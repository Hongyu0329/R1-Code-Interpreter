    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of GCRD**\n\nThe Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s), is a common right divisor G(s) that is \"divisible\" by any other common right divisor. Specifically:\n*   G(s) is a **right divisor** of P1(s) and P2(s), meaning there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s).\n*   If R(s) is any other common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s), then R(s) must be a right divisor of G(s). This means there exists a polynomial matrix L(s) such that G(s) = L(s)R(s).\n\nThe GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then any matrix U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD, where U(s) is a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant). We typically seek a GCRD in a simplified or canonical form, such as a row-reduced echelon form.\n\n**2. Method of Calculation: Generalized Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nThe GCRD can be computed by applying elementary row operations to the stacked matrix M(s) formed by P1(s) and P2(s).\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nThese operations are equivalent to left-multiplying M(s) by a unimodular matrix. The goal is to transform M(s) into the form [G(s); 0], where G(s) is an upper triangular matrix (or more specifically, in row-reduced echelon form). The resulting non-zero matrix G(s) is a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**3. Applying the Algorithm**\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\n**Step 3.1: Form the stacked matrix M(s).**\nM(s) =\n[ s^2 + s,  -s   ]  (Row 1)\n[ -s^2 - 1,  s^2  ]  (Row 2)\n[ s,        0    ]  (Row 3)\n[ -s - 1,   1    ]  (Row 4)\n\n**Step 3.2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M(s).**\n\nWe start by using the row with the lowest degree leading element as a pivot. Row 3 has `s` (degree 1) in the first column. Let's use it to eliminate the other elements in the first column.\n\n*   `R1 -> R1 - (s+1) * R3`:\n    [s^2+s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, -s] = [0, -s]\n*   `R2 -> R2 + s * R3`:\n    [-s^2-1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2-1 + s^2, s^2] = [-1, s^2]\n*   `R4 -> R4 + R3`:\n    [-s-1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-s-1+s, 1] = [-1, 1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM'(s) =\n[ 0,    -s   ]\n[ -1,   s^2  ]\n[ s,    0    ]\n[ -1,   1    ]\n\nNow, the element `-1` (degree 0) is the best pivot. Let's use the last row `[-1, 1]`. We swap it to the top and multiply by -1 to make the pivot `1`.\nThe matrix becomes (after swapping R4 to R1 and multiplying by -1):\nM''(s) =\n[ 1,    -1   ]  (New R1)\n[ -1,   s^2  ]  (Old R2)\n[ s,    0    ]  (Old R3)\n[ 0,    -s   ]  (Old R1)\n\nNow, use the new R1 `[1, -1]` to eliminate the first column.\n*   `R2 -> R2 + R1`:\n    [-1, s^2] + [1, -1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n*   `R3 -> R3 - s * R1`:\n    [s, 0] - s[1, -1] = [0, s]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM'''(s) =\n[ 1,   -1       ]\n[ 0,   s^2 - 1  ]\n[ 0,   s        ]\n[ 0,   -s       ]\n\nNow we focus on the second column for rows 2, 3, and 4. The elements are `s^2-1`, `s`, and `-s`. The lowest degree non-zero element is `s` (or `-s`). Let's use R3 `[0, s]` as the pivot.\n*   `R4 -> R4 + R3`:\n    [0, -s] + [0, s] = [0, 0]\n*   `R2 -> R2 - s * R3`:\n    [0, s^2 - 1] - s[0, s] = [0, s^2 - 1 - s^2] = [0, -1]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nM''''(s) =\n[ 1,   -1   ]\n[ 0,   -1   ]\n[ 0,   s    ]\n[ 0,   0    ]\n\nWe are close to the final form. Now use R2 `[0, -1]` as the pivot for the second column. First, multiply it by -1.\n*   `R2 -> -1 * R2`:\n    [0, 1]\n\nThe matrix is now:\nM'''''(s) =\n[ 1,   -1   ]\n[ 0,   1    ]\n[ 0,   s    ]\n[ 0,   0    ]\n\nFinally, use the new R2 `[0, 1]` to eliminate the other elements in the second column.\n*   `R1 -> R1 + R2`:\n    [1, -1] + [0, 1] = [1, 0]\n*   `R3 -> R3 - s * R2`:\n    [0, s] - s[0, 1] = [0, 0]\n\nThe final reduced matrix is:\nM_final(s) =\n[ 1,   0    ]\n[ 0,   1    ]\n[ 0,   0    ]\n[ 0,   0    ]\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe reduction process transforms the stacked matrix [P1(s); P2(s)] into [G(s); 0], where G(s) is the non-zero part of the final matrix.\nIn this case, G(s) is:\nG(s) = [1, 0;\n        0, 1]\n\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix, I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the original matrices are said to be **right coprime**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The order of operations can vary, but the final GCRD (up to unimodular multiplication) will be the same.\n*   The key to the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials is to always use the polynomial of the lowest degree as the divisor/pivot to reduce the degree of other polynomials in the same column.\n*   The GCRD is defined up to a left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. The identity matrix is the simplest and standard representation for the GCRD of coprime matrices.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
