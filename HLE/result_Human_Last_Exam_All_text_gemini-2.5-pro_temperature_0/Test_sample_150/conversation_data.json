    "Answering this question requires a multi-faceted analysis. First, we must determine if the provided Java program correctly solves the problem. Second, if it's incorrect, we need to devise the most efficient C implementation. Finally, we must calculate the specific efficiency metrics requested: the minimum number of character comparisons and the minimum memory usage for a 100-instruction input.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Analysis of the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **Initial State:** A single integer variable `x` starts at 0.\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`, followed by `n` lines, each containing a \"statement\".\n*   **Statements:** A statement consists of one variable `X` and one operation (`++` or `--`). The problem explicitly states, \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This is a crucial detail.\n*   **Valid Statements:**\n    *   Increment `x`: `++X` and `X++`\n    *   Decrement `x`: `--X` and `X--`\n*   **Goal:** Calculate and print the final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Submitted Java Program**\n\n```java\n// ... inside main method\nint t = inpt.nextInt(); // Reads n\nint tresult = 0;       // Our x, correctly initialized\nwhile (t-- > 0)\n{\n    String test = inpt.next(); // Reads a statement, e.g., \"X++\"\n    \n    if (test.contains(\"++X\")) // Checks for the substring \"++X\"\n    {\n        tresult++;\n    }\n    if (test.contains(\"--X\")) // Checks for the substring \"--X\"\n    {\n        tresult--;\n    }  \n}\nSystem.out.println(tresult);\n// ...\n```\n\n*   **The Flaw:** The program's logic is flawed. It only checks for statements where the operation comes before the variable (`++X` and `--X`). It completely fails to handle the cases where the variable comes first (`X++` and `X--`). For an input of `X++`, neither `if` condition will be true, and the value of `tresult` will not change, which is incorrect.\n*   **Conclusion:** The program does not solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the answer must start with `N`.\n\n**3. Designing an Optimal C Program**\n\nTo be \"most efficient\" means minimizing both execution time (fastest) and memory consumption.\n\n*   **Minimizing Execution Time:** The core of the loop is distinguishing an increment from a decrement. Instead of using slow string comparison functions, we can inspect individual characters. A key observation is that for all four statement types, the character at index 1 (the middle character) uniquely identifies the operation:\n    *   `++X` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `X++` -> `s[1]` is `+`\n    *   `--X` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    *   `X--` -> `s[1]` is `-`\n    Therefore, a single character comparison per statement (`if (statement[1] == '+')`) is sufficient. This is the fastest possible way to process each statement.\n\n*   **Minimizing Memory:** We need to store the number of statements, the result, and a buffer for reading the input.\n    *   An `int` for the number of statements, `n`. We can reuse this as the loop counter (`while (n--)`).\n    *   An `int` for the result, `x`.\n    *   A `char` array to read the 3-character statement. `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` requires a null-terminated string, so a buffer of size 4 (`char s[4]`) is the minimum required.\n    *   This avoids needing a separate loop counter variable like `i`.\n\n**4. Calculating Efficiency Metrics (x and y)**\n\nThe required format is `Nx+y`.\n\n*   **`x`: Smallest number of character comparisons (for 100 instructions)**\n    *   Our optimal C algorithm performs exactly one character comparison per instruction (`s[1] == '+'`).\n    *   For 100 instructions, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   This is the absolute minimum, as each statement must be inspected at least once.\n    *   So, `x = 100`.\n\n*   **`y`: Smallest memory size in Bytes**\n    *   The minimal set of variables for our efficient C program is:\n        1.  `int n;` (for count/counter): 4 Bytes (on a typical 32/64-bit system)\n        2.  `int x;` (for the result): 4 Bytes\n        3.  `char s[4];` (for the input buffer): 4 Bytes\n    *   Total minimum memory size = `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` Bytes.\n    *   So, `y = 12`.\n\n**5. Final Answer Formulation**\n\n*   The program is incorrect: `N`\n*   Smallest comparisons `x`: `100`\n*   Smallest memory `y`: `12`\n*   Combining these into the format `Nx+y` gives `N100+12`.\n\n<<<N100+12>>>"
