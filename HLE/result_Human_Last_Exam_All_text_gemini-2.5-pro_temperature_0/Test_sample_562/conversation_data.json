    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Character**\nFirst, we need to visually break down the kanji 謄 into its constituent parts. The character 謄 is composed of two main components arranged side-by-side:\n*   The left-side component: 言\n*   The right-side component: a phonetic element derived from 朕 (chin).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, the radical is the component that classifies the character for dictionary lookup and often provides a clue to its meaning. For characters with a left-right structure like 謄, the left-side component is very often the radical.\n*   The left component is 言, which means \"word,\" \"speech,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The character 謄 means \"to transcribe\" or \"to copy,\" an action closely related to words and text.\nTherefore, the semantic component, and thus the radical, is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nRadicals are often given specific names based on their form and position within a character.\n*   The radical is 言.\n*   When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is known as a \"hen\" (or \"ben\" due to rendaku).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical in this position is ごんべん (gonben).\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the name of the radical using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the prompt.\n*   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the character as 謄 and not confuse it with similar-looking characters like 騰 (which has the 馬 radical).\n*   **Radical Position:** The name of the radical can change depending on its position. For 言, when it stands alone, it's just \"gen\" or \"iu\". On the left side, it becomes \"gonben\".\n*   **Semantic vs. Phonetic:** Recognizing that 謄 is a phono-semantic compound (形声文字, *keisei moji*) helps in correctly identifying the left part (言) as the semantic radical and the right part as the phonetic component.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its positional name is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
