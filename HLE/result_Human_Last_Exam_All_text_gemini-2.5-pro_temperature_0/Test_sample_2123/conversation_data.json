    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the puzzle are:\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay (or an essay originally in Russian).\n    *   **Setting:** The description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Clue:** The surname of an English poet appears within this description.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Material:** The question refers to a famous passage from the book **\"No Day Without a Line\" (\"Ни дня без строчки\")** by the Russian writer **Yury Olesha**. Although the prompt mentions a \"Russian translation,\" the work was originally written in Russian. The pun exists in the original Russian text.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Relevant Passage:** In his book, Olesha recounts his travels and observations. When describing Vienna, he is particularly impressed by the immense width of its streets and boulevards.\n\n4.  **Identify the Pun:** The connection to the poet's name is a phonetic pun that works in the Russian language.\n    *   Olesha uses the Russian word for \"wide,\" which is **\"широкий\" (shirokiy)**. He uses an even more emphatic form, **\"широченные\" (shirochennye)**, to describe the boulevards.\n    *   He then remarks that this word reminds him of the surname of a famous English poet.\n\n5.  **Make the Connection:** The sound of the Russian word **\"широкий\" (shirokiy)** is phonetically similar to the Russian transliteration of the English surname **Shelley**, which is **\"Шелли\" (Shelli)**. The initial \"Shi-\" sound is the key to the association.\n\n6.  **Identify the Poet:** The poet in question is the renowned English Romantic poet, **Percy Bysshe Shelley**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The \"Translation\" Aspect:** The prompt's mention of a \"Russian translation\" can be slightly misleading. The source text was written in Russian by a Russian author. The crucial point is that the logic of the puzzle operates *within the Russian language*.\n*   **The Nature of the Clue:** The clue is not a direct translation or a historical fact linking a poet to Vienna. It is a subjective, literary wordplay created by the author, Yury Olesha.\n*   **The Key Word:** The trigger for the pun is not the word for \"boulevard\" or \"Vienna,\" but the adjective used to describe them: \"wide\" (\"широкий\").\n*   **The Phonetic Link:** The entire puzzle hinges on the sound association between \"широкий\" and \"Шелли\" (Shelley) in Russian.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy following the trail from the description of Vienna's wide boulevards in a Russian literary work, we identify the author as Yury Olesha. We then uncover his phonetic pun connecting the Russian word for \"wide\" (широкий) to the surname of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. The surname is Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
