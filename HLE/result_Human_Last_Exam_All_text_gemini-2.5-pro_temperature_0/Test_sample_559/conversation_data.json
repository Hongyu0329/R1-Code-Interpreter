    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system and find the equilibrium points.**\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\nFrom the second equation, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the possible values for $u$:\n$u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\nWe analyze these two cases to find the corresponding values of $d$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points by linearization.**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$ of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point (excluding the degenerate one at the origin).\n\n*   **At point (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)0 - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At point (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, the point $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the separatrix.**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We have a saddle point at $(-1, 1)$, so we will look for its manifolds.\n\nThe unstable manifold is a trajectory that leaves the saddle point. We can try to find an explicit equation for a trajectory $d = f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the equation of the separatrix.**\nInstead of solving the complex differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$, we can test a simple functional form for a trajectory. Given the polynomial nature of the system, let's test a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, for instance $d = -u^2$.\n\n1.  **Check if the curve passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$:**\n    If $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the point $(-1, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Check if the curve is a trajectory of the system:**\n    If $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, we can find its time derivative using the chain rule:\n    $d'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\cdot u'(t)$\n    Substitute the expression for $u'(t)$:\n    $d'(t) = -2u \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Now, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    $d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n    $d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - u^3 + u^4$\n    $d' = (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n    $d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    The two expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical. This confirms that the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed a trajectory of the system.\n\nSince $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory that passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$, it must be one of its manifolds. The stable manifold of the saddle point is the line $u=1$. Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold. The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix.\n\nThe equation of the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
