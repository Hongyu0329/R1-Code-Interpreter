After applying the gate Q to the first ququint of the entangled pair and then measuring it, the system collapses to one of the following five possible final states with their corresponding probabilities:
1.  With probability **3/10**, the measurement outcome for ququint A is 2, and the final state of the system is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability **1/5 (or 2/10)**, the measurement outcome for ququint A is 0, and the final state of the system is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability **1/5 (or 2/10)**, the measurement outcome for ququint A is 1, and the final state of the system is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability **1/5 (or 2/10)**, the measurement outcome for ququint A is 3, and the final state of the system is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability **1/10**, the measurement outcome for ququint A is 4, and the final state of the system is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
