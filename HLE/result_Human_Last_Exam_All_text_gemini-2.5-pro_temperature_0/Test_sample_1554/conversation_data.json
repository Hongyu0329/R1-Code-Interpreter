    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular school of thought (the Lviv-Warsaw School) and is known for a specific philosophical contribution: decomposing the concept of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the School of Thought:** The **Lviv-Warsaw School** was a highly influential group of logicians and analytic philosophers active in Poland from the interwar period onwards. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The school was known for its emphasis on logical rigor, clarity of language, and anti-irrationalism.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Hallmark:** In this context, \"hallmark\" is a general term for a sign, an indicator, or a distinguishing characteristic that points to something else. The Polish equivalent would be *oznaka* or *cecha*.\n    *   **Decomposition into Symptoms and Signals:** This is the specific philosophical act we need to attribute. We must understand the distinction:\n        *   **Symptom (or Index):** This refers to a *natural sign*. It has a causal or natural connection to the thing it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The sign is an *effect* of the thing it signifies.\n        *   **Signal (or Conventional Sign):** This refers to an *artificial or conventional sign*. Its meaning is not natural but is established by a rule, agreement, or intention. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"tree\" is a signal for the concept of a tree. The connection is arbitrary and must be learned.\n\n4.  **Connect the Concepts to a Philosopher:** We need to search within the members of the Lviv-Warsaw School for a philosopher whose work in semiotics (the theory of signs) or philosophy of language includes this specific distinction.\n    *   While many members worked on logic and language, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the figure most prominently associated with this analysis.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz's work on language, meaning, and syntax is central to his philosophy. In his analysis of how expressions function as signs, he made a clear distinction between different types of signs.\n    *   He classified signs based on their relationship to what they signify. The distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is a cornerstone of his semiotic theory. He used this framework to analyze the meaning of linguistic expressions.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of the key concepts and the known contributions of the members of the Lviv-Warsaw School, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign or \"hallmark\" into the categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs).\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
