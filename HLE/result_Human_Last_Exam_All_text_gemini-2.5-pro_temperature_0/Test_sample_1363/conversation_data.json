    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in ballroom dancing that involves turning to the left. Each of the dances listed has a version of a Reverse Turn.\n*   **Overturning:** This means rotating more than the technically prescribed amount for a given step or figure. For example, if a step is supposed to turn 1/4 (90 degrees), overturning would mean turning more than that, perhaps 3/8 or 1/2.\n*   **\"Without Disregarding the Technique\":** This is the most crucial part of the question. It's not asking where overturning is simply a mistake, but where the fundamental principles of the dance's technique make overturning a conceptual impossibility. If you overturn, you are by definition no longer executing the correct technique.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Technique of Each Dance Option**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as the \"swing\" dances. Their technique is built on principles that create continuous, flowing movement. These principles include:\n    *   **Contra Body Movement (CBM):** The action of turning the opposite side of the body towards the moving foot, which initiates rotation.\n    *   **Sway:** The inclination of the body away from the direction of movement, used to control momentum and shape turns.\n    *   **Rise and Fall:** The elevation and lowering of the body through the feet, knees, and ankles, which contributes to the dance's character and power.\n    *   In these dances, a Reverse Turn is a smooth, continuous rotation powered by CBM, shaped by sway, and characterized by rise and fall. While overturning is a significant technical error that disrupts alignment and flow, it is essentially an *exaggeration* or *misapplication* of the very techniques that create the turn. A dancer *can* physically overturn by using too much CBM or momentum. It would be incorrect, but it's an error within the spectrum of swing-based movement.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat, with dancers moving on the same level. The knees are flexed, but there is no elevation.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body is held strong and upright, without the inclination seen in the swing dances.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movement is sharp, deliberate, and often punctuated by pauses.\n    *   **Unique Turning Mechanism:** Turns in Tango are not generated by the flowing momentum of CBM in the same way as swing dances. Instead, they are sharp, almost mechanical swivels and rotations of the body frame. The feet are kept in close contact with the floor.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Tango to the Swing Dances in the Context of the Question**\n\n*   In the swing dances, overturning is a *quantitative* errorâ€”too much of a correct action (rotation).\n*   In Tango, the Reverse Turn has a very specific, limited amount of rotation executed with a sharp, staccato action and no swing. To rotate *more* than this prescribed amount (to overturn), a dancer would be forced to introduce elements that are forbidden by Tango technique. They would have to introduce sway, use rotational momentum (swing), or lift their feet in a way that is not part of the technique.\n*   Therefore, the act of overturning a Tango Reverse Turn is not just an error; it is a complete *disregard* for the foundational rules of Tango movement. You cannot overturn it while still adhering to the principles of Tango technique. The technique itself creates a hard limit on the rotation.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe European Tango is the only dance on the list where the core technique (no swing, no sway, no rise and fall, staccato action) makes it impossible to overturn a Reverse Turn without fundamentally violating and abandoning that technique. In the other dances, overturning is a technical fault, but it's an over-application of the existing technical principles, not a complete departure from them.\n\n<<<C>>>"
