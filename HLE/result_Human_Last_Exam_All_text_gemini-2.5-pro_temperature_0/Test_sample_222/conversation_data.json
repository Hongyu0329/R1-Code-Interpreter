    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Define the Sequences**\n\n*   We are given `X(k)`, the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a 4-point sequence `x(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   We are given `H(k)`, the 4-point DFT of a 4-point sequence `h(n)`.\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y_interleaved(m)`, which is an 8-point sequence formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y_interleaved(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n**2. Interpret the \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\"**\n\n*   The DFT is typically defined for sequences of the same length (e.g., an N-point DFT for an N-point sequence).\n*   When asked to find an M-point DFT of an N-point sequence where M < N, the standard interpretation in digital signal processing is to first create an M-point sequence by **time-aliasing** (or \"wrapping\") the N-point sequence.\n*   Let the 8-point sequence be `y_interleaved(m)`. We need to create a 4-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, by aliasing `y_interleaved(m)`.\n*   The formula for time-aliasing is: `y(n) = y_interleaved(n) + y_interleaved(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   Let's compute the elements of `y(n)`:\n    *   `y(0) = y_interleaved(0) + y_interleaved(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n    *   `y(1) = y_interleaved(1) + y_interleaved(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n    *   `y(2) = y_interleaved(2) + y_interleaved(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n    *   `y(3) = y_interleaved(3) + y_interleaved(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\n**3. Find the values of `y(n)` using the given DFTs**\n\n*   We don't have the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` directly, but we can find the necessary sums from their DFTs, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n*   Recall the 4-point DFT formulas:\n    *   `X(0) = x(0) + x(1) + x(2) + x(3)`\n    *   `X(2) = x(0) - x(1) + x(2) - x(3)`\n*   By adding and subtracting these, we can isolate the terms we need:\n    *   `X(0) + X(2) = 2 * (x(0) + x(2))`\n    *   `X(0) - X(2) = 2 * (x(1) + x(3))`\n*   Using the given values for `X(k)`:\n    *   `x(0) + x(2) = (X(0) + X(2)) / 2 = (1 + (-1)) / 2 = 0`. So, `y(0) = 0`.\n    *   `x(1) + x(3) = (X(0) - X(2)) / 2 = (1 - (-1)) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1`. So, `y(2) = 1`.\n*   Similarly for `h(n)` and `H(k)`:\n    *   `H(0) = h(0) + h(1) + h(2) + h(3)`\n    *   `H(2) = h(0) - h(1) + h(2) - h(3)`\n    *   `h(0) + h(2) = (H(0) + H(2)) / 2`\n    *   `h(1) + h(3) = (H(0) - H(2)) / 2`\n*   Using the given values for `H(k)`:\n    *   `h(0) + h(2) = (0 + 1) / 2 = 1/2`. So, `y(1) = 1/2`.\n    *   `h(1) + h(3) = (0 - 1) / 2 = -1/2`. So, `y(3) = -1/2`.\n\n**4. Calculate the 4-point DFT of `y(n)`**\n\n*   We have found the 4-point time-aliased sequence: `y(n) = [0, 1/2, 1, -1/2]`.\n*   Now, we compute its 4-point DFT, let's call it `Y(k)`.\n*   The formula for the 4-point DFT is `Y(k) = y(0) + y(1)W_4^k + y(2)W_4^{2k} + y(3)W_4^{3k}`, where `W_4 = e^{-j2\\pi/4} = -j`.\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = y(0) + y(1) + y(2) + y(3) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 - 1/2 = 1`\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   `Y(1) = y(0) + y(1)W_4^1 + y(2)W_4^2 + y(3)W_4^3`\n    *   `Y(1) = 0 + (1/2)(-j) + (1)(-1) + (-1/2)(j) = -j/2 - 1 - j/2 = -1 - j`\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   `Y(2) = y(0) + y(1)W_4^2 + y(2)W_4^4 + y(3)W_4^6`\n    *   `Y(2) = 0 + (1/2)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1/2)(-1) = -1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 1`\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   `Y(3) = y(0) + y(1)W_4^3 + y(2)W_4^6 + y(3)W_4^9`\n    *   `Y(3) = 0 + (1/2)(j) + (1)(-1) + (-1/2)(-j) = j/2 - 1 + j/2 = -1 + j`\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the sequence `Y(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n`Y(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of the Question:** The phrase \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\" is ambiguous. The standard interpretation is to use time-aliasing, which is a fundamental property related to downsampling in the frequency domain (Decimation-In-Frequency).\n2.  **DFT Properties:** The solution relies on the property that `x(n) + x(n+N/2)` in the time domain corresponds to selecting the even-indexed samples `X(2k)` in the frequency domain. We used a time-domain approach here, but a frequency-domain approach would yield the same result and confirm the method.\n3.  **Twiddle Factors:** Be careful with the powers of the twiddle factor `W_4 = -j`.\n    *   `W_4^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_4^1 = -j`\n    *   `W_4^2 = (-j)^2 = -1`\n    *   `W_4^3 = (-j)^3 = j`\n    *   Higher powers are periodic: `W_4^4 = 1`, `W_4^6 = W_4^2 = -1`, etc.\n4.  **Complex Arithmetic:** Ensure all calculations involving complex numbers (especially with `j`) are performed correctly.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of DFT coefficients calculated in Step 4.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
