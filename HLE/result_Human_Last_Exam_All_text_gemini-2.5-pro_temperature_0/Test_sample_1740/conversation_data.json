    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the total number of \"members\" of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Ambiguity:** The term \"member\" can be interpreted in two primary ways in the context of miRNA families:\n    *   **Unique Mature miRNA Sequences:** These are the final, short RNA molecules that are functionally active. Different genes can sometimes produce identical mature miRNAs.\n    *   **Precursor miRNA Genes (Loci):** These are the specific genes in the DNA that are transcribed to produce the precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which are then processed into mature miRNAs.\n\n3.  **Count the Unique Mature miRNA Sequences:**\n    The let-7 family is characterized by a highly conserved \"seed sequence.\" In humans, the family consists of several distinct mature miRNAs. Based on the canonical miRNA database, miRBase, these are:\n    *   let-7a\n    *   let-7b\n    *   let-7c\n    *   let-7d\n    *   let-7e\n    *   let-7f\n    *   let-7g\n    *   let-7i\n    *   miR-98 (This miRNA is structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family, despite its different name).\n\n    Counting these gives a total of **9** unique mature miRNA sequences.\n\n4.  **Count the Precursor miRNA Genes:**\n    The 9 mature let-7 family miRNAs are encoded by multiple genes located at different positions (loci) in the human genome. It is common in scientific literature to refer to the number of genes when discussing the size of the family.\n    *   **let-7a:** is encoded by 3 different genes (`hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`).\n    *   **let-7f:** is encoded by 2 different genes (`hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`).\n    *   **let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98:** are each encoded by a single gene.\n\n    To get the total number of genes, we sum them up:\n    3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = **12** genes.\n\n5.  **Conclusion and Final Answer Selection:**\n    *   There are 9 unique mature let-7 family miRNAs.\n    *   There are 12 distinct precursor genes that produce these miRNAs.\n    *   When scientific reviews and databases discuss the \"members\" of the human let-7 family, they most often refer to the number of distinct gene loci. This count reflects the genomic complexity and regulation of the family. Therefore, the most accurate and commonly accepted answer for the number of members is the count of the precursor genes.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Member\":** Always be aware that \"member\" can mean either the final product (mature miRNA) or the gene. In this context, the gene count is more common.\n*   **Inclusion of miR-98:** It is crucial to include miR-98, as it is universally considered part of the let-7 family due to its sequence and function, despite its name.\n*   **Outdated Information:** Some older sources might cite a different number (e.g., 13), but this is typically based on outdated annotations that have since been revised in primary databases like miRBase. The current consensus is 12 genes.\n*   **Distinguishing Genes from Products:** The fact that `let-7a` comes from three genes and `let-7f` from two is a key detail for arriving at the correct total of 12 genes.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, the final answer is the number of precursor genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
