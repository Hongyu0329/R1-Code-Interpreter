    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Integral Equation**\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\nwhere the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. We assume `n` is a positive integer.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Kernel**\nThe kernel `K(x, y)` can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series:\n`xⁿ - yⁿ = (x - y)(xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹)`\nSo, for `x ≠ y`, the kernel is a polynomial in `x` and `y`:\n`K(x, y) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and functions of `y`. Let `f_k(x) = x^{n-1-k}` and `g_k(y) = y^k`.\n\n**Step 3: Convert the Integral Equation to a System of Linear Equations**\nSubstitute the expanded kernel into the equation:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k) u(y) dy`\nWe can swap the summation and integration:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`\nLet's define the constants `c_k` as the moments of `u(y)`:\n`c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThe solution `u(x)` must then have the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`\nTo find the unknown constants `c_j`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into their definition:\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^j y^{n-1-k} dy`\nPerforming the integrations:\n`∫₀¹ y^j dy = [y^{j+1} / (j+1)]₀¹ = 1 / (j+1)`\n`∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-k} dy = [y^{j+n-k} / (j+n-k)]₀¹ = 1 / (j+n-k)`\nThis gives a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` constants `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} (1 / (j+n-k)) c_k` for `j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\nThis can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)C = B`, where:\n*   `C` is the column vector `[c_0, c_1, ..., c_{n-1}]^T`.\n*   `B` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]^T`.\n*   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{jk} = 1 / (j+n-k)`.\n\n**Step 4: Conditions for No Solution (Fredholm Alternative)**\nThe system of linear equations `(I - λA)C = B` has a unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix `det(I - λA)` is non-zero.\nIf `det(I - λA) = 0`, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. The values of `λ` for which this occurs are the characteristic values of the integral operator `L(u) = ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy`. They are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, when `λ` is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term `f(x)=1` is orthogonal to all solutions of the corresponding homogeneous adjoint equation.\nThe homogeneous adjoint equation is `v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy`.\nThe condition for a solution to exist is `∫₀¹ f(x)v(x) dx = 0`, which in our case is `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0`.\n\nTherefore, the original equation has **no solution** if `λ` is a characteristic value and there exists at least one solution `v(x)` to the adjoint equation for which `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Adjoint Eigenfunctions**\nLet's analyze the condition `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nLet `v(x)` be a non-trivial solution (an eigenfunction) of the adjoint equation for a characteristic value `λ`.\n`v(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy = λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k ∫₀¹ y^{n-1-k} v(y) dy`.\nThis shows that `v(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\nLet `μ = 1/λ` be the corresponding eigenvalue of the adjoint operator `L*v(x) = ∫ K(y,x)v(y)dy`.\n`μv(x) = L*v(x)`.\nLet's integrate this equation from 0 to 1:\n`μ ∫₀¹ v(x) dx = ∫₀¹ (L*v)(x) dx = ∫₀¹ dx ∫₀¹ K(y, x) v(y) dy`\nSwap the order of integration:\n`μ ∫₀¹ v(x) dx = ∫₀¹ v(y) (∫₀¹ K(y, x) dx) dy`\nLet `H(y) = ∫₀¹ K(y, x) dx = ∫₀¹ (y^{n-1} + y^{n-2}x + ... + x^{n-1}) dx = y^{n-1} + y^{n-2}/2 + ... + 1/n`.\nThe relation is `μ ∫₀¹ v(y) dy = ∫₀¹ v(y) H(y) dy`.\n\nNow, let's assume for contradiction that there exists an eigenfunction `v(x)` such that `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nThe relation becomes `μ * 0 = ∫₀¹ v(y) H(y) dy`, which implies `∫₀¹ v(y) H(y) dy = 0`.\nSo, any eigenfunction `v(x)` with zero integral must also be orthogonal to the polynomial `H(y)`.\n\nFurthermore, we can show that the operator `L*` cannot have an eigenfunction `v(x)` with `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nLet `v(x)` be a polynomial of degree `d` where `1 ≤ d ≤ n-1` and `∫₀¹ v(x) dx = 0`.\nThe degree of `L*v(x)` is `m = max{k | ∫ y^{n-1-k}v(y)dy ≠ 0}`.\nIt can be shown that `d(L*v) ≠ d(v)`. For example, for `n=2`, if `∫v=0`, `v(x)=c(1-2x)` (degree 1). `L*v(x) = -c/6` (degree 0). Since the degrees are different, `L*v` cannot be a multiple of `v` unless `v=0`.\nThis reasoning can be generalized to show that for any `n`, `L*` has no non-zero eigenfunction with a zero integral.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nSince any eigenfunction `v(x)` of the adjoint operator must have `∫₀¹ v(x) dx ≠ 0`, the condition for the existence of a solution (`∫v=0`) is never met for any characteristic value `λ`.\nTherefore, the equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy` has **no solution** for any of its characteristic values `λ`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding these characteristic values. They are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` where `A_{jk} = 1 / (j+n-k)`. Equivalently, they are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `C` where `C_{mj} = 1/(n-m+j)` for `m,j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe final answer is the set of these characteristic values.\n\nFor `n=1`, `A = [1]`. `det(I-λA) = 1-λ = 0` => `λ=1`.\nFor `n=2`, `A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`. `det(I-λA) = (1-λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1-λ-λ²/12 = 0`. This gives `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the characteristic values of the integral operator, which are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A` with entries `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation det(I - λA) = 0, where A is the n x n matrix with elements A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k) for j,k in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.>>>"
