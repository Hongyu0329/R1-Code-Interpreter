    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate is a property that an element of the domain may or may not have.\n\n2.  **Logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO) over the schema $S$.\n    *   The formulas are built using the predicates from $S$.\n    *   The allowed logical constructs are: existential quantifier ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), the constant True ($\\top$), and the constant False ($\\bot$).\n    *   We are interested in formulas with one free variable, say $x$, as these define concepts (subsets of a domain). A formula $\\phi(x)$ defines the set of elements $a$ in a given model for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n\n3.  **VC dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension measures the expressive power of a class of concepts.\n    *   A **concept class** $\\mathcal{H}$ over a universe $U$ is a collection of subsets of $U$.\n    *   A set of points $X \\subseteq U$ is **shattered** by $\\mathcal{H}$ if for every subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{H}$ such that $C \\cap X = Y$.\n    *   The **VC dimension** of $\\mathcal{H}$ is the size of the largest set $X$ that can be shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the concept class\n\nThe concepts are defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ from the logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The VC dimension of the logic is defined as the maximum VC dimension over all possible models. Specifically, it is the largest integer $d$ such that there *exists* a model $M$ (a domain and an interpretation of the predicates) containing a set of $d$ elements that can be shattered by the formulas of the logic.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of a formula $\\phi(x) \\in \\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. Any such formula can be written in a normal form. By repeatedly applying the rule $\\exists z (\\alpha \\land \\beta) \\equiv \\alpha \\land \\exists z \\beta$ (if $z$ is not free in $\\alpha$), we can pull out all existential quantifiers that do not bind $x$.\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to a formula of the form:\n$\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. An atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and some variable $z$.\nWe can separate the atoms involving $x$ from those involving the existentially quantified variables $y_j$:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)) \\land \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\bigwedge_{j=1}^m \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_j} P_i(y_j))$\nfor some index sets $I_0, I_1, \\dots, I_m \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\n\nLet's denote $C_I(z) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(z)$. The formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv C_{I_0}(x) \\land \\exists y_1 C_{I_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\exists y_m C_{I_m}(y_m)$.\nThe part $\\theta = \\exists y_1 C_{I_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\exists y_m C_{I_m}(y_m)$ is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given model $M$, this sentence is either true or false.\n\n*   If $M \\models \\neg \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$. The concept defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. This is the same concept as defined by the formula $\\bot$.\n*   If $M \\models \\theta$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C_{I_0}(x)$. The concept defined is $\\{a \\in \\text{domain}(M) \\mid M \\models C_{I_0}(a)\\}$.\n\nThe formula $\\top$ defines the entire domain, which is equivalent to $C_{\\emptyset}(x)$ (an empty conjunction is true).\n\nSo, for any fixed model $M$, the class of concepts definable by our logic, let's call it $\\mathcal{H}_M$, is a subset of:\n$\\{ \\{a \\mid M \\models C_I(a)\\} \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\} \\cup \\{\\emptyset, \\text{domain}(M)\\}$.\nThis is the class of concepts generated by **monotone conjunctions** of the 4 predicates. An element $a$ can be identified with its \"type\", a binary vector $v(a) \\in \\{0,1\\}^4$ where $(v(a))_i = 1$ if $M \\models P_i(a)$ and 0 otherwise. The formula $C_I(x)$ selects all elements whose type vector has 1s in all positions indexed by $I$.\n\nThe VC dimension of the logic is the maximum $d$ for which we can find a model $M$ and a set $X \\subseteq \\text{domain}(M)$ of size $d$ that is shattered by $\\mathcal{H}_M$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the VC dimension\n\nWe are looking for the VC dimension of the concept class of monotone conjunctions over 4 variables. Let $n=4$ be the number of predicates.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of distinct formulas of the form $C_I(x)$ is the number of subsets $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, which is $2^4 = 16$. These formulas define at most 16 distinct concepts in any model. By the Sauer-Shelah Lemma, if a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ shatters a set of size $d$, then $|\\mathcal{H}| \\ge 2^d$. In our case, the number of concepts available to shatter a set is at most 16. So, we must have $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$. Thus, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model $M$ in which a set of size 4 can be shattered.\nLet's construct such a model.\nLet the domain be $D = X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nWe define the interpretation of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ on $X$. This is equivalent to assigning a type (a 4-bit vector) to each element in $X$. Let's choose the following types:\n*   $t(x_1) = (0,1,1,1)$\n*   $t(x_2) = (1,0,1,1)$\n*   $t(x_3) = (1,1,0,1)$\n*   $t(x_4) = (1,1,1,0)$\nThis means, for example, $M \\models P_1(x_1)$ is false, while $M \\models P_2(x_1)$, $M \\models P_3(x_1)$, and $M \\models P_4(x_1)$ are all true.\n\nNow we must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a formula $C_I(x)$ that selects exactly the elements in $Y$.\nAn element $x_k$ is selected by the concept $C_I$ if and only if $M \\models C_I(x_k)$, which means $M \\models P_j(x_k)$ for all $j \\in I$. In terms of types, this is $(t(x_k))_j = 1$ for all $j \\in I$.\nFrom our choice of types, $(t(x_k))_j = 1$ if and only if $j \\ne k$.\nSo, $x_k$ is selected by $C_I$ if and only if for all $j \\in I$, $j \\ne k$. This is equivalent to saying that $k$ is not in the set $I$, i.e., $k \\notin I$.\n\nLet $Y \\subseteq X$ be the target subset we want to generate. Let $K \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ be the set of indices such that $Y = \\{x_k \\mid k \\in K\\}$.\nWe need to find an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ such that the concept $C_I$ selects exactly the elements of $Y$.\nThe set selected by $C_I$ is $\\{x_k \\in X \\mid k \\notin I\\}$.\nWe want this set to be equal to $Y = \\{x_k \\in X \\mid k \\in K\\}$.\nThis requires that for any $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, $k \\notin I \\iff k \\in K$.\nThis condition is satisfied by choosing $I = K^c = \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\setminus K$.\nSince for any choice of $K$ (and thus any choice of $Y$), we can find a corresponding valid set $I$, we have shown that any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ can be generated.\nTherefore, the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ is shattered in our constructed model $M$.\n\nSince we have found a set of size 4 that can be shattered, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4. Therefore, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\nThe number of unary predicates in the schema $S$ determines the VC dimension. If there were $k$ unary predicates, the same argument would show that the VC dimension is $k$. In this problem, $k=4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
