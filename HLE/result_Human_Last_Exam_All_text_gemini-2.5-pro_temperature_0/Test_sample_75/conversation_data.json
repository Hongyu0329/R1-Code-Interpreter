    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Conflict and its Timeframe:** The question asks about the \"Second Great War.\" In StarCraft lore, this term refers to the galaxy-wide conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*).\n\n2.  **Determine the Start Date:** The Second Great War began in the canonical year **2504**. This is marked by the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign, when the Zerg Swarm, led by the Queen of Blades, launched a full-scale invasion of the Terran Dominion worlds in the Koprulu Sector.\n\n3.  **Determine the End Date:** The war concluded with the final defeat of the main antagonist, the dark god Amon. This climactic event occurs during the epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void,\" which takes place after the main story of *Legacy of the Void*. According to the official timeline, Amon's final defeat happens in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** The war started at some point in the year 2504 and ended at some point in the year 2506. This means the conflict was active during the years 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   The events of *Wings of Liberty* and most of *Heart of the Swarm* take place in 2504.\n    *   The war against Amon, the central plot of *Legacy of the Void*, spans from 2505 into 2506.\n    *   The final confrontation in the epilogue takes place in 2506.\n\n5.  **Interpret the \"Rounded Up\" Instruction:** The question requires the duration in years, \"rounded up.\" This is a crucial detail.\n    *   The total time elapsed is from a point in 2504 to a point in 2506. This gives a duration of approximately 2 full years.\n    *   For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the total duration would be 2 years and 2 months.\n    *   Given the galactic scale of the campaigns—uniting the Protoss factions, Kerrigan's journey to Zerus, and the multi-front war against Amon's forces—it is extremely unlikely that the war's duration was exactly 1 or 2 full years. It is almost certain that the duration was 2 years plus some additional months.\n    *   When we have a duration that is greater than 2 years (e.g., 2.2 years), \"rounding up\" means we take the next whole number, which is 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Calendar Years vs. Duration:** The war touched three different calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506), but this doesn't automatically mean it lasted three full years. The question asks for the *length* of the war.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clause:** This is the key to resolving the ambiguity. Since the war's events span a period that is almost certainly longer than exactly 24 months, any duration over 2 years must be rounded up to 3.\n*   **Canonical Timeline:** The years 2504 (start) and 2506 (end) are well-established in StarCraft lore and serve as the definitive goalposts for this calculation.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506. This results in a duration of approximately 2 years. However, because the conflict's events are spread out over this period, the actual length is slightly more than two full years. As per the instruction to round up, this duration rounds up to 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
