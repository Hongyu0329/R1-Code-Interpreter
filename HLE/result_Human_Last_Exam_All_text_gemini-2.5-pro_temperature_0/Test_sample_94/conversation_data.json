    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"Which physicist...\"**: The answer must be the name of a specific person who was a physicist.\n2.  **\"...better known for work in the microscopy field...\"**: This is a major clue. The physicist's primary contribution or fame is related to microscopes. This narrows the field from all physicists to those who made significant advances in microscopy.\n3.  **\"...discovered an optical effect in real imagery...\"**: The discovery is a principle of optics, specifically one that applies to real images (images formed by the actual convergence of light rays).\n4.  **\"...after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker...\"**: This is a very specific and anecdotal part of the discovery story. The initial observation was not made by a scientist in a controlled experiment but by a non-scientist performing a routine task.\n5.  **\"...cleaning concave mirrors.\"**: This pinpoints the specific type of equipment involved in the accidental observation. Concave mirrors are capable of forming real images.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The physicist must have a strong connection to **microscopy**.\n*   The discovery must be an **optical effect**, not a particle or a theory of relativity, for example.\n*   The story involving the **custodial worker** and the **concave mirror** is the most unique and identifying detail. We need to find a discovery story that matches this anecdote.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  We start with the most distinctive clue: the story of a custodial worker's observation on a concave mirror leading to a major optical discovery. This specific anecdote is famously associated with one particular physicist.\n\n2.  The story is linked to the discovery of the **phase-contrast principle**. This principle is a method for making transparent objects, such as living cells, visible under a microscope. These objects don't absorb much light, but they do alter the phase of the light passing through them. The phase-contrast method converts these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness.\n\n3.  The physicist credited with this discovery is **Frits Zernike**. He was a Dutch physicist who was investigating spectral lines using a concave diffraction grating (a specialized type of concave mirror).\n\n4.  The anecdote states that a janitor, while cleaning the grating, remarked to Zernike how clearly the scratches on the mirror's surface were visible. This observation helped spark Zernike's realization that these scratches, which were essentially transparent phase objects, could be seen because they diffracted light differently than the surrounding perfect surface. This insight was the key to developing the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n5.  Let's check if Frits Zernike fits all the criteria:\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, he was a Dutch physicist.\n    *   **Better known for microscopy?** Yes, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase-contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\" This is his most celebrated work.\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery?** Yes, the phase-contrast principle, which he first observed in the real images produced by a concave grating.\n    *   **Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?** Yes, this is the famous story associated with his discovery.\n\nAll points in the question align perfectly with Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
