    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Syllabification**: First, we break the line down into its constituent syllables. We must be careful to identify diphthongs and potential elisions. In this case, we will proceed without elision, as is common in Plautine scansion to achieve a valid meter.\n    `et | ti | bi | be | ne | es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n    This gives us a total of 15 syllables.\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Quantity**: Next, we determine whether each syllable is long (L) or short (S).\n    *   A syllable is long by **nature** if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is long by **position** if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (the consonants can be in the same or different words).\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is short.\n\n    Let's apply these rules to our syllables:\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`). Thus, it is long by position. **L**\n    *   `ti`: The vowel `i` is short and followed by a single consonant. **S**\n    *   `bi`: The vowel `i` is short and followed by a single consonant. **S**\n    *   `be`: The vowel `e` is short and followed by a single consonant. **S**\n    *   `ne`: The vowel `e` is short and followed by a single consonant before the next vowel. **S**\n    *   `es`: From `esse`. The vowel `e` is short, but followed by the double consonant `ss`. Thus, it is long by position. **L**\n    *   `se`: The final `e` of `esse` is short. **S**\n    *   `so`: From `soli`. The `o` is long by nature. **L**\n    *   `li`: From `soli`. The final `i` is long by nature. **L**\n    *   `quom`: This contains a diphthong (`uo`) and is therefore long by nature. It is also followed by two consonants (`m` and `s` from `sibi`), making it long by position as well. **L**\n    *   `si`: The vowel `i` is short. **S**\n    *   `bi`: The vowel `i` is short. **S**\n    *   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `sit` and `m` from `male`). Thus, it is long by position. **L**\n    *   `ma`: The vowel `a` is short. **S**\n    *   `le`: The final vowel `e` is short. **S**\n\n    The resulting sequence of long and short syllables is: `L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n3.  **Grouping into Feet**: The line is an **iambic senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet. The basic foot is an iamb (`S L`). However, in Roman comedy, many substitutions (resolutions) are allowed:\n    *   A spondee (`L L`) can replace an iamb.\n    *   An iamb (`S L`) can be resolved into a tribrach (`S S S`).\n    *   A spondee (`L L`) can be resolved into a dactyl (`L S S`), an anapest (`S S L`), or a proceleusmatic (`S S S S`).\n\n    We parse the sequence `L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S` into six valid feet:\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` -> `L S S`. This is a **dactyl**, a valid substitution for a spondee in the first foot.\n    *   **Foot 2**: `be ne es` -> `S S L`. This is an **anapest**, a valid substitution.\n    *   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> `S L`. This is a pure **iamb**.\n    *   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> `L L`. This is a **spondee**, a valid substitution.\n    *   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> `S S L`. This is an **anapest**, a valid substitution.\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> `S S`. The final syllable of a line is *anceps* (it can be treated as long or short). Here, the short `-le` is treated as long to form a valid final **iamb** (`S L`).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Plautine Meter**: The meter of Plautus is much more flexible than that of classical poets like Virgil. It allows for many resolutions and substitutions, which can make scansion challenging.\n*   **No Elision**: While elision is common in Latin poetry, this line scans perfectly without it. Plautus often uses hiatus (the absence of elision) where it is metrically convenient.\n*   **Syllable Quantity by Position**: Pay close attention to consonant clusters that cross word boundaries (e.g., `et tibi`, `sit male`).\n*   **Final Syllable (Anceps)**: Remember that the length of the very last syllable in a line is metrically indifferent; it is scanned to fit the required pattern of the final foot.\n*   **Caesura**: The division of feet does not need to align with word boundaries. It is normal for a foot to contain syllables from two different words (e.g., `be ne es-` and `-se so-`).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis above, the scansion is as follows:\n\n*   Foot 1: `et ti bi` = `L S S` (Dactyl)\n*   Foot 2: `be ne es` = `S S L` (Anapest)\n*   Foot 3: `se so` = `S L` (Iamb)\n*   Foot 4: `li quom` = `L L` (Spondee)\n*   Foot 5: `si bi sit` = `S S L` (Anapest)\n*   Foot 6: `ma le` = `S L` (Iamb)\n\nCombining these feet with spaces in between gives the final answer.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
