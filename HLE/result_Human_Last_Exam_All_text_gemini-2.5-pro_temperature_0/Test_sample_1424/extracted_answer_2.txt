The bare Green's function in the frequency-eigenstate representation, $G_0(k, \omega)$, has a simple pole structure. The functional dependence is such that the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ sets the location of this pole on the real frequency axis. The explicit form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta_k}$, where $\eta_k$ is an infinitesimal that enforces causality.
