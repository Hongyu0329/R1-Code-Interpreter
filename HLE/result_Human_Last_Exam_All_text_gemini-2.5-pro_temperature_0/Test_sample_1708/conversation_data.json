    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Set and the Order\n\n*   **The Set (S):** The set consists of all finite strings formed from the characters in the alphabet A = {a, b, c, d}. This includes the empty string \"\".\n    *   Examples: \"\", \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"d\", \"dabc\", ...\n*   **The Order (<):** The ordering is lexical (lexicographical), which is the standard dictionary order. For two strings `s1` and `s2`:\n    1.  If `s1` is a proper prefix of `s2`, then `s1 < s2`. (e.g., \"a\" < \"aa\")\n    2.  Otherwise, find the first position `i` where they differ. If the character `s1[i]` comes before `s2[i]` in the alphabet, then `s1 < s2`. (e.g., \"ab\" < \"ac\", \"ad\" < \"b\")\n\n### Step 2: Determine if the Set is Well-Ordered\n\nAn ordered set is **well-ordered** if every non-empty subset has a least (minimum) element. The order type of a well-ordered set is an **ordinal number**.\n\nLet's check if (S, <) is well-ordered.\nConsider an arbitrary non-empty subset `X` of `S`. We need to show `X` has a minimum element.\nWe can construct the minimum element as follows:\n1.  If the empty string `\"\"` is in `X`, it is the minimum element of `S` and thus the minimum element of `X`.\n2.  If `\"\"` is not in `X`, all strings in `X` have a first character. Let `c1` be the smallest first character among all strings in `X` (e.g., if `X` contains \"b\", \"ca\", \"ba\", the smallest first character is 'b').\n3.  Consider the subset `X1` of `X` containing all strings that start with `c1`. This set is non-empty.\n4.  For each string `s = c1s'` in `X1`, consider its \"tail\" `s'`. Let `X'` be the set of all such tails. `X'` is a subset of `S`.\n5.  We can apply this same logic recursively to `X'`. This process must terminate because at each step where we don't find an empty string, we are selecting a string that is getting progressively \"smaller\" in a way that must end. A more formal proof shows that we can always find a string `m` in `X` such that no other string `t` in `X` is smaller than `m`.\n\nA simpler way to see this is to visualize the strings as nodes on an infinite 4-ary tree (the root is `\"\"`, its children are `a,b,c,d`, etc.). The lexical order corresponds to a pre-order traversal of this tree. For any subset of nodes, the first node visited by the traversal is the minimum element of that subset.\n\nTherefore, the set `S` is well-ordered, and its order type is an ordinal number.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the Ordinal Number\n\nLet `τ` be the order type of `S`. We can decompose `S` into disjoint subsets based on the first character:\n`S = {\"\"} ∪ S_a ∪ S_b ∪ S_c ∪ S_d`\nwhere `S_c` is the set of strings starting with character `c`.\n\nAccording to the lexical ordering rule, any string starting with `a` is less than any string starting with `b`, and so on.\n*   `\"\"` is the smallest element.\n*   Every element of `S_a` is less than every element of `S_b`.\n*   Every element of `S_b` is less than every element of `S_c`.\n*   Every element of `S_c` is less than every element of `S_d`.\n\nThis means the order type `τ` is the ordinal sum of the order types of these parts:\n`τ = type({\"\"}) + type(S_a) + type(S_b) + type(S_c) + type(S_d)`\n\n*   `type({\"\"}) = 1`.\n*   Now consider `type(S_a)`. `S_a` consists of strings `{as' | s' ∈ S}`. The mapping `f(s') = as'` is an order isomorphism from `S` to `S_a`. This means `s'_1 < s'_2` if and only if `as'_1 < as'_2`. Therefore, `S_a` has the same order type as `S`. So, `type(S_a) = τ`.\n*   Similarly, `type(S_b) = type(S_c) = type(S_d) = τ`.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation gives us an equation for the ordinal `τ`:\n`τ = 1 + τ + τ + τ + τ`\n`τ = 1 + 4·τ`\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Ordinal Equation\n\nWe need to find the ordinal `τ` that is the solution to `τ = 1 + 4·τ`.\nThis is a recursive definition. We can find the solution by seeing what ordinal is built by this process.\nLet's start with `0` and repeatedly apply the function `F(α) = 1 + 4α`.\n*   `F(0) = 1`\n*   `F(1) = 1 + 4 = 5`\n*   `F(5) = 1 + 4·5 = 21`\n*   The limit of this first sequence `1, 5, 21, ...` is `ω`.\n\nLet's continue from `ω`.\n*   `F(ω) = 1 + 4·ω`\n*   `F(1 + 4·ω) = 1 + 4(1 + 4·ω) = 1 + 4 + 16·ω = 5 + 16·ω`\n*   The limit of this sequence is `ω²`.\n\nLet's continue from `ω²`.\n*   `F(ω²) = 1 + 4·ω²`\n*   The limit of this process gives `ω³`.\n\nThe process generates the sequence of ordinals `ω, ω², ω³, ...`. The solution to the equation is the supremum (the limit) of this sequence.\n`τ = sup{ω, ω², ω³, ... , ω^n, ...}` for `n ∈ ℕ`.\n\nThe supremum of this sequence is the ordinal **`ω^ω`**.\n\nLet's verify this. The order type of polynomials with natural number coefficients, ordered by their value for large `x`, is `ω^ω`. This structure is a well-known example of a well-ordered set with this order type. Our set of strings can be mapped to such polynomials, showing they have the same structure. For example, with alphabet {a,b} (a=0, b=1), the string `babaa` (`10100`) could be mapped to the polynomial `x^4 + x^2`. This mapping (shortlex order) has type `ω^ω`. While the lexical order is different, its recursive structure builds up to the same ordinal complexity.\n\nThe order type is the least ordinal `τ` such that `τ > F(α)` for all `α < τ`. This leads to `τ = ω^ω`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n1.  **Lexical vs. Shortlex:** Be careful not to confuse lexical order with shortlex (short for \"short-lexicographical\") order. In shortlex, shorter strings always come first. The order type for shortlex would be `1 + 4 + 4² + 4³ + ... = ω`. The problem specifies lexical order.\n2.  **Well-Ordering:** It is easy to mistakenly construct an infinite descending sequence (e.g., `b > ab > aab > ...`), but this is incorrect because `ab < b`. The set is indeed well-ordered.\n3.  **Ordinal Arithmetic:** The equation `τ = 1 + 4·τ` seems paradoxical because for infinite ordinals `1+τ = τ`, which would imply `τ = 4·τ`, an equation with no solution for `τ > 0`. The error in that reasoning is that the equation `τ = 1 + 4·τ` is a *recursive definition* for `τ`, and its solution is the limit of the construction, which is `ω^ω`.\n\nFinal Answer: The order type is the ordinal `ω^ω`.\n\n<<<ω^ω>>>"
