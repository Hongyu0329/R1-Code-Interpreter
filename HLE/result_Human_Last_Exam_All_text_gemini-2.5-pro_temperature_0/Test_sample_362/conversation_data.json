    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is **pivalaldehyde**, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure features a tert-butyl group `((CH3)3C-)` attached to an aldehyde functional group `(-CHO)`.\n    *   Structure: `(CH3)3C-C(=O)H`\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**. This is a phosphorus ylide. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This is the triphenylphosphine part, `(C6H5)3P`, often abbreviated as `Ph3P`. The λ⁵ indicates phosphorus is in a pentavalent state, characteristic of an ylide.\n    *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`: This is the organic group attached to the phosphorus. \"Ethylidene\" implies a two-carbon chain attached via a double bond (`=CH-CH3`). The \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" substituent is on the second carbon of this chain.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is: `(Ph)3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl)`.\n\n**2. Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a chemical reaction that converts a carbonyl group (an aldehyde or a ketone) into an alkene (a C=C double bond). The core transformation is the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (`C=O`) with the carbon group from the phosphorus ylide (`C=PPh3`).\n\n*   The reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic attack of the ylide's carbanion on the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon.\n*   This forms a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane.\n*   The oxaphosphetane then decomposes to yield the final alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide (`Ph3P=O`) as a byproduct.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity**\n\nTo find the structure of the product, we connect the carbon atom from the aldehyde that was part of the `C=O` group to the carbon atom from the ylide that was part of the `C=P` group.\n\n*   From pivalaldehyde: `(CH3)3C-CH=`\n*   From the ylide: `=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl)`\n*   Combining them gives the alkene skeleton: `(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl)`\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemistry (A Careful Point)**\n\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting double bond (whether it is Z or E) is a crucial aspect of the Wittig reaction. It depends on the stability of the phosphorus ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized Ylides:** Ylides with an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, ester) on the carbon atom adjacent to the phosphorus are \"stabilized\". They typically yield the **(E)-alkene** (trans) as the major product.\n*   **Unstabilized Ylides:** Ylides with alkyl or hydrogen groups on the carbon atom adjacent to the phosphorus are \"unstabilized\". Our ylide, `(Ph)3P=CH-CH2-R`, falls into this category because the `CH2-R` group is not electron-withdrawing. Unstabilized ylides react with aldehydes to predominantly form the **(Z)-alkene** (cis) as the major product. This is a result of kinetic control during the formation of the oxaphosphetane intermediate.\n\nTherefore, we expect the major product of this reaction to be the (Z)-isomer.\n\n**5. Assign the Final Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Structure:** The (Z)-isomer will have the high-priority groups on each side of the double bond on the same side.\n    *   On the left carbon: The tert-butyl group `-(C(CH3)3)` has higher priority than the hydrogen atom `-H`.\n    *   On the right carbon: The `-(CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl))` group has higher priority than the hydrogen atom `-H`.\n    *   In the (Z)-isomer, the `-(C(CH3)3)` group and the `-(CH2-(C6H4-2-Cl))` group are on the same side of the C=C double bond.\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: It is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n    2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number: `(CH3)3C(4)-CH(3)=CH(2)-CH2(1)-(C6H4-2-Cl)`. The double bond is at position 2, so it is a `pent-2-ene`.\n    3.  Identify and name the substituents: A `2-chlorophenyl` group at position 1, and two `methyl` groups at position 4.\n    4.  Combine the parts with the stereochemical descriptor (Z): **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is the (Z)-isomer of the resulting alkene, due to the use of an unstabilized ylide.\n\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
