    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has the following properties:\n1.  The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n2.  The graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\nThe chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colours required to colour the vertices of $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. We are looking for the maximum value that $\\chi(G)$ can take under the given constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The absolute maximum chromatic number.** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ can be at most $n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique colour to each of the $n$ vertices. So, for our graph $G$, we know $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The condition for reaching the absolute maximum.** A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of exactly $n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n    *   **Why?** If $G = K_n$, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. Therefore, all $n$ vertices must be assigned a unique colour, so $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n    *   Conversely, if $\\chi(G) = n$, it means that it's impossible to colour the graph with $n-1$ colours. If the graph were not complete, there would be at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices, say $u$ and $v$. We could then assign the same colour to $u$ and $v$ and proceed to colour the remaining $n-2$ vertices with at most $n-2$ new colours, leading to a total of at most $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colours. This contradicts $\\chi(G)=n$. Therefore, if $\\chi(G)=n$, the graph must be complete.\n\n*   **Applying the condition to our problem:** The problem explicitly states that $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. Based on the point above, this means that the chromatic number of $G$ cannot be 12345.\n    *   So, we must have $\\chi(G) < 12345$.\n    *   Since the chromatic number must be an integer, this implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   This gives us an upper bound: the maximum number of colours needed is at most 12344.\n\n### Step 3: Verifying if the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nNow we need to determine if it's possible to construct a graph $G$ that satisfies the problem's conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344. If we can find such a graph, then 12344 is indeed the maximum possible value.\n\n*   **Construction of a candidate graph:** Let's try to build a graph $G^*$ with 12345 vertices that requires 12344 colours. A simple way to do this is to construct a graph that contains a very large clique.\n    *   Consider the graph $G^*$ which is the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n    *   $G^* = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$.\n\n*   **Analyzing the constructed graph $G^*$:**\n    1.  **Number of vertices:** The number of vertices in $G^*$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the condition.\n    2.  **Is it a complete graph?** No. For $G^*$ to be $K_{12345}$, every vertex would need to be connected to every other vertex. The isolated vertex in $G^*$ is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. Thus, $G^* \\neq K_{12345}$. This matches the condition.\n    3.  **Chromatic number:** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph (one with multiple components) is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n        *   The chromatic number of the first component, $K_{12344}$, is $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n        *   The chromatic number of the second component, the isolated vertex $K_1$, is $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n        *   Therefore, the chromatic number of our constructed graph is $\\chi(G^*) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n*   **Conclusion of this step:** We have successfully constructed a graph with 12345 vertices, which is not the complete graph, and which requires exactly 12344 colours. This shows that the upper bound of 12344 is achievable.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\n1.  We established that any graph $G$ on 12345 vertices that is not the complete graph must have a chromatic number $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n2.  We demonstrated the existence of such a graph with $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n\nCombining these two points, the maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of $G$ properly is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
