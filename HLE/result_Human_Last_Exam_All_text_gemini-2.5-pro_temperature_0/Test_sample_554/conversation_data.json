    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Name**\n\n*   **\"Nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific type of molecule designed to resemble a car on a molecular scale. It is not a standard IUPAC name but a nickname for a molecule first synthesized by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University. To answer the question, we must analyze the chemical structure of this specific, well-known nanocar.\n*   **\"Perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard chemical prefix. It means that every hydrogen atom (H) in the original molecule has been replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Original Nanocar**\n\nThe original nanocar molecule consists of two main parts: the chassis (which includes the body, axles, and bumpers) and the wheels.\n\n*   **Wheels**: The wheels are four C₆₀ fullerene molecules (buckyballs). Fullerenes are allotropes of carbon and are composed entirely of carbon atoms. Therefore, they contain **zero hydrogen atoms**.\n*   **Chassis**: The chassis is the part of the molecule that contains hydrogen atoms. We need to carefully count all the hydrogens on the chassis based on its published chemical structure. The chassis is built around a central benzene ring.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Hydrogen Atoms on the Nanocar's Chassis**\n\nLet's break down the chassis into its constituent parts and count the hydrogens on each:\n\n1.  **Central Ring**: The core of the chassis is a benzene ring that is substituted at four positions (1, 2, 4, and 5). This leaves two unsubstituted positions on the ring, which hold **2 hydrogen atoms**.\n2.  **Axle Arms**: Attached to the central ring (at positions 1 and 4) are two arms that function as axles. Each arm consists of a para-phenylene group (-C₆H₄-). Each of these phenyl rings has **4 hydrogen atoms**. Since there are two such arms, this contributes 2 * 4 = **8 hydrogen atoms**.\n3.  **Bumper Arms**: Attached to the central ring (at positions 2 and 5) are two bulkier arms that act as bumpers and prevent the molecules from clumping. Each arm is a 3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl group.\n    *   The phenyl ring in this group has **3 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   Each of the two tert-butyl groups (-C(CH₃)₃) has 3 * 3 = **9 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   So, one bumper arm has 3 + (2 * 9) = 21 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are two such arms, this contributes 2 * 21 = **42 hydrogen atoms**.\n4.  **Linkers**: The various parts of the chassis are connected by alkyne (-C≡C-) groups, which contain no hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms**\n\nTo find the total number of hydrogens in the nanocar molecule, we sum the counts from each part of the chassis:\n\n*   Total Hydrogens = (Hydrogens on Central Ring) + (Hydrogens on Axle Arms) + (Hydrogens on Bumper Arms)\n*   Total Hydrogens = 2 + 8 + 42 = **52 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms in Perfluoronanocar**\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means we replace every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom.\n\n*   Number of hydrogen atoms in a nanocar = 52\n*   Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar = **52**.\n\nThe C₆₀ fullerene wheels are unaffected as they have no hydrogens to be replaced.\n\n<<<52>>>"
