    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the relationship between the Néron-Severi group of X and the curve C**\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g`, and let `X = C^(n)` be its `n`-th symmetric power. The Néron-Severi group of `X`, denoted `NS(X)`, is the group of divisors on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is the Picard number `ρ(X)`.\n\nA fundamental result by I. G. Macdonald connects the Picard group of `C^(n)` to the Picard group of the Jacobian of `C`, denoted `J(C)`. This result implies an isomorphism for the Néron-Severi groups:\n`NS(C^(n)) \\cong Z \\oplus NS(J(C))`\n\nThe rank of a direct sum of abelian groups is the sum of their ranks. The rank of `Z` is 1. Therefore, the rank of `NS(X)` is given by the formula:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(C^(n)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nIn our problem, `C` is a genus 3 curve and `X` is its 15th symmetric power (`g=3`, `n=15`). The formula becomes:\n`ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nThis means the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(J(C))`, the Picard number of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Step 2: Establish the general bounds for the rank of NS(J(C))**\n\nThe Jacobian `J(C)` of a genus `g=3` curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For any `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A`, its Picard number `ρ(A)` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`.\n\n*   **Lower Bound:** Since `J(C)` is a projective variety, it has an ample line bundle (given by the principal polarization). The class of this line bundle is non-trivial in `NS(J(C))`, so `ρ(J(C)) >= 1`.\n*   **Upper Bound:** The Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)` for a `g`-dimensional abelian variety is `g^2`. This is a consequence of the Hodge decomposition. So, `ρ(J(C)) <= h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9`.\n\nCombining these, we have the range for the Picard number of the Jacobian:\n`1 <= ρ(J(C)) <= 9`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the smallest possible rank of NS(X)**\n\nThe smallest rank of `NS(X)` will occur when `ρ(J(C))` is minimal.\n\n*   The minimum value `ρ(J(C)) = 1` is achieved for a \"very general\" curve `C`.\n*   A very general curve in the moduli space `M_3` has a Jacobian `J(C)` that is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = Z`.\n*   For such a Jacobian, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and thus `NS(J(C)) \\cong Z`.\n*   Therefore, the minimum possible value for `ρ(J(C))` is 1.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value into our formula for `ρ(X)`:\n`ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The set of curves for which `ρ(J(C)) > 1` forms a countable union of proper subvarieties in the moduli space of curves. Thus, a \"generic\" curve will have `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the largest possible rank of NS(X)**\n\nThe largest rank of `NS(X)` will occur when `ρ(J(C))` is maximal. We need to check if the upper bound `ρ(J(C)) = 9` is attainable.\n\n*   The Picard number of a `g`-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety `A` reaches its theoretical maximum of `g^2` if and only if `A` is isogenous to the `g`-th power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (a CM elliptic curve).\n*   So, for `g=3`, `ρ(J(C))` can be 9 if and only if there exists a genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian `J(C)` is isogenous to `E^3` for some CM elliptic curve `E`.\n*   Such curves exist. A prime example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, given by the projective equation `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`.\n    *   This is a smooth curve of genus `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n    *   It is a classical result that its Jacobian, `J(F_4)`, is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve `E: y^2 = x^3 - x`.\n    *   This elliptic curve `E` has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n*   Since such a curve `C = F_4` exists, the maximum value `ρ(J(C)) = 9` is attainable.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value into our formula for `ρ(X)`:\n`ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n**Careful Point:** The existence of a specific curve whose Jacobian has the maximal possible Picard number is a non-trivial fact that is essential for this part of the argument.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the structure of the Néron-Severi group of the symmetric power of a curve, we have found:\n*   The smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` is 2, achieved for a generic genus 3 curve.\n*   The largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is 10, achieved for special curves like the Fermat quartic whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
