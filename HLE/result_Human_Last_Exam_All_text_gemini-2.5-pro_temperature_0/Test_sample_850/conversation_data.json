    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties**\n\nFirst, we must carefully define the three properties required by the question in the context of crystal symmetry.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:**\n    *   In its strictest sense, optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is associated with **chiral** structures. A chiral object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n    *   However, the physical property of optical activity is governed by the **gyration tensor (g_ij)**. A crystal can exhibit optical activity for at least some direction of light propagation if this tensor has non-zero components.\n    *   According to Neumann's principle, the symmetry of a physical property must include the symmetry of the crystal point group. This dictates that the gyration tensor can only be non-zero for the **21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes** (those lacking a center of inversion).\n    *   Crucially, among these 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, there are three for which the gyration tensor is identically zero due to other symmetry elements: `-42m`, `-6m2`, and `-43m`.\n    *   Therefore, for a crystal class to have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity,\" it must be **non-centrosymmetric** and **not** be one of `-42m`, `-6m2`, or `-43m`. This broader definition is necessary to find a solution, as the strict definition (chirality) would contradict the \"achiral\" requirement.\n\n2.  **Achiral:**\n    *   A crystal class is achiral if its symmetry includes at least one **improper rotation axis**. These are:\n        *   A center of inversion (`i` or `-1`).\n        *   A mirror plane (`m`).\n        *   A rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n    *   This means we must exclude the 11 **chiral** (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes, which lack all these symmetry elements. The chiral classes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n\n3.  **Non-polar:**\n    *   A crystal class is polar if it has a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity.\n    *   Symmetrically, this means the class has at least one polar axis (a rotation axis not perpendicular to a mirror plane and with no perpendicular twofold axes).\n    *   There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is not one of these 10 classes.\n\n**Step 2: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nWe will now systematically apply these three conditions to the 32 crystal classes to find which ones satisfy all criteria.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Must be Achiral.**\n    We start by eliminating the 11 chiral classes:\n    `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`\n    This leaves 21 achiral classes.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Must be Non-polar.**\n    From the remaining 21 achiral classes, we eliminate those that are polar. The achiral classes that are also polar are:\n    `m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm`\n    After removing these 5 classes, we are left with 16 classes that are both achiral and non-polar:\n    `-1, 2/m, mmm, -4, 4/m, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, -6, 6/m, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m`\n\n*   **Condition 3: Must be Optically Active.**\n    From this list of 16 achiral, non-polar classes, we must keep only those that are optically active (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor).\n    *   First, we eliminate all **centrosymmetric** classes, as they cannot be optically active. The 11 centrosymmetric classes are: `-1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m`. All of these are on our list of 16, so we remove them.\n    *   This leaves us with the following non-centrosymmetric classes from our list: `-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m`.\n    *   Next, we eliminate the special non-centrosymmetric classes for which the gyration tensor is nevertheless zero: `-42m, -6m2, -43m`.\n    *   Removing these three classes leaves us with the final result.\n\n**Step 3: Final Result**\n\nThe crystal classes that remain after applying all three filters are:\n1.  **-4** (Schoenflies: S₄)\n2.  **-6** (Schoenflies: C₃ₕ)\n\nLet's verify these two classes:\n*   **Class -4:** It is achiral (contains a -4 axis), non-polar (not one of the 10 polar classes), and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric and its gyration tensor is non-zero).\n*   **Class -6:** It is achiral (contains a -6 axis), non-polar (not one of the 10 polar classes), and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric and its gyration tensor is non-zero).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The primary subtlety is the definition of \"optical activity\". The question is unanswerable if optical activity is strictly equated with chirality. The physically correct basis for optical activity is a non-zero gyration tensor, which can exist in certain achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes.\n*   The distinction between polar and non-polar classes is critical. A class is non-polar if it lacks any unique polar axes.\n*   The distinction between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric classes is the first filter for optical activity. All centrosymmetric classes are optically inactive.\n*   A final filter is required for the few non-centrosymmetric classes (`-42m`, `-6m2`, `-43m`) that are also optically inactive due to their specific symmetry.\n\nThe final answer is the two crystal classes that satisfy all conditions.\n\n<<<-4, -6>>>"
