Based on structural and functional studies of the human CaV2.3 (alpha-1) and CaVÎ²1 subunit complex, the key residue hotspots are as follows (residue numbering from UniProt P54283-2 for human CACNB1):

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues form the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and are essential for the physical binding of the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID).

*   **Core Hydrophobic Pocket Residues:**
    *   **Leucine 298 (L298)**
    *   **Valine 355 (V355)**
    *   **Tyrosine 357 (Y357)**
    *   **Phenylalanine 359 (F359)**
    *   **Leucine 400 (L400)**
    *   **Valine 402 (V402)**
    *   **Tryptophan 438 (W438)**
    *   **Isoleucine 440 (I440)**
*   **Key Electrostatic Interaction Residues (at the pocket rim):**
    *   **Glutamic Acid 396 (E396)**
    *   **Glutamic Acid 442 (E442)**

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues or regions are critical for the allosteric regulation of channel opening, closing, and inactivation, often acting at sites distinct from the primary binding pocket.

*   **N-Terminal Modulatory Cluster:** This region is crucial for modulating the voltage-dependence of both activation and inactivation.
    *   **Lysine 19 (K19)**
    *   **Arginine 20 (R20)**
    *   **Lysine 21 (K21)**
*   **SH3 Domain Modulatory Hotspot:** This residue is part of a secondary interaction site that specifically fine-tunes channel inactivation.
    *   **Tryptophan 239 (W239)**
