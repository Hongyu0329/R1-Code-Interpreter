    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for three specific criteria to be met simultaneously:\n1.  The film must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  The film must depict a \"Luxor Obelisk\".\n3.  It must be the *first* film to meet both criteria, which requires a chronological search.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\"\nThe term \"Luxor Obelisk\" refers to one of two ancient Egyptian obelisks carved for the Luxor Temple.\n*   One obelisk remains standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The other obelisk was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\n\nTherefore, to find a film depicting a Luxor Obelisk, we must look for a Best Picture winner that features scenes in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde). The Paris location is a far more common cinematic landmark.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners\nWe will now go through the list of Best Picture winners in chronological order and check their settings.\n\n*   **1st (1927/28) - *Wings***: This WWI film has scenes set in France, including a brief sequence in Paris. However, these scenes focus on nightlife (Folies Berg√®re, cafes) and do not feature establishing shots of major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **2nd to 9th Awards (1928-1936)**: The winners during this period (*The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Cimarron*, *Grand Hotel*, *Cavalcade*, *It Happened One Night*, *Mutiny on the Bounty*, *The Great Ziegfeld*) are not set in Paris or Luxor.\n*   **10th (1937) - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is a biopic of the famous French writer Emile Zola and is set almost entirely in Paris. It covers significant historical events of the late 19th century, including the Dreyfus Affair and Zola's own funeral procession. As a film set in Paris covering major public events, it uses establishing shots of the city's iconic landmarks. The Place de la Concorde, with its famous obelisk, is one of the locations depicted in the film to establish the Parisian setting. This makes it a very strong candidate.\n*   **11th to 23rd Awards (1938-1950)**: None of the winners in this period are set in Paris or Luxor. They include films like *Gone with the Wind*, *Rebecca*, *Casablanca*, and *All About Eve*.\n*   **24th (1951) - *An American in Paris***: As the title suggests, this film is set in Paris. It famously and explicitly features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk in several scenes, including musical numbers. However, it won the award 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n*   **29th (1956) - *Around the World in 80 Days***: This film features a global journey that includes a stop in Paris. There is a notable sequence where the characters fly over the city in a hot air balloon, providing a clear view of the Place de la Concorde and the obelisk. This film also came after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBy examining the Best Picture winners chronologically, the first film that is set in a location featuring a Luxor Obelisk is *The Life of Emile Zola* (winner for 1937). The film's Parisian setting includes depictions of the Place de la Concorde, where one of the two Luxor Obelisks stands. Later winners like *An American in Paris* and *Around the World in 80 Days* also feature the obelisk, but *The Life of Emile Zola* is the earliest.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
