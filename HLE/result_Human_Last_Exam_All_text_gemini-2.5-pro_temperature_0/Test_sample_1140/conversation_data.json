    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide. This length is important. The peptide also contains a specific unnatural amino acid (UAA), azido phenylalanine, at a defined position 'X'.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Standard Synthesis Techniques:**\n    *   **Standard Recombinant DNA Expression:** This method uses a host organism (like *E. coli*) to produce a protein from its gene.\n        *   **Pros:** Very efficient for proteins of 100 aa and longer.\n        *   **Cons:** The cell's translational machinery can only incorporate the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids. It cannot read a codon for azido phenylalanine. Therefore, this standard method is not viable on its own.\n    *   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is a chemical method where amino acids are added one by one to a growing chain anchored to a solid support.\n        *   **Pros:** It is extremely versatile and can easily incorporate almost any unnatural amino acid, including azido phenylalanine, provided a protected version of the UAA is available (which it is).\n        *   **Cons:** The efficiency of each coupling step is not 100%. Over a long synthesis, these small inefficiencies accumulate dramatically. For a 100 aa peptide, the overall yield of the correct full-length product would be extremely low, and the final purification from a complex mixture of deletion sequences would be exceptionally difficult. A 100 aa peptide is generally considered beyond the practical limit for routine SPPS.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Advanced/Hybrid Synthesis Techniques:** Since the standard methods have significant drawbacks, we must consider more advanced techniques designed for such problems.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This technique involves chemically joining two smaller peptide fragments. One fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine.\n        *   **Application:** One could synthesize a small fragment containing the UAA (e.g., M...KAVCLX) using SPPS, and produce the remaining larger fragment (VIGATR...A) using recombinant expression.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This strategy requires an N-terminal cysteine on the second fragment. The native sequence has a Valine (V) at that position. This would require mutating V to C for the ligation, which might be undesirable or require an additional chemical step after ligation to convert the cysteine back to an alanine (not the original valine). This adds significant complexity.\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion (also known as Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation or Amber Suppression):** This is a sophisticated *in vivo* technique that \"teaches\" the cell to incorporate a UAA.\n        *   **How it works:**\n            1.  The gene for the 100 aa peptide is synthesized, but a stop codon (typically the amber codon, UAG) is placed at the position where 'X' should be.\n            2.  A new, orthogonal pair of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) and its corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) is introduced into the host cell.\n            3.  This engineered aaRS specifically recognizes the UAA (azido phenylalanine, which is added to the cell growth medium) and attaches it to the engineered tRNA.\n            4.  The engineered tRNA is designed to recognize the UAG stop codon.\n            5.  During translation, when the ribosome encounters the UAG codon, the engineered tRNA delivers the azido phenylalanine, incorporating it into the growing peptide chain instead of terminating synthesis.\n        *   **Feasibility:** This method combines the high efficiency of recombinant expression for a 100 aa peptide with the site-specific precision needed to incorporate the UAA. It is a well-established and powerful technique for exactly this type of problem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, total chemical synthesis (SPPS) is impractical due to the peptide's length. Native Chemical Ligation is possible but complex, potentially requiring mutations. Genetic code expansion is the most direct, elegant, and efficient method. It leverages the power of cellular machinery to build the long peptide backbone while providing a specific mechanism to insert the single unnatural amino acid. Therefore, it is the most helpful technique.\n\n<<<Genetic code expansion (via amber suppression)>>>"
