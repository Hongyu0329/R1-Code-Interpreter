    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **\"Full spectral volume\"**: This refers to the 3D data cube, often denoted as `I(x, y, λ)`, which contains spatial information on two axes (`x`, `y`) and spectral information on the third axis (wavelength, `λ`).\n*   **\"From a single image\"**: This is a critical constraint. The entire 3D data cube must be reconstructed from a single 2D measurement captured by a sensor in one snapshot. This is a class of techniques known as snapshot hyperspectral imaging.\n*   **\"Computed tomography (CT)\"**: This specifies the reconstruction methodology. CT works by taking multiple lower-dimensional projections of a higher-dimensional object and then using an algorithm to reconstruct the original object. The classic example is a medical CT scan, where multiple 2D X-ray images (projections) from different angles are used to reconstruct a 3D volume of the body.\n*   **\"Diffraction gratings\"**: These are the optical components used to create the projections. A diffraction grating disperses light, separating it into its constituent wavelengths. The direction of this dispersion depends on the orientation of the grating lines.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Core Problem**\n\nThe fundamental challenge is to encode the information from a 3D data cube `I(x, y, λ)` onto a 2D sensor `g(u, v)`. This is a dimensionality reduction, which inherently leads to information loss. To recover the original 3D cube, the encoding process (the \"projections\") must be done in a way that the reconstruction algorithm can uniquely solve for the original data. This is the essence of computed tomography.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Computed Tomography Analogy**\n\nLet's draw a parallel to standard 2D CT, which is easier to visualize.\n*   **Object**: A 2D image, `f(x, y)`.\n*   **Projections**: A set of 1D line integrals (e.g., summing pixel values along parallel lines) taken at various angles `θ`.\n*   **Reconstruction**: Using these 1D projections to reconstruct the original 2D image `f(x, y)`.\n\nThe **Fourier Slice Theorem** is a key concept in CT. It states that the 1D Fourier Transform of a projection taken at angle `θ` is equal to a slice through the 2D Fourier Transform of the original object at the same angle `θ`. To reconstruct the object, we need to adequately sample its 2D Fourier space.\n\n*   **With 1 projection**: We only know the Fourier transform along a single line through the origin. This is not enough information to reconstruct the 2D object.\n*   **With 2 projections (e.g., at 0° and 90°)**: We know the Fourier transform along the horizontal and vertical axes. This is better, but we have no information about the diagonal frequencies. This leads to severe artifacts and ambiguity. For example, the images `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` and `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` have identical projections at 0° and 90° (row and column sums are all 1). The reconstruction is not unique.\n*   **With 3 projections (e.g., at 0°, 60°, and 120°)**: We now have three lines sampling the Fourier space. This provides enough information to \"fill in the gaps\" through interpolation and achieve a stable, unique reconstruction (within the limits of resolution).\n\nTherefore, for 2D CT, the minimum number of non-collinear projections for a stable reconstruction is **three**.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the CT Analogy to the Spectral Imaging Problem**\n\nIn our case, the \"object\" is the 3D spectral data cube `I(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are created by the diffraction gratings on the 2D sensor.\n\n*   A single diffraction grating disperses light in one direction. For example, a grating oriented to disperse along the sensor's u-axis mixes the spatial `x` information with the spectral `λ` information. This is one projection. As in the 2D CT case, one projection is insufficient to resolve the ambiguity between space and wavelength.\n*   Using two gratings to provide two orthogonal dispersion directions (e.g., along the u-axis and v-axis) is analogous to the 2-projection case in 2D CT. It provides more information but is still insufficient for an unambiguous reconstruction due to the \"missing wedge\" of information (in this case, the diagonal spectral-spatial information).\n*   To make the reconstruction problem well-posed and stable, we need to add at least one more projection in a non-collinear direction. This would be achieved by a third diffraction grating, oriented to disperse light diagonally. This provides the necessary information to resolve the ambiguities present with only two projections.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Minimum Number**\n\nBased on the principles of computed tomography, a minimum of three independent, non-collinear projections are required for a stable reconstruction. Since each diffraction grating (or each independent grating function within a single complex optical element) provides one such projection, the minimum number of gratings necessary is three.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The question asks for the \"minimum number\". While more gratings (projections) would yield a better quality reconstruction, three is the theoretical minimum for a stable solution.\n*   A single physical component, like a Computer-Generated Hologram (CGH), can be designed to produce multiple diffraction orders, effectively acting as multiple gratings simultaneously. However, the question is about the number of fundamental grating *functions* or *projections* required, which is the core of the physics problem.\n*   The problem is a 3D to 2D projection, which is more complex than the 2D to 1D analogy, but the fundamental requirement for angularly diverse projections to fill the object's Fourier space remains the same.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n1.  Reconstructing a volume from a single image requires a tomographic approach.\n2.  Tomography requires multiple projections from different \"angles\".\n3.  In this context, diffraction gratings provide these projections by dispersing light in different directions.\n4.  The minimum number of projections for a stable tomographic reconstruction is three.\n5.  Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is three.\n\n<<<C>>>"
