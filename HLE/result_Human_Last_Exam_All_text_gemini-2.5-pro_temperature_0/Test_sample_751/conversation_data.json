    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C using the principle of duality.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find a state transformation z(k) = T⁻¹x(k) that transforms the system into observer canonical form:\nz(k+1) = A_o z(k)\ny(k) = C_o z(k)\nwhere A_o = T⁻¹AT and C_o = CT. We need to find the value of the new matrix C_o.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Principle of Duality**\n\nThe principle of duality connects the observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ). We can find the transformation to observer canonical form by first finding the transformation that converts the dual system to controller canonical form.\n\nThe dual system is defined by:\nA_d = Aᵀ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]\nB_d = Cᵀ = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]\n\n**Step 3: Check Observability/Controllability**\n\nThe standard canonical forms are defined for single-input/single-output systems. Our system has two outputs. We must first check if the system is observable from a single output. Let's use the first row of C, denoted as C₁.\nC₁ = [0, 1, 0]\n\nThe observability matrix for the pair (A, C₁) is:\nO₁ = [C₁ᵀ, AᵀC₁ᵀ, (Aᵀ)²C₁ᵀ]ᵀ = [C₁; C₁A; C₁A²]\nC₁A = [0, 1, 0]A = [2, 1, 1]\nA² = A * A = [[3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 1], [4, 2, 2]]\nC₁A² = [0, 1, 0]A² = [4, 5, 1]\nO₁ = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [4, 5, 1]]\ndet(O₁) = 0 - 1(2 - 4) + 0 = 2 ≠ 0.\nSince the observability matrix has full rank, the system is observable from the first output alone. We can proceed using the dual of the single-output system (A, C₁), which is the single-input system (A_d, B_d1) where B_d1 = C₁ᵀ = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Transformation to Controller Canonical Form for the Dual System**\n\nWe need to find the transformation matrix Q that transforms the dual system (A_d, B_d1) into controller canonical form (A_c, B_c).\nThe transformation is z_c = Qz_d, where A_c = QA_dQ⁻¹ and B_c = QB_d1.\n\nFirst, find the characteristic polynomial of A (or A_d):\nP(λ) = det(λI - A) = λ³ - 2λ² - 3λ + 2\nThe coefficients are a₁ = -2, a₂ = -3, a₃ = 2.\n\nThe transformation matrix Q is given by Q = (W_c * M)⁻¹, where W_c is the controllability matrix of (A_d, B_d1) and M is a matrix constructed from the characteristic polynomial coefficients.\n\nW_c = [B_d1, A_d*B_d1, A_d²*B_d1] = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]\nM = [[a₂, a₁, 1], [a₁, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\n\nLet P_c = W_c * M:\nP_c = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]\nP_c = [[0, 2, 0], [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]\n\nNow, find the inverse, Q = P_c⁻¹:\ndet(P_c) = -2\nadj(P_c) = [[-1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 0], [-1, -2, 0]]\nQ = (1/-2) * adj(P_c) = [[1/2, 0, -1], [-1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 1, 0]]\n\n**Step 5: Find the Transformation for the Original System**\n\nThe transformation matrix T for the original system (to convert it to observer canonical form) is the transpose of the matrix Q found for the dual system.\nT = Qᵀ = [[1/2, -1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the New C Matrix (C_o)**\n\nThe new system matrices are given by A_o = T⁻¹AT and C_o = CT. We need to compute C_o.\nC_o = C * T\nC_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1/2, -1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]\nC_o = [[(0*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)), (0*(-1/2) + 1*0 + 0*0), (0*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0)],\n       [(1*1/2 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)), (1*(-1/2) + 1*0 + 0*0), (1*1/2 + 1*1 + 0*0)]]\nC_o = [[0, 0, 1],\n       [1/2, -1/2, 3/2]]\n\nThe first row of C_o is [0, 0, 1], which is the canonical form for the output C₁ that was used to derive the transformation. This confirms the correctness of the result.\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n[[0, 0, 1],\n [0.5, -0.5, 1.5]]\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 1], [0.5, -0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
