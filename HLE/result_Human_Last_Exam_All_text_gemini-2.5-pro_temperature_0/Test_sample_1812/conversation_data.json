    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Goal:**\nThe primary task is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix `A` given by:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context for where this matrix might arise, but it is not needed for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly defined.\n\n**2. Choose a Method for Calculating the Determinant:**\nThere are several methods to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n*   Cofactor Expansion (or Laplace Expansion)\n*   Sarrus's Rule\n*   Row/Column Operations to simplify the matrix\n\nWe will use Row/Column Operations as it is often the most efficient and reveals properties of the matrix. We can then verify the result with another method.\n\n**3. Method 1: Using Row/Column Operations**\nA property of determinants is that their value does not change if we add a multiple of one row (or column) to another row (or column).\n\n*   **Observation:** Let's examine the sum of the elements in each row:\n    *   Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 2: \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 3: \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   Since the sum of the elements in each row is zero, the columns are linearly dependent. We can show this with a column operation. Let's replace the first column (C1) with the sum of all three columns (C1 + C2 + C3).\n    \\[ C1' = C1 + C2 + C3 \\]\n*   The new first column will be:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix} 2 + (-1) + (-1) \\\\ -1 + 2 + (-1) \\\\ -1 + (-1) + 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   The matrix becomes:\n    \\[\n    A' = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    0 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    0 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    0 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   The determinant of a matrix with a column of all zeros is **0**. Therefore, \\( \\det(A) = \\det(A') = 0 \\).\n\n**4. Method 2: Verification using Cofactor Expansion**\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n\\[ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\]\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, we calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 - (-2))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(1 + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 1(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 0\n\\]\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** Do not get distracted by the term \"Markov quiver\". The problem provides the matrix `A` explicitly, so the core task is a standard linear algebra calculation.\n2.  **Sign Errors:** Be extremely careful with negative signs during calculations, especially when using the cofactor expansion method. A single sign error will lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **Linear Dependence:** Recognizing that the sum of the rows or columns is zero is a powerful shortcut. If the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) of a square matrix is zero, its determinant is always zero. This is because the vector of all ones, `[1, 1, ..., 1]`, is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 0, and the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues.\n4.  **Verification:** Whenever possible, use a second method to verify your result. This helps catch arithmetic or procedural errors.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the determinant of the given matrix is calculated to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
