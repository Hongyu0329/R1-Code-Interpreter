    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Rephrasing the integral as a Fourier Transform**\n\nThe given integral is:\n$I(a_1, ..., a_9) = \\int_{[0, 1]^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3)} dxdy$\n\nLet $a = (a_1, ..., a_9) \\in \\mathbb{R}^9$.\nLet the vector of monomials be $v(x,y)$:\n$v(x,y) = (x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3)$.\nThis vector $v(x,y)$ defines a 2-dimensional surface $S$ in $\\mathbb{R}^9$ as $(x,y)$ varies over the unit square $[0,1]^2$.\nThe integral can be written as a dot product in $\\mathbb{R}^9$:\n$I(a) = \\int_{[0, 1]^2} e^{2\\pi i a \\cdot v(x,y)} dxdy$.\n\nThis expression is the Fourier transform of a measure $\\mu$ on the surface $S$. The measure $\\mu$ is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure $dxdy$ from the square $[0,1]^2$ onto the surface $S$. We can write $I(a) = \\widehat{d\\mu}(a)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest $p$ such that $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This means we are looking for the threshold of integrability for $\\widehat{d\\mu}$.\n\n**Step 2: Applying the Theory of Fourier Transforms on Manifolds**\n\nThe $L^p$ behavior of the Fourier transform of a measure supported on a manifold is a classical topic in harmonic analysis, related to the Tomas-Stein restriction theorem. The key result states that for a measure supported on a $d$-dimensional manifold with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, its Fourier transform belongs to $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ if and only if $p > 2n/d$.\n\nIn our case:\n- The dimension of the ambient space is $n=9$.\n- The dimension of the manifold (the surface $S$) is $d=2$.\n\nIf the condition of non-vanishing Gaussian curvature is met, the critical exponent for $p$ will be $p_c = 2n/d = 2(9)/2 = 9$.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying the Curvature Condition**\n\nWe need to check if the surface $S$ parametrized by $v(x,y)$ has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature. For a $d$-dimensional manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this condition is equivalent to the linear independence of the $d$ first partial derivative vectors and the $d(d+1)/2$ second partial derivative vectors of the parametrization at every point.\n\nFor our surface $S$ with $d=2$, we need to check the linear independence of the following $2 + 2(3)/2 = 5$ vectors:\n1. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} = (1, 0, 2x, y, 0, 3x^2, 2xy, y^2, 0)$\n2. $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = (0, 1, 0, x, 2y, 0, x^2, 2xy, 3y^2)$\n3. $\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} = (0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6x, 2y, 0, 0)$\n4. $\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} = (0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2x, 6y)$\n5. $\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x \\partial y} = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2x, 2y, 0)$\n\nTo check for linear independence, we can form a $5 \\times 9$ matrix with these vectors as rows and check if its rank is 5 for all $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$. We can do this by finding a $5 \\times 5$ submatrix that is always non-singular. Let's consider the submatrix formed by columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:\n$M' = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 2x & y & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & x & 2y \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is an upper triangular matrix (after swapping rows 4 and 5). Its determinant is the product of the diagonal elements:\n$\\det(M') = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\nSince the determinant is a non-zero constant, the matrix $M'$ has rank 5 for all values of $x$ and $y$. This implies that the original set of five vectors is linearly independent for all $(x,y) \\in [0,1]^2$.\nTherefore, the surface $S$ has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature everywhere.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Critical Exponent**\n\nSince the conditions of the theorem are met, we can apply the formula for the critical exponent:\n$p_c = \\frac{2n}{d} = \\frac{2 \\times 9}{2} = 9$.\n\nThe theorem implies that $I(a) \\in L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ if and only if $p > 9$.\nThis means:\n- For $p > 9$, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ converges.\n- For $p \\le 9$, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da$ diverges.\n\nThe question asks for the largest $p$ such that the function $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This is the supremum of the set of $p$ for which $I \\notin L^p$.\nThe set is $(-\\infty, 9]$. The supremum of this set is 9.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis based on the theory of Fourier transforms on curved manifolds shows that the integrability of $I(a)$ hinges on the exponent $p=9$. For any $p \\le 9$, the function is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. The largest such value of $p$ is 9.\n\nThis can also be understood via a less rigorous stationary phase argument. For a generic choice of $a$, the phase of the integrand will have a non-degenerate critical point inside the domain of integration. For a 2D integral, this leads to a decay rate of $|a|^{-1}$ for large $|a|$. The $L^p$ norm integral behaves like $\\int |a|^{-p} dV$, where $dV$ is the volume element in $\\mathbb{R}^9$. In spherical coordinates, this is $\\int_0^\\infty (\\lambda^{-1})^p \\lambda^8 d\\lambda = \\int_0^\\infty \\lambda^{8-p} d\\lambda$. This integral diverges if the exponent $8-p \\ge -1$, which means $p \\le 9$. This confirms the result from the more rigorous theorem."
