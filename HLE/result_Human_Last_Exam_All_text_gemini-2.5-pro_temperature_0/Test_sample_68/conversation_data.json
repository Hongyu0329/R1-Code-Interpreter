    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring and the Algebraic Structure\n\nKnot coloring, in this context, refers to a specific method of labeling the arcs of a knot diagram. The labels, or \"colors,\" are taken from a finite set, which forms an algebraic structure.\n\n1.  **Knot Diagram:** A knot is represented by a 2D projection called a knot diagram, which consists of arcs and crossings.\n2.  **Coloring Rule:** At each crossing, three arcs meet: one over-arc and two under-arcs. If we label the colors of the two under-arcs as `a` and `b`, and the color of the over-arc as `c`, they must satisfy the equation:\n    `a + b ≡ 2c (mod n)`\n    or equivalently, `a + b - 2c ≡ 0 (mod n)`.\n3.  **Algebraic Structure:** The set of colors is `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`, and the operations are addition and multiplication modulo `n`. This structure is a specific type of quandle known as a **dihedral quandle** or is related to **Fox n-colorings**.\n4.  **Non-Trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered *trivial* if all arcs have the same color (e.g., `a=b=c`). A coloring is *non-trivial* if at least two different colors are used. The question asks for the smallest structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring.\n5.  **The Goal:** We need to find the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot has a non-trivial `n`-coloring. The size of the smallest algebraic structure will then be this value of `n`.\n\n### Step 2: The Knot Determinant and Colorability\n\nA fundamental theorem in knot theory connects the colorability of a knot to a value called the **knot determinant**.\n\n1.  **Theorem:** A knot `K` is `n`-colorable (i.e., admits a non-trivial coloring with `n` colors) if and only if `n` is a divisor of the knot determinant, `det(K)`.\n2.  **Knot Determinant:** The knot determinant is calculated from the knot's Alexander polynomial, `Δ_K(t)`, using the formula:\n    `det(K) = |Δ_K(-1)|`\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Knot Determinant for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nNow, we apply this theorem to the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁).\n\n1.  **Alexander Polynomial:** The Alexander polynomial for the figure-eight knot is a well-known result:\n    `Δ(t) = t⁻¹ - 3 + t`\n2.  **Evaluate at t = -1:** We substitute `t = -1` into the polynomial:\n    `Δ(-1) = (-1)⁻¹ - 3 + (-1)`\n    `Δ(-1) = -1 - 3 - 1`\n    `Δ(-1) = -5`\n3.  **Calculate the Determinant:** We take the absolute value of this result:\n    `det(K) = |-5| = 5`\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nThe knot determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5.\n\n1.  **Condition for Colorability:** According to the theorem, the figure-eight knot is `n`-colorable if and only if `n` divides 5.\n2.  **Divisors of 5:** The positive integer divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n3.  **Interpreting the Divisors:**\n    *   `n=1`: A 1-coloring uses only one color, which is always possible but is a trivial coloring.\n    *   `n=5`: A 5-coloring is possible. Since 5 is the smallest divisor greater than 1, it is the smallest value of `n` that allows for a non-trivial coloring.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot can be non-trivially colored is 5. This means the smallest algebraic structure (the set of colors) that allows for this coloring must have 5 elements. This structure is the set of integers modulo 5, `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nFor completeness, a valid 5-coloring for the four arcs of the figure-eight knot is `(0, 1, 2, 4)`.\n\nThe number of elements in this smallest structure is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
