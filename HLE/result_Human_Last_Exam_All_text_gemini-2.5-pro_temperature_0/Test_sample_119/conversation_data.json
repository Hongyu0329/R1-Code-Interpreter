    "An analysis of the position reveals that the white king on g5 is extremely exposed and vulnerable to a forced checkmate. Black can exploit this by using the coordinated power of the knight on e5, the rooks on e8 and b8, and the pawns.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the mating sequence:**\n\n1.  **Initial Position:** It is Black's turn to move. The white king is on g5, a very dangerous square. Black's knight on e5 controls key squares (f7, g4, h5, f3, d3), and the rooks on the back rank are ready to join the attack.\n\n2.  **Black's Move 1: f6+**\n    *   This is the most forcing move, a check by the f-pawn.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must analyze all of White's possible responses. The white king is attacked and must move.\n    *   The king cannot move to f5, h5, or h4 because all these squares are controlled by the black knight on e5.\n    *   Therefore, White has only one legal move.\n    *   **White's Forced Move 1: Kxg6**\n\n3.  **Black's Move 2: Re6+**\n    *   The white king is now on g6. Black continues the attack with a check from the rook on e8.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must again analyze all of White's possible responses: moving the king, blocking the check, or capturing the checking piece.\n    *   **King Moves:** The king on g6 cannot move to f5 or h5 (controlled by the knight on e5), nor can it move to f7 or h7 (controlled by the black king on h8). There are no escape squares.\n    *   **Blocking:** It is impossible to place a piece between the rook on e6 and the king on g6.\n    *   **Capturing:** The only piece that can capture the rook on e6 is the white pawn on f3.\n    *   Therefore, White again has only one legal move.\n    *   **White's Forced Move 2: fxe6**\n\n4.  **Black's Move 3: Rg8#**\n    *   After White captures the rook, the king is still on g6. Black now delivers the final blow with the other rook, moving it from b8 to g8.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must verify that this is checkmate.\n    *   The king on g6 is attacked by the rook on g8.\n    *   **King Moves:** As before, the escape squares f5 and h5 are controlled by the knight, and f7 and h7 are controlled by the black king. The king has no legal moves.\n    *   **Blocking:** The check is on the g-file. The square g7 cannot be occupied by any white piece to block the check.\n    *   **Capturing:** No white piece can capture the rook on g8.\n    *   Since the king is in check and there are no legal moves to escape the check, this is checkmate.\n\nThis sequence is a mate in 3 moves for Black, and it is the shortest possible forced mating sequence in this position.\n\n<<<f6+, Kxg6, Re6+, fxe6, Rg8#>>>"
