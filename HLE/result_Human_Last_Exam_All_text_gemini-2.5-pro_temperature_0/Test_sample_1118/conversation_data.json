    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific object in a specific painting and understand its symbolic meaning.\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n*   **Information to find:** What object is he holding, and why is it a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Research the Painting and its Context**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the painting titled *Selbstbildnis mit Zimmermannsbleistift* (Self-Portrait with Carpenter's Pencil). The historical context is crucial:\n*   In 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, and the Gestapo (Secret State Police) was established.\n*   Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and was associated with the \"New Objectivity\" art movement, which often depicted social realities critically.\n*   Due to his political affiliations, he was arrested and interrogated by the SA (the Nazi Party's original paramilitary wing, which worked alongside the Gestapo in the early days) in March 1933.\n*   After his release, he painted this self-portrait, which is considered a powerful act of defiance.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Object**\nVisual inspection of the painting and its title confirms that the object Querner holds firmly in his right hand is a **carpenter's pencil**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Symbolism of the Object**\nThe carpenter's pencil is not merely a tool of his trade; it is laden with symbolic meaning in this specific context.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Symbol of Class and Political Identity.** A carpenter's pencil is a tool of a manual laborer, a worker. Querner, coming from a working-class background and being a communist, uses the pencil to symbolize his solidarity with the proletariat. This was a direct political statement against the Nazi regime, which he viewed as an enemy of the working class.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Symbol of Artistic Defiance.** The pencil is also a drawing instrument, a fundamental tool for an artist. By holding it, Querner asserts his identity as an artist. The Nazis would soon condemn modern art like his as \"degenerate art\" (*Entartete Kunst*). Holding the pencil is a declaration that he will not be silenced and will continue to create his art, to bear witness to the truth, despite the threat of persecution.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Symbol of Unbroken Will.** The way he holds the pencil—firmly, almost like a weapon—combined with his intense, confrontational gaze directly at the viewer, signifies an unbroken spirit. It is a symbol of quiet but resolute resistance, showing that although he was imprisoned, his will and convictions remain strong.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy combining these layers of meaning, the carpenter's pencil becomes a potent symbol of political, artistic, and personal resistance against the nascent Nazi dictatorship.\n\n<<<A carpenter's pencil>>>"
