    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to an amide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, giving -C(=O)N(CH2CH3)2. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group [-N(CH3)2] is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(Et)2 group at C1 and an -N(Me)2 group at C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Deprotonation)**\n*   **Reagents:** sec-Butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF.\n*   **Function:** This combination is a very strong base system used for deprotonation, specifically for a process called Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM). sec-BuLi abstracts the most acidic proton, and TMEDA enhances its reactivity and selectivity by chelating the lithium ion.\n*   **Identifying the most acidic proton:** We need to find the site that sec-BuLi will deprotonate. The acidity of the aromatic protons is strongly influenced by the substituents.\n    *   The tertiary amide group [-C(=O)N(Et)2] is a powerful Directed Metalation Group (DMG). It directs deprotonation (lithiation) to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C6) because the carbonyl oxygen can coordinate with the lithium ion.\n    *   The dimethylamino group [-N(CH3)2] is also a strong DMG. It directs lithiation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4) because the nitrogen's lone pair can coordinate with the lithium ion.\n*   **Synergistic Effect:** The proton at position C2 is unique because it is *ortho* to both the amide group at C1 and the dimethylamino group at C3. This allows for a powerful cooperative effect where the lithium ion is chelated by both the amide oxygen and the amino nitrogen, forming a very stable six-membered ring intermediate. This chelation makes the C2 proton by far the most acidic and the kinetically favored site for deprotonation.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The reaction selectively removes the proton from C2, replacing it with lithium. The intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-lithiobenzamide.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench)**\n*   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH3I).\n*   **Function:** Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electron-deficient and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Reaction:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (effectively a carbanion at C2). This nucleophilic carbon at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction where the lithium is replaced by the methyl group, and iodide is the leaving group (forming LiI as a byproduct).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n*   The net result of the two-step sequence is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n*   The final product has the following substituents on the benzene ring:\n    *   C1: -C(=O)N(Et)2\n    *   C2: -CH3\n    *   C3: -N(Me)2\n*   The name of the resulting compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The choice of base (sec-BuLi) and the presence of a chelating agent (TMEDA) are crucial for the efficiency and selectivity of the DoM reaction.\n*   The cooperative effect of two DMGs directing to the same position is a powerful tool in organic synthesis for achieving high regioselectivity.\n*   Side reactions, such as nucleophilic attack by sec-BuLi on the amide carbonyl, are generally slow at the low temperatures typically used for these reactions (-78 Â°C) compared to the rapid, directed deprotonation.\n*   The electrophile (CH3I) is simple and unhindered, ensuring a clean substitution reaction with the aryllithium intermediate.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
