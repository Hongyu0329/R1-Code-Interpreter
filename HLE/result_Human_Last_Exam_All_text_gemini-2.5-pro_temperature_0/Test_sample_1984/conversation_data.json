    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the function governing the dynamics.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. The equation is of the form $x' = f(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at that point, i.e., $f'(x^*)$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must use another method, such as phase line analysis or analyzing higher-order derivatives.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We will use phase line analysis to determine the stability of $x=1$. We need to check the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals around $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$):\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$.\n        Since $x' < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing. This means that if we start just to the left of 1, we move away from 1.\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$):\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$.\n        Since $x' < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing. This means that if we start just to the right of 1, we move towards 1.\n\n    Because trajectories starting to the right of $x=1$ approach it, but trajectories starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is **semi-stable** (or half-stable). In the standard definition, a \"stable\" equilibrium must be stable to perturbations from all directions. Therefore, a semi-stable point is not considered stable.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points.**\nBased on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\nSo, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
