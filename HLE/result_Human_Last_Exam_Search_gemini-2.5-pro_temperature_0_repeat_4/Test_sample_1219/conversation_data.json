    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a multi-step calculation based on the properties of the tangent function is required. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Argument Reduction**: The value of tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 - nπ) for any integer *n*. By choosing *n* to be the integer part of 10^100/π, the problem becomes calculating tan(π * {10^100/π}), where {x} denotes the fractional part of *x*.\n\n2.  **Fractional Part Calculation**: The fractional part of 10^100/π can be determined by examining the decimal expansion of 1/π. Multiplying 1/π by 10^100 shifts the decimal point 100 places to the right. Thus, the fractional part of 10^100/π is equal to the decimal part of 1/π starting from the 101st digit.\n\n3.  **High-Precision Value of 1/π**: A high-precision value of 1/π is required. The digits of 1/π are known to a high degree of accuracy. The first few hundred digits are readily available from scientific sources. The decimal expansion of 1/π begins as 0.3183098861...\n\n4.  **Identifying the Necessary Digits**: To find the fractional part, we need the digits of 1/π that come after the 100th decimal place. The 101st digit of the decimal expansion of 1/π is 7, and the subsequent digits are 2, 6, 2, 4, and so on. Therefore, the fractional part of 10^100/π begins with 0.72624...\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The value to be calculated is tan(π * 0.72624...).\n    *   Multiplying this fractional part by π gives approximately 2.281588.\n    *   The tangent of 2.281588 radians is approximately -0.86833.\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 868.\n\n<<<868>>>"
