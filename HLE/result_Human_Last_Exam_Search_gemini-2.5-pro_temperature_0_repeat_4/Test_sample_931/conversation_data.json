    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, have a diet that is primarily predatory, but is also supplemented with other food sources. They have been recorded feeding on nectar, pollen, and soft-bodied arthropods like aphids.\n\nSpecifically, their diet includes:\n*   **Aphids:** Adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids and other small, soft-bodied insects. They are considered beneficial for pest control in agricultural settings, such as pear orchards.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen:** Many adult snakeflies supplement their predatory diet by feeding on nectar and pollen. Pollen has been found in the digestive tracts of snakeflies, although it is sometimes unclear if it is an essential part of their lifecycle or simply a favored food.\n\nSnakeflies are not native to New Zealand, although there was a failed attempt to introduce a North American species there in the early 20th century. Therefore, while they eat aphids and pollen in general, they would not naturally feed on species specific to New Zealand like Māhoe pollen, Karamū leaf tissue, or Totara Aphids. However, the question asks what they have been recorded feeding on by *type* of food.\n\nBased on the available food types:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Recorded as part of their diet.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** While not this specific aphid, they are well-known aphid predators.\n\nTherefore, the combination of nectar and aphids represents the recorded diet of adult snakeflies.\n\n<<<F>>>"
