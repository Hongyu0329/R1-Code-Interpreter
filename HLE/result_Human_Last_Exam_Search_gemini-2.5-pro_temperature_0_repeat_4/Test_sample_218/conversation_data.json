    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Classification of Irreps of $S_n$**: The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. For $S_{25}$, we are interested in the partitions of 25.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Dimension of an Irrep**: The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n    $dim(\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{i,j}}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook-length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook-length is the number of cells to the right of $(i,j)$ in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.\n\n3.  **Systematic Search for Partitions**: Instead of calculating the dimension for all 1,958 partitions of 25, we can focus on partitions that are likely to have small dimensions. These are the partitions whose Young diagrams are \"hook-like\", meaning they have a large first row or a large first column. Partitions that are more \"balanced\" or \"jagged\" tend to have larger dimensions.\n\n4.  **Dimension of Conjugate Partitions**: For any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram across the main diagonal) corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension. That is, $dim(\\lambda) = dim(\\lambda')$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate (i.e., $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$), then this pair contributes two irreps of the same dimension. If $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate, it contributes only one. Self-conjugate partitions of 25, such as $(13, 1^{12})$ or $(5^5)$, have dimensions far exceeding 500,000. Thus, all irreps with dimensions less than 500,000 come in pairs.\n\nWe will systematically list the partitions $\\lambda$ (and their conjugates $\\lambda'$) whose dimensions are less than 500,000. The following is a list of such partitions, grouped by the first part of the partition, along with their dimensions.\n\nHere is the list of the 29 partitions of 25 that correspond to irreducible representations with dimensions strictly less than 500,000, along with their dimensions:\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 25:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$: dimension = 1\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 24:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$: dimension = 24\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 23:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: dimension = 275\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: dimension = 276\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 22:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: dimension = 2,000\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: dimension = 4,025\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 2,024\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 21:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 4)$: dimension = 10,350\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 3, 1)$: dimension = 31,350\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 2)$: dimension = 21,000\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 2, 1, 1)$: dimension = 31,625\n    *   $\\lambda = (21, 1, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 10,626\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 20:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 5)$: dimension = 40,480\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 4, 1)$: dimension = 164,220\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 2)$: dimension = 207,000\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 3, 1, 1)$: dimension = 249,480\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 2, 1)$: dimension = 11,000\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 2, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 167,355\n    *   $\\lambda = (20, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 42,504\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 19:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: dimension = 123,970\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$: dimension = 442,750\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 4, 2)$: dimension = 480,480\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 3, 2, 1)$: dimension = 218,120\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 134,596\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 18:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: dimension = 303,600\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$: dimension = 346,104\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 17:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (17, 7, 1)$: dimension = 398,025\n    *   $\\lambda = (17, 6, 2)$: dimension = 458,850\n\n*   **Partitions with first part 16:**\n    *   $\\lambda = (16, 8, 1)$: dimension = 252,103\n\nEach of these 29 partitions has a distinct conjugate partition which corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension. For example, the conjugate of $(24,1)$ is $(2,1^{23})$, and both have dimension 24. Since none of these 29 partitions are self-conjugate, each gives rise to a pair of irreps with the same dimension.\n\nTherefore, the total number of irreducible representations with a dimension strictly less than 500,000 is $29 \\times 2 = 58$.\n\n<<<58>>>"
