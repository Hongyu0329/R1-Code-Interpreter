    "An island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name is Hanga Roa.\n\nHanga Roa is the main town and capital of Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, and the town is situated on the bay of the same name.\n\nEaster Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, with the nearest inhabited land, Pitcairn Island, located over 1,900 kilometers away. The island's landscape is of volcanic origin, characterized by three extinct volcanoes. One of these, Rano Kau, has a large crater lake and is located near Hanga Roa. The town itself is nestled in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. While not situated directly inside a caldera, the bay's formation is a direct result of the island's volcanic geography, and the town lies on a bay that shares its name.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
