    "To date, the human let-7 family of microRNAs consists of several members, with the exact number varying depending on whether one is referring to the mature microRNA sequences or the genomic loci that encode them.\n\nIn humans, there are typically considered to be **10 unique mature let-7 family members**. These include:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nThese mature microRNAs are encoded by a larger number of genes. It has been identified that there are **12 to 13 precursor genes** for the let-7 family in humans. This is because some of the mature let-7 sequences are produced from multiple distinct genomic loci. For example, the mature let-7a is encoded by three different genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3), and mature let-7f is encoded by two genes (let-7f-1 and let-7f-2).\n\nSome sources may cite 9 mature let-7 miRNAs, which are encoded by 12 different genomic loci. The discrepancy in the count of mature members often revolves around the inclusion of miR-202 in the let-7 family. Nevertheless, a significant body of scientific literature supports the count of 10 distinct mature sequences.\n\n<<<10>>>"
