    "I have performed a Google search and have gathered some initial information about \"order type\" and \"lexicographical order\". The search results provide definitions and examples of lexicographical ordering for strings. They also touch upon the concept of order type and provide examples like ω for the natural numbers and η for the rational numbers. One result discusses the order type of infinite sequences over a finite alphabet, which is more complex than the current question about finite strings. Another result mentions that the set of all finite-length sequences of natural numbers is countable. There is also a discussion about the order type of finite sequences of natural numbers, with a suggestion of ω^ω.\n\nHowever, none of the results directly state the order type of the set of *finite* strings of characters from a finite alphabet, ordered lexicographically. I need to synthesize the information and likely map the set of finite strings to a known ordered set.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  Represent the finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} as numbers in a specific base.\n2.  Analyze the structure of this set of numbers when ordered naturally.\n3.  Relate this structure to known order types.\n4.  Formulate the final answer based on this analysis.\n\nI believe I have enough information to proceed with the reasoning and don't need further searches at this moment.\n\nThe user wants to know the order type of the set of finite strings of characters from the alphabet {a, b, c, d} ordered lexicographically.\n\nFirst, let's establish the ordering of the alphabet. Let a < b < c < d.\n\nThe set of finite strings includes the empty string, strings of length 1, strings of length 2, and so on. Let's denote the set of strings as S.\n\nThe lexicographical order on S is defined as follows: for two strings s1 and s2, s1 < s2 if s1 is a proper prefix of s2, or at the first position where they differ, the character in s1 is smaller than the character in s2. For example, \"a\" < \"ab\", and \"ac\" < \"ad\".\n\nLet's analyze the structure of this ordered set.\n- The empty string is the smallest element.\n- Then come the strings of length 1: a, b, c, d.\n- Then strings of length 2: aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, bb, bc, bd, ...\n- And so on.\n\nThis ordering is not a well-ordering because there are infinite descending chains. For example, \"b\" > \"ab\" > \"aab\" > \"aaab\" > ... is not a feature of standard lexicographical ordering. In standard lexicographical order, a shorter string comes before a longer string if the shorter one is a prefix of the longer one. For example, \"a\" < \"aa\". Let's re-verify the definition of lexicographical order.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, for strings of different lengths, the shorter string is a prefix of the longer one, the shorter one comes first. For example, \"cat\" < \"caterpillar\". If they are not prefixes, the comparison is based on the first differing character. For example, \"cat\" < \"dog\".\n\nLet's list the beginning of the ordered set of strings from {a, b, c, d}:\nε (the empty string)\na\naa\naaa\n... (an infinite sequence of strings starting with 'a')\n...\naab\n...\naac\n...\naad\n...\nab\n...\nac\n...\nad\n...\nb\n...\nc\n...\nd\n...\n\nThis structure is dense. Between any two strings, we can often find another. For example, between \"b\" and \"c\", we have all the strings that start with \"b\" and have at least one more character, like \"ba\", \"bb\", etc.\n\nLet's try to map these strings to numbers to understand the order type. We can treat the strings as representations of numbers in base 5 (since we have 4 characters, let's map them to digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and use 0 for something else, or simply use base 4).\n\nLet's map a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3, d -> 4.\nA string s = c_k ... c_1 c_0 can be mapped to a number in base 5. For instance, we can think of these as the fractional part of a number.\n- \"a\" -> 0.1\n- \"b\" -> 0.2\n- \"c\" -> 0.3\n- \"d\" -> 0.4\n- \"aa\" -> 0.11\n- \"ab\" -> 0.12\n- \"ba\" -> 0.21\n\nLexicographical order on the strings corresponds to the natural order of these base-5 numbers.\nThe set of all finite strings corresponds to the set of all terminating base-5 decimals in the interval (0, 1). This is a subset of the rational numbers.\n\nThe set of all terminating base-k decimals is a countable, dense, linearly ordered set without a greatest or least element (if we don't consider the empty string). If we include the empty string as the very first element, it is a countable, dense linear order with a least element but no greatest element.\n\nThe order type of the rational numbers is denoted by η. The set of rational numbers in (0, 1) also has order type η. The set of terminating base-5 decimals in (0, 1) is also order-isomorphic to the rational numbers.\n\nLet's verify this. Any countable, dense, linearly ordered set without endpoints is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers (Cantor's isomorphism theorem). Our set of non-empty finite strings is:\n-   **Countable:** We have a finite number of strings of any given length n (4^n). The total number of strings is the countable union of finite sets, which is countable.\n-   **Linearly ordered:** Lexicographical order provides a total order.\n-   **Dense:** Between any two distinct strings s1 and s2, we can find another string s3 such that s1 < s3 < s2. For example, let s1 = \"b\" and s2 = \"c\". We can find \"ba\", \"bb\", etc. such that \"b\" < \"ba\" < \"c\". Let s1 = \"ba\" and s2 = \"bb\". We can find \"baa\" such that \"ba\" < \"baa\" < \"bb\". This holds generally. If s1 is not a prefix of s2, let s1 = p + c1 + r1 and s2 = p + c2 + r2 where p is the longest common prefix and c1 < c2. Then s1 < p + c1 + 'a' < s2. If s1 is a prefix of s2, say s2 = s1 + r, then s1 < s1 + 'a' < s2 as long as r is not just 'a's. If s2 = s1 + 'a...a', we can still find an intermediate string. For example, between \"b\" and \"ba\", there is no string. So it's not dense everywhere.\n\nLet's re-examine the density.\nConsider the strings \"b\" and \"ba\". Is there a string s such that \"b\" < s < \"ba\"? No. Because any string starting with \"b\" that is longer than \"b\" comes after \"b\". And any string that comes after \"b\" must either start with a character greater than 'b' (like 'c') or start with 'b' and be longer. If it starts with 'b' and is longer, the shortest such strings are \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\", \"bd\". So \"ba\" is the immediate successor of \"b\" in a sense, if we only consider strings starting with 'b'. But what about strings not starting with 'b'?\nThe order is:\n...\na... (all strings starting with a)\nb\nba\nbaa\n...\nbab\n...\nbb\n...\nc\n...\n\nThe string \"b\" has an immediate successor, which is \"ba\". This means the order is not dense.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure.\nWe have groups of strings based on their first letter.\nAll strings starting with 'a', followed by all strings starting with 'b', and so on.\nThe set of all strings is {ε} U S_a U S_b U S_c U S_d, where S_x is the set of strings starting with x.\nThe order is ε < S_a < S_b < S_c < S_d.\nWithin S_a, we have \"a\" followed by strings \"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ad\", etc.\nSo, S_a = {\"a\"} U S_aa U S_ab U S_ac U S_ad.\nThis has a recursive structure.\n\nLet's map the alphabet {a, b, c, d} to {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nA finite string of these characters can be seen as the sequence of coefficients of a polynomial in ω.\nLet the order type of the set of finite strings over an alphabet of size n be τ_n.\nThe set of strings is the union of strings of length 0, 1, 2, ...\nLength 0: ε (1 element)\nLength 1: a, b, c, d (4 elements)\nLength 2: aa, ab, ..., dd (16 elements)\nLength k: 4^k elements.\n\nThe set of all finite strings is ordered lexicographically. Let's consider the structure again.\nε\na\naa\naaa\n... (this is a sequence of type ω)\naaab\naaac\naaad\naab\naaba\n...\nThis looks like a tree, where the nodes are the strings, and the lexicographical order corresponds to a depth-first traversal.\n\nLet's consider the mapping to ordinals.\nLet's map the alphabet {a, b, c, d} to the natural numbers {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nA finite sequence of these numbers (s_k, ..., s_1) can be mapped to an ordinal number using a base-ω representation.\nA string s = c_k c_{k-1} ... c_0 is mapped to the ordinal ω^k * code(c_k) + ... + ω * code(c_1) + code(c_0).\nLet's check if this preserves the order.\n\"a\" -> 0\n\"b\" -> 1\n\"aa\" -> ω*0 + 0 = 0. This mapping is not right.\n\nLet's try another approach.\nConsider the set of strings as a tree. The root is the empty string. The children of a node `s` are the strings `sa`, `sb`, `sc`, `sd`.\nThe lexicographical order is a pre-order traversal of this tree.\nε, a, aa, aaa, ..., aab, ..., ab, ..., b, ba, ...\n\nLet's analyze the order type of this tree.\nThe string 'a' is followed by all strings starting with 'a'. This substructure is isomorphic to the whole structure.\nLet τ be the order type.\nThe set is {ε} U {strings starting with a} U {strings starting with b} U {strings starting with c} U {strings starting with d}.\nThe order type is 1 + τ + τ + τ + τ = 1 + 4τ.\nSo we are looking for an ordinal τ that satisfies τ = 1 + 4τ.\nIf τ is an infinite ordinal, then 1 + 4τ = 4τ.\nSo we need to solve τ = 4τ. This doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure. It's not just a sum of order types.\nAfter all strings starting with 'a', we have 'b'.\nSo the order is more like:\n(strings starting with a) followed by (strings starting with b) ...\nLet τ be the order type of the set of all finite strings.\nThe set of all strings starting with 'a' is of the form \"a\" + s, where s is any finite string. This set is order-isomorphic to τ.\nSo we have:\nε\na followed by (strings starting with aa, ab, ac, ad)\nb followed by (strings starting with ba, bb, bc, bd)\n...\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for a known result.\n\nA search for \"order type of finite strings lexicographically\" leads to discussions of ω^ω.\nLet's see if this makes sense.\nThe set of finite sequences of natural numbers can be ordered by length first, and then lexicographically.\nLength 0: () - 1 element\nLength 1: (0), (1), (2), ... - order type ω\nLength 2: (0,0), (0,1), ..., (1,0), (1,1), ... - order type ω^2\nLength 3: order type ω^3\nThe order type of all finite sequences of natural numbers, ordered by length and then lexicographically, is ω + ω^2 + ω^3 + ... = ω^ω.\n\nHowever, the question is about pure lexicographical order, not length-first.\nIn lexicographical order, \"b\" comes after \"aaaa...\".\nLet's map our strings to numbers in a different way.\nLet the alphabet be {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nA string can be seen as a number in base 4, but with a twist.\nLet's map the strings to the interval.\na -> 0.1 (base 4) = 1/4\nb -> 0.2 (base 4) = 2/4\nc -> 0.3 (base 4) = 3/4\nd -> 0.4... wait, base 4 is {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nLet a->0, b->1, c->2, d->3.\n\"a\" -> 0.1 (base 4) = 1/4\n\"b\" -> 0.2 (base 4) = 2/4\n\"c\" -> 0.3 (base 4) = 3/4\n\"d\" -> ??? There is no 'd'. Let's use base 5.\na->1, b->2, c->3, d->4.\n\"a\" -> 0.1 (base 5) = 1/5\n\"aa\" -> 0.11 (base 5) = 1/5 + 1/25 = 6/25\n\"ab\" -> 0.12 (base 5) = 1/5 + 2/25 = 7/25\n\"b\" -> 0.2 (base 5) = 2/5 = 10/25\nThe lexicographical order of strings corresponds to the numerical order of their base-5 representations.\nThe set of all finite strings corresponds to the set of all rational numbers in (0, 1) that have a finite base-5 expansion.\nThis is a countable dense linear order without endpoints (if we exclude the empty string).\nLet's check density again. Between \"a\" (0.1) and \"b\" (0.2), we have \"aa\" (0.11), \"ab\" (0.12), etc.\nBetween \"a\" (0.1) and \"aa\" (0.11), there is no string. No, \"a\" is not 0.1. \"a\" is a string. \"aa\" is another string.\nIn lexicographical order, \"a\" < \"aa\".\nLet's map \"s\" to the number 1.s (base 5).\n\"a\" -> 1.1 (base 5) = 1 + 1/5 = 6/5\n\"aa\" -> 1.11 (base 5) = 1 + 1/5 + 1/25 = 31/25\n\"b\" -> 1.2 (base 5) = 1 + 2/5 = 7/5\nThis preserves the order.\nThe set of all finite strings is mapped to a subset of the rational numbers.\nThis subset is countable, linearly ordered. Is it dense?\nBetween any two such numbers, is there another?\nLet x1 and x2 be the numbers corresponding to strings s1 and s2, with x1 < x2.\nLet s1 = \"a\" (x1 = 1.1) and s2 = \"b\" (x2 = 1.2). The string \"aa\" gives x3 = 1.11. We have 1.1 < 1.11 < 1.2. So x1 < x3 < x2.\nLet s1 = \"a\" and s2 = \"aa\". x1 = 1.1, x2 = 1.11. Is there a string s3 such that \"a\" < s3 < \"aa\"? No.\nA string is either \"a\" or not. If it's longer and starts with \"a\", the shortest is \"aa\". If it's different, it's not between.\nSo, the order is not dense. There are immediate successors. The successor of \"s\" is \"sa\".\n\nLet's reconsider the structure as a tree.\nThe set of nodes is the set of finite strings.\nThe tree is ordered by lexicographical order of the nodes.\nThis is equivalent to ordering the nodes in a depth-first, pre-order traversal.\nLet's consider the alphabet {0, 1}.\nε, 0, 00, 000, ..., 001, ..., 01, 010, ..., 1, 10, ...\nThis is a countable set.\nLet's consider the order type.\nIt starts with an ω-sequence: 0, 00, 000, ...\nWhat comes after all of these? Nothing. This is not correct.\nLexicographical order:\nε < 0 < 00 < 000 < ...\nThis is not the standard lexicographical order.\nStandard lexicographical order (as in a dictionary):\nA shorter word comes before a longer word if it is a prefix.\n\"a\" < \"aa\"\n\"b\" > \"aa\" is wrong. \"aa\" < \"b\".\n\nLet's fix the ordering.\nAlphabet {a, b, c, d} with a<b<c<d.\nThe empty string ε is the smallest element.\nThen come strings of length 1: a, b, c, d.\nThen strings of length 2: aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ...\nThis is ordering by length first, then lexicographically. This is called \"shortlex order\".\nIf this is the case, the order type is the sum of the number of strings of each length.\nLength 0: 1\nLength 1: 4\nLength 2: 16\n...\nLength n: 4^n\nThe order type would be 1 + 4 + 16 + ... = sum_{n=0 to infinity} 4^n. This is not an ordinal. This is the cardinality.\nThe order type is ω. We have a countably infinite set arranged in a single sequence.\nLet's list them: ε, a, b, c, d, aa, ab, ac, ad, ba, ...\nThis is a simple ω-ordering.\n\nHowever, the standard definition of \"lexicographical order\" is not shortlex.\nLexicographical order:\nGiven s1, s2. Find the first position i where they differ. If s1[i] < s2[i], then s1 < s2. If one is a prefix of the other, the prefix is smaller.\nExample: \"a\" < \"b\", \"aa\" < \"ab\".\n\"a\" < \"b\" because at the first position, 'a' < 'b'.\n\"ab\" < \"b\" is false. \"ab\" and \"b\". First position: 'a' < 'b'. So \"ab\" < \"b\". This is not what dictionaries do.\n\nLet's clarify the lexicographical order definition.\nFrom Wikipedia: \"Given two different words of the same length... the order depends on the alphabetic order of the symbols in the first place i where the two words differ\".\n\"To compare words of different lengths, a common convention is to consider that the shorter word is padded at the end with 'blanks' that are smaller than any symbol in the alphabet.\"\nUnder this convention: \"cat\" vs \"caterpillar\". \"cat\" is padded to \"cat    \" which is smaller than \"caterpillar\" because blank < 'e'.\nSo, shorter words come first only if they are prefixes of longer words.\nNo, that's not what it says.\n\"cat\" vs \"catch\". \"cat\" is padded to \"cat  \". ' ' < 'c'. So \"cat\" < \"catch\".\n\"catch\" vs \"caterpillar\". \"catch\" vs \"cater\". 'c'='c', 'a'='a', 't'='t'. Then 'c' vs 'e'. 'c' < 'e'. So \"catch\" < \"caterpillar\".\n\nLet's use this rule. Let the blank be smaller than 'a'.\nThe set of strings is S = {finite strings of a,b,c,d}.\nLet's compare \"b\" and \"aa\".\n\"b\" is padded to \"b \". \"aa\" is not padded.\nCompare \"b \" and \"aa\". First char: 'b' > 'a'. So \"b\" > \"aa\".\nThis seems to be the standard.\n\nSo the order is:\n(empty string)\na\naa\naaa\n...\naaab\n...\naab\n...\nab\n...\nac\n...\nad\n...\nb\nba\n...\nThis is the structure I had initially.\n\nLet's try to map this to a known ordered set.\nThis is a countable linear ordering.\nIt has a first element (the empty string).\nIt is not dense (e.g., 'aa' is the immediate successor of 'a').\nIt has no last element.\nIt contains copies of ω (e.g., a, aa, aaa, ...).\nIt also contains copies of ω* (the reverse of ω). For example, consider the sequence approaching \"b\":\n... < ab...bd < ab...be < ... < ac < b\nNo, that's not right.\n\nLet's consider the set of strings as a 4-ary tree (each node has 4 children). The strings are the nodes. The lexicographical order is the pre-order traversal of this tree.\nThe empty string is the root.\nThe children of the root are a, b, c, d.\nThe children of 'a' are 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ad'.\nThe pre-order traversal gives: ε, a, aa, ..., ab, ..., ac, ..., ad, ..., b, ba, ...\n\nLet τ be the order type.\nτ = 1 (for ε) + (order type of subtree at a) + (order type of subtree at b) + ...\nThe subtree at 'a' consists of all strings starting with 'a'. The set of these strings is { 'a's | s in S }. This set is order isomorphic to S itself.\nSo, if τ is the order type of S, then the order type of the subtree at 'a' is also τ.\nSo, τ = 1 + τ + τ + τ + τ = 1 + 4τ.\nThis is an equation for ordinals.\nIf τ is an infinite ordinal, 1 + τ = τ.\nSo τ = 4τ = τ + τ + τ + τ.\nWhich infinite ordinals satisfy this?\nLet τ = ω. Then 4ω = ω+ω+ω+ω > ω.\nLet τ = ω^2. Then 4 * ω^2 = ω^2 + ω^2 + ω^2 + ω^2 > ω^2.\nLet τ = ω^ω. Then 4 * ω^ω = ω^ω. No, this is not true for ordinals.\nFor ordinals α, β > 0, αβ >= α+β.\nFor ordinals, if β >= 1, αβ >= α.\nIf α is an infinite ordinal, 1+α = α.\nIf α is an ordinal, n * α is the sum of n copies of α.\nLet's try to construct the order.\nIt starts with 1 (for ε).\nThen the 'a' subtree. This starts with 'a' (1), and then its own subtrees.\nSo the type is 1 + (1 + τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d) + (1 + ...)\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet's try the mapping to numbers again, but more carefully.\nMap the alphabet {a, b, c, d} to {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nA string s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k is mapped to the number 0.c_1 c_2 ... c_k in base 4. No, base 5 to avoid ambiguity.\nLet a->1, b->2, c->3, d->4.\ns = c_1 ... c_k -> sum_{i=1 to k} code(c_i) / 5^i.\n\"a\" -> 1/5\n\"b\" -> 2/5\n\"aa\" -> 1/5 + 1/25 = 6/25\n\"ab\" -> 1/5 + 2/25 = 7/25\n\"b\" -> 2/5 = 10/25\nOrder: \"a\" (0.2) < \"aa\" (0.24) < \"ab\" (0.28) < \"b\" (0.4). This works.\nThe set of all finite strings is mapped to the set of all rational numbers in (0, 1) which have a finite expansion in base 5, and only use digits {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nLet's call this set Q_5.\nWhat is the order type of Q_5?\nIt is a countable, linearly ordered set.\nIs it dense? Yes. Between any two such numbers, say x < y, we can find another.\nLet x = 0.c_1...c_k and y = 0.d_1...d_m.\nIf they have different first digits, e.g., x=0.1... and y=0.2..., then z=0.11... is between them.\nIf they have a common prefix, x = 0.p c_i ... and y = 0.p d_i ..., with c_i < d_i.\nThen z = 0.p c_i 1... is between x and y.\nSo the set is dense.\nIt is countable.\nIt has no least element (0.1, 0.11, 0.111, ... is a decreasing sequence).\nIt has no greatest element (0.4, 0.44, 0.444, ... is an increasing sequence).\nBy Cantor's isomorphism theorem, any countable, dense, linearly ordered set without endpoints is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers, Q.\nThe order type of Q is denoted by η.\n\nWhat about the empty string?\nThe empty string ε is the smallest element.\nSo the full set is {ε} U {non-empty strings}.\nThe order type is 1 + η.\n\nLet's double check the lexicographical ordering.\nThe most common definition in computer science and mathematics for general strings (not just in dictionaries for natural language) is that s1 < s2 if s1 is a prefix of s2, or at the first differing character, the character in s1 is smaller.\nExample: \"a\" < \"aa\".\n\"aa\" < \"ab\".\n\"ab\" < \"b\". This is the part I'm unsure about.\nLet's check this specific comparison.\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"b\".\nFirst character of s1 is 'a'. First character of s2 is 'b'.\nSince 'a' < 'b', then \"ab\" < \"b\".\nThis seems to be the standard for string comparison in programming, for example.\n\nSo the order is:\na\naa\naaa\n...\naab\n...\nab\naba\n...\nac\n...\nb\nba\n...\n\nThis is different from the \"blank padding\" version.\nLet's analyze this order.\nLet's map the strings to a tree again.\nRoot = empty string (not in this set for now).\nChildren of the root are a, b, c, d.\nChildren of a node `s` are `sa`, `sb`, `sc`, `sd`.\nThe set of all non-empty strings is the set of all nodes in this 4-ary tree.\nThe ordering is NOT a pre-order traversal.\nLet's list some elements:\na, aa, ab, ac, ad, b, ba, bb, bc, bd, c, ...\nThis is a different order.\nLet's compare \"ad\" and \"b\". 'a' < 'b', so \"ad\" < \"b\".\nThe set is ordered by the first letter. All strings starting with 'a' come before all strings starting with 'b'.\nSo the total order is (strings starting with a) < (strings starting with b) < (strings starting with c) < (strings starting with d).\nLet τ be the order type of the set of all non-empty finite strings.\nLet τ_x be the order type of the set of strings starting with character x.\nτ = τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d.\nWhat is the structure of τ_a?\nIt's the set {\"a\"s' | s' is any finite string (including empty)}.\nThe order is \"a\" < \"aa\" < \"aab\" ...\nLet s1' and s2' be two strings. Then \"a\"s1' < \"a\"s2' if and only if s1' < s2'.\nSo the set of strings starting with 'a' is order-isomorphic to the set of all finite strings (if we allow the empty string to be mapped to \"a\").\nLet τ_full be the order type of the set of ALL finite strings (including empty).\nThen τ_a is order-isomorphic to τ_full.\nSo τ_full = 1 (for empty string) + τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d.\nτ_full = 1 + τ_full + τ_full + τ_full + τ_full = 1 + 4 * τ_full.\nAgain, this ordinal equation has no solution for τ_full being an ordinal.\n\nThis suggests that the set is not well-ordered, and thus its order type is not an ordinal. This is correct, as \"b\" > \"ab\" > \"aab\" > ... is not a valid comparison in this ordering. \"ab\" < \"b\".\nLet's re-verify the lexicographical order definition.\nFrom: \"Given two different words... a = a1a2...ak and b = b1b2...bk, the order... depends on the alphabetic order of the symbols in the first place i where the two words differ\". This is for same-length words.\nFor different lengths: \"This is sometimes called shortlex order... A more common convention for different-length words is to compare them by padding the shorter with a value smaller than any character... this is the order used in dictionaries\". This is the one I analyzed that gives 1+η.\n\nLet's call this \"dictionary order\".\nThe other one, where prefixes come first, is often just called \"lexicographical order\" in formal language theory.\nLet's assume the user means the standard dictionary-like order.\nThe set of finite strings over {a,b,c,d} is mapped to the set of terminating base-5 rationals in (0,1) using digits {1,2,3,4}.\nThis set is Q_5' = { sum_{i=1 to k} c_i / 5^i | k in N, c_i in {1,2,3,4} }.\nThis is a countable dense linear order.\nIt is bounded. For example, all elements are between 0.1 (base 5) = 0.2 and 0.444... (base 5) = 1.\nThe number 0.1 (base 5) corresponds to \"a\". Is there a smallest element? No, \"a\" > \"aa\" > \"aaa\" is not true in this order.\n\"a\" (0.2) < \"aa\" (0.24).\nSmallest element: Is there one? Consider the sequence \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", ... The corresponding numbers are 0.2, 0.24, 0.248, ... This is an increasing sequence.\nWhat about \"a\", \"a...a\" (k times)? The number is sum_{i=1 to k} 1/5^i. This sequence converges to 1/4.\nWhat about the sequence of strings: d, cd, ccd, cccd, ...? This is not how lexicographical order works.\n\nLet's restart with the structure, assuming \"dictionary order\" (shorter padded with blanks).\nOrder: aa < a, ab < a, b > a.\nNo, that's not right.\n\"a\" vs \"aa\". Pad \"a\" to \"a \". ' ' < 'a'. So \"a\" < \"aa\".\n\"a\" vs \"b\". 'a' < 'b'. So \"a\" < \"b\".\n\"aa\" vs \"b\". 'a' < 'b'. So \"aa\" < \"b\".\n\"b\" vs \"aa\". 'b' > 'a'. So \"b\" > \"aa\". This is consistent.\n\nSo the order is:\n(empty string)\na\naa\naaa\n...\naab\n...\naac\n...\naad\n...\nab\naba\n...\nThis is the pre-order traversal of the 4-ary tree.\nLet's call this order type τ.\nτ = 1 (for ε) + τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d\nwhere τ_x is the order type of the subtree of strings starting with x.\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is {a} U {as | s is a non-empty string}.\nThe order within τ_a is: a, aa, aaa, ..., aab, ..., ab, ...\nThis set {as | s is a non-empty string} is order isomorphic to the set of all non-empty strings.\nLet τ_ne be the order type of non-empty strings.\nτ_a = 1 + τ_ne.\nτ_ne = τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d = 4 * (1 + τ_ne).\nτ_ne = 4 + 4*τ_ne.\nThis still leads to a weird equation.\n\nLet's think about what this set looks like.\nIt's a set of points.\nLet's map the strings to the real line.\nLet the alphabet be {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nMap the string s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k to a point in.\nThis is like the construction of the Cantor set, but we are not removing the middle part.\nLet's divide into 5 intervals: [0,1), [1,2), [2,3), [3,4), [4,5).\nMap ε to the interval.\nMap 'a' to [0,1), 'b' to [1,2), 'c' to [2,3), 'd' to [3,4). The last interval [4,5) is for strings that are \"successors\".\nThis seems too complex.\n\nLet's go back to the mapping to rationals.\nThe set of finite strings over {a,b,c,d} ordered lexicographically (where prefix < extension, e.g., \"a\" < \"aa\").\nThis is the set S = {a,b,c,d}*.\nLet's map each string to a rational number in (0,1).\nLet's use base 4. Alphabet {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nMap string s = d_1 d_2 ... d_k to the number x_s = sum_{i=1 to k} (d_i / 4^i) + 1/4^{k+1}.\nThis doesn't quite work.\n\nLet's consider the set of \"dyadic rationals\" in the context of a 4-adic or 5-adic system.\nThe set of finite binary strings ordered lexicographically is order-isomorphic to the set of dyadic rationals in [0,1). A dyadic rational is a number of the form m/2^n.\nA binary string s = b_1...b_n is mapped to the number sum_{i=1 to n} b_i / 2^i.\nExample: \"0\" -> 0/2 = 0. \"1\" -> 1/2. \"01\" -> 0/2 + 1/4 = 1/4. \"10\" -> 1/2 + 0/4 = 1/2.\nThis doesn't preserve order. \"1\" > \"01\", but 1/2 > 1/4.\nA different mapping is needed.\nMap binary string s to sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i+1) / 3^i. (using base 3 for digits 1, 2).\nThis still has issues.\n\nLet's look at the structure again.\nS = {ε, a, b, c, d, aa, ab, ...}\nOrder: ε < a < aa < ab < ... < b < ba < ...\nThis is NOT lexicographical order. This is shortlex.\nIf the user meant shortlex, the answer is ω. It's a single infinite sequence.\n\nIf the user meant lexicographical order, the order is:\nε < a < aa < aaa < ...\n... < aab < ...\n... < ab < ...\n... < b < ...\nThis is the pre-order traversal of the infinite 4-ary tree.\nThis order type is not an ordinal, because it's not well-ordered. For example, the set {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...} has no least element in some definitions of lexicographical order.\nLet's re-read the search results carefully.\n mentions: \"It is not true that the set of all finite words is well-ordered; for example, the infinite set of words {b, ab, aab, aaab, ... } has no lexicographically earliest element.\"\nThis is for the lexicographical order where shorter strings are padded with a character LARGER than any alphabet character.\nLet's assume the standard computer science definition: prefix is smaller.\n\"a\" < \"aa\".\n\"aa\" < \"ab\".\n\"ab\" < \"b\" is FALSE. 'a' < 'b'. So \"ab\" < \"b\".\nWait, my reasoning is circular.\nLet's compare \"ab\" and \"b\" step-by-step.\ns1 = \"ab\", s2 = \"b\".\nCompare first characters: 'a' vs 'b'. 'a' < 'b'.\nTherefore, \"ab\" < \"b\".\nThis is the definition used in `strcmp` in C, `String.compareTo` in Java, etc.\n\nSo the order is:\nAll strings starting with 'a'.\nThen all strings starting with 'b'.\n...\nLet's analyze the set of strings starting with 'a', let's call it S_a.\nS_a = {a, aa, ab, ac, ad, aaa, aab, ...}\nThe first element is \"a\".\nThe elements after \"a\" are all strings of the form \"a\" + s, where s is a non-empty string from the original alphabet.\nLet τ be the order type of the set of all non-empty finite strings.\nThe order type of S_a is 1 + τ.\nThe order type of the set of all non-empty strings is τ = τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d.\nτ = (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ) = 4 + 4τ.\nThis is an equation for order types (not necessarily ordinals).\nLet's think about this order type.\nIt consists of 4 blocks, each of type (1+τ).\nLet's consider the alphabet {a}.\nThe strings are a, aa, aaa, ... This is order type ω.\nHere τ = 1 + τ. This is true for any τ >= ω.\nFor a 1-letter alphabet, τ = ω.\nLet's check the equation: ω = 1 + ω. This is correct.\n\nNow for a 2-letter alphabet {a, b}.\nτ = (1+τ) + (1+τ) = 2 + 2τ.\nWhat order type satisfies this?\nLet's write it out:\na, aa, aaa, ..., ab, aba, ..., b, ba, baa, ..., bb, ...\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is of type 1+τ.\nThe set of strings starting with 'b' is of type 1+τ.\nThe total is (1+τ) + (1+τ).\nLet's try to identify this with something known.\nConsider the set of polynomials in x with natural number coefficients.\nP(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0.\nThis is related to ordinals in Cantor normal form.\nAny ordinal α can be written as ω^β_1 * c_1 + ... + ω^β_k * c_k.\n\nLet's try to construct the order type for the 2-letter alphabet {a,b}.\nThe set of strings starting with 'a' is {a} followed by {as | s is non-empty}.\nThis is 1 + τ.\nThe set of strings starting with 'b' is {b} followed by {bs | s is non-empty}.\nThis is 1 + τ.\nSo τ = (1+τ) + (1+τ).\nLet's consider the structure of τ. It is composed of two copies of something.\nLet's look at the strings in base 2. a=0, b=1.\n0, 00, 01, 1, 10, 11. (shortlex) -> ω\nLexicographical:\n0\n00\n000\n...\n001\n...\n01\n010\n...\n011\n...\n1\n10\n...\n11\n...\nThis is the set of nodes of an infinite binary tree, ordered by pre-order traversal.\nLet's denote this order type by τ_2.\nτ_2 = (1+τ_2) + (1+τ_2). No, this is the type of non-empty strings.\nLet τ_2 be the type of all strings (including empty).\nτ_2 = 1 + τ_2 + τ_2 = 1 + 2*τ_2.\nThis is the order type of the set of rational numbers of the form m/2^n in [0,1), but with a specific arrangement.\n\nLet's consider the mapping s -> x_s into [0, 2).\nMap string s=c_1...c_k to sum_{i=1 to k} c_i / 2^i. (a=0, b=1).\n\"0\" -> 0.\n\"1\" -> 1/2.\n\"01\" -> 1/4.\n\"10\" -> 1/2.\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet's try to map to the interval.\nMap string s to an interval.\nε ->\na -> [0, 1/2], b -> [1/2, 1]\naa -> [0, 1/4], ab -> [1/4, 1/2]\nba -> [1/2, 3/4], bb -> [3/4, 1]\nThe lexicographical order of the strings corresponds to the ordering of the left endpoints of these intervals.\nThe set of left endpoints for alphabet {a,b} is { m/2^n | n>=1, 0 <= m < 2^n }.\nThese are the dyadic rationals in [0,1).\nThe order type of the dyadic rationals in [0,1) is η, the order type of the rationals.\nLet's verify.\nThe set is countable, dense, and has a least element (0, from \"a\", \"aa\", ...) but no greatest.\nWait, the set of left endpoints is {0, 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, ...}.\nLet's list them in order:\n0 (from a)\n1/8 (from aaa)\n1/4 (from aa)\n3/8 (from aab)\n... this is not η. η is dense. This set is not dense. 1/4 is the successor of 3/8 in some sense. No.\n\nLet's reconsider the tree traversal.\nThe order type is that of the nodes of the infinite 4-ary tree in pre-order.\nLet's denote the order type for a k-ary tree by τ_k.\nτ_1 = ω.\nτ_2 is the order on the binary tree.\nIt starts with the left-most branch: ε, a, aa, aaa, ... (ω)\nThen the next node in the traversal is 'ab'.\nThen the subtree at 'ab': 'aba', 'abaa', ...\nThis structure is self-similar.\nThe order type is given by the ordinal ε_0 = ω^(ω^(ω^...)) = sup{ω, ω^ω, ω^ω^ω, ...}. No, this is for something else.\n\nLet's try to find a source that names this specific order type.\nA search for \"order type of infinite tree preorder\" might help.\nThe order type of the set of finite sequences of natural numbers under lexicographical ordering is ω^ω. This is from a source, but it's for sequences of naturals, not a finite alphabet.\nLet's see if it applies here.\nLet the alphabet be {0, 1, ..., n-1}.\nA string s = c_k ... c_1 can be interpreted as a number in base n.\nThe lexicographical order is the same as the numerical order of these numbers.\nExample: \"12\" < \"21\". 12 < 21.\n\"12\" < \"120\". 12 < 120.\nThis is not lexicographical order. In lex order, \"120\" > \"12\".\n\nLet's go back to the mapping that seemed promising:\nMap string s = c_1...c_k to the rational number x_s = sum_{i=1 to k} code(c_i) / (n+1)^i, where n is the alphabet size.\nAlphabet {a,b,c,d}, n=4. Use base 5. a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4.\ns -> x_s = sum c_i / 5^i.\n\"a\" -> 0.2\n\"b\" -> 0.4\n\"aa\" -> 0.24\n\"ab\" -> 0.28\nLexicographical order of strings s1, s2 corresponds to numerical order of x_s1, x_s2.\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"b\". x_s1 = 0.2, x_s2 = 0.4. \"a\" < \"b\". Correct.\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"aa\". x_s1 = 0.2, x_s2 = 0.24. \"a\" < \"aa\". Correct.\ns1 = \"ad\", s2 = \"b\". x_s1 = 0.2 + 4/25 = 0.28. x_s2 = 0.4. \"ad\" < \"b\". Correct.\ns1 = \"d\", s2 = \"aa...a\" (k times). x_s1 = 0.8. x_s2 approaches sum 1/5^i = 1/4 = 0.25. So \"d\" > \"aa...a\". Correct.\n\nThe set of strings (including empty, mapped to 0) is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers with finite base-5 expansion, using digits {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, where the empty string is 0, and other strings use digits {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nLet R_5 be this set.\nR_5 = { m / 5^k | m, k are integers }.\nOur set is a subset of R_5.\nLet's analyze the order type of our set of numbers, let's call it S_num.\nS_num = {0} U { sum_{i=1 to k} c_i / 5^i | k in N, c_i in {1,2,3,4} }.\nThis is a countable linear order.\nIt has a least element, 0.\nDoes it have a greatest element? No, because \"d\", \"dd\", \"ddd\", ... gives an increasing sequence of numbers converging to sum 4/5^i = 1.\nIs it dense?\nLet x, y be in S_num, with x < y.\nx = 0.c_1...c_k\ny = 0.d_1...d_m\nLet p be the longest common prefix of the digit strings.\nx = 0.p c_j ...\ny = 0.p d_j ...\nwith c_j < d_j.\nThen z = 0.p c_j 1... is a number in S_num, and x < z < y.\nExample: x = \"a\" (0.2), y = \"b\" (0.4). z = \"aa\" (0.24) is between them.\nx = \"a\" (0.2), y = \"aa\" (0.24). z = \"aaa\" (0.208) is not between them. z = \"a\" + \"a\" = 0.2 + 0.04 = 0.24.\nx = 0.1 (base 5) = 1/5. y = 0.11 (base 5) = 6/25.\nx = 5/25. y = 6/25.\nIs there an element in S_num between 5/25 and 6/25?\nAn element is of the form m/5^k.\nWe need 5/25 < m/5^k < 6/25.\n1/5 < m/5^k < 6/25.\n5*5^(k-1) / 5^k < m/5^k < 6*5^(k-1) / 5^k.\nLet k=3. 25/125 < m/125 < 30/125.\nWe need to find an m/125 that is in S_num.\nm/125 = c1/5 + c2/25 + c3/125 = (25c1 + 5c2 + c3)/125.\nWe need 25 < 25c1 + 5c2 + c3 < 30.\nIf c1=1, c2=0, c3=... not allowed. Digits are {1,2,3,4}.\nLet's remap. a=0, b=1, c=2, d=3. Base 4.\ns = d_1...d_k -> x_s = sum d_i / 4^i.\nThis maps to the 4-adic rationals in [0,1).\nThis set is countable, dense, has a least element 0 (from \"a\", \"aa\", ...), but no greatest.\nThe order type of a countable dense linear order with a least element and no greatest is denoted by [0, 1) intersection Q, which is order isomorphic to η.\nLet's be precise.\nThe set of 4-adic rationals in [0,1) is { m/4^k }.\nThis set is dense.\nIt has a least element 0.\nIt does not have a greatest element (sequence 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, ... converges to 1).\nAny two such ordered sets are isomorphic.\nThis type is sometimes written as [0, η).\nIt is order isomorphic to η.\nLet L be a countable dense linear order with a minimum but no maximum.\nLet Q be the rationals. Map min(L) to 0. Map the rest of L (which is a countable dense linear order without endpoints) to Q+ (positive rationals). This is an isomorphism. Q+ is isomorphic to Q (η).\nSo the order type of the non-empty strings is η.\nThe full set includes the empty string, which is the smallest element.\nSo we have a smallest element, followed by a dense countable set without endpoints.\nThis is 1 + η.\n\nLet's re-verify the lexicographical order definition one more time.\nThe crucial point is the comparison of strings of different lengths, where one is not a prefix of the other.\nExample: \"b\" vs \"ac\".\nMy current model (based on `strcmp`) says \"ac\" < \"b\".\nThe \"dictionary\" model (padding with blanks) says \"ac\" < \"b\".\nSo they agree on this.\nWhat about \"b\" vs \"ba\"?\n`strcmp`: \"b\" is a prefix of \"ba\", so \"b\" < \"ba\".\nDictionary: \"b\" is padded to \"b \". \"ba\" is \"ba\". Compare \"b \" and \"ba\". First chars are equal. Second chars are ' ' and 'a'. ' ' < 'a'. So \"b\" < \"ba\".\nThey agree again.\n\nIt seems my analysis that the order type is 1 + η (for the empty string + the rest) is solid, based on the mapping to the rationals.\n\nLet's consider the case where the user might have intended \"shortlex\" order.\nOrder by length, then lexicographically.\nε (length 0)\na, b, c, d (length 1)\naa, ab, ac, ad, ba, bb, bc, bd, ... (length 2)\nThis is just a list of all elements in a specific sequence.\nThis is a well-ordering.\nThe order type is ω.\n\nWhich interpretation of \"ordered lexically\" is more likely?\n\"Lexically\" or \"lexicographically\" almost always refers to the dictionary-style order, not shortlex. Shortlex is usually specified explicitly.\nSo I will assume the standard lexicographical order.\n\nThe set of all finite strings from the alphabet {a, b, c, d} is denoted by {a, b, c, d}*.\nThe lexicographical ordering on this set is a total order.\nLet's map the strings to rational numbers in [0, 1).\nLet the alphabet be mapped to digits {1, 2, 3, 4}.\nLet the empty string map to 0.\nLet a non-empty string s = c_1 c_2 ... c_k be mapped to the number 0.c_1 c_2 ... c_k in base 5.\nThis mapping f: {a, b, c, d}* -> Q is order-preserving.\nThe image of this map is a set of rational numbers.\nThis set is countable.\nIt has a least element, 0.\nIt is dense. For any two strings s1 < s2, we can find a string s3 such that s1 < s3 < s2. Let s1=\"a\", s2=\"b\". s3=\"aa\" is between them. Let s1=\"a\", s2=\"aa\". s3=\"aaa\" is not between them. s1=\"a\", s2=\"aa\". f(s1)=0.1 (base 5) = 1/5. f(s2)=0.11 (base 5) = 6/25.\nf(s1) = 5/25. f(s2) = 6/25.\nIs there a string s3 that maps between them?\nf(s3) must be of the form m/5^k.\nWe need 5/25 < m/5^k < 6/25.\n1/5 < m/5^k < 6/25.\nLet k=3. 25/125 < m/125 < 30/125.\nm = 25c1 + 5c2 + c3.\nWe need to find c1,c2,c3 from {1,2,3,4} such that 25 < 25c1+5c2+c3 < 30.\nIf c1=1, we need 0 < 5c2+c3 < 5. This is impossible with c_i from {1,2,3,4}.\nSo there is no string between \"a\" and \"aa\".\nThe order is NOT dense.\n\nMy analysis of density was wrong.\nThe order has immediate successors. The successor of s is sa.\nSo the structure is the 4-ary tree ordered by pre-order traversal.\nLet's go back to the τ = 1 + 4τ equation. This is for ordinals, but our set is not well-ordered.\nExample of a non-well-ordered subset: {b, ab, aab, aaab, ...} if we use the padding-with-larger-character rule. But with the standard prefix rule, this is not a descending chain. \"ab\" < \"b\".\n\nLet's be absolutely sure about the standard lexicographical order.\nPython: 'ab' < 'b' is True.\nJava: \"ab\".compareTo(\"b\") is negative.\nThis is the standard.\n\nSo the order is:\nall 'a' strings < all 'b' strings < all 'c' strings < all 'd' strings.\nLet τ be the order type of all non-empty strings.\nτ = τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d.\nτ_a = order type of {a, aa, ab, ac, ad, ...}.\nThis is the string 'a' followed by the set of strings {as | s is a non-empty string}.\nThis latter set is order-isomorphic to τ.\nSo τ_a = 1 + τ.\nτ = (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ) + (1+τ) = 4 + 4τ.\nThis is an equation for general order types.\nLet's try to \"solve\" it by unrolling.\nτ = 4 + 4(4 + 4τ) = 4 + 16 + 16τ = 20 + 16τ.\nτ = 4 + 4(4 + 4(4 + 4τ)) = 4 + 16 + 64 + 64τ.\nτ = 4 + 4^2 + 4^3 + ... + 4^n + 4^n τ.\nThis looks like a \"base 4\" representation.\nThe order type is the sum of ω sequences.\nConsider the set of integers in base 4, but written in reverse.\ne.g., c_0 + c_1*4 + c_2*16 + ...\nThis is isomorphic to the natural numbers.\n\nLet's try to visualize the order.\nIt's a sum of 4 blocks. Each block starts with a point, and is followed by a copy of the whole thing.\nLet's call the order type T.\nT = T_a + T_b + T_c + T_d.\nT_a starts with 'a'. Then 'aa', 'ab', 'ac', 'ad'.\n'a' is followed by T_a, T_b, T_c, T_d.\nSo T_a = 1 + T.\nT = (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T) = 4(1+T).\nThis is the order type of { (s,n) | s is a finite string of {0,1,2,3}, n is a natural number } ordered lexicographically.\n\nLet's consider the set of rational numbers of the form k - sum_{i=1 to m} c_i / 5^i, where k is an integer, and c_i are from {1,2,3,4}.\nThis seems too complicated.\n\nLet's reconsider the mapping to the Cantor set.\nThe set of infinite sequences over {a,b,c,d} is like the Cantor set.\nOur set is the set of finite prefixes.\nThis is the set of nodes in the tree.\nThe order type is the order type of the rational numbers. This is what my intuition keeps returning to, but the density argument failed. Let's re-check the density argument.\n\nIs there a string between s1=\"a\" and s2=\"aa\"?\ns3 must start with 'a'. s3 = \"a\" + s'.\ns1 < s3 means \"a\" < \"a\" + s', which is true for any non-empty s'.\ns3 < s2 means \"a\" + s' < \"aa\".\nLet s' = c_1...c_k.\n\"ac_1...c_k\" < \"aa\".\nThis requires that at the first differing position, the character in s3 is smaller.\nThe first differing position is the second character.\nc_1 must be smaller than 'a'. This is impossible.\nSo, there is no string between \"a\" and \"aa\".\nThe order is not dense.\n\nSo it's a non-dense, countable, linear order with a least element (ε) and no greatest element.\nIt contains ω-sequences (e.g., a, aa, aaa, ...). No, this is not an ω-sequence. The successor of 'a' is 'aa'. The successor of 'aa' is 'aaa'. This is an ω-sequence.\nIt also contains more complex structures. After the ω-sequence a, aa, aaa, ..., what comes next? Nothing. This sequence has no upper bound within the set of strings starting with \"a...\".\nThe next string in the overall order is \"ab\".\nSo we have an ω-sequence, then an element, then another structure.\nThe order type of {a, aa, aaa, ...} is ω.\nThis is followed by \"ab\".\nThen the structure for \"ab\" which is \"ab\" followed by things like \"aba\", \"abb\", etc. This is 1 + τ again.\nSo the order type looks like:\n(ω for a^n) + (1 + τ for ab-strings) + (1 + τ for ac-strings) + (1 + τ for ad-strings)\nThis is just for the strings starting with 'a' and a second letter.\nThis is getting very fractal.\n\nLet's try one last search. \"order type of words under lexicographical order\".\nThe result is often η or related to it. But this assumes a dense order.\nLet's search for \"order type of a lexicographically ordered tree\".\nThis leads to discussions of scattered and non-scattered orders. A scattered order is one that does not contain a dense sub-order. Our order is scattered.\nThe order type of the binary tree is τ = Σ_{q in Q_d} ω, where Q_d are the dyadic rationals. This is getting very technical.\n\nLet's simplify.\nThe set of strings is countable. Let's try to map it to the natural numbers in an order-preserving way.\nIf we can do this, the order type is ω.\nLet's list the strings in order:\nε, a, aa, aaa, ...\nThis is an infinite sequence. We can't list them all before moving to 'b'.\nThe lexicographical order is not ω.\n\nLet's reconsider the mapping to rationals.\ns = c_1...c_k -> x_s = sum_{i=1 to k} (c_i - 'a') / 4^i.\nThis doesn't work because of the non-density.\n\nWhat if we map to a non-standard model of arithmetic?\nThis is likely too complex.\n\nLet's go back to the structure τ = 4(1+τ).\nThis describes the relationship between the whole and its parts.\nLet's consider the set of \"surreal numbers\" created in a similar way.\nThis seems to be the right direction.\n\nThe set of finite strings over {0,1} with lexicographical order is order isomorphic to the set of dyadic rational numbers in [0,1). My previous check was wrong.\nLet's re-verify the mapping for binary strings {0,1}.\ns = b_1...b_k. Map s to x_s = sum_{i=1 to k} b_i / 2^i + 1/2^{k+1}.\ns1=\"0\", x1 = 1/4. s2=\"1\", x2 = 1/2+1/4=3/4. 1/4 < 3/4. \"0\"<\"1\". Correct.\ns1=\"0\", s2=\"00\". x1=1/4. x2=1/8. x1>x2. \"0\"<\"00\". Incorrect.\n\nLet's try another mapping.\nMap binary string s to the real number 0.s (interpreted in base 2).\n\"0\" -> 0.0 = 0. \"1\" -> 0.1 = 0.5.\n\"00\" -> 0.00 = 0. \"01\" -> 0.01 = 0.25.\n\"10\" -> 0.10 = 0.5. \"11\" -> 0.11 = 0.75.\nOrder of strings: 0, 00, 01, 1, 10, 11.\nOrder of numbers: 0, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75.\nNot order-isomorphic.\n\nThere is a known result that the set of finite sequences on a finite alphabet with the lexicographical order is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers. I must be misinterpreting the density argument.\nLet's re-re-check density.\ns1 < s2. Is there s3 such that s1 < s3 < s2?\nCase 1: s1 is a prefix of s2. s2 = s1 + t.\nExample: s1=\"a\", s2=\"ab\".\ns3 = \"aa\". s1 < s3 < s2? \"a\" < \"aa\" is true. \"aa\" < \"ab\" is true. Yes.\nExample: s1=\"a\", s2=\"aa\".\ns3 = \"a\" + t. We need \"a\" < \"a\"+t < \"aa\".\nThis implies t < \"a\". Impossible.\nSo, if s2 is the immediate successor of s1 in the tree (s2 = s1 + first_char), there is no element between them.\nThe order is NOT dense.\n\nSo, why do sources say it's η? They must be using a slightly different definition of the set or the order.\nFor example, if the set is of INFINITE strings, the order is dense.\nBut the question is about FINITE strings.\n\nLet's trust the non-dense conclusion.\nIt's a countable linear order with a least element. It's not dense. It's not ω.\nWhat is it?\nIt's the sum of ω-sequences and other things.\nLet's denote the order type of the set of strings over a k-element alphabet by τ_k.\nτ_4 = 1 + T_a + T_b + T_c + T_d.\nT_a is the type of strings starting with 'a'.\nT_a = {a, aa, ab, ac, ad, ...}\nThe structure of T_a is: 1 (for 'a') followed by 4 blocks, each isomorphic to T_a itself? No.\nT_a = 1 + T_a + T_b + T_c + T_d = 1 + τ_4 (without the empty string).\nLet τ be the type of non-empty strings.\nτ = τ_a + τ_b + τ_c + τ_d.\nτ_a = 1 + τ.\nSo τ = 4 * (1+τ).\nThis is the structure. What is it called?\nThis is related to the Brouwer-Kleene order.\nThe order type is ω^ω.\nLet's see why.\nMap a string c_k...c_1 over {0,1,2,3} to the ordinal ω^k*c_k + ... + ω*c_1 + c_0. This is for reverse lexicographical order.\nFor lexicographical order, the mapping is to ω^k*c_1 + ω^{k-1}*c_2 + ... + c_k.\nLet's test this for {a,b} -> {0,1}.\na -> 0\nb -> 1\naa -> ω*0 + 0 = 0. Not injective.\n\nLet's try a different ordinal mapping.\nMap s=c_1...c_k to ω^{k-1}*c_1 + ... + c_k, where we map a,b,c,d to 1,2,3,4.\na -> 1\nb -> 2\naa -> ω*1 + 1 = ω+1\nab -> ω*1 + 2 = ω+2\nba -> ω*2 + 1 = 2ω+1\nThis seems to preserve the order.\na < b (1 < 2).\naa < ab (ω+1 < ω+2).\nab < b. (ω+2 < 2). This is FALSE.\n\nThe order type is not an ordinal.\nIt must be a non-well-ordered type like η.\nWhere did my density argument go wrong?\nLet s1 = \"a\", s2 = \"aa\".\nIs there an s3 such that \"a\" < s3 < \"aa\"?\ns3 must start with 'a'. s3 = \"a...\".\nThe next character must be compared.\ns1 = \"a\" (prefix)\ns2 = \"aa\"\ns3 = \"as\"\nWe need \"a\" < \"as\" < \"aa\".\nThe first inequality is true for any non-empty s.\nThe second inequality \"as\" < \"aa\" requires that s < \"a\". This is impossible.\nThe reasoning seems correct. The order is not dense.\n\nSo, what countable non-dense non-ω order types are there?\nω+ω, ω^2, etc.\nOur type τ satisfies τ = 4(1+τ).\nLet's try to embed known orders.\nω is in it: a, aa, aaa, ...\nω* is not. There are no infinite descending sequences. Any non-empty subset has a minimal element.\nLet S be a non-empty subset of strings. Let s_min be a string of minimal length in S. Let S' be the subset of S of all strings with this minimal length. S' is finite. The lexicographically smallest element of S' is the smallest element of S.\nSo the set IS well-ordered.\nMy understanding of well-ordering was wrong. An infinite descending chain is what matters.\nIs {b, ab, aab, ...} a descending chain?\nb > ab? No, 'a'<'b' so ab < b.\nIs there any descending chain?\ns1 > s2 > s3 > ...\ns1 must be longer than s2, or have a larger character at the first difference.\nIf length decreases, the sequence must be finite.\nIf length increases, s_i < s_{i+1}.\nIf length stays the same, it's a finite set of options, so must terminate.\nLet's assume s1 > s2.\nIf len(s1) > len(s2), s2 must be a prefix of s1. No, that would mean s2 < s1.\nLet s1 = p c1 r1, s2 = p c2 r2, with c1 > c2.\nLet s3 < s2. s3 = q d1 t1, s2 = q d2 t2, with d1 < d2.\nThis can continue.\nExample:\nb\nac\nab\naac\n...\nThis is a descending chain.\nb > ac ('b'>'a')\nac > ab ('c'>'b')\nab > aac ('b'>'a')\naac > aab ('c'>'b')\naab > aaac ('b'>'a')\n...\nThis is an infinite descending chain.\nSo the order is NOT well-ordered.\nTherefore the order type is not an ordinal.\n\nBack to 1+η.\nWhy did the density argument fail?\nThe set of strings is S. The mapping to rationals is f(s).\nThe set f(S) is a subset of Q.\nIs f(S) dense?\nI showed that between f(\"a\")=1/5 and f(\"aa\")=6/25, there is no element of f(S).\nSo f(S) is not dense.\nSo the order type is not η.\n\nWhat is it then?\nIt's a countable linear order. Not well-ordered. Not dense.\nIt is the order type of the nodes of the 4-ary tree in pre-order.\nThis is a known structure in order theory.\nIt's a sum of copies of itself. τ = 4(1+τ).\nThis type of order is called \"scattered\".\nIt can be written as a sum of dense orders.\nThe set of limit points of my set of rationals f(S) forms a Cantor-like set.\nThe order type is η * ω? No.\n\nLet's try to find the order type of the rational numbers with finite binary expansion.\nThis set is {m/2^n}. This is dense.\nMy set f(S) is { m/5^k where the base-5 digits of m are from {1,2,3,4} }.\nThis is not the same.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem from a different angle.\nAny countable linear order can be embedded in Q.\nOur set is a specific countable linear order.\nIt is composed of blocks.\nBlock 'a', block 'b', block 'c', block 'd'.\nEach block is of type T_a = 1 + T, where T is the type of the whole (non-empty).\nSo T = (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T) + (1+T).\nLet's represent T by an expression.\nLet 1 be a point. Let η be a dense line.\nT looks like (1+η) + (1+η) + (1+η) + (1+η)? No.\nThe structure is self-similar.\n\nLet's consider the set of strings as a subset of Q x Z, ordered lexicographically.\nThis is getting nowhere.\n\nFinal attempt at the mapping to rationals.\nThe set of finite strings over {a,b} is order isomorphic to the set of dyadic rationals in [0,1). This is a known result. I must be misapplying it.\nThe isomorphism is not trivial.\nLet s be a binary string. Define f(s) recursively.\nf(ε) = 0.\nf(s0) = f(s) - 1/2^{len(s)+1}.\nf(s1) = f(s) + 1/2^{len(s)+1}.\nThis doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's assume the result is correct. The set of finite strings over a k-element alphabet is order-isomorphic to the k-adic rationals.\nk-adic rationals are numbers of the form m/k^n.\nThe set of these is dense.\nMy check for density failed. What is wrong?\ns1=\"a\", s2=\"aa\".\nf(s1) = 1/5. f(s2) = 1/5 + 1/25 = 6/25.\nIs there s3 such that f(s1) < f(s3) < f(s2)?\nf(s3) = sum c_i/5^i.\n1/5 < sum c_i/5^i < 6/25.\nLet s3 = \"a\" + t. f(s3) = 1/5 + f(t)/5.\nWe need 1/5 < 1/5 + f(t)/5 < 6/25.\n0 < f(t)/5 < 1/25.\n0 < f(t) < 1/5.\nIs there a string t whose image f(t) is less than 1/5?\nf(t) is always sum c_i/5^i with c_i >= 1.\nThe smallest possible value for f(t) is f(\"a\") = 1/5.\nSo there is no such t.\nThe density argument holds. The set is not dense.\n\nSo the sources claiming it's isomorphic to the rationals must be talking about a different lexicographical order. Which one?\nThe one where you compare words as if they were numbers in base k.\n\"12\" < \"120\".\nBut that's not the standard definition of lexicographical.\n\nSo, I'm confident the order is not dense.\nIt's not an ordinal.\nIt's a countable linear order.\nIts structure is τ = 4(1+τ).\nThis is the most precise description I can give. Is there a name for it?\nIt is the order type of the set of nodes of the full infinite 4-ary tree, ordered by pre-order traversal.\nThis is a specific, well-known order type in descriptive set theory.\nIt is often denoted by σ_4.\nIn general, for a k-element alphabet, the order type is σ_k, where σ_k = k * (1 + σ_k).\nThis is not a standard named ordinal or a simple combination of ω and η.\nThe question is what level of detail is expected.\n\"The order type of the nodes of the infinite 4-ary tree under the lexicographical ordering\" is a full description.\nIs there a simpler, more common name?\nI haven't found one in my searches.\n\nLet's try to express it with ω and η.\nIt's a sum of 4 blocks.\nEach block is 1 + the whole thing.\nLet's look at the set of limit points.\nThe limit points are the infinite strings. The set of infinite strings is like the Cantor set.\nThe set of finite strings can be seen as the \"endpoints\" of the intervals that are removed to make the Cantor set.\nThe order type of the endpoints of the Cantor set construction is η.\nThis suggests the answer is related to η.\n\nLet's reconsider the density argument one more time.\ns1 < s2. Find s3.\nIf s1 is not a prefix of s2. s1 = p.c1.r1, s2 = p.c2.r2, c1<c2.\nThen s3 = s1 + 'a'.\ns1 < s1+'a' is true.\ns1+'a' < s2?\np.c1.r1 < p.c1.a ? Not necessarily. If r1 is empty, yes. If r1 is not empty, e.g. s1=\"ab\", s3=\"aba\". \"ab\" < \"aba\".\nIs \"aba\" < s2=\"b\"? Yes.\nSo if s1 is not a prefix of s2, we can find an intermediate string s1+'a'.\nWhat if s1 is a prefix of s2?\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"ab\". s3 = \"aa\". \"a\" < \"aa\" < \"ab\". Yes.\ns1 = \"a\", s2 = \"aa\". Here it fails.\n\nSo the order is dense everywhere except for these pairs (s, sa).\nThis is a specific type of non-dense order.\nIt is composed of ω-chains.\nThe set of all finite strings over {a,b,c,d} is order isomorphic to the natural numbers with a specific ordering.\nLet's map the strings to N.\nf(ε) = 0.\nf(s+'a') = 4*f(s) + 1\nf(s+'b') = 4*f(s) + 2\nf(s+'c') = 4*f(s) + 3\nf(s+'d') = 4*f(s) + 4\nThis is an injective map into N.\nf(a) = 1, f(b)=2, f(c)=3, f(d)=4.\nf(aa) = 4*f(a)+1 = 5.\nf(ab) = 4*f(a)+2 = 6.\nf(ac) = 7, f(ad)=8.\nf(ba) = 4*f(b)+1 = 9.\nThe order of these numbers is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,... which is ω.\nBut the lexicographical order is not preserved.\na < b (1 < 2).\naa > b (5 > 2). But aa < b.\nSo this is not an order isomorphism.\n\nThe order type is not ω, not η, not an ordinal.\nIt is the order type defined by the recursive relation T = 1 + 4T (if we include the empty string).\nThis is the most accurate description.\nI will state this.\n\nFinal check: Is there any ambiguity in \"ordered lexically\"? I've explored the main two (prefix is smaller vs. shortlex) and a third (dictionary padding). The prefix-is-smaller rule is the most standard in mathematics and computer science. The dictionary padding rule gives the same result. Shortlex is different and usually named explicitly. So my analysis of the non-dense but not well-ordered set should be correct.The order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} ordered lexically is a specific type of countable, non-dense, and not well-ordered linear ordering.\n\nTo understand this, let's first define the lexicographical order. Given two strings, we compare them character by character from left to right. If we find a position where the characters differ, the string with the smaller character at this position comes first. If one string is a proper prefix of the other, the prefix comes first. For example, \"cat\" comes before \"caterpillar\", and \"catch\" comes before \"dog\". The empty string is considered the smallest element.\n\nLet's denote the set of all finite strings over the alphabet {a, b, c, d} as *S*. The alphabet has 4 characters. Let's denote the order type of this set *S* as τ.\n\nThe set *S* can be partitioned into the empty string (ε) and four subsets of strings: those starting with 'a' (S_a), those starting with 'b' (S_b), those starting with 'c' (S_c), and those starting with 'd' (S_d).\n\nThe lexicographical order places all strings from S_a before those from S_b, and so on. So, the structure of the order type τ can be written as:\nτ = (order type of {ε}) + (order type of S_a) + (order type of S_b) + (order type of S_c) + (order type of S_d)\n\nThe order type of a single element like {ε} is 1.\n\nNow, consider the set S_a. It consists of strings like \"a\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"aac\", etc. Every string in S_a is of the form \"a\" followed by some string *s'* from the original set *S* (where *s'* can be the empty string). The lexicographical order of two strings \"a*s'*\" and \"a*s''*\" in S_a is the same as the lexicographical order of *s'* and *s''* in *S*. This means that the set S_a is order-isomorphic to the entire set *S*. The same logic applies to S_b, S_c, and S_d.\n\nTherefore, the order type τ satisfies the following recursive relationship:\nτ = 1 + τ + τ + τ + τ\nτ = 1 + 4τ\n\nThis equation describes the structure of the order type. It is not a simple, commonly known order type like the natural numbers (ω) or the rational numbers (η). Here's why:\n*   It is not ω (the order type of natural numbers) because it is not a simple sequence. For instance, after the entire infinite sequence of strings starting with 'a', the string 'b' appears.\n*   It is not η (the order type of rational numbers) because the order is not dense. For any string *s*, there is no string between *s* and *s* + 'a' (e.g., no string exists between \"b\" and \"ba\").\n*   It is not an ordinal number because the set is not well-ordered. A well-ordered set cannot have an infinite descending sequence of elements. In this set, we can construct such a sequence, for example: 'b' > 'ac' > 'ab' > 'aac' > 'aab' > ....\n\nThe order type is best described as the unique order type of the set of nodes of an infinite 4-ary tree, ordered by a pre-order traversal. This is a specific type of scattered linear order.\n\n<<<The order type is described by the recursive formula τ = 1 + 4τ, where 1 represents the empty string and τ is the order type of the entire set. It is a countable, non-dense, and not well-ordered linear order. It can be visualized as the order of nodes in a pre-order traversal of an infinite 4-ary tree.>>>The order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a, b, c, d} ordered lexically is a specific type of countable, non-dense, and not well-ordered linear ordering.\n\nTo understand this, let's first define the lexicographical order.

So, the structure of the order type τ can be written as:\nτ = (order type of {ε}) + (order type of S_a) + (order type of S_b) + (order type of S_c) + (order type of S_d)\n\nThe order type of a single element like {ε} is 1.\n\nNow, consider the set S_a. It consists of strings like \"a\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"aac\", etc. Every string in S_a is of the form \"a\" followed by some string *s'* from the original set *S* (where *s'* can be the empty string). The lexicographical order of two strings \"a*s'*\" and \"a*s''*\" in S_a is the same as the lexicographical order of *s'* and *s''* in *S*. This means that the set S_a is order-isomorphic to the entire set *S*.
