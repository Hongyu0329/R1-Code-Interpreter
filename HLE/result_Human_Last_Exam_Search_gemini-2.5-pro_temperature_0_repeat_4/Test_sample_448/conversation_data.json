    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was Radon (Rn). Due to its extremely short half-life, its abundance is transient and exceptionally low, making it the least common of the noble gases.\n\nThe abundance of noble gases in Earth's different reservoirs—atmosphere, crust, and mantle—varies significantly. While the atmosphere contains the majority of the Earth's inventory of non-radiogenic noble gases, the solid Earth contains noble gases produced by radioactive decay.\n\nBased on data and models from around 2002, particularly the comprehensive work \"Noble Gas Geochemistry\" by Ozima and Podosek, the general order of abundance of stable noble gases in the total terrestrial inventory from most to least abundant is Argon (Ar), Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), and Xenon (Xe).\n\n*   **Argon (Ar)** is the most abundant noble gas, primarily due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust and mantle, which produces the isotope Argon-40. This isotope constitutes the vast majority of argon in the terrestrial environment.\n*   **Helium (He)** is the second most abundant, with most of it being the isotope Helium-4, a product of the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the crust and mantle.\n*   **Neon (Ne)**, **Krypton (Kr)**, and **Xenon (Xe)** are considerably rarer. Their abundances are primarily of primordial origin, incorporated into the Earth during its formation. Of these three, Xenon is the least abundant.\n\nHowever, **Radon (Rn)** is by far the rarest noble gas. All isotopes of radon are radioactive with very short half-lives; the most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This rapid decay means that it exists only in trace amounts at any given time, produced continuously from the decay of radium in the Earth's crust. Its extreme scarcity and transient nature make its percentage of all terrestrial matter vanishingly small compared to the other noble gases.\n\nTherefore, when considering all noble gases present on Earth, Radon was the rarest as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
