    "The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S⁴ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **The Knot and the Manifold:** The problem considers the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a knotted 2-sphere (a 2-knot) embedded in the 4-sphere (S⁴). We are interested in the double branched cover of S⁴ over this knot.\n\n2.  **Fundamental Group of the Knot Complement:** According to a theorem by E.C. Zeeman, the complement of an m-twist-spun knot of a classical knot `k` is a fiber bundle over the circle S¹. The fiber of this bundle is the punctured m-fold cyclic branched cover of S³ over the knot `k`. For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the fiber is the punctured 5-fold cyclic branched cover of S³ over the trefoil knot. This 5-fold branched cover is a well-known manifold called the Poincaré dodecahedral space.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Fundamental Group:** The fundamental group of the Poincaré dodecahedral space is the binary icosahedral group (also called the binary dodecahedral group), denoted I*, which has an order of 120. Puncturing a 3-manifold (that is not S³) does not change its fundamental group. Zeeman further showed that for the 5-twist-spun trefoil, the fundamental group of its complement in S⁴ is the direct product of the fundamental group of the fiber and the integers (ℤ). Therefore, the knot group is:\n    π₁(S⁴ - K) ≅ I* × ℤ\n\n4.  **Fundamental Group of the Double Branched Cover:** For a knot K in a simply connected manifold like S⁴, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is obtained by taking the knot group π₁(S⁴ - K) and quotienting by the normal subgroup generated by the square of a meridian element. A meridian corresponds to a generator of the ℤ factor in the knot group. Let `t` be a generator of ℤ. We compute the quotient:\n    (I* × ℤ) / <<(e, t)²>> = (I* × ℤ) / <(e, t²)> ≅ I* × (ℤ/2ℤ) = I* × ℤ₂\n    So, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is the direct product of the binary icosahedral group and the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n5.  **Minimal Number of Generators:** The final step is to determine the minimal number of generators, denoted `d(G)`, for the group G = I* × ℤ₂.\n    *   The group G is not cyclic, so it requires more than one generator. The maximum order of an element in G is 10.\n    *   The binary icosahedral group I* is a perfect group and can be generated by two elements; for instance, its standard presentation is <s, t | s⁵ = t³, (st)² = e>. Thus, d(I*) = 2.\n    *   The group ℤ₂ is generated by one element.\n    *   We can show that d(I* × ℤ₂) = 2. Let `s` and `t` be the generators of I*, and let `a` be the generator of ℤ₂. Consider the two elements g₁ = (s, a) and g₂ = (t, 1). The subgroup generated by these two elements contains (t, 1) and also (s, a)⁵ = (s⁵, a) = (t³, a). Since it also contains (t, 1)³ = (t³, 1), it must contain their product (t³, a)(t³, 1)⁻¹ = (1, a). With (1, a), we can generate the entire ℤ₂ component. Furthermore, we can obtain (s, 1) = (s, a)(1, a)⁻¹. Since the subgroup contains (s, 1) and (t, 1), it can generate the entire I* component. Therefore, the two elements g₁ and g₂ generate the entire group I* × ℤ₂.\n\nSince the group cannot be generated by one element but can be generated by two, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
