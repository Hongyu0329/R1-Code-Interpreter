    "After a thorough investigation, there is no evidence to suggest that any Nobel laureates were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial.\n\nExtensive research, including numerous targeted searches for Nobel Prize winners in connection with Enron's advertising campaigns, yielded no information to support this claim. Reports and analyses of the \"Ask Why\" campaign focus on its theme of questioning the status quo, which ironically mirrored the company's own deceptive business practices. While the campaign was a significant part of Enron's public image before its collapse, there are no credible sources that indicate the participation of any Nobel laureates.\n\nTherefore, the assertion that two Nobel laureates were featured in the commercial appears to be incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no evidence that any Nobel laureates were featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial.>>>"
