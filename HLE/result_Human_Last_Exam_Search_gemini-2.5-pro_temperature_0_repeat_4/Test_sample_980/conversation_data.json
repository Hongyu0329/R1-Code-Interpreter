    "The next number in the sequence is 62.\n\nThe provided sequence of numbers, while not a straightforward single series, contains strong evidence of being related to the Collatz Conjecture. The Collatz Conjecture proposes a sequence where for any given positive integer, the next term is obtained by dividing it by two if it is even, and multiplying it by three and adding one if it is odd.\n\nObserving the provided sequence: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124, the final number is 124.\n\nApplying the rule of the Collatz Conjecture to the last number, 124, which is an even number, we perform the following calculation:\n124 / 2 = 62\n\nThis suggests that the next number in the sequence is 62. The presence of the number 62 earlier in the sequence further supports this conclusion. While the entire sequence does not follow a single linear progression of the Collatz conjecture, the relationship between its final term and the likely subsequent term is consistent with the conjecture's rules. For instance, a portion of a known Collatz sequence starting from 27 includes the numbers 41, 124, and 62, which are also present in the given sequence.\n\n<<<62>>>"
