    "The search results confirm my initial line of reasoning.\n\n1.  **Barbell Graph Structure:** The search results confirm the structure of a barbell graph. For instance, result states, \"The most commonly used one is an n-barbell graph which is a simple graph obtained by connecting two copies of a complete graph with n nodes.\" Result gives a similar definition. For a 10-node graph, this means two K5 complete graphs connected by an edge (a path of length 0).\n\n2.  **Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** The search results describe gossiping protocols in a way that aligns with my node-centric sampling model. Result describes the most fundamental protocol, \"Uniform Gossip,\" where \"all persons knowing the rumor will select one other person from the population uniformly at random and informing this person\". Result also describes \"Uniform gossip\" where \"In each step, each node u chooses a node v uniformly at random\". While some results discuss variations, the standard \"uniform gossiping\" implies a node-based selection. Specifically, result defines a \"natural random walk\" as a process where a node \"selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to visit.\" This process of a node selecting a neighbor is the core of the edge sampling method I used.\n\n3.  **Bottleneck Edge Sampling:** Result directly discusses the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with uniform gossiping. It states: \"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (i∗,j∗), with uniform weights can be computed explicitly: Pu i∗j∗ = Pu j∗i∗ = 1/n * 1/di∗\". This is precisely the formula I derived.\n    *   P(select node i*) = 1/n\n    *   P(i* chooses j*) = 1/d_i* (where d_i* is the degree of node i*)\n    *   The total probability is the sum of this event and the symmetric event starting from node j*.\n\nMy calculation seems correct and well-supported by the literature.\n\nLet's re-state the final calculation.\n*   Graph: Barbell graph with N=10 nodes, consisting of two K5 cliques.\n*   Bottleneck edge connects node `u` in the first clique and node `v` in the second.\n*   Degree of `u`, deg(u) = (5-1) + 1 = 5.\n*   Degree of `v`, deg(v) = (5-1) + 1 = 5.\n*   The gossiping process samples an edge by first picking a node uniformly at random (probability 1/10) and then having that node pick a neighbor uniformly at random.\n*   The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the probability of (picking `u` AND `u` choosing `v`) OR (picking `v` AND `v` choosing `u`).\n*   P(bottleneck) = P(pick u) * P(u chooses v) + P(pick v) * P(v chooses u)\n*   P(bottleneck) = (1/10) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/10) * (1/deg(v))\n*   P(bottleneck) = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)\n*   P(bottleneck) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThe result is 1/25, which is 0.04.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and confirmed by the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nA barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck edge.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is typically sampled through a two-step process:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the entire graph.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to interact with.\n\nLet's denote the 10 nodes in the graph as N=10. The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge are `u` and `v`.\n\nThe probability of selecting any specific node in the first step is 1/N, which is 1/10.\n\nNext, we need to determine the degree of nodes `u` and `v`.\n*   Each of these nodes is part of a 5-node clique (a K5). In an isolated K5, each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n*   Additionally, nodes `u` and `v` are connected to each other by the bottleneck edge.\n*   Therefore, the degree of node `u` is 4 (from its clique) + 1 (from the bottleneck) = 5.\n*   Similarly, the degree of node `v` is 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v) is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  Node `u` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected, and it chooses to gossip with node `u`.\n\nThe probability of the first event is:\nP(select u) * P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/degree(u)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe probability of the second event is:\nP(select v) * P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/degree(v)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of these two probabilities:\nP(bottleneck edge) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThis calculation is supported by literature on gossiping algorithms on barbell graphs, which confirms that the probability of activating the bottleneck edge (i,j) in uniform gossiping is the sum of the probabilities of each endpoint node being chosen and then selecting the other.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
