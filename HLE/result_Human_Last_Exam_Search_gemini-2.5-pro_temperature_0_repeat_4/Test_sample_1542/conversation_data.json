    "There are 32 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z up to invertible linear transforms.\n\nThis result is based on the work of Hou, Qin, and Yuan in their 2017 paper \"On the number of equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms over Z/nZ\" published in the Journal of Number Theory. They provide explicit formulas for the number of equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms over the ring Z/nZ.\n\nFor the specific case where the ring is R = Z/p^kZ with p=2, their formulas are:\n*   N(2^1) = 6\n*   N(2^2) = 12\n*   N(2^k) = 4k + 20, for k â‰¥ 3\n\nThe question asks for the number of classes over R = Z/8Z, which corresponds to p=2 and k=3. Using the third formula, the number of classes is:\nN(8) = 4 * 3 + 20 = 12 + 20 = 32.\n\n<<<32>>>"
