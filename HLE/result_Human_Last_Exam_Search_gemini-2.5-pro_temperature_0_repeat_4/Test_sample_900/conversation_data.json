    "While a video of Svetlana Gileva performing the Jete Woman solo in the Semperoper Ballett's 2015 production of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is available, a precise count of the *pas de Balanchine* steps she performed is not available in any written analysis or review.\n\nThe performance took place on November 9, 2015, and features Gileva in the specified role. However, determining the exact number of times a specific ballet step is performed would require a visual analysis of the choreography from the video, which is not possible through text-based search results. Reviews and official company information confirm Gileva's role in the ballet but do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number as this would require a visual analysis of the performance video. The available text-based sources do not contain this level of choreographic detail.>>>"
