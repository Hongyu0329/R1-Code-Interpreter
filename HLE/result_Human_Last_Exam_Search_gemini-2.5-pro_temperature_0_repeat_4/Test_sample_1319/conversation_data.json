    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Athos**.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, serving as settings for divine intervention and observation of the Trojan War. While Mount Olympus stands as the highest and most prominent as the home of the gods, other notable peaks are mentioned.\n\nThe heights of the key historical mountains in the *Iliad*, aside from Mount Olympus, are as follows:\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on the Chalkidiki peninsula in northern Greece, it has an elevation of 6,670 feet (2,033 meters). Homer mentions Mount Athos in the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain, located in modern-day Turkey near the site of ancient Troy, was a frequent vantage point for the gods to watch the battles of the Trojan War. Its highest peak is 5,820 feet (1,774 meters). It is distinct from the taller Mount Ida on Crete, which is associated with the birth of Zeus but is not the setting for the events of the *Iliad*.\n*   **Mount Saos (or Fengari) on Samothrace:** This island peak, from which Poseidon is said to have watched the war, rises to 5,285 feet (1,611 meters).\n\nComparing these elevations, Mount Athos is the tallest among the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
