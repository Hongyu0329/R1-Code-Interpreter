    "All the provided peptides contain the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) sequence, which is a well-known primary recognition motif for many integrin receptors. The binding affinity and specificity of these peptides to different integrin subtypes are heavily influenced by the amino acids flanking this core RGD sequence.\n\nThe peptide RGDSPSS contains the sequence RGDSP. The RGDSP sequence is a specific inhibitor of integrin binding to fibronectin, a major protein in the extracellular matrix. Fibronectin is a natural ligand for several integrins, including α5β1 and αv-class integrins, and its primary cell attachment site is the RGD sequence. Peptides containing the RGDS sequence have been shown to inhibit integrin receptor function and promote cell attachment. The G4RGDSP peptide, which is very similar to option B, is explicitly described as a cell integrin-binding peptide that targets integrin receptors. Furthermore, a fibronectin-mimetic peptide named PR_b, which contains the RGDSP motif, has been developed to specifically target the α5β1 integrin with high affinity.\n\nWhile other RGD-containing peptides can also bind to integrins, the RGDSP sequence is a well-documented and specific motif derived from fibronectin, making RGDSPSS a highly likely candidate for strong integrin binding in an in vitro assay. For instance, the peptide RGDLTTP was identified in a screen for variants that bind to muscle cells, suggesting it has binding capabilities, but the RGDSP sequence is more classically associated with general integrin-fibronectin interactions.\n\n<<<B>>>"
