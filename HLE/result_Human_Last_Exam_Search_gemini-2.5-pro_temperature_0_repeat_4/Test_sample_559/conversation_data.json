    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and such curves are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points exist where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This yields two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nWe classify these equilibrium points by linearizing the system, which involves computing the Jacobian matrix:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node (source)**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1). We look for an invariant curve (a trajectory) that passes through this point. Let's test for a solution of the form $d = f(u)$. By substituting $d=au^2+bu+c$ into the differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$, we can find that $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution curve.\n\nLet's verify this solution:\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$.\nSubstituting this and $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$-2u \\cdot u' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$-2u((u-1)u^2) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nThe equation holds, confirming that $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve.\n\nThis curve passes through the saddle point (-1, 1), since $-1 = -(1)^2$. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be one of its manifolds. To confirm it is the unstable manifold, we can check its slope at the saddle point. The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$, which is -2 at $u=1$. The eigenvector for the unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda=1$ of the Jacobian at (-1, 1) is $\\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2$. The slopes match.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1, 1). This curve acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions with different dynamic behaviors. Trajectories on one side of this curve will behave differently from trajectories on the other side.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
