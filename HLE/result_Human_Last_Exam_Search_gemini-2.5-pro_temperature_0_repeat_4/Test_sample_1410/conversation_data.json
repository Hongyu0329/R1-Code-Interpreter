    "Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence begins with White's move:\n\n1.  **Qxf7+**\n\nBlack is forced to respond with:\n\n1.  **... Kh8**\n\nWhite continues the attack with:\n\n2.  **Ng6+**\n\nBlack has two possible responses, both of which lead to checkmate in 4 moves:\n\n*   If Black plays **2...hxg6**, White delivers checkmate with **3. Qxg6+ Kg8 4. Qf7#**.\n*   If Black plays **2...Kh7**, White forces checkmate with **3. Nf8+ Kh8 4. Qh7#**.\n\nIn both variations, White checkmates the Black king on the fourth move.\n\n<<<4>>>"
