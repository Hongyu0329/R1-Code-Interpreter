    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe outer-hull, or more formally the convex hull, of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces.\n\nSince the surface of the convex hull is already composed of triangles, it is in its own minimal triangulation. Therefore, the number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
