    "When applying the cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1 (represented as a black cell or the digit '1') for 20 iterations, a specific binary pattern emerges. Rule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\nThe rules are as follows, based on the pattern of `[left neighbor, current cell, right neighbor]`:\n*   `111` → `0`\n*   `110` → `1`\n*   `101` → `1`\n*   `100` → `0`\n*   `011` → `1`\n*   `010` → `1`\n*   `001` → `1`\n*   `000` → `0`\n\nThese rules are derived from the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`.\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' on a background of '0's, the pattern evolves with each iteration. After 20 applications of Rule 110, the resulting binary pattern is:\n\n<<<11000011101100111100101011>>>"
