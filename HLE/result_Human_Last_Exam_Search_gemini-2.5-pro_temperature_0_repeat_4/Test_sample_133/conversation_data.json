    "The search results confirm the strategy I identified. Creating multiple threats is a key way to win Connect 4. Specifically, creating a situation where the opponent is forced to block one winning move, which then opens up another winning move for you, is a classic tactic. This is often called creating a \"fork\" or a \"trap\".\n\nMy analysis of the board showed that moves `c4` and `f4` each create an unstoppable horizontal threat in row 4.\n\n*   **Move c4:** Creates a line of three O's (`c4, d4, e4`) with open ends at `b4` and `f4`. Player X can only block one of these on their next turn, allowing O to play in the other and win.\n*   **Move f4:** Creates a line of three O's (`d4, e4, f4`) with open ends at `c4` and `g4`. Player X can only block one of these, allowing O to win on the next turn.\n\nSince there is no move that allows 'O' to win on the current turn, a move that forces a win on the subsequent turn is the optimal choice for winning \"as fast as possible\". Both `c4` and `f4` achieve this. No other moves on the board create such a forced win.\n\nTherefore, the optimal moves for O are c4 and f4.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
