    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThese structures are all located within the posterior subesophageal mass, which is the rearmost part of the subesophageal brain. The palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger \"palliovisceral lobe complex\" which also includes the fin lobes and posterior chromatophore lobes, all of which are involved in controlling posterior body functions.\n\nSpecifically:\n*   The **palliovisceral lobe** is involved in controlling escape movements and the ejection of ink.\n*   The **posterior chromatophore lobes** control the chromatophores (color-changing cells) and papillae (skin texture) on the mantle, fins, and visceral mass.\n*   The **fin lobes** are responsible for the movement of the cuttlefish's fins.\n\nA 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish, available through the Cuttlebase web tool, provides a visual representation of the brain's 32 lobes, confirming the co-location of these lobes in the posterior-most region of the brain. Studies on other cuttlefish species, such as *Sepia plangon* and *Sepia officinalis*, show a similar anatomical arrangement where the fin and posterior chromatophore lobes are situated in the dorsal region of the posterior subesophageal mass, in proximity to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
