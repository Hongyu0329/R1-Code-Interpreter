    "To solve the competitive programming problem with the most memory-efficient C program, the best approach is to avoid storing both strings in memory at the same time. The program will read the first string into a buffer and then process the second string character by character, comparing it on the fly with the stored first string.\n\nThis method significantly reduces memory consumption compared to the more straightforward approach of storing both strings in separate, large buffers. To further optimize, variables are declared with the smallest possible data types that can hold their required range of values.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program for this task:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case,\n * with a primary focus on minimizing memory usage.\n *\n * It stores only the first string and reads the second one character by character\n * to perform the comparison. Variable types are chosen to be the smallest\n * possible size for their required data range.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Buffer for the first string. Max length is 100, plus 1 for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Variable to store the comparison result (-1, 0, or 1).\n    // 'signed char' is sufficient for this range.\n    signed char result = 0;\n\n    // Loop index for the first string. 'unsigned char' is sufficient for a length up to 100.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Variable to read characters of the second string.\n    // This must be an 'int' to correctly handle the EOF (End Of File) value.\n    int c2;\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer by scanf.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Read the second string character by character and compare.\n    while ((c2 = getchar()) != '\\n' && c2 != EOF) {\n        // Only update the result if the strings have been equal so far.\n        if (result == 0) {\n            // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n            char lower_s1 = tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]);\n            char lower_c2 = tolower((unsigned char)c2);\n\n            if (lower_s1 < lower_c2) {\n                result = -1;\n            } else if (lower_s1 > lower_c2) {\n                result = 1;\n            }\n        }\n        // Move to the next character of the first string.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // Print the final result.\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", result);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming a standard 64-bit architecture commonly used in competitive programming platforms:\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: A character array to store the first string (up to 100 characters) and a null terminator.\n    *   Memory: 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`signed char result`**: Stores the result (-1, 0, or 1). `signed char` is the smallest signed type.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(signed char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: A loop counter for the string index (0 to 100). `unsigned char` (0 to 255) is sufficient.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`int c2`**: Holds characters from the second string via `getchar()`. It must be an `int` to handle the `EOF` value correctly.\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 107 bytes.\n\n<<<107>>>"
