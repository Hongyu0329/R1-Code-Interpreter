    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G^k, which is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of G, for some integer k. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of order 512, we first need to understand its structure.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, is a group of order 2^9. It can be defined by the presentation:\nG = SD_512 = ⟨r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(127)⟩.\n\nWe need to determine the set of subgroups {G^k | k ∈ ℤ}.\n\n1.  **When k is an odd integer:**\n    The power subgroup G^k is generated by the set {g^k | g ∈ G}. Let's consider the generators of G, which are r and s.\n    *   The element r^k is in G^k. Since k is odd, the greatest common divisor of k and 256 is 1 (i.e., gcd(k, 256) = 1). This implies that the cyclic subgroup generated by r^k is the same as the one generated by r, so ⟨r^k⟩ = ⟨r⟩. Therefore, r itself is an element of G^k.\n    *   The element s^k is also in G^k. Since s has order 2 and k is odd, s^k = s.\n    *   Because both generators r and s are in G^k, the subgroup G^k must be the entire group G.\n    Thus, for any odd integer k, the power subgroup G^k is G itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **When k is an even integer:**\n    Let k be an even integer. We can write k as k = m * 2^j, where m is an odd integer and j ≥ 1.\n    The power subgroup G^k is then G^(m * 2^j) = (G^(2^j))^m.\n\n    First, let's determine the subgroup G^2, which is generated by the squares of all elements in G.\n    *   The squares of the elements in the cyclic subgroup ⟨r⟩ are of the form (r^i)^2 = r^(2i). These elements generate the cyclic subgroup ⟨r^2⟩.\n    *   The squares of the other elements, which have the form r^i * s, are (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (srs)^i * s^2 = r^i * (r^127)^i = r^(128i).\n        *   If i is even, r^(128i) is the identity element, e.\n        *   If i is odd, r^(128i) is r^128.\n    The set of all squares in G is therefore {r^(2i) for 0 ≤ i < 128} ∪ {e, r^128}. The subgroup G^2 is generated by these elements. Since r^128 is already in the subgroup ⟨r^2⟩ (as r^128 = (r^64)^2), G^2 is simply ⟨r^2⟩.\n\n    Now we can find G^(2^j) by repeatedly taking the squares:\n    *   G^4 = (G^2)^2 = ⟨r^2⟩^2 = ⟨(r^2)^2⟩ = ⟨r^4⟩.\n    *   By induction, G^(2^j) = ⟨r^(2^j)⟩ for j ≥ 1.\n\n    Finally, we consider G^k = (G^(2^j))^m. The subgroup H = G^(2^j) = ⟨r^(2^j)⟩ is a cyclic group. Since m is an odd integer, the map x ↦ x^m is an automorphism of the cyclic group H. This means that H^m = H.\n    Therefore, G^k = G^(2^j). This shows that any power subgroup with an even exponent k = m * 2^j is equal to one of the subgroups of the form G^(2^j).\n\n**Counting the distinct power subgroups:**\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups consists of G (for all odd k) and the subgroups G^(2^j) for j ≥ 1. Let's list them:\n*   G^1 = G (order 512)\n*   G^2 = ⟨r^2⟩ (order 128)\n*   G^4 = ⟨r^4⟩ (order 64)\n*   G^8 = ⟨r^8⟩ (order 32)\n*   G^16 = ⟨r^16⟩ (order 16)\n*   G^32 = ⟨r^32⟩ (order 8)\n*   G^64 = ⟨r^64⟩ (order 4)\n*   G^128 = ⟨r^128⟩ (order 2)\n*   G^256 = ⟨r^256⟩ = {e} (the trivial subgroup of order 1)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups, as they all have different orders.\n\nThus, there are 9 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
