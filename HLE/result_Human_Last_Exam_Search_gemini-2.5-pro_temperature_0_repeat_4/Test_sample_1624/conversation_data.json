    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this result:\n\n1.  **$X$ is a locally separable space.**\n    A space is locally separable if every point has a separable neighborhood.\n    *   Let $x$ be an arbitrary point in $X$. Since $X$ is a metric space, $x$ has a basis of open neighborhoods that are also connected. Let $N$ be such a connected open neighborhood of $x$.\n    *   The set $U$ is a dense open subset of $X$, and each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. As a subspace of a metric space, $U$ is also a metric space.\n    *   Consider the intersection $N \\cap U$. This is an open subset of the connected space $N$.\n    *   The connected components of $N \\cap U$ are themselves open sets within $N$. Since $N$ is connected, any collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint open sets within it must be countable.\n    *   Each connected component of $N \\cap U$ is a connected 1-dimensional manifold, which is homeomorphic to either $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$. Both $\\mathbb{R}$ and $S^1$ are separable (they contain a countable dense subset).\n    *   Therefore, $N \\cap U$ is a countable union of separable spaces, which makes $N \\cap U$ itself a separable space.\n    *   Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $N \\cap U$. We can show that $D$ is also dense in $N$. For any point $y \\in N$ and any open ball $B(y, \\epsilon)$ contained in $N$, the intersection $B(y, \\epsilon) \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set because $U$ is dense in $X$. Since $D$ is dense in $N \\cap U$, $B(y, \\epsilon) \\cap U$ must contain a point from $D$. Thus, $D$ is dense in $N$.\n    *   This shows that the connected neighborhood $N$ of $x$ is separable. Since $x$ was an arbitrary point in $X$, the space $X$ is locally separable.\n\n2.  **$X$ is a separable space.**\n    A well-known theorem in topology states that a connected, locally separable metric space is separable. Since we have established that $X$ is both connected (by hypothesis) and locally separable, $X$ must be separable. This means $X$ contains a countable dense subset.\n\n3.  **The cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.**\n    A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. This can be shown by considering that every point in the space is the limit of a sequence from the countable dense set. The set of all such sequences has cardinality $(\\aleph_0)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n4.  **The cardinality of $X$ is at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$.**\n    The space $X$ is a connected metric space. The existence of a non-empty open set $U$ where points have neighborhoods homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ implies that $X$ must have more than one point. A connected metric space with more than one point is always uncountable and has a cardinality of at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nCombining these results, the cardinality of $X$ is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ exists and is equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<Yes, there is an upper bound. The cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
