The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization is given by the formula:

δσ = - (e² / (πħLφ))

where:
*   δσ is the quantum correction to the conductivity.
*   e is the elementary charge.
*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
*   Lφ is the phase coherence length.

The phase coherence length, Lφ, is related to the electron diffusion constant, D, and the phase coherence time, τφ, by the equation Lφ = √(Dτφ). The correction is negative, signifying an increase in the material's resistivity. This effect is a direct consequence of the enhanced probability of an electron returning to its starting point due to constructive quantum interference.
