    "The man Kurt Vonnegut noted for looking like a porcupine in pictures is the British philosopher and mathematician, Bertrand Russell. While the specific \"porcupine\" anecdote is not directly verifiable through available search results, the connection between Vonnegut and his references to Russell is well-documented.\n\nA two-word name for him where both words start with the same letter is **Russell the Rainmaker**. This nickname was given to him during a lecture tour in Australia in 1950 due to the unusually wet weather that seemed to follow him.\n\n<<<Bertrand Russell>>>"
