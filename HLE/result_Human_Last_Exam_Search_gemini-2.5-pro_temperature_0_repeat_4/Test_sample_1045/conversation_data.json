    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom is determined as follows:\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom (H):** The 1s atomic orbital is represented by two contracted basis functions. This is known as a split-valence basis set, where the valence orbital is split into an inner and an outer part.\n*   **For each Carbon atom (C):**\n    *   The core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function (composed of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n    *   The valence orbitals (2s and the three 2p orbitals) are split into two parts each (an inner part made of 3 primitives and an outer part consisting of a single primitive). This results in two basis functions for the 2s orbital and two for each of the three 2p orbitals.\n    *   Therefore, each carbon atom is described by 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 3 * 2 (for 2p) = 9 contracted basis functions.\n\nToluene has the chemical formula C₇H₈, which means it contains 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTo calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene:\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the functions for all atoms:\n\n63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
