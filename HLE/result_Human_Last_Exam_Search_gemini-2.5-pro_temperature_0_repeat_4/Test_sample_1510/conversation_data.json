    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe symmetry of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern is described by one of the 17 wallpaper groups. Each wallpaper group has an associated point group, which consists of the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed. The order of a group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe possible point groups for any wallpaper group are restricted by the crystallographic restriction theorem to C_n_ and D_n_ where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The point groups with an order of 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n\n*   **C₂ (Cyclic group of order 2):** This group contains the identity operation and a single 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁ (Dihedral group of order 1):** This group contains the identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n1.  **p2:** This group has a point group of C₂. It features 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n2.  **pm:** This group has a point group of D₁. It has reflection axes that are all parallel.\n3.  **pg:** This group also has a point group of D₁. It contains glide reflections but no reflections.\n4.  **cm:** This group's point group is also D₁. It is characterized by having both reflections and glide reflections, where the glide reflection axes are not also reflection axes.\n\nA comprehensive table of the 17 wallpaper groups confirms that only these four groups (p2, pm, pg, and cm) have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
