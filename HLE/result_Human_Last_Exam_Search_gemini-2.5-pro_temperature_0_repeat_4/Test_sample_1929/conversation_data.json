    "The reaction between butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a dienophile) is a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, it undergoes a [4+2] cycloaddition, also known as the Diels-Alder reaction, to form a six-membered ring.\n\nIn this reaction, the four pi electrons from butadiene and the two pi electrons from 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene rearrange to form a new cyclohexene derivative. The double bonds in butadiene are at positions 1 and 3. During the reaction, a new single bond forms between carbon 1 of butadiene and a carbon of the dienophile, and another new single bond forms between carbon 4 of butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile. The double bond between carbons 2 and 3 of butadiene shifts to become the new double bond in the cyclohexene ring.\n\nThe product of this reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe reaction can be visualized as follows:\n\n*   **Butadiene:** CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** CCl₂=CF₂\n\nThe pi electrons from the double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene add across the 1,4-positions of the conjugated diene, butadiene. This type of reaction is a concerted process, meaning the new bonds are formed in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n\nThe resulting product has a six-membered ring containing one double bond. The carbons that were part of the dienophile are now saturated and are bonded to the chlorine and fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
