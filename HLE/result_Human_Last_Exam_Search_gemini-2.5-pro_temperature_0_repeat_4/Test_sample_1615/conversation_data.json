    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, which is not a complete graph, is $12344$.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n*   The chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, you can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n*   The chromatic number of a complete graph with $n$ vertices, $K_n$, is exactly $n$, because every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each.\n*   The problem states that the graph $G$ has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than $n$. This means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$, which is $12344$.\n*   To determine if $12344$ is the maximum possible chromatic number, we need to see if there exists a non-complete graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that requires $12344$ colors.\n*   Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $12344$ vertices ($K_{12344}$) and adding one more vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex).\n*   This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not adjacent to the other vertices.\n*   The chromatic number of this disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. The components are $K_{12344}$ and the single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n*   $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$ and $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic number of the constructed graph is $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that the chromatic number for any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices cannot exceed 12344, and we have constructed a graph that achieves this number, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
