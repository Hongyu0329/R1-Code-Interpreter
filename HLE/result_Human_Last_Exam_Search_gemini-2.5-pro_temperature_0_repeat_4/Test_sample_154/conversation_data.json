    "There are 12 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices, is connected, and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. Such a vertex that disconnects the graph is called a cut vertex. Therefore, a 2-vertex-connected graph must be a connected graph with no cut vertices.\n\nThere are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected. We can analyze these connected graphs based on their number of edges to determine how many are 2-vertex-connected:\n\n*   **4 Edges:** The 3 connected graphs with 4 edges are trees. All trees with more than two vertices have at least one cut vertex (any non-leaf vertex). Thus, none of these are 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **5 Edges:** Among the 5 connected graphs with 5 edges, only the cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5) is 2-vertex-connected. The other four graphs all possess cut vertices.\n*   **6 Edges:** There are 6 connected graphs with 6 edges. Out of these, the following 3 are 2-vertex-connected:\n    *   The 5-cycle with one chord.\n    *   The \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top).\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K<sub>2,3</sub>.\n    The other three graphs with 6 edges have cut vertices.\n*   **7 Edges:** All 4 non-isomorphic connected graphs with 7 edges are 2-vertex-connected. These can be identified by taking the complement of the graphs with 3 edges (P4, K1,3, P3 ∪ K2, and K3 ∪ 2K1), all of which result in 2-connected graphs.\n*   **8 Edges:** Both of the 2 non-isomorphic graphs with 8 edges are 2-vertex-connected. These are the complements of the two graphs with 2 edges (P3 and 2K2).\n*   **9 Edges:** The single graph with 9 edges is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed. It is 4-connected and therefore 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **10 Edges:** The complete graph K5, which has 10 edges, is 4-connected and thus 2-vertex-connected.\n\nSumming these up: 1 (with 5 edges) + 3 (with 6 edges) + 4 (with 7 edges) + 2 (with 8 edges) + 1 (with 9 edges) + 1 (with 10 edges) = 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
