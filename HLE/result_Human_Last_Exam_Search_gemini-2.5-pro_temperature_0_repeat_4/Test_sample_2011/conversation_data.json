    "Let G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. The goal is to determine the maximum possible number of different sizes of cliques that can appear as induced subgraphs in G.\n\nAn induced k-clique is a set of k vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, and this property is preserved in the subgraph formed by only these k vertices and their connecting edges.\n\nLet S be the set of all possible integers k such that G has an induced clique of size k. We want to maximize the number of elements in S, denoted as |S|.\n\nLet $\\omega(G)$ be the clique number of the graph G, which is the size of the largest clique in G. By definition, $\\omega(G)$ is the maximum value in the set S.\n\nConsider a maximum clique C in G, which has $\\omega(G)$ vertices. The subgraph induced by these $\\omega(G)$ vertices is a complete graph, $K_{\\omega(G)}$. For any integer k such that $1 \\le k \\le \\omega(G)$, we can select any subset of k vertices from C. This subset will also form a clique, and the subgraph it induces will be a complete graph $K_k$.\n\nThis means that if a graph G has a maximum clique of size $\\omega(G)$, it necessarily contains induced cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to $\\omega(G)$. Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes S must contain all integers from 1 to $\\omega(G)$. Since $\\omega(G)$ is the largest possible clique size, the set of clique sizes is exactly $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number of the graph, $|S| = \\omega(G)$.\n\nTo maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to maximize the clique number $\\omega(G)$ for a graph with n = 128 vertices. The clique number of any graph on n vertices cannot exceed n. This maximum value is achieved by the complete graph $K_n$, where all n vertices are connected to each other.\n\nFor n = 128, the complete graph $K_{128}$ has a clique number of 128. In this graph, any subset of k vertices (for $1 \\le k \\le 128$) forms an induced k-clique. Consequently, the set of induced clique sizes for $K_{128}$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 128\\}$.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is 128. It is not possible to have more than 128 different clique sizes, as the size of any clique is limited by the total number of vertices in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on 128 vertices is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
