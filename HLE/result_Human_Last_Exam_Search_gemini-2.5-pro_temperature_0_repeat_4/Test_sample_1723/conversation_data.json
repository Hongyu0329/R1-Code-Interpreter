    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.\n\nWhile several species of mushrooms are blue in color, their spore prints are of different colors. For instance, the vibrant blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* has a reddish-pink spore print. Similarly, the *Lactarius indigo*, another blue mushroom, has a cream-colored spore print.\n\nOther mushrooms that are blue or have blueish tones also do not produce blue spores. The Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*) has a purple-brown spore print. The Wood Blewit (*Clitocybe nuda*) can have a blue to violet-tinged cap but produces pale pink spores. Species of the genus *Psilocybe*, some of which are known for their blue-bruising reaction, have spore prints that are typically purple-brown.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
