    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined by a known formula, especially when 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n\nFor the given curve, we have the parametric equations:\n*   x(t) = cos(9t)\n*   y(t) = sin(5t)\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5. Both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers and are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).\n\nFor a Lissajous curve with parameters 'a' and 'b' that are coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstituting the values a = 9 and b = 5 into this formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nA self-intersection point occurs when two different values of the parameter 't' produce the same (x, y) coordinates. For Lissajous figures where the frequencies are in a rational ratio, the curve is closed and will trace over itself. The formula provides a direct way to count these intersection points without needing to solve the parametric equations directly.\n\n<<<16>>>"
