    "There are exactly **11** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also known as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere Anabanti and Sarah Hart. In their 2015 paper, \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" they proved that any such group must have an order of at most 24. This proof confirmed a conjecture by Giudici and Hart and finalized the list of all such groups.\n\nThe 11 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C₆, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂\n*   **Dicyclic Group:** Q₁₂ (the dicyclic group of order 12)\n*   **Alternating Group:** A₄ (the alternating group on four letters)\n*   **Special Linear Group:** SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field of 3 elements)\n\nThis complete list is detailed in a table within the aforementioned research papers, which catalogues all locally maximal product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<11>>>"
