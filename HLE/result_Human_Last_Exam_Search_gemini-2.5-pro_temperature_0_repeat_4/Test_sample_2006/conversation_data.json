    "This is a fascinating riddle! Here is the solution:\n\nThe haiku provides a series of clues that point to a significant historical event. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This strongly suggests the surrender of Emperor Hirohito of Japan at the end of World War II, as the Emperor was considered a divine figure.\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This refers to the tumultuous events of August 1945, specifically the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which can be described as a man-made \"tempest\".\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. This points to August 30, 1945, the day General Douglas MacArthur landed in Japan to begin the Allied occupation, heralding a profound \"wind of change\" for the nation.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a question asking to identify the specific bays associated with these events. The answer, as requested, in alphabetical order is:\n\n*   **Hiroshima Bay**: The city of Hiroshima, the target of the first atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, is located on this bay.\n*   **Nagasaki Bay**: The city of Nagasaki, the target of the second atomic bomb on August 9, 1945, is situated on this bay.\n*   **Tokyo Bay**: The formal instrument of surrender was signed on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay.\n\n<<<Hiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
