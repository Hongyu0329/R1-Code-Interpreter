    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factor the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$:\n$d = 53599 = 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThe conductor is a square-free integer.\n\n### 2. Conditions for a Primitive Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ is a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character). A non-trivial character has an order greater than 1.\n\n### 3. Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We require:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character, $o_i$, must be a divisor of 6. Since the characters must be non-trivial, their orders must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n### 4. Counting Characters of a Specific Order\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic and has an order of $p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nFor our prime factors:\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters has order $13-1=12$. The possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 12.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   **Modulo 19:** The group of characters has order $19-1=18$. The possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 18.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   **Modulo 31:** The group of characters has order $31-1=30$. The possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ all divide 30.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Results\nWe use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of combinations of characters $(\\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ that satisfy the order condition.\n\nFirst, we count the total number of non-trivial characters where the order of each component divides 6. For each prime factor, the number of such characters is the sum of the counts for orders 2, 3, and 6:\n$1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nThe total number of combinations of such characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$.\n\nNext, we subtract the combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. This occurs if the lcm divides 2 or divides 3.\n*   **lcm divides 2:** This happens if all component characters have an order that divides 2. Since they must be non-trivial, they must all have order 2. The number of such combinations is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   **lcm divides 3:** This happens if all component characters have an order that divides 3. Since they must be non-trivial, they must all have order 3. The number of such combinations is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe cases where the lcm divides 2 and where it divides 3 are mutually exclusive (as the only common divisor is 1, corresponding to the trivial character, which is excluded).\n\nTherefore, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations with orders dividing 6, minus those where the order divides 2, and minus those where the order divides 3:\nNumber of characters = $125 - 1 - 8 = 116$.\n\n<<<116>>>"
