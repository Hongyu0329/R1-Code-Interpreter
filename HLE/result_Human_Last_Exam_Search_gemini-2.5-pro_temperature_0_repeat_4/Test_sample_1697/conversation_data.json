    "The reaction described is a classic example of directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by electrophilic quenching.\n\n**Step 1: Directed ortho-metalation**\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two potential directing metalation groups (DMGs) for the lithiation reaction: the tertiary amide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). The reagents used are sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong base, and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent. TMEDA complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the organolithium reagent and facilitating the deprotonation of the aromatic ring.\n\nIn competitive situations, the tertiary amide group is a more powerful directing group than a tertiary amine group. The amide group directs the lithiation to the ortho position. The starting material has two positions ortho to the amide group: C2 and C6. The C2 position is also ortho to the dimethylamino group at C3. The directing effects of the two groups are therefore complementary, or reinforcing, towards the C2 position. The sec-BuLi/TMEDA system will deprotonate the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring, which is at the C2 position, due to the combined directing influence of the adjacent amide and dimethylamino groups. This forms an aryllithium intermediate, N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Quenching**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which is an electrophile. The carbanionic center at C2 attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
