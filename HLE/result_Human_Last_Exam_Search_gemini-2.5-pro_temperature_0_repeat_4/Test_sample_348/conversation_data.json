    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\nGiven the functions:\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n### Step 1: Find Market Equilibrium\n\nMarket equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q*) and the price is the same for both functions (P*). We find the equilibrium quantity (Q*) by setting the two equations equal to each other:\n\n`ln(Q*³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q*))`\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved using numerical methods. Solving this equation numerically yields an equilibrium quantity of:\n\n**Q* ≈ 4.694**\n\nNext, we find the equilibrium price (P*) by substituting Q* into either the supply or demand function. Using the demand function:\n\n`P* = 18e^(-arctan(4.694)) ≈ 18e^(-1.360) ≈ 4.618`\n\nSo, the market equilibrium is approximately **(Q* = 4.694, P* = 4.618)**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the area between the demand and supply curves.\n\n**Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n`CS = ∫[0 to Q*] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P*Q*`\n\n**Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, or `Q > ∛2`. The price is zero when `ln(Q³ - 2) = 0`, which means `Q³ - 2 = 1`, so the supply curve starts at `Q = ∛3`.\n`PS = P*Q* - ∫[∛3 to Q*] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ`\n\n**Total Welfare (TW)** is the sum of CS and PS:\n`TW = CS + PS = ∫[0 to Q*] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - ∫[∛3 to Q*] (ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ`\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Integrals\n\nWe use numerical integration to find the values of these definite integrals:\n\n1.  **Integral of the demand function from 0 to 4.694:**\n    `∫[0 to 4.694] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 30.116`\n\n2.  **Integral of the supply function from ∛3 to 4.694** (where ∛3 ≈ 1.442):\n    `∫[1.442 to 4.694] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ ≈ 11.056`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Total Welfare\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of the supply integral from the value of the demand integral:\n\n`TW ≈ 30.116 - 11.056 = 19.06`\n\nThe total welfare at market equilibrium is approximately 19.06.\n\n<<<19.06>>>"
