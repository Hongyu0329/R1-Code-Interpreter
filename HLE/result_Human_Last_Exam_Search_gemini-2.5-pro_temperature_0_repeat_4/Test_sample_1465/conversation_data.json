    "The provided sequences are de novo designed coiled-coil proteins. The oligomeric state of these specific sequences can be identified from the source code of a protein modeling software called ISAMBARD, as well as from related publications in the field of protein design.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the oligomeric state for each sequence:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: This sequence is designed to form a **heptamer** (a coiled-coil with 7 helices).\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence is designed as a **dimer** (a coiled-coil with 2 helices).\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This sequence is designed to be a **trimer** (a coiled-coil with 3 helices).\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: While this exact sequence is not in the primary search result, a very similar sequence, `KIEQILQKIEKILQKIEWILQKIEQILQ`, is listed as a **pentamer** (5 helices). Given the pattern and the answer choices, it is highly probable that this sequence corresponds to a pentamer.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: This sequence is not explicitly found in the search results. However, by examining the provided answer choices and the identified states for the other sequences (7, 2, 3, and likely 5), we can deduce the intended oligomeric state. The remaining number in the likely correct answer choice is 4. A sequence designed to be a **tetramer** (4 helices) from the same research group is `ELAAIKQELAAIKKELAAIKWELAAIKQ`. The pattern of hydrophobic and polar residues is a key determinant for the oligomeric state. The provided sequence likely fits the design principles for a tetramer.\n\nBased on this information, the oligomeric states for the given sequences are 7, 2, 3, 5, and 4 respectively. Comparing this to the answer choices, the correct option is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
