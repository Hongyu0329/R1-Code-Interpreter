The final state of the system is not a single state but a probabilistic ensemble. After applying the gate Q to the first ququint and measuring it, the system collapses to one of five possible states with different probabilities:
1.  With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With a probability of 3/10, the final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With a probability of 1/5, the final state is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With a probability of 1/10, the final state is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
