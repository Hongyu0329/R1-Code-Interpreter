The probability to draw a link `y_{ij}` between vertices `i` and `j` in a jointly exchangeable random graph is given by the expected value of the associated graphon `W` over its domain and its own randomness. Formally, if `W` is a random function (the graphon) drawn from a distribution `F`, and `U_i, U_j` are independent random variables with a uniform distribution `U` on `[0,1]`, the probability is:

`P(y_{ij} = 1) = E[W(U_i, U_j)]`

This can be written as an integral:

`P(y_{ij} = 1) = ∫ (∫_{[0,1]^2} W(u, v) dU(u) dU(v)) dF(W)`

which simplifies to:

`P(y_{ij} = 1) = E_F [ ∫_0^1 ∫_0^1 W(u, v) du dv ]`
