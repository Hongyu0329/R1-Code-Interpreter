    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. The Vaganova method emphasizes maintaining a square and stable torso and hips, while the Balanchine style often features a more open hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on the body working as a coordinated whole, with a stable, square torso serving as the foundation for movement. When executing a cambré derrière, the bend is initiated from the upper back, and the hips are meant to remain aligned and facing forward. This technique prioritizes control and precise body alignment.\n\nThe Balanchine method, conversely, is known for its speed, athleticism, and a more \"neoclassical\" aesthetic that often breaks from purely classical lines to create dynamic shapes. A signature element of the Balanchine style is the open hip in positions like arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is allowed to lift to achieve a higher leg extension. This principle of a more open and less rigid torso suggests a different approach to the cambré derrière as well, allowing for greater dynamism and a different aesthetic line. While Vaganova focuses on maintaining a strict form, Balanchine's method often adapts classical movements for a more daring and streamlined look.\n\nOther differences exist between the two methods in areas such as arm and head placement (port de bras and épaulement), speed, and the overall quality of movement. For instance, Vaganova has very specific and expressive port de bras, whereas Balanchine's arm movements can be more varied and sometimes less formal to match the speed and energy of the choreography. However, the fundamental approach to the hips—square in Vaganova versus potentially open in Balanchine—is a significant and defining difference in the execution of a cambré derrière.\n\n<<<B>>>"
