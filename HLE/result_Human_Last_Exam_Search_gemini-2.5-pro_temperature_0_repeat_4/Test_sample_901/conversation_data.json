    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The specified stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky base, which strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n*   **E2 Mechanism Requirement**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromide) and the proton being removed must be in an anti-periplanar arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n*   **Chair Conformation**: For the *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, there are two possible chair conformations.\n    1.  A conformation with the bromine atom in an axial position and the methyl group in an equatorial position.\n    2.  A conformation with the bromine atom in an equatorial position and the methyl group in an axial position.\n    The E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (bromine) is axial.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev)**: With the bromine in the required axial position, there are two adjacent (beta) carbons with anti-periplanar hydrogens that can be removed by the base: one on carbon 2 (C2) and one on carbon 6 (C6).\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen from C2 would lead to the more substituted, thermodynamically more stable alkene, **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen from C6 would lead to the less substituted, less stable alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is known as the Hofmann product.\n*   **Role of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton on C2 (which is adjacent to the methyl group). It is easier for the bulky base to remove the less hindered proton on C6. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nBecause the bulky base preferentially removes the less sterically hindered proton, the major product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
