    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which took place on **November 8, 1917**. This World War I engagement, also known as the Affair of Huj, involved a successful charge by the 5th Mounted Brigade against a rearguard of German, Austrian, and Turkish forces in Palestine.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, captured this event in her work titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*. The painting immortalizes what is considered one of the last classic, unsupported cavalry charges in British military history.\n\nWhile Lady Butler painted other scenes from World War I, the Charge at Huj is the latest dated historical battle that has been identified among her works. Other notable World War I paintings by her include:\n*   *The Retreat from Mons*, depicting events of August 23, 1914.\n*   A watercolour of Sergeant Frederick Barter's Victoria Cross action at the Battle of Festubert on May 16, 1915.\n*   *The Charge of The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February, 1916*.\n*   A depiction of London Irish Riflemen at the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n\nHer painting *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders*, completed in 1929, is a more general scene from the First World War without a specific date attached to the event it portrays. Therefore, the Charge at Huj remains the latest specific historical battle she depicted.\n\n<<<The Charge at Huj"
