The appropriate management involves a phased approach starting with medical stabilization of her diabetes and acute wound care. This is followed by a healing period and prosthetic planning that accounts for her skeletal jaw relationship. The definitive treatment would be a chrome-cobalt removable partial denture, using the left second premolar and left central incisor as primary abutments, and right-sided teeth for indirect retention. The key cells affected by her condition are neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, whose functions are impaired by hyperglycemia, leading to delayed healing.
