    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry and the chemical environments of its protons is necessary.\n\nThe molecule possesses a C3 rotational symmetry axis that passes through the center of the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. This symmetry makes the three large substituents chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of these substituents and on the central benzene core.\n\n1.  **Central Ring Protons**: The central part of the molecule is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. This will result in a single signal.\n    *   There are no aromatic protons on the central ring itself.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n\n2.  **Protons in one substituent arm**: We will now analyze the protons in one of the `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl` groups.\n    *   **Methylene linker (-CH₂-)**: This group connects the indazolyl moiety to the central benzene ring. The two protons of this CH₂ group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived fragment is chiral). Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will produce separate signals.\n        *   **Signal Count: 2**\n    *   **Indazole Ring Proton**: There is a single proton on the five-membered indazole ring at position 3.\n        *   **Signal Count: 1**\n    *   **Camphor-derived moiety**: This part is chiral and has several distinct proton environments.\n        *   **Methyl Groups**: There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton: one at C7 and two at C8. The two methyl groups at C8 are diastereotopic (gem-dimethyls on a bridged system) and thus are not equivalent. The C7-methyl is in a different environment. Therefore, the three methyl groups will give three distinct signals.\n            *   **Signal Count: 3**\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton (H4)**: There is a single proton at the C4 bridgehead position.\n            *   **Signal Count: 1**\n        *   **Methylene Protons (C5 and C6)**: The camphor skeleton contains two methylene groups at positions C5 and C6. In each CH₂ group, the two protons (endo and exo) are diastereotopic and chemically non-equivalent. This results in two signals for the C5 protons and two signals for the C6 protons.\n            *   **Signal Count: 4**\n\n**Total Number of Peaks:**\n\nSumming the signals from all the unique proton environments:\n*   Central Ring Methyls: 1\n*   Linker Methylene Protons: 2\n*   Indazole Ring Proton: 1\n*   Camphor Methyl Groups: 3\n*   Camphor Bridgehead Proton: 1\n*   Camphor Methylene Protons (C5 + C6): 4\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = **12**\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
