It is not possible to find two languages from two distinct Asian cultures with no direct contact where the words for "broom," "mom," and "dad" are all nearly identical or highly similar. While the words for "mom" and "dad" are often coincidentally similar across unrelated languages due to the nature of infant speech development (sounds like "mama" and "papa" or "baba" are easy for babies to make), the word for a common object like a "broom" is arbitrary and language-specific. Therefore, the probability of all three words being similar without linguistic contact is virtually zero.
