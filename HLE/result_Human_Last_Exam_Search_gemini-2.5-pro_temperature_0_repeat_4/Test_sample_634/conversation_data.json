    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm by performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]. The goal is to reduce this matrix to a row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\n1.  **Form the stacked matrix M:**\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n         [s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n    Let the rows be denoted by R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations:** The strategy is to use rows with simpler polynomial entries to reduce the complexity of other rows.\n\n    *   Replace R1 with R1 - (s+1)R3:\n        R1' = [s^2 + s - s(s+1), -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 + sR3:\n        R2' = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]\n    *   Replace R4 with R4 + R3:\n        R4' = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M' = [[0, -s],\n          [-1, s^2],\n          [s, 0],\n          [-1, 1]]\n\n3.  **Continue the reduction process:** Now, use the new simpler rows to further reduce the matrix. Let the new rows be R1', R2', R3, R4'.\n\n    *   Use R4' = [-1, 1] to eliminate the first column entries in R2' and R3.\n    *   Replace R2' with R2' - R4':\n        R2'' = [-1 - (-1), s^2 - 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n    *   Replace R3 with R3 + sR4':\n        R3' = [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    M'' = [[0, -s],\n           [0, s^2 - 1],\n           [0, s],\n           [-1, 1]]\n\n4.  **Focus on the rows with leading zeros:** The first three rows, [0, -s], [0, s^2 - 1], and [0, s], can be reduced among themselves. This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor of the polynomials -s, s^2 - 1, and s. The GCD of these is 1. We can perform row operations to obtain a row.\n\n    *   Let the rows be R_A = [0, -s], R_B = [0, s^2 - 1], R_C = [0, s].\n    *   Replace R_B with R_B - s*R_C:\n        R_B' = [0, s^2 - 1 - s(s)] = [0, -1]\n    *   Now we have a row [0, -1]. We can use it to eliminate the other rows.\n    *   Replace R_A with R_A - s*R_B':\n        R_A' = [0, -s - s(-1)] =\n    *   Replace R_C with R_C + s*R_B':\n        R_C' = [0, s + s(-1)] =\n    *   Multiply R_B' by -1 to get.\n\n    The set of non-zero rows is now:\n    M''' = [,\n            [-1, 1]]\n\n5.  **Final reduction step:**\n\n    *   Replace the second row with (second row) - (first row):\n        [-1, 1] - = [-1, 0]\n\n    The non-zero rows become:\n    M'''' = [,\n             [-1, 0]]\n\n6.  **Final Form:** By swapping the rows and multiplying the first row by -1, we obtain the canonical form:\n    G = [,\n        ]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. A GCRD being the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix) means that the original matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\n\nTo verify, we can check if G is a right divisor of P1 and P2.\n*   P1 = Q1 * G. Since G=I, Q1 = P1, which is a polynomial matrix.\n*   P2 = Q2 * G. Since G=I, Q2 = P2, which is a polynomial matrix.\nSo, I is a common right divisor. The algorithm ensures it is the *greatest* common right divisor.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
