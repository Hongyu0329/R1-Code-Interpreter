    "Yes, based on a standard interpretation of Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, if you understand the proposition *Fa* (e.g., \"Socrates is mortal\"), you should be able to understand *Fx (∀x)* (e.g., \"Everything is mortal\"), provided you also understand the concept of universal quantification.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why this is the case:\n\n1.  **Understanding 'Fa'**: According to Evans, to understand a singular proposition like *Fa*, you must possess the individual concept of 'a' and the predicative concept of 'F'. You must be able to think about the object 'a' and to think the property 'F' of it.\n\n2.  **The Generality Constraint**: Evans's Generality Constraint stipulates that thought is structured and systematic. If a person can think '*a* is *F*', they must possess the conceptual abilities to recombine these concepts. This means they must also be able to entertain other thoughts, such as '*a* is *G*' (for any other property *G* they have a concept of) and '*b* is *F*' (for any other individual *b* they can think of).\n\n3.  **Grasping the Propositional Function 'Fx'**: The crucial implication of the Generality Constraint is that in understanding *Fa*, your grasp of the predicate 'F' is not intrinsically tied to the individual 'a'. You have a general ability to predicate 'F' of any suitable object. This means you have the conceptual resources to grasp the propositional function *'... is F'*, or *Fx*, where 'x' is a variable that can be replaced by a concept of an individual. The constraint ensures that your conceptual abilities are flexible and recombinable.\n\n4.  **The Role of Universal Quantification**: The user's premise—that you already understand universal quantification (∀)—is the final required piece. Understanding the universal quantifier is a distinct logical ability. It is the capacity to take a propositional function, like the *Fx* that the Generality Constraint ensures you can grasp, and bind the variable to express the thought that the predicate holds true for every object in the relevant domain.\n\nIn essence, the Generality Constraint provides the necessary \"raw material\"—the grasp of a detachable and generally applicable predicative concept (*F*) and thus the propositional function (*Fx*). Your assumed understanding of the universal quantifier (∀) is the logical tool that operates on this raw material to construct the universally quantified thought (∀x Fx).\n\nTherefore, the ability to understand *Fa*, when combined with an understanding of universal quantification, logically entails the ability to understand *Fx (∀x)* within Evans's framework."
