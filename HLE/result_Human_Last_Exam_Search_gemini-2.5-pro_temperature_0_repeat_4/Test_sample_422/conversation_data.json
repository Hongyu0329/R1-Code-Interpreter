    "Given the constraint to ignore Gettier problems and to assume a simplified epistemic landscape with only two states, \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge encounters two significant issues.\n\n<<<### 1. The Infinite Regress of Justification\n\nThe \"Justification\" condition of the JTB account posits that for a belief to be knowledge, it must be justified. However, this requirement creates a logical puzzle known as the Agrippan Trilemma. The justification for a belief must itself be another belief, which in turn must also be justified to provide a solid foundation. This leads to three problematic possibilities:\n\n*   **An infinite chain of justifications:** This is impossible for a finite human mind to possess.\n*   **A circular chain of justifications:** This is a logical fallacy and does not provide a real foundation.\n*   **A chain that stops at a foundational belief:** This belief would have to be accepted without further justification.\n\nIn a system restricted to only \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief,\" this third option is particularly damaging to the JTB definition. If the chain of justification ends with a belief that is not itself justified, then this foundational belief cannot be \"Knowledge\" under the JTB account; it is merely a \"Belief.\" This would mean that the entire structure of our knowledge is built upon a foundation that is not knowledge itself, which fundamentally undermines the theory.\n\n### 2. The Inadequacy for *A Priori* Knowledge\n\nThe JTB framework struggles to adequately account for *a priori* knowledgeâ€”knowledge that is independent of experience, such as mathematical and logical truths (e.g., \"2+2=4\" or \"all bachelors are unmarried\"). The problems arise with both the \"Belief\" and \"Justification\" conditions.\n\n*   **The Belief Condition:** It is debatable whether we \"believe\" in necessary truths in the same way we hold beliefs about the empirical world. Belief often implies a psychological state of confidence that could be mistaken. However, our relationship with a logical tautology is more one of rational apprehension or understanding than of belief. Forcing such certainties into the category of \"belief\" may mischaracterize them.\n\n*   **The Justification Condition:** The nature of justification for *a priori* truths is distinctly different from that for empirical truths. The justification for \"2+2=4\" comes from reason and understanding the concepts, not from sensory observation. The JTB model, by not distinguishing between these different kinds of justification, presents an overly simplistic account that may not be sufficient to explain all types of knowledge.>>>"
