    "To identify the correct protein sequence, the provided nucleotide sequence must be translated in all three possible forward reading frames. The problem states that the sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), which is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for amino acids. This implies that the correct reading frame will not contain any stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA in RNA, which correspond to TAA, TAG, and TGA in the given DNA sequence).\n\nA reading frame is a way of dividing the sequence of nucleotides into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets. Since a codon is a triplet of bases, a sequence can be read in three different ways starting from the first, second, or third nucleotide.\n\nThe three reading frames for the sequence are:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga...`\n    *   This frame contains the codon `tag`, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):** `g gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    *   Translating this frame results in a continuous sequence of amino acids with no stop codons. This is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):** `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n    *   This frame contains the codon `tga`, which is a stop codon. Therefore, this is not the correct reading frame.\n\nBased on this analysis, Frame 2 is the correct open reading frame. The resulting protein sequence, using the one-letter amino acid code, is presented below.\n\n<<<DIVVSGEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
