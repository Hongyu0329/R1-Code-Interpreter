I am unable to provide an answer to your question. The provided information is insufficient to establish a relationship between the maximum norm $(k_{k,\infty})$, the covolume $(V)$, and squarefree natural numbers $(N)$. The notation $k_{k,\infty}$ is not standard in this context, and without a clear definition, it is impossible to determine its connection to the other mathematical concepts.
