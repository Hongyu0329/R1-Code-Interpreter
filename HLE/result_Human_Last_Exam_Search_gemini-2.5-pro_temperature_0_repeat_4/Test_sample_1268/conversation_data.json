    "I'm sorry, but the initial search results did not provide a direct answer or a clear path to finding the relationship between the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$ and the covolume $(V)$ for squarefree natural numbers $(N)$. The search results are focused on the distribution of squarefree integers in arithmetic progressions, bounds on the number of squarefree integers, and general concepts in algebraic number theory like lattices and covolume, but they do not connect these specific terms in the way the user has asked.\n\nThe notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is not standard in the provided context, and it's unclear what it represents. Without a precise definition of this term and its relation to the other concepts, I am unable to proceed with a meaningful search and provide a relevant answer.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that I cannot answer the question as it is currently formulated. It is possible that the user has a specific mathematical context in mind that is not immediately apparent from the query.\n\nIf the user can provide more context or clarify the meaning of $k_{k,\\infty}$, I would be happy to try again.\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question. The provided information is insufficient to establish a relationship between the maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$, the covolume $(V)$, and squarefree natural numbers $(N)$. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is not standard in this context, and without a clear definition, it is impossible to determine its connection to the other mathematical concepts.>>>"
