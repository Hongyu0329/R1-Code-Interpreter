The potential for free-standing boron nanosheets to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is entirely dependent on the specific crystalline structure of the nanosheet. SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, and a fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit such an effect is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. Boron nanosheets, or borophene, can exist in multiple structural allotropes. Some of the most stable and commonly studied free-standing phases, like the β12 and χ3 sheets, possess a centrosymmetric structure and therefore would not exhibit SPDC. However, other borophene phases, such as the 8-Pmmn structure, have been identified as having broken inversion symmetry. This lack of a center of symmetry is a necessary condition for a material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which governs second-order processes like SPDC. Theoretical work also suggests that creating buckled structures in borophene can induce non-centrosymmetry, opening the possibility for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena. While there are no direct experimental reports of SPDC in borophene to date, the existence of non-centrosymmetric allotropes indicates that it is theoretically plausible for certain types of boron nanosheets to exhibit this quantum optical effect.
