    "A wooden stick, a hanging square box, and a ladder placed in the center describe the Chinese character **困 (kùn)**.\n\nThis is a classic example of a Chinese character riddle, where the character's components are described metaphorically:\n\n*   **A wooden stick** or **a ladder placed in the center** refers to the character **木 (mù)**, which means \"wood\" or \"tree\".\n*   **A hanging square box** refers to the radical **囗 (wéi)**, which signifies an enclosure.\n\nWhen combined, the character 木 is placed inside the enclosure 囗, forming the character **困**. This character most commonly means \"to be stranded,\" \"trapped,\" or \"sleepy.\"\n\n<<<困>>>"
