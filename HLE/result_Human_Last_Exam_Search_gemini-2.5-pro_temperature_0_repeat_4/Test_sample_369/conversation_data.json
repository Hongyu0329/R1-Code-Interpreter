    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into six metrical feet. The feet in a hexameter line can be either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, — ∪ ∪) or a spondee (two long syllables, — —).\n\nFirst, we identify any elisions, where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\".\n\n1.  `verum ubi`: The `-um` in `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`.\n2.  `ubi equi`: The `-i` in `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n3.  `atque hominis`: The `-e` in `atque` elides with the `ho-` of `hominis`.\n\nThe line is scanned as if written: `ver' ub' equ' atqu' hominis casu convenit imago`.\n\nNow, we can determine the feet:\n\n1.  **Foot 1:** `vēr-ŭ-b'ĕ-` constitutes a **dactyl** (— ∪ ∪). The first syllable `ver-` is long by position (the vowel `e` is followed by two consonants, `r` and the `b` from `ubi`). The syllables `-u-` (from `ubi`) and `-be-` (from the elision of `ubi` and `equi`) are both short.\n2.  **Foot 2:** `-quī āt-` forms a **spondee** (— —). The syllable `qui` (from `equi`) contains a naturally long `i`. The syllable `at-` (from `atque`) is long by position, as its vowel is followed by the two consonant sounds in `-tque` (`t` and `k`).\n3.  **Foot 3:** `-qu(e) hōm-nīs` is a **spondee** (— —). The `-que` of `atque` elides. The syllable `hom-` is long by position (its vowel is followed by `m` and `n`). The syllable `nis-` is also long by position (its vowel is followed by `n` and `s`).\n4.  **Foot 4:** `cā-sū` is a **spondee** (— —). Both the `a` and the `u` (ablative singular ending) are long by nature.\n5.  **Foot 5:** `cōn-vĕ-nĭt` is a **dactyl** (— ∪ ∪). This assumes the present tense of the verb. The syllable `con-` is long by position. The syllables `-ve-` and `-nit` are both short.\n6.  **Foot 6:** `ĭ-mā-gō` must be a **spondee** (— —) to fit the meter. Although the initial `i` is naturally short, the final foot of a hexameter is conventionally a spondee (or a trochee), and the last syllable is always treated as long (a principle known as *syllaba anceps*).\n\nTherefore, the scansion of the line is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
