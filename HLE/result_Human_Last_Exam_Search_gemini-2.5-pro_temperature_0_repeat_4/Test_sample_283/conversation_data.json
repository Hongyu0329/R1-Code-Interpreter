    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, we first need to understand how an HSS matrix is represented. The representation is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix, which can be visualized as a binary tree.\n\n### HSS Matrix Representation\n\nAn HSS matrix is defined by a set of smaller matrices, called generators, associated with the nodes of its corresponding hierarchical tree. For a tree of a given depth, the total number of these generator submatrices defines the storage for the HSS matrix and represents the data that must be accessed for any computation, including matrix multiplication.\n\nThe standard definition for the submatrices that constitute an HSS representation is as follows:\n*   **D matrices:** At each leaf node of the tree, a dense diagonal block `D_i` is stored.\n*   **U, V, R, and B matrices:** For each non-leaf (or internal) node of the tree, four generator matrices (`U_i`, `V_i`, `R_i`, and `B_i`) are stored. These generators are used to efficiently represent the low-rank off-diagonal blocks.\n\n### Calculation for a Depth-4 Tree\n\nWe can now calculate the number of these submatrices for a single HSS matrix associated with a tree of depth 4.\n\n1.  **Tree Structure:** A hierarchical tree of depth 4 has 5 levels (level 0 to level 4).\n    *   The number of nodes at level `l` is `2^l`.\n    *   The leaf nodes are at the deepest level (level 4). The number of leaf nodes is `2^4 = 16`.\n    *   The non-leaf nodes are at levels 0, 1, 2, and 3. The number of non-leaf nodes is `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15`.\n\n2.  **Counting Submatrices for One HSS Matrix:**\n    *   **Leaf Nodes:** There are 16 leaf nodes, and each stores one `D` matrix. This gives a total of 16 submatrices.\n    *   **Non-Leaf Nodes:** There are 15 non-leaf nodes. Each stores four generator matrices (`U`, `V`, `R`, `B`). This results in `15 * 4 = 60` submatrices.\n    *   **Total for one matrix:** The total number of submatrices for a single HSS matrix is the sum of the matrices from the leaf and non-leaf nodes: `16 + 60 = 76`.\n\n3.  **Submatrices Accessed During Multiplication:**\n    A matrix multiplication operation, `C = A * B`, involves two input matrices, `A` and `B`. The algorithm for HSS matrix multiplication requires accessing all the constituent submatrices of both input matrices.\n    *   Submatrices for matrix A: 76\n    *   Submatrices for matrix B: 76\n\nThe total number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication is the sum of the submatrices for both input matrices.\n\nTotal submatrices accessed = 76 (for A) + 76 (for B) = 152.\n\n<<<152>>>"
