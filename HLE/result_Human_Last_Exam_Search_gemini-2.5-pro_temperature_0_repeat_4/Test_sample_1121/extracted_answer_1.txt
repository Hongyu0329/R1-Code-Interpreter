1.  **Simulation (Distance-3 Code):** Approximately **7** logical non-Clifford gates are required to construct a Toffoli gate, a fundamental building block for universal computation.
2.  **Implementation (Distance-5 Code, 1% Error):** Approximately **280** physical non-Clifford gates (in the form of raw magic states) are required to be distilled into a single, high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate.
