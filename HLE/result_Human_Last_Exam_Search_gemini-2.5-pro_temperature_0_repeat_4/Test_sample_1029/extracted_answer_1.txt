The Poynting vector is:
For inside the rod (r < R):
$$ \vec{S}_{in} = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2}\hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4\epsilon_0}\hat{z} $$
For outside the rod (r > R):
$$ \vec{S}_{out} = -\frac{E \rho v R^2}{2r}\hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v R^4}{4\epsilon_0 r^2}\hat{z} $$
where $r$ is the radial distance from the axis of the rod, and $\hat{r}$ and $\hat{z}$ are the unit vectors in the radial and axial directions, respectively.
