    "The term \"sum of graphs\" can have several meanings in graph theory. The resulting chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\) depends on which definition of \"sum\" is used. We will consider the two most likely interpretations: the **join** of graphs and the **union** of the edge sets of the graphs.\n\n### Interpretation 1: Join of Three Cycles\n\nThe join of two graphs, \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\), denoted \\( H_1 + H_2 \\), is a graph formed by taking disjoint copies of \\( H_1 \\) and \\( H_2 \\) and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( H_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( H_2 \\). This operation can be extended to three graphs. A key property of the join operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\n\nLet \\( G \\) be the join of three cycles of length \\( n \\), denoted as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The chromatic number of \\( G \\) is given by:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd (for \\( n \\geq 3 \\)):\n*   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite and its chromatic number is 3.\n\nBased on this, we can determine the chromatic number of \\( G \\):\n*   If \\( n \\) is even, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n*   If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n\nThe maximal chromatic number for a graph \\( G \\) that is the join of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is therefore 9, which occurs when \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n### Interpretation 2: Union of the Edges of Three Cycles\n\nAnother interpretation is that \\( G \\) is a graph with \\( n \\) vertices, where the edge set of \\( G \\) is the union of the edge sets of three distinct cycles of length \\( n \\) on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n\nLet \\( G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\), where \\( |V| = n \\) and \\( C_1 = (V, E_1) \\), \\( C_2 = (V, E_2) \\), and \\( C_3 = (V, E_3) \\) are three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\nThe maximum degree of any vertex in \\( G \\) is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). According to Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number of a graph is at most its maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles, it is not a single odd cycle. Therefore, if \\( G \\) is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 6.\n\nFor \\( G \\) to be a complete graph \\( K_n \\), it must have \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) edges. The total number of edges from three \\( n \\)-cycles is at most \\( 3n \\). For \\( G \\) to be \\( K_n \\), we must have \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\leq 3n \\), which simplifies to \\( n-1 \\leq 6 \\), or \\( n \\leq 7 \\).\n\n*   If \\( n = 7 \\), the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\frac{7 \\cdot 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. A 7-cycle has 7 edges, so three 7-cycles have a total of 21 edges. It is a known result that \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles (7-cycles). If these three specific cycles are chosen, their union forms \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7.\n*   For \\( n > 7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) cannot be a complete graph. Thus, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, which is at most 6.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two interpretations, the join of graphs yields a maximal chromatic number of 9, while the union of edges gives a maximal chromatic number of 7. In the context of abstract graph theory problems, the term \"sum\" often refers to the join operation due to its clean algebraic properties with respect to graph invariants like the chromatic number. Therefore, the most likely intended answer is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
