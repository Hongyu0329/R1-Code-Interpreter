    "The ability to overturn a reverse turn is directly related to the fundamental technique of the dance in question. In dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the turning action is generated by Contra Body Movement (CBM) and incorporates body sway. These techniques create a continuous, flowing rotation that can be increased or \"overturned\" for navigational or choreographic purposes. Similarly, the Viennese Waltz reverse turn can be overturned, although it is noted to be difficult when trying to navigate a corner.\n\nThe European Tango, however, operates on a different set of principles. Its technique is characterized by:\n*   **No Body Sway:** The upper body remains still, and there is no side-to-side sway.\n*   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp and precise, not continuous and flowing.\n*   **Unique Turning Mechanism:** Turns are executed as a sharp swivel or pivot, often without the use of CBM as the primary driver of rotation in the way the sway dances use it. The shoulders in a Tango reverse turn stop rotating to allow the hips to catch up.\n\nIn a Tango reverse turn, the specific foot placements (such as Contra Body Movement Position, or CBMP) and the compact, fixed hold create a mechanical limit to the amount of turn possible. Attempting to rotate further would require breaking the core technical elements of the dance, such as introducing sway or improperly using the upper body, which is a direct violation of Tango technique. One video analysis explicitly notes that overturning the body on the second step of a reverse turn would result in a completely different figure (a Fallaway).\n\nTherefore, it is in the European Tango that overturning a reverse turn is impossible without disregarding the dance's fundamental technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
