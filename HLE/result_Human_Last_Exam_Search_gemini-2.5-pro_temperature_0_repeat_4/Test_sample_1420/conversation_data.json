    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat is calculated using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, where ϵ = d_c - d. For a system with a scalar order parameter (like the Ising model), the upper critical dimension, d_c, is 4.\n\nThe key steps in the calculation are:\n1.  Determine the value of ϵ for the given spatial dimension d=3. Here, ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n2.  Use the one-loop epsilon expansion formula for the specific heat exponent α for the general O(n)-vector model. This can be derived from the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - νd, where ν is the correlation length exponent.\n3.  The first-order expansion for α is given by:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n4.  For a system with a scalar order parameter (Ising universality class), the number of components of the order parameter, n, is 1.\n5.  Substituting n=1 and ϵ=1 into the formula gives the value for α.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\nα ≈ (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) * 1\nα ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)\nα ≈ 3 / 18\nα ≈ 1/6\n\nThis result provides a good first-order approximation for the specific heat exponent in three dimensions.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
