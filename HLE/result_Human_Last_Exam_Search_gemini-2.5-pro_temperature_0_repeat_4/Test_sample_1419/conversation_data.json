    "The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is given in terms of ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nIn the context of the renormalization group analysis of the ϕ⁴ theory, the behavior of the coupling constant 'u' under changes in the energy scale is described by the beta function, β(u). A fixed point is a value of the coupling, u*, for which the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale.\n\nThe Lagrangian for the single-component ϕ⁴ theory is typically defined with the interaction term:\nL_int = (u/4!) * ϕ⁴\n\nThe one-loop beta function for this coupling 'u' in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions is:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3u²)/(16π²)\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, β(u*) = 0, yields two possible fixed points:\n1.  The Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0.\n2.  The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nTo find the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, we solve the equation:\n-ϵu* + (3(u*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nThis gives the non-trivial solution:\nu* = (16π²/3) * ϵ\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling. Higher-order corrections will introduce terms proportional to ϵ², ϵ³, and so on. The existence of this non-trivial fixed point for ϵ > 0 is central to the explanation of critical phenomena in systems described by the ϕ⁴ theory, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature.\n\nIt is important to note that the numerical prefactor depends on the normalization chosen for the coupling constant 'u'. The expression provided corresponds to the most common normalization used in quantum field theory textbooks.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ϵ>>>"
