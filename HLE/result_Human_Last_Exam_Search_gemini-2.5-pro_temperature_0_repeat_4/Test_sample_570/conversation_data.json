    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation px+qy=1, where p and q are coprime integers, is a classic problem in the field of geometry of numbers. The value of this minimal area is **12/π²**.\n\nThis problem can be formally stated as finding the minimum area of a convex set K such that for every pair of coprime integers (p, q), there exists a point (x, y) in K satisfying the equation px + qy = 1.\n\nThe convex domain that achieves this minimal area is a specific, centrally symmetric shape defined by an infinite number of linear constraints. This domain, let's call it K₀, is the set of all points (x, y) in the plane that satisfy the inequality |px + qy| ≤ 1 for all pairs of coprime integers (p, q).\n\nThis set K₀ is a convex polygon with infinitely many sides. Its boundary is formed by the envelope of the lines px + qy = 1 and px + qy = -1 for all coprime (p,q). The vertices of this polygon are located at specific integer coordinate points. For instance, the points (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1) are vertices of this shape, as are points like (1,1), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nThe calculation of the area of this specific domain is a non-trivial result from the geometry of numbers. It has been established in mathematical literature, for instance in the work of mathematicians like L. J. Mordell and C. A. Rogers, that the area of this particular convex set K₀ is exactly 12/π².\n\nIt is conjectured, and widely accepted for this problem, that the minimal area is achieved by a centrally symmetric domain. Under this assumption, any convex domain satisfying the given conditions must contain a set congruent to K₀, and therefore its area must be at least 12/π².\n\nFor comparison, the well-known convex shape defined by |x| + |y| ≤ 1, a square rotated by 45 degrees, also intersects all the specified lines and has an area of 2. The value 12/π² is approximately 1.216, which is significantly smaller than 2.\n\n<<<12/π²>>>"
