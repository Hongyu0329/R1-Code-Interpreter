    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, a process of network analysis and summarization is required.\n\nFirst, let's define the IP address range for each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** This network has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. The range of IP addresses is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network also has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. The range of IP addresses is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are not contiguous in a way that allows for a simple summarization into a single, larger network block without including other, unwanted networks. A standard supernet that encompasses both would be `172.20.0.0/16`, which covers all addresses from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, making it too broad and not the \"smallest appropriate\" entry.\n\nHowever, access control lists, particularly in Cisco environments, can utilize non-contiguous wildcard masks to match complex patterns. A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask and tells the device which bits of an IP address to check.\n\nTo find a single ACL entry for these two specific networks, we must find a base address and a wildcard mask that uniquely identifies the combined range. The combined range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nLet's analyze the third octet in binary:\n*   The first network range (`96-127`) can be represented as `011xxxxx`.\n*   The second network range (`128-159`) can be represented as `100xxxxx`.\n\nA single ACL entry that can match these two distinct patterns is not straightforward. Standard summarization techniques do not apply cleanly. If a single entry is required, it implies the use of a complex, non-contiguous wildcard mask. However, finding a single, simple wildcard mask that covers exactly these two networks and no others is not possible with standard ACL logic.\n\nGiven the constraints, the most appropriate and precise method to control access for exactly these two networks is to use two separate ACL entries:\n1.  `permit 172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255`\n2.  `permit 172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255`\n\nSince the question insists on a single entry, and a perfect, non-inclusive summary is not possible, there might be an intended \"trick\" answer involving a specific non-contiguous wildcard mask. After extensive analysis, no such single entry can be formed that is both simple and accurate. Therefore, the premise of finding a single \"smallest appropriate\" entry is likely flawed, and the correct approach is to use two entries.\n\nHowever, if forced to provide a single entry that is the \"smallest\" possible supernet containing both, one could argue for `172.20.64.0/18` and `172.20.128.0/18`, but neither covers the other. The smallest single contiguous block covering both is `172.20.0.0/16`, which is not \"appropriate\".\n\nBased on the technical impossibility of a single, precise entry, the most accurate answer reflects the need for two separate lines in an access control list.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.31.255 and 172.20.128.0 0.0.31.255>>>"
