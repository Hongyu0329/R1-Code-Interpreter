    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nA power subgroup Gᵏ is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group G. To find the number of distinct power subgroups, we analyze the subgroups generated for different values of k.\n\n1.  **When k is an odd integer:**\n    For any odd integer k, the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements, Q_128ᵏ, is the group Q_128 itself. This is because the elements generated by aᵏ will form the entire cyclic subgroup <a> (since k is coprime to the order of <a>), and the k-th powers of elements of the form aⁱx will, together with <a>, generate the entire group Q_128. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **When k is an even integer:**\n    Let k = 2m for some integer m ≥ 1. The power subgroup Q_128ᵏ is generated by the k-th powers of all elements.\n    *   The k-th power of an element aⁱ from the cyclic subgroup is aⁱᵏ. These generate the subgroup <aᵏ>.\n    *   The k-th power of an element aⁱx is (aⁱx)ᵏ = ((aⁱx)²)ᵐ = (a³²)ᵐ = a³²ᵐ.\n    The resulting power subgroup is generated by <aᵏ> and a³²ᵐ. Since a³²ᵐ is already an element of <aᵏ>, the power subgroup is simply <aᵏ>. The specific subgroup is determined by the greatest common divisor of k and 64, which is <aᵍᶜᵈ(ᵏ,⁶⁴)>.\n\n    As k is even, we examine the distinct subgroups that can be formed this way:\n    *   k = 2: Q_128² = <a²>, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n    *   k = 4: Q_128⁴ = <a⁴>, a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n    *   k = 8: Q_128⁸ = <a⁸>, a cyclic subgroup of order 8.\n    *   k = 16: Q_128¹⁶ = <a¹⁶>, a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    *   k = 32: Q_128³² = <a³²>, a cyclic subgroup of order 2.\n    *   k = 64: Q_128⁶⁴ = <a⁶⁴> = {e}, the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\n    Any other even value of k will result in one of these same subgroups. For instance, Q_128⁶ = <aᵍᶜᵈ(⁶,⁶⁴)> = <a²>. This gives a total of 6 distinct power subgroups for even k.\n\nCombining the results, the set of all distinct power subgroups of Q_128 is {Q_128, <a²>, <a⁴>, <a⁸>, <a¹⁶>, <a³²>, {e}}. These are 7 unique subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
