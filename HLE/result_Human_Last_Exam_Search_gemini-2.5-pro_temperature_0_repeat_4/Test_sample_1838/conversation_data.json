    "To find the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that form the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is a method for drawing a line on a grid of pixels. It determines which pixels should be turned on to create a close approximation of a straight line between two points.\n\nHere are the steps and the resulting pixels for the line from (1,1) to (11,5):\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   dx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Initialize the decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and determine each pixel:**\n    Starting with the first point (1,1), we increment x at each step and decide whether to increment y based on the decision parameter.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. To find the central pixel, we find the middle of this sequence. With 11 pixels, the central pixel is the 6th one in the list.\n\nThe 6th pixel in the sequence is (6, 3).\n\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
