    "To solve the initial value problem, we first need to find the general solution of the differential equation $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a separable differential equation.\n\nFirst, we rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nNext, we separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n$$\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$. The integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We use this to solve for C.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = C\n$$\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nWe want to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the equation:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
