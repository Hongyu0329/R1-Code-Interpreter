    "In the context of the representation theory of posets, a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is of tame representation type if, for any given dimension $d$, the indecomposable representations of dimension $d$ can be classified by a finite number of discrete representations and a finite number of one-parameter families. This is a fundamental concept from Drozd's tame-wild dichotomy, which has been extended from finite-dimensional algebras to posets.\n\nAn upper semilattice is a type of poset where any two elements have a least upper bound (or join). It is a known result in the representation theory of posets that a finite poset is of tame representation type if its associated incidence algebra is tame. This is true for finite upper semilattices. The question specifies that the functor $f$ is tame, which aligns with the properties of its domain $J$ being an upper semilattice.\n\nThe term \"n-resolvable\" is not standard across all of representation theory but, in this context, it refers to the number of parameters required to classify the indecomposable representations that are not of finite type. For tame functors, the indecomposable modules fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. These families are typically parameterized by the polynomial ring in a single variable, $K[x]$, which represents one parameter.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
