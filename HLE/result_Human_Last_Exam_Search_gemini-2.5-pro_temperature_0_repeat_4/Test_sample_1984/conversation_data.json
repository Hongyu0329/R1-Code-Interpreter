    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine the number of stable equilibria, $m$, for the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points**\n\nThe equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nFactor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic factor is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium points are the solutions to this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\n\nTo determine the stability of each equilibrium point, we can use the first derivative test. The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x^*)$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 0:**\n    $$\n    f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1\n    $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 1:**\n    $$\n    f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 - \\epsilon$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is negative. This means that if we start just to the left of 1, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution will move away from 1.\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1 + \\epsilon$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ is also negative. This means that if we start just to the right of 1, $x'(t) < 0$, and the solution will move towards 1.\n\nSince solutions starting on one side of $x=1$ (the left side) move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\n\n**3. Calculate the final expression**\n\nThe number of stable equilibria is $m=1$. We are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m$:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
