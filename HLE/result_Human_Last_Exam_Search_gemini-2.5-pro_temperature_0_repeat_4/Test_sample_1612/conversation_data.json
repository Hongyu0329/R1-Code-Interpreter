    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), a total of 27 players are officially recognized as having won the batting Triple Crown. This prestigious and rare achievement is accomplished when a player leads their league in three key statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs). The total number of Triple Crowns is 28, with some players achieving the feat more than once.\n\nThe landscape of Triple Crown winners has evolved with the formal inclusion of statistics from the Negro Leagues (1920-1948) into MLB's official records. This has rightfully expanded the list to include several legendary players.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Triple Crown winners by league:\n\n*   **American League (AL):** There have been 10 players who have won the Triple Crown in the American League. The most recent player to achieve this was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, ending a 45-year drought in the AL. Other notable AL winners include Ted Williams (who won it twice), Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, and Carl Yastrzemski.\n\n*   **National League (NL):** The National League has seen 6 players win the Triple Crown. The last NL player to accomplish this was Joe Medwick back in 1937.\n\n*   **Negro Leagues:** There were 11 Triple Crown winners in the Negro Leagues. Among them, the legendary Oscar Charleston won it an incredible three times, and Josh Gibson achieved it twice.\n\n*   **American Association (AA):** One player, Tip O'Neill, won the Triple Crown in the American Association in 1887.\n\nFour players in MLB history have won the Triple Crown multiple times:\n\n*   Oscar Charleston (3 times)\n*   Rogers Hornsby (2 times)\n*   Ted Williams (2 times)\n*   Josh Gibson (2 times)\n\nThe most recent Triple Crown winner in MLB was Miguel Cabrera of the Detroit Tigers in 2012, who hit .330 with 44 home runs and 139 RBIs.\n\n<<<27>>>"
