The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_i(t+1) = p \cdot P_{i-1}(t) + q \cdot P_{i+1}(t)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the probabilities of moving right and left, respectively, and indices are taken modulo N. For a symmetric walk ($p=q=1/2$), the transition matrix $\hat{A}$ is a circulant matrix with $A_{j,j-1} = A_{j,j+1} = 1/2$ and all other entries being zero. The eigenvectors of this matrix are indeed of the form $(\mathbf{v}_n)_j = e^{ijk_n}$ with $k_n = 2\pi n/N$, and the corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$ for $n=0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0 = 1$. The second-largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by this eigenvalue and is given by the spectral gap, $\gamma = 1 - \lambda_1 = 1 - \cos(2\pi/N)$.
