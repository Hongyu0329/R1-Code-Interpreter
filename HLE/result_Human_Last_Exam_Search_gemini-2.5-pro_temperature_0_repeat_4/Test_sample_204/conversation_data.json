    "The Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1.\n\nThe provided vector field is a classic example of a Hopfion, a topological soliton in three-dimensional space. Its topological charge, known as the Hopf charge or Hopf invariant, can be determined using several methods, including the direct application of the Whitehead integral formula, or by a more intuitive topological interpretation.\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nwhere `f = atan2(y,x)` and `G` is a function of the spatial coordinates `(x,y,z)`. This formulation is a mapping from the 3D space `R^3` to a 2D sphere `S^2`, where `G` acts as the polar angle (from the z-axis) and `f` is the azimuthal angle.\n\nThe Hopf charge can be understood as the product of two winding numbers: a toroidal winding number and a poloidal winding number.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding (Azimuthal Vorticity):** The term `f = atan2(y,x)` describes the winding of the vector field around the z-axis. As one circles the z-axis in the x-y plane, the angle `f` goes from 0 to 2π, meaning the vector field winds around the z-axis exactly once. This gives a toroidal winding number of `n = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding (Twisting):** The function `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))` controls the \"twist\" of the field. At the central core of the structure (a circle defined by `x*x+y*y=0.5` and `z=0`, where `r2=0`), `G = π`. This corresponds to the vector pointing to the south pole `(0, 0, -1)`. At an infinite distance from the core (`r2` -> ∞), `G` approaches 0, which corresponds to the vector pointing to the north pole `(0, 0, 1)`. As one moves from the core to infinity, the vector field sweeps the entire sphere `S^2` exactly once in the poloidal direction. This gives a poloidal winding number of `m = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is the product of these two integer winding numbers. In this case, `H = n * m = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThis result is also confirmed by the linking number interpretation of the Hopf charge. The preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere `S^2` are closed loops in the 3D space `R^3`. The Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of these two loops. For this specific vector field, the preimage of the south pole is the circle `x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0`, and the preimage of an equatorial point is another circle that is linked with the first one exactly once, confirming that the Hopf charge is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
