    "Based on an analysis of the health scaling mechanics of Terraria in Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players would also be infinite.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Base Health:** In Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu starts with a base health of 3,640 for a single player.\n*   **Multiplayer Health Scaling:** The boss's health increases for each additional player in the game. This scaling is not linear.\n*   **Scaling Formula:** The health multiplier is determined by a complex formula that changes as more players join.\n    *   For the second player, a health multiplier of 35% is added.\n    *   For players 3 through 9, the multiplier increases with each player based on the previous player's boost.\n    *   For 10 or more players, a modified formula is used which is approximately `M_n = ((n - 1.95) * 2 + 8) / 3`, where `M_n` is the health multiplier and `n` is the number of players.\n\nAs the number of players (`n`) approaches infinity, the health multiplier (`M_n`) also approaches infinity, as it grows proportionally to `(2/3) * n`.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical health, which is the base health multiplied by this scaling factor, would also tend towards infinity. While the game has a practical limit of 255 players on a dedicated PC server, the mathematical formula for health scaling does not have a finite upper bound.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
