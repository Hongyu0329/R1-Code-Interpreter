    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThe molecule in question is a triethynyl-substituted triangulene. Triangulenes are a class of triangular graphene flakes. The core structure of this molecule is a triangulene, which possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nTo determine the point group, we analyze the symmetry elements of the molecule:\n\n*   **Principal Axis of Rotation (Cn):** The molecule has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) passing through the center of the triangular structure and perpendicular to the molecular plane. Rotating the molecule by 120 degrees (360/3) around this axis results in an identical-looking molecule.\n\n*   **Perpendicular C2 Axes:** There are three two-fold rotational axes (C2) that are perpendicular to the principal C3 axis. These axes lie in the plane of the molecule and pass through each of the ethynyl groups and the center of the opposite side of the triangle.\n\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh):** The molecule is planar, and therefore has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that lies in the plane of the molecule itself.\n\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σv):** The molecule also possesses three vertical mirror planes (σv). Each of these planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n\n*   **Improper Rotation Axes (Sn):** The presence of a C3 axis and a σh plane implies the existence of an S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nThe combination of a C3 principal axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) uniquely defines the **D3h** point group. Molecules with D3h symmetry include trigonal planar molecules like boron trifluoride (BF3).\n\nA study on triskelion-shaped hexabenzocoronenes, which are structurally related to the molecule in question, reports the synthesis of derivatives with D3h symmetry, further supporting this assignment.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
