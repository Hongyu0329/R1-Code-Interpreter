    "The search results confirm my initial approach.\n and provide the formula for the normalized wave function and the probability density.\n and show worked examples of calculating the probability for a particle in a box for n=2 in a given interval, confirming the integration method.\n and explain the concept of nodes, and specifically for n=2, there is a node at the center of the box (x=L/2), where the probability of finding the particle is zero. This is crucial as the requested interval is centered at this node.\nMy calculation method of integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over the specified interval is correct.\n\nThe probability density function is P(x) = (2/a)sin²(nπx/a).\nFor n=2, P(x) = (2/a)sin²(2πx/a).\nThe probability is the integral of P(x) from 0.495a to 0.505a.\nP = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a)sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nAs I derived earlier, the exact result of this integral is:\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π) / (2π)\n\nLet's calculate this value.\nπ ≈ 3.14159265\n0.02π ≈ 0.06283185\nsin(0.02π) ≈ 0.06279052\n2π ≈ 6.2831853\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279052 / 6.2831853\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.00999342\nP ≈ 0.00000658\nP ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThe approximation I used earlier also gave a very similar result:\nP ≈ (1/12π) * (0.02π)³ = (π²/12) * (0.02)³ ≈ (9.8696/12) * 0.000008 ≈ 0.822 * 0.000008 ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nThe calculation is solid. The probability is extremely small, which is expected because the interval is centered on a node where the probability density is zero.\n\nI am confident in my calculation and understanding of the problem. I can now write the final answer.\n\nFinal check of the question:\n- Particle in 1D box\n- Interval: 0.495a to 0.505a\n- n = 2\n- Find the probability.\n\nAll conditions have been met. The calculation is complete.\nThe probability is approximately 0.00000658, or 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. This can also be expressed as about 0.00066%.\n\nThe question asks for the probability, so a numerical value is expected.\nThe calculation is:\nP = (1/2π) * [ 0.02π - sin(0.02π) ]\nP = (1/2 * 3.14159) * [ 0.02 * 3.14159 - sin(0.02 * 3.14159) ]\nP = (0.15915) * [ 0.062832 - sin(0.062832) ]\nP = (0.15915) * [ 0.062832 - 0.062791 ]\nP = (0.15915) * [ 0.000041 ]\nP = 0.00000652515 which is ~6.5 x 10⁻⁶.\n\nLet's re-run the Taylor expansion approximation:\nP ≈ (8π²/3a³) * ∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] y² dy\nP = (8π²/3a³) * [y³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP = (8π²/9a³) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\nP = (8π²/9a³) * [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³ ]\nP = (16π²/9) * (0.005)³\nP = (16 * 9.8696044 / 9) * 0.000000125\nP = (17.54596) * 0.000000125\nP = 0.000002193\n\nThere is a mistake in my approximation calculation. Let's re-check.\n∫[-0.005a, 0.005a] (8π²/a³) * y² dy\n= (8π²/a³) * [y³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\n= (8π²/3a³) * [ (0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³ ]\n= (8π²/3a³) * [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³ ]\n= (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n= (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 0.000000125\n= (52.6378) * 0.000000125\n= 0.0000065797\nThis matches the exact calculation. My first approximation calculation was correct, the second one had a typo (divided by 9 instead of 3).\n\nThe result is robust.\n\nFinal answer should be the numerical value.\nP = 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\nThe question does not specify the required precision. I will provide the answer with a few significant figures.\nThe probability is a dimensionless quantity.\nThe final answer is the result of the calculation.\nP = 0.00000658.\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
