    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in seven different colors. These colors correspond to the various structural forms, or allotropes, of the element, each with unique physical properties.\n\nThe observable colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\n\n*   **White:** Pure white phosphorus is a waxy, translucent solid.\n*   **Yellow:** When exposed to light, white phosphorus gradually turns yellow. For this reason, it is often referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Greenish (Glow):** White phosphorus is chemiluminescent, meaning it glows in the dark when exposed to oxygen, emitting a faint greenish light.\n*   **Red:** Red phosphorus is a more stable allotrope and has a characteristic dark red color. It can also have an iron-grey lustre.\n*   **Violet:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline allotrope is violet or purple in color.\n*   **Black:** The most thermodynamically stable form, black phosphorus, is a black, flaky solid with a metallic appearance, similar to graphite.\n*   **Blue:** Blue phosphorus is a more recently identified two-dimensional allotrope.\n\n<<<7>>>"
