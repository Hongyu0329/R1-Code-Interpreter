    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit is cataloged in the UniProt database under the accession number P24046. The protein consists of 479 amino acids. The structure of GABAA receptors includes four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4) connected by intracellular and extracellular loops.\n\nBased on the annotations in UniProt for the canonical sequence of P24046:\n*   The third transmembrane domain (TM3) spans amino acid positions 343-365.\n*   The fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) spans amino acid positions 458-479.\n\nThe intracellular linker connecting TM3 and TM4 therefore corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 366 to 457. Analysis of this specific region of the amino acid sequence reveals the presence of a single cysteine (C) residue. While some publications mention a cysteine at position 364, the canonical sequence in UniProt and other databases shows the single cysteine in this linker is located at position 382.\n\n<<<1>>>"
