    "The number of primitive Gaussian-type functions (GTFs) in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom in question. The notation specifies how atomic orbitals are constructed from these primitive functions. Here is a breakdown for hydrogen and for second-row heavy atoms (like Carbon).\n\n### Understanding the 6-311G** Notation\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` can be deconstructed as follows:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence orbitals. It signifies a triple-zeta valence basis set.\n    *   **6**: Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence shell is split into three functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians. In Pople basis sets, the same set of valence primitives is typically used for both s- and p-orbitals.\n*   **\\*\\***: This indicates the addition of polarization functions, which allow for more flexibility in describing chemical bonds.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. This usually consists of 6 Cartesian d-functions (dₓₓ, dᵧᵧ, d₂₂, dₓᵧ, dₓ₂, dᵧ₂), each being a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This consists of 3 p-functions (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), each being a single primitive Gaussian.\n\n### Calculation of Primitive Gaussians\n\nBased on this notation, the total number of primitive Gaussians can be calculated for each type of atom.\n\n#### For a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)\n\nA second-row atom like carbon has 1s core orbitals and 2s/2p valence orbitals.\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** 6 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The valence shell uses a set of primitives split into three groups: 3, 1, and 1. Because the exponents are shared between s and p orbitals, the total number of valence primitives is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Polarization Functions (`*`):** 6 primitive d-functions are added.\n\nTotal primitive Gaussians for a heavy atom = 6 (core) + 5 (valence sp) + 6 (d-polarization) = **17**.\n\n#### For a Hydrogen Atom\n\nA hydrogen atom only has a 1s valence orbital.\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** The orbital is described by a triple-zeta split of 3, 1, and 1 primitive Gaussians. This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Polarization Functions (`**`):** 3 primitive p-functions are added.\n\nTotal primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom = 5 (valence s) + 3 (p-polarization) = **8**.\n\n<<<A 6-311G** basis set contains 17 primitive Gaussians for a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon) and 8 primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom.>>>"
