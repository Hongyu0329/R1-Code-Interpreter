    "The number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 42.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, is a finitely generated infinite 2-group. A key property for determining the number of its subgroups of a given index is the structure of its abelianization, G/[G,G]. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is the elementary abelian group of rank 3, which is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., G/[G,G] ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 correspond to transitive permutation representations of G on a set of 4 elements. The image of such a representation is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S₄. Since G is a 2-group, its homomorphic images must also be 2-groups. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the cyclic group of order 4 (ℤ₄), the Klein four-group (V₄ ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂), and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₄).\n\n1.  **Homomorphisms to ℤ₄**: A homomorphism from G to ℤ₄ must factor through the abelianization of G. Since the abelianization of G is (ℤ/2ℤ)³, which has exponent 2, any element in the image of a homomorphism to ℤ₄ must have an order that divides 2. Therefore, the image cannot be the entire ℤ₄ group, and there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to ℤ₄.\n\n2.  **Homomorphisms to D₄**: The abelianization of D₄ is D₄/[D₄,D₄] ≅ ℤ₂ × ℤ₂. Any homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group G to D₄ must map the commutator subgroup [G,G] to the commutator subgroup [D₄,D₄]. This induces a homomorphism from the abelianization G/[G,G] to D₄/[D₄,D₄]. As the image of G under any homomorphism to D₄ must be a subgroup of D₄ whose own abelianization is a quotient of (ℤ/2ℤ)³, the image cannot be D₄ itself. Thus, there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to D₄.\n\n3.  **Homomorphisms to V₄**: Since surjective homomorphisms to ℤ₄ and D₄ are not possible, any transitive action of G on 4 elements must have V₄ as its image. This implies that all subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group are normal subgroups with the quotient group isomorphic to V₄. The number of such subgroups is equal to the number of surjective homomorphisms from G to V₄.\n\nThese homomorphisms from G to V₄ factor through the abelianization G/[G,G] ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)³. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of surjective homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to (ℤ/2ℤ)².\n\nThe total number of homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to (ℤ/2ℤ)² is |(ℤ/2ℤ)²|³ = 4³ = 64.\n\nA homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of (ℤ/2ℤ)². The proper subgroups of (ℤ/2ℤ)² are the trivial subgroup and three distinct subgroups of order 2.\n*   There is only **1** homomorphism whose image is the trivial subgroup (the zero map).\n*   For each of the three subgroups of order 2, there are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from (ℤ/2ℤ)³ to that subgroup. This gives a total of 3 × 7 = 21 homomorphisms whose image is a subgroup of order 2.\n\nThe number of non-surjective homomorphisms is the sum of these, which is 1 + 21 = 22.\n\nTherefore, the number of surjective homomorphisms is the total number of homomorphisms minus the number of non-surjective ones: 64 - 22 = 42.\n\nEach of these 42 surjective homomorphisms defines a unique normal subgroup of index 4, which is its kernel.\n\n<<<42>>>"
