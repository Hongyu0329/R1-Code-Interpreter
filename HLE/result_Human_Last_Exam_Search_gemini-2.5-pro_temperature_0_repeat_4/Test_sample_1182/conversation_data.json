    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$ has one double point.\n\nTo determine the number of double points, we first need to find a suitable model of the curve whose special fiber (its reduction modulo 2) is a stable curve. A stable curve is a connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes). The number of these nodes is the number of double points in the stable reduction.\n\nThe initial equation is $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nIts reduction modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which simplifies to $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This represents a \"double line\" and is not a stable curve because the singularity is more severe than a node.\n\nTo find a better model, we can perform a birational transformation. Let's introduce new variables $x_1 = x$ and $y_1 = \\frac{y-x}{2}$. This is motivated by the fact that $(y-x)(y+x) = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$, and since $y \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$, $y+x$ is a multiple of 2, implying $y-x$ is also a multiple of 2. The inverse transformation is $x=x_1$ and $y=2y_1+x_1$.\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation gives:\n$(2y_1+x_1)^2 = 8x_1 + x_1^2 + 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 8x_1^5$\n$4y_1^2 + 4x_1y_1 + x_1^2 = 8x_1 + x_1^2 + 4x_1^3 + 4x_1^4 + 8x_1^5$\n\nSubtracting $x_1^2$ from both sides and dividing by 4, we obtain a new model for the curve, let's call it $C'$ (using $x, y$ instead of $x_1, y_1$):\n$C': y^2 + xy = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5$\n\nThis new model is regular over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We now examine its special fiber by reducing the equation modulo 2:\n$C'_s: y^2 + xy - x^3 - x^4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n$y(y+x) \\equiv x^3(1+x) \\pmod{2}$\n\nTo find the singularities of this curve, we compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ and find where they vanish simultaneously on the curve.\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = 2y+x \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = y - 3x^2 - 4x^3 \\equiv y - x^2 \\pmod{2}$\n\nSetting both partial derivatives to zero gives $x=0$ and $y=0$. The point $(0,0)$ lies on the curve $C'_s$, so it is the only singular point.\n\nTo determine the type of singularity, we look at the lowest degree terms of the equation at $(0,0)$, which are $y^2+xy=0$. This can be factored as $y(y+x)=0$, which represents two distinct tangent lines ($y=0$ and $y=-x \\equiv x \\pmod{2}$) at the singular point. This indicates that the singularity is an ordinary double point, also known as a node.\n\nThe curve $C'_s$ is an irreducible curve of genus 2 with a single node. A curve with only nodal singularities is stable. Therefore, $C'_s$ is the stable reduction of the original curve. Since it has exactly one node, the number of double points is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
