    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is most commonly and efficiently achieved by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The optimal and most frequently cited temperature for this direct reaction is 400°C.\n\nThe process typically involves reacting xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container at 400°C and approximately 6 atmospheres of pressure. Nickel is used for the reaction vessel because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas. A patent for this process specifies a temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods exist, such as using an electric discharge, these often require more complex apparatus or result in mixtures of xenon fluorides (XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6) that are difficult to separate. The thermal method at 400°C is noted for producing essentially quantitative yields of XeF4. Lower temperatures can favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF2), while higher temperatures tend to produce xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). Therefore, 400°C represents a balance that efficiently targets the production of XeF4.\n\nBased on the available methods, 400°C is the coldest temperature listed that allows for the efficient and direct synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
