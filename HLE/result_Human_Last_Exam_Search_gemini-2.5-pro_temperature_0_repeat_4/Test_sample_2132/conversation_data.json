    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of this product is 28.0.\n\nThe Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when treated with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, results in a ring contraction to form ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a quantitative measure of a molecule's complexity based on information theory. It considers factors like stereochemistry, unsaturated bonds, branching, and symmetry by summing the information content of each atom's microenvironment. The unit for this complexity measure is the \"mcbit\" (molecular bit). Using the Böttcher Score calculator provided by the Forli Lab at the Scripps Research Institute, the complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (SMILES: CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1) was determined.\n\n<<<28.0>>>"
