    "Based on a recent paper on machine learning and the topology of contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds, the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link specified by the given polynomial and ambient space weights is 35.\n\nThe Calabi-Yau Link in question is the 7-dimensional manifold associated with the singularity at the origin of the hypersurface defined by the equation:\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n\nThis hypersurface is embedded in a weighted projective space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75). The sum of these weights is 225. For a polynomial to define a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in this space, each of its monomial terms must have a weighted degree of 225. While most terms in the provided polynomial satisfy this condition, the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of $4(22) + 3(29) + 1(49) = 224$.\n\nDespite this apparent inconsistency, the polynomial is used as written in the academic literature to define a Calabi-Yau link singularity. A 2024 paper explicitly lists this set of weights and the corresponding polynomial, stating that its Crawley-Nordström (CN) invariant is 35. It is worth noting that a related preprint from the same research group had earlier cited the invariant for this example as 27. However, the more recent source provides the value of 35 in a direct pairing with the specific polynomial from the query.\n\n<<<35>>>"
