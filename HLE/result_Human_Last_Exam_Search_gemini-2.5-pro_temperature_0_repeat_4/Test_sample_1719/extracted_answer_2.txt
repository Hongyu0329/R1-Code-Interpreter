The homotopy-theoretic obstructions are classified by elements in a sequence of groups. The list of groups that build these obstructions is as follows:

*   **Primary Obstruction Group:**
    *   $\pi_1(SO(2k))$

*   **Secondary Obstruction Groups:** These are the groups that classify the homotopy class in $[\Sigma^2 X, SO(2k)]$. They are constructed from the following fundamental groups:
    *   $\tilde{H}_{n-1}(X)$
    *   $\pi_q(SO(2k))$ for $q \ge 1$
