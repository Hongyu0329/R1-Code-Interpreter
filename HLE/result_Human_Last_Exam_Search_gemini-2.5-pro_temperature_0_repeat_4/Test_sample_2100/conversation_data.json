    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nVoznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (1970), later adapted into the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (1981), chronicles Rezanov's 1806 expedition to California and his tragic romance with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of San Francisco. The libretto is based on the real-life events of Rezanov, a chamberlain of the Russian imperial court, who undertook a mission to establish trade with Spanish California to supply Russian settlements in Alaska.\n\nDuring his mission, Rezanov and the fifteen-year-old Concepción fell in love and became engaged. However, Rezanov had to return to Russia to seek permission from the Tsar to marry a Catholic. On his arduous journey across Siberia, he fell ill, died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and was buried there. His grave was initially marked by a stone without any inscription. Concepción, remaining faithful to him, never married and eventually entered a monastery, only learning of his death years later.\n\nThe question of his final resting place, as poetically posed by Voznesensky, saw a resolution of sorts in the late 20th century. In a symbolic ceremony in October 2000, earth and a rose from Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk were brought to Concepción's grave in Benicia, California, finally uniting the two lovers in spirit. This event was the culmination of renewed interest in their story, spurred in part by the immense popularity of Voznesensky's work.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
