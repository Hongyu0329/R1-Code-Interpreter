    "## The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is \"Eudes-Bec\" or \"Odebec\".\n\nThe Gaulish name \"Odobeccus,\" also recorded in historical texts as \"Edobicus,\" is a compound name. Its analysis reveals a direct linguistic lineage to modern French, although a single, definitive equivalent is not in common use today. The most accurate modern French renderings would be **Eudes-Bec** or **Odebec**.\n\nThe etymology of \"Odobeccus\" can be broken down into two distinct Gaulish elements:\n\n*   **Odo-**: This element likely derives from the Gaulish root *odo-*, meaning \"smell\" or \"odor.\" The renowned linguist and expert on the Gaulish language, Xavier Delamarre, translates this component as \"odeur\" (smell) or \"puanteur\" (stench) in his authoritative \"Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise\". While the name \"Odo\" also exists as a name of Germanic origin meaning \"wealth\" or \"possessions,\" its presence in a distinctly Gaulish compound name points towards the Celtic root.\n\n*   **-beccus**: This is the Gaulish word for \"beak,\" which by extension could also mean \"mouth.\" This word was adopted into Latin and subsequently evolved into the modern French word **\"bec,\"** which retains the meaning of \"beak\" and is used colloquially to mean \"mouth.\" The Roman historian Suetonius even noted that \"Beccus\" was a Gaulish nickname meaning \"chicken's beak\".\n\nTherefore, the literal meaning of \"Odobeccus\" is \"he who has the beak/mouth that smells\" or, more bluntly, \"stinking mouth\" or \"bad breath.\" Delamarre directly translates \"Odobeccus\" as **\"Pue-du-Bec\"** (Stinks-from-the-Beak).\n\nWhile \"Pue-du-Bec\" is a literal translation, it is not a modern French given name. The historical figure Odo of Paris, a king of West Francia, bore a name of Germanic, not Gaulish, origin. However, the name \"Odo\" and its French form \"Eudes\" are well-established.\n\nConsidering the linguistic evolution, a modern French equivalent of \"Odobeccus\" would combine the French evolution of its two parts. Thus, **Eudes-Bec** or the more consolidated **Odebec** represent the most faithful modern French equivalents of the ancient Gaulish name. There are no records of \"Sent-du-Bec\" in authoritative linguistic or historical sources as an equivalent for \"Odobeccus.\"\n\n<<<Eudes-Bec>>>"
