    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is the character of the **Wood-Sun** who describes the religious practices of the Romans in a way that readers would recognize as a reference to Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe Wood-Sun, a supernatural being and the lover of the protagonist Thiodolf, possesses a deep, visionary knowledge of the Romans. In Chapter III, \"Thiodolf Talketh with the Wood-Sun,\" she describes the Romans and their city to Thiodolf. She speaks of their banner of battle, which bears the image of a wolf suckling two children. This is a clear allusion to the foundational myth of Rome, in which the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf.\n\nWhile the text does not state that the Wood-Sun physically visited a Roman city in a conventional sense, her supernatural abilities allow her to see and describe their customs and symbols with great accuracy.\n\n<<<The Wood-Sun>>>"
