    "<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit system is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the following transformation of a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i U_i \\rho U_i^\\dagger $$\n    Here, $\\{U_i\\}$ is a basis of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and orthogonal. The coefficients $\\{p_i\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $\\sum_i p_i = 1$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** Any quantum channel can be represented using a Stinespring dilation, which involves a unitary evolution on a larger system composed of the principal system and an environment. The complementary channel describes the evolution of the environment. A fundamental theorem in quantum information theory states that a quantum channel and its complementary channel have the same rank. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix.\n\n3.  **Rank of the Pauli Channel:** The problem is thus reduced to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself. The rank of a channel is determined by the number of linearly independent Kraus operators. For a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are given by $A_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$.\n\n4.  **Choi Matrix and Rank Calculation:** The rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is formally given by the rank of its Choi matrix, $J(\\Lambda)$. The Choi matrix can be expressed as:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{i=0}^{d^2-1} p_i |\\psi_i\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i| $$\n    where the vectors $|\\psi_i\\rangle$ are derived from the Pauli operators $U_i$. The rank of $J(\\Lambda)$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by the $|\\psi_i\\rangle$ corresponding to non-zero probabilities $p_i$.\n\n5.  **Linear Independence of Pauli Operators:** The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_i\\}_{i=0}^{d^2-1}$ form a complete basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. This means they are linearly independent. Consequently, the corresponding vectors $|\\psi_i\\rangle$ are also linearly independent.\n\n6.  **Determining the Rank:** Because the operators are linearly independent, the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is simply the number of non-zero probabilities $p_i$ in its definition. Let this number be $k$. So, for a given Pauli channel, the rank is $k$.\n\n7.  **Maximizing the Rank:** The question asks for the *maximal* rank. To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_i$. The maximum possible number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$, which is the total number of Pauli operators.\n\n8.  **Example of a Maximal Rank Channel:** An example of a Pauli channel that achieves this maximal rank is the completely depolarizing channel, where each Pauli operator is applied with equal probability: $p_i = 1/d^2$ for all $i = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. For this channel, all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero, so its rank is $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of the original channel, the maximal rank for the complementary channel of any Pauli channel is also $d^2$.\n\n$d^2$>>>"
