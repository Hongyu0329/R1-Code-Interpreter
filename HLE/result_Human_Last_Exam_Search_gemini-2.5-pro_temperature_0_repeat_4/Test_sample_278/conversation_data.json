    "To find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the figure made by the given parametric curve, we first need to determine the bounding box of the figure. This means finding the minimum and maximum values for x and y.\n\nThe parametric equations for the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b\\sin t$\n\nwhere $b=1$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $b=5$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\n\n**1. Finding the range of x:**\nThe x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\cos t$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n*   The maximum value of x is $x_{max} = 1$ (at $t=0$).\n*   The minimum value of x is $x_{min} = -1$ (at $t=\\pi$).\nThe width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values:\nWidth = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n**2. Finding the range of y:**\nThe y-coordinate depends on the value of $b$.\n\n*   **For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:**\n    $y = 1 \\cdot \\sin t = \\sin t$.\n    In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   The maximum value of y in this part is $y_{max1} = 1$ (at $t=\\pi/2$).\n    *   The minimum value of y in this part is $y_{min1} = 0$ (at $t=0$ and $t=\\pi$).\n\n*   **For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:**\n    $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0).\n    *   The minimum value of y in this part is $y_{min2} = -5$ (at $t=3\\pi/2$).\n    *   The y-values approach 0 as t approaches $\\pi$ and $2\\pi$.\n\nCombining the ranges for y, the overall maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$ and the overall minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$.\nThe height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values:\nHeight = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**3. Determining the side of the smallest circumscribing square:**\nA square that outcircles the figure must have a side length that is at least as large as both the width and the height of the figure.\n*   Width = 2\n*   Height = 6\nThe side length of the smallest square must be equal to the larger of these two dimensions, which is 6.\n\n**4. Calculating the area of the square:**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\nArea = $(\\text{side length})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe figure described is the upper semi-unit circle combined with the lower half of an ellipse with semi-axes of 1 and 5. The smallest square that can contain this shape must have a side length equal to the maximum dimension of the shape, which is its height of 6.\n\n<<<36>>>"
