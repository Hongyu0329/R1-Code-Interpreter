    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, q) for an odd prime power q can be determined by identifying the conjugacy classes of involutions and the orders of their centralizers.\n\nFor G = PSU(4, q) with q odd, there are two conjugacy classes of involutions. This is a known result from the study of the structure of finite classical groups. These two classes can be described by their preimages in the special unitary group SU(4, q). Involutions in PSU(n, q) are the images of elements `g` in SU(n, q) for which `g^2` is in the center of SU(n, q). For PSU(4, q), the center of SU(4, q) is of order `d = gcd(4, q+1)`. For q = 997, `d = gcd(4, 998) = 2`, and the center is `{I, -I}`. Thus, involutions in PSU(4, 997) arise from elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\nThe two classes of involutions and their centralizer orders are:\n1.  **Semisimple involutions**: These are images of elements `g ∈ SU(4, q)` such that `g^2 = I` and `g ≠ I`. These elements are conjugate to a matrix of the form `diag(-1, -1, 1, 1)`. The centralizer of such an involution in PSU(4, q) has order `q^2(q^2-1)^2`.\n2.  **Skew-involutions**: These are images of elements `g ∈ SU(4, q)` such that `g^2 = -I`. The centralizer of this type of involution in PSU(4, q) is isomorphic to PGL(2, q²) and has order `q^2(q^4-1)`.\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes. The size of a conjugacy class `C(t)` is given by `|G| / |C_G(t)|`, where `|G|` is the order of the group and `|C_G(t)|` is the order of the centralizer of an element `t` in that class.\n\nThe order of PSU(4, q) is given by the formula:\n`|PSU(4, q)| = (1/d) * q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\nFor n=4 and q=997, d=2, so:\n`|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1)(997^3 + 1)(997^4 - 1)`\n\nThe number of involutions in the first class (`N_1`) is:\n`N_1 = |PSU(4, q)| / |C_1| = [ (1/2) * q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) ] / [ q^2(q^2-1)^2 ]`\n`N_1 = (1/2) * q^4 * (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / (q^2-1)`\n`N_1 = (1/2) * q^4 * (q^3+1)(q^2+1)`\n\nThe number of involutions in the second class (`N_2`) is:\n`N_2 = |PSU(4, q)| / |C_2| = [ (1/2) * q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1) ] / [ q^2(q^4-1) ]`\n`N_2 = (1/2) * q^4 * (q^2-1)(q^3+1)`\n\nThe total number of involutions is `N = N_1 + N_2`:\n`N = (1/2)q^4 * [ (q^3+1)(q^2+1) + (q^2-1)(q^3+1) ]`\n`N = (1/2)q^4 * (q^3+1) * [ (q^2+1) + (q^2-1) ]`\n`N = (1/2)q^4 * (q^3+1) * (2q^2)`\n`N = q^6(q^3+1)`\n\nSubstituting q = 997, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is:\n`997^6 * (997^3 + 1)`\n\nCalculating the values:\n*   `997^3 = 991,026,973`\n*   `997^3 + 1 = 991,026,974`\n*   `997^6 = (997^3)^2 = 982,134,461,868,333,029`\n\nSo, the total number of involutions is:\n`982,134,461,868,333,029 * 991,026,974 = 973,323,035,444,313,815,118,380,526`\n\n<<<997^6 * (997^3 + 1)>>>"
