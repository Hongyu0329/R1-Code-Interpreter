    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nAll numbers in this sequence are multiples of 6. While the differences between consecutive numbers do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression, a pattern emerges when analyzing the numbers modulo 12.\n\nThe remainders of the numbers in the sequence when divided by 12 are as follows:\n6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0.\n\nThis sequence of remainders consists of blocks of 0s and 6s. The sequence ends with a block of two zeros. Based on the established pattern, it is logical to assume that the next number will have a remainder of 6 when divided by 12.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. The next multiple of 6 is 2358. To verify if this fits the pattern, we find its remainder when divided by 12:\n2358 รท 12 = 196 with a remainder of 6.\n\nTherefore, 2358 is the next number that logically follows the established pattern.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
