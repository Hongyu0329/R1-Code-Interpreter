    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Structure of Primitive Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nSo, a primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $36036$ must be of the form:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo the respective prime power $p^a$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is $6$. This implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6, which means it must be divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\n### 4. Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, whose order is a divisor of 6.\n\n*   **Modulo $4 = 2^2$**: The group of characters modulo 4, $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to $C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The principal character has conductor 1. The other character has order 2 and is primitive. So, there is **1** primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n\n*   **Modulo $9 = 3^2$**: The group of characters modulo 9, $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to $C_6$. There are $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The characters induced from modulo 3 are not primitive; their orders are 1 and 2. The remaining $\\phi(9)-\\phi(3) = 6-2=4$ characters are primitive. Their orders are the remaining orders in $C_6$, which are 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) are divisors of 6. So, there are $2+2=4$ choices for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Modulo $7$**: The group of characters modulo 7, $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to $C_6$. The only non-primitive character is the principal character (order 1). All other $\\phi(7)-1=5$ characters are primitive. Their orders are 2, 3, and 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Modulo $11$**: The group of characters modulo 11, $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to $C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 5, and 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    So, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Modulo $13$**: The group of characters modulo 13, $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to $C_{12}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### 5. Combining the Results\nThe total number of ways to choose the tuple of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that each has an order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of tuples = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for all these 100 combinations.\nLet the orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n*   $o_4$ must be 2.\n*   $o_9$ must be 3 or 6.\n*   $o_7$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   $o_{11}$ must be 2.\n*   $o_{13}$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\nThe lcm must be a multiple of 2. This is guaranteed because $o_4 = 2$ (and $o_{11}=2$).\nThe lcm must be a multiple of 3. This is guaranteed because the order of $\\chi_9$, $o_9$, must be either 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it is a multiple of 6. As all individual orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. The only multiple of 6 that is also a divisor of 6 is 6 itself.\nTherefore, every one of the 100 combinations of primitive characters results in a character of order 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $36036$ and order $6$ is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
