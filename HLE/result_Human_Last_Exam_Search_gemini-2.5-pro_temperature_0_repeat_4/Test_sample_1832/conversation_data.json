    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, and uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. For this metric, there are 9 unique non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\nThe Christoffel symbols, denoted as $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, are mathematical objects derived from the metric tensor that describe the gravitational field. They are symmetric in their two lower indices, meaning $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\nIn the standard spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r$\n*   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\Gamma_{rt}^t$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi$\n\nCounting these unique, independent components results in a total of 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols. Some sources might mention 13 non-zero symbols; this number arises from counting components like $\\Gamma_{tr}^t$ and $\\Gamma_{rt}^t$ separately before considering their inherent symmetry. However, the standard practice is to count the number of independent, non-zero symbols.\n\n<<<9>>>"
