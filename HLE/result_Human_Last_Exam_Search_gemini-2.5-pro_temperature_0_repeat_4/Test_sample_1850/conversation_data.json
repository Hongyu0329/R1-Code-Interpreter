    "## Six Historical Saints Named in Milton's Epic, *Paradise Lost*\n\nJohn Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*, names six figures who are recognized as historical saints within various Christian traditions. These characters play significant roles in the celestial and earthly drama that unfolds throughout the narrative.\n\nThe historical saints mentioned by name are:\n\n*   **Adam:** The first man created by God, a central figure in the poem whose fall from grace is a primary focus. Adam is venerated as a saint in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.\n*   **Eve:** The first woman and Adam's partner, whose temptation by Satan leads to the original sin. Like Adam, Eve is considered a saint in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions.\n*   **Michael:** The powerful archangel who leads God's army against Satan's rebellion. He is venerated as a saint in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestant denominations.\n*   **Gabriel:** The archangel messenger of God. Gabriel is also a revered saint across major Christian traditions.\n*   **Raphael:** The archangel sent by God to warn Adam and Eve of the impending danger. Raphael is recognized as a saint in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\n*   **Uriel:** An archangel who serves as a guardian of the Garden of Eden. While his veneration is not as widespread as the other archangels, Uriel is considered a saint in some Anglican and Eastern Orthodox traditions.\n\nWhile other celestial beings and biblical figures are mentioned, these six are the named individuals in *Paradise Lost* who are also formally recognized as saints in historical Christianity.\n\n<<<6>>>"
