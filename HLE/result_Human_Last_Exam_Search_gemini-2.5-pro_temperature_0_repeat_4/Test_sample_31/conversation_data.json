    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver must observe a specific number of non-top-facing stickers on the last layer. This allows for what is known as \"2-Side PLL Recognition,\" a technique that avoids the need to look at all four sides of the cube, thus saving time.\n\nWhen viewing the last layer from two adjacent sides (for instance, the front and right faces), a total of six non-top-facing stickers are visible. These stickers belong to three corner pieces and two edge pieces. However, to distinguish between all 21 PLL cases, it is not always necessary to see all six of these stickers.\n\nThrough careful analysis of the possible permutations, it has been determined that a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers are required to uniquely identify any given PLL case. While many cases can be distinguished with fewer stickers, some require the information from five stickers to be resolved unambiguously. There are established systems and guides, such as the \"5 Sticker PLL Recognition\" method, that detail how to identify each case based on this minimal information.\n\nTherefore, to guarantee the correct identification of any of the 21 PLL cases, a solver must see 5 non-top-facing stickers.\n\n<<<5>>>"
