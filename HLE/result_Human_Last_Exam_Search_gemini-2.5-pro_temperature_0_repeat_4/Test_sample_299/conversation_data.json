    "An analysis of the functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ for continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ reveals the following properties for any potential solution $f$:\n\n1.  **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Thus, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Range**: The range of $f(f(x))$ is the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. Let $R(f)$ be the range of $f$. Then the range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f))$. So, $f(R(f)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe can now analyze the two cases for monotonicity.\n\n### Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $R(f)$ is an open interval $(A, B)$, where $A = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$ and $B = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$. Since $f$ is defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is all of $\\mathbb{R}$ if it's an onto function, or a bounded interval.\n\nThe range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(R(f)) = f((A,B))$. Since $f$ is decreasing, this is $(\\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to A^+} f(y))$. This must be equal to $(0, \\infty)$.\nThis implies $\\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to A^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n\nThe condition $\\lim_{y \\to A^+} f(y) = \\infty$ is impossible if $A$ is a finite number and $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, we must have $A = -\\infty$.\nThe condition $\\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y) = 0$ implies, by continuity, that if $B$ is finite, then $f(B) = 0$.\n\nSo, for a decreasing solution, we have:\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = B$ for some finite $B$.\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n*   The range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, B)$.\n*   $f(B) = 0$. Since $0$ must be in the range of $f$, we have $0 \\in (-\\infty, B)$, which means $B > 0$.\n\nFrom $f(B) = 0$, we can apply $f$ again: $f(f(B)) = f(0)$.\nFrom the original equation, $f(f(B)) = \\exp(B)$.\nThus, we must have $f(0) = \\exp(B)$.\n\nHowever, the range of $f$ is $(-\\infty, B)$, which means that for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $f(x) < B$. For $x=0$, this implies $f(0) < B$.\nThis leads to the contradiction $\\exp(B) < B$. The function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has an absolute minimum at $x=0$, where $g(0)=1$. Thus, $e^x > x$ for all real numbers $x$. The condition $e^B < B$ can never be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\n### Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $R(f)$ is an open interval $(A, B)$, where $A = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $B = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\nThe range of $f \\circ f$ is $f((A,B)) = (\\lim_{y \\to A^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y))$, which must equal $(0, \\infty)$.\nThis implies $\\lim_{y \\to A^+} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y) = \\infty$.\n\nBy continuity, if $A$ is finite, $f(A) = 0$. The condition $\\lim_{y \\to B^-} f(y) = \\infty$ implies that $B$ cannot be a finite number at which $f$ is continuous, so $B=\\infty$.\nSo, for an increasing solution, we have:\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = A$ for some finite $A$.\n*   $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n*   The range of $f$ is $(A, \\infty)$.\n*   $f(A) = 0$. Since $0$ must be in the range of $f$, we have $0 \\in (A, \\infty)$, which means $A < 0$.\n\nFrom $f(A)=0$, we find $f(f(A)) = f(0)$, which gives $f(0) = \\exp(A)$. This is consistent, as $A<0$ implies $f(A)=0 > A$, and $f(0) = e^A > A$.\n\nThe construction of such functions shows that there is a large degree of freedom. A solution can be constructed by:\n1.  Choosing any constant $A \\in (-\\infty, 0)$.\n2.  Choosing any continuous, strictly increasing bijection $\\psi$ from the interval $[A, 0]$ to the interval $[0, e^A]$.\n3.  This choice uniquely determines the function $f$ over its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}$. For $x \\in (A, \\infty)$, $f(x)$ is determined by the relation $f(x) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x))$. For $x \\le A$, $f(x)$ is determined by $f(x) = \\psi^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n\nThe set of solutions is therefore parameterized by the choice of $A$ and the choice of $\\psi$.\n*   The set of possible values for $A$ is $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For each choice of $A$, the set of continuous, strictly increasing bijections $\\psi$ from $[A, 0]$ to $[0, e^A]$ also has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function is determined by its values on a dense set (like the rationals), and there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to define these values consistently.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the cardinalities of these choices, which is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThus, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
