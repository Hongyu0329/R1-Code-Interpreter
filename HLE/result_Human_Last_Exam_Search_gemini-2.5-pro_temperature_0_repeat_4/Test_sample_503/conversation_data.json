    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ along with 2-morphisms $id_A \\to g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\to id_B$. In the context of the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the objects are finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, the 1-morphisms are order-preserving maps, and the 2-morphisms are given by the pointwise order on maps.\n\nLet $f: \\to$ and $g: \\to$ be order-preserving maps. The conditions for an internal adjunction are:\n1.  $id_{} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in$.\n2.  $f \\circ g \\le id_{}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in$.\n\nThis pair of conditions defines a **Galois connection** between the posets $$ and $$. The problem is therefore equivalent to counting the number of Galois connections from $$ to $$.\n\nA Galois connection between two posets $P$ and $Q$ is determined by a pair of subsets: the set of *closed* elements $A \\subseteq P$ and the set of *open* elements $B \\subseteq Q$, together with an order-isomorphism between them.\n\nFor a poset which is a finite chain like $[n]$, the properties of these subsets are simple:\n*   A subset $A \\subseteq [n]$ is the set of fixed points of a closure operator (i.e., the set of closed elements) if and only if it contains the maximal element, $n$.\n*   A subset $B \\subseteq [n]$ is the set of fixed points of a kernel operator (i.e., the set of open elements) if and only if it contains the minimal element, $0$.\n\nIn our case, an adjunction from $$ to $$ is determined by:\n1.  A set of closed elements $A \\subseteq$ which must contain $23$.\n2.  A set of open elements $B \\subseteq$ which must contain $0$.\n3.  An order-isomorphism between $A$ and $B$.\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are subsets of totally ordered sets, they are themselves totally ordered. An order-isomorphism between them exists if and only if they have the same cardinality, and if it exists, it is unique.\n\nTherefore, the task reduces to counting the number of pairs of subsets $(A, B)$ such that:\n*   $A \\subseteq$ and $23 \\in A$.\n*   $B \\subseteq$ and $0 \\in B$.\n*   $|A| = |B|$.\n\nLet's count these pairs by their common cardinality, $k$.\n\n*   The number of subsets $A \\subseteq$ of size $k$ containing $23$: We must choose the element $23$, and then choose $k-1$ additional elements from the remaining $23$ elements in $$ (i.e., from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 22\\}$). The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{23}{k-1}$. The size $k$ can range from $1$ (for $A=\\{23\\}$) to $24$ (for $A=$).\n\n*   The number of subsets $B \\subseteq$ of size $k$ containing $0$: We must choose the element $0$, and then choose $k-1$ additional elements from the remaining $37$ elements in $$ (i.e., from $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 37\\}$). The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{37}{k-1}$. The size $k$ can range from $1$ (for $B=\\{0\\}$) to $38$ (for $B=$).\n\nTo find the total number of adjunctions, we sum the product of these counts over all possible values of $k$. The common size $k$ can range from $1$ to $\\min(24, 38) = 24$.\nLet $j = k-1$. The total number is:\n$$ N = \\sum_{k=1}^{24} \\binom{23}{k-1} \\binom{37}{k-1} = \\sum_{j=0}^{23} \\binom{23}{j} \\binom{37}{j} $$\nThis sum is a known binomial identity, a corollary of Vandermonde's Identity, which states that $\\sum_{j} \\binom{n}{j} \\binom{m}{j} = \\binom{n+m}{n}$. This can be proven by considering the coefficient of $x^n$ in the expansion of $(1+x)^{n+m} = (1+x)^n (1+x^{-1})^m x^m$.\n\nApplying this identity with $n=23$ and $m=37$, we get:\n$$ N = \\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThis is also equal to $\\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\\binom{60}{23}>>>"
