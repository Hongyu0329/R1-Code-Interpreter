    "I am unable to provide the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle. While a well-known database for circle packing problems, maintained by Eckard Specht, likely contains this information, the specific data for 1135 circles, including its symmetry group, could not be retrieved through the available search tools.\n\nThe website, \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle,\" lists various parameters for packings, including the symmetry group in Schoenflies notation. Although a page for the packing of 1135 circles exists on this site, the search results did not contain the specific table entry that would list its symmetry group. Therefore, the answer to your question cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
