    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **suster** (pronounced to rhyme with \"muster\") or possibly **swester**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is the result of linguistic influence from Old Norse. The original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor** (with dialectal variations such as *swustor* and *swester*). Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* originate from the same Proto-Germanic word, *\\*swestēr*. This shared ancestry is why cognates like the German *Schwester* and Dutch *zuster* are recognizable.\n\nDuring the Middle English period, the native *sweostor* evolved into forms like **suster**. However, the prevalence of the Old Norse *systir* among Viking settlers heavily influenced the English word, eventually shifting the vowel from \"u\" to \"i\" and giving us the modern \"sister\".\n\nWithout this Norse intervention, the Middle English form *suster* would have likely undergone the natural phonetic shifts of the English language. The short \"u\" sound, as seen in *suster*, typically evolved into the /ʌ/ vowel sound heard in modern words like \"cup\" or \"dull\". Therefore, the word would have most plausibly become **suster**.\n\n<<<suster"
