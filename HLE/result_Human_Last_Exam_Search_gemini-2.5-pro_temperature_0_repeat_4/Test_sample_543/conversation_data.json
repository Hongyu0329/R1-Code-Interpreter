    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction:\n*   **Reactant Analysis**: The starting material, 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, has three halogen atoms attached to a benzene ring. Phenyl magnesium bromide is a strong nucleophile and a strong base.\n*   **Reactivity of Halogens**: In reactions with Grignard reagents, the reactivity of halogens on an aromatic ring generally follows the order I > Br > Cl. This is because the Carbon-Iodine bond is the weakest and most easily broken.\n*   **Step 1: Substitution of Iodine**: The most reactive site is the carbon atom bonded to iodine. The phenyl group from the Grignard reagent will first substitute the iodine atom. This is a type of cross-coupling reaction.\n*   **Step 2: Substitution of Bromines**: Since an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide is used, the reaction continues. The two bromine atoms are subsequently replaced by phenyl groups.\n*   **Final Product Formation**: The sequential replacement of all three halogen atoms (one iodine and two bromines) by phenyl groups leads to a benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n*   **Aqueous Work-up**: The final step involving an aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent, converting it to benzene, and to protonate any magnesium salts, which are then removed from the organic product.\n\nThe final product, which has the chemical formula C₂₄H₁₈, is named 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
