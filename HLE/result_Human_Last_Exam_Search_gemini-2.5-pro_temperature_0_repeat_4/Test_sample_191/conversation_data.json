    "### Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG) Breakdown Enhances Macrophage Engulfment of Amyloid\n\nThe breakdown or reduction of Glia Maturation Factor-γ (GMFG) allows for the increased engulfment of amyloid-β by macrophages. GMFG is a protein highly expressed in immune cells that plays a role in regulating the phagocytic activity of macrophages.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that when GMFG is reduced or \"knocked down\" in macrophages, their ability to phagocytose amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), a primary component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, is significantly increased. Conversely, overexpression of GMFG leads to a reduction in the uptake of Aβ42 by these immune cells.\n\nThe mechanism by which GMFG regulates amyloid engulfment is linked to its influence on the scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI). SR-AI is a cell-surface receptor that has been implicated in the clearance of amyloid-β. By modulating GMFG levels, it is possible to influence the expression and activity of SR-AI, thereby affecting the macrophage's capacity to clear amyloid deposits.\n\nWhile other proteins are involved in the broader process of amyloid clearance by macrophages, such as apolipoprotein E (apoE) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) which assist in the degradation of amyloid-β, GMFG is specifically identified as a protein whose reduction directly facilitates the initial engulfment process. Additionally, receptors like TREM2 are also known to be involved in the phagocytosis of cellular debris and amyloid by myeloid cells.\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
