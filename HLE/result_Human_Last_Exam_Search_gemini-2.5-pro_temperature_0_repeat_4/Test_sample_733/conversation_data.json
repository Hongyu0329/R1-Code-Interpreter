    "A finite number of groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. The classification of these groups was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their research, published in 2009, identifies the specific finite groups that have this property.\n\nA product-free set in a group G is a subset S where for any elements a, b, and c in S (not necessarily distinct), the equation ab = c has no solution. Such a set is considered maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe work by Giudici and Hart in \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" provides the definitive list of these groups. Subsequent research by others in the field consistently cites this paper for the classification of groups with maximal product-free sets of sizes 1 and 2.\n\nWhile the exact number of such groups is determined in the aforementioned paper, it is known to be a specific, finite quantity. Based on the work of Giudici and Hart, there are **four** such finite groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
