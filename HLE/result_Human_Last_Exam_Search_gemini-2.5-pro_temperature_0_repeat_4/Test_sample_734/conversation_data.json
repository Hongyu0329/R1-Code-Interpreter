    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential changes in the laws of nature at the Fall is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nThe specific terminology he developed is that of ***rationes seminales***, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons,\" \"causal principles,\" or \"seedlike principles.\" This concept, which Augustine adapted from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy, became a cornerstone of his theology of creation and miracles.\n\nAccording to Augustine, God embedded these \"seminal reasons\" into matter at the initial creation. These are latent potentialities, or hidden causalities, for all things that would come into being later. This framework allows for two kinds of development:\n1.  The natural, ordinary unfolding of events according to the regular patterns we observe as the laws of nature.\n2.  Miraculous events, which are the actualization of special *rationes seminales* that lie outside the normal course of nature.\n\nThis terminology was applicable to both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth**: For Augustine, the virgin birth was not a violation of the natural order God created, but the activation of a unique, pre-ordained potentiality—a seminal reason—that God had placed within creation from the beginning. He argued that it was fitting for Christ, the Head of the Church, to be born in this miraculous way to signify that his members would be born of a \"virgin Church.\" The event is therefore contrary to the *usual* course of nature, but not contrary to God's overarching will and design for nature.\n\n*   **The Fall**: The negative changes to the natural world and human nature after the Fall of Man, such as the introduction of disease, death, and a nature that is more difficult to cultivate, can be understood within this framework. These changes represent a shift in the way nature operates, an unfolding of negative potentialities as a consequence of sin. Augustine taught that the Fall led to the weakening of human faculties and subjected humanity to death, representing a change in the functioning of the natural order.\n\nWhile other theologians like Thomas Aquinas would later develop related concepts such as \"obediential potency\"—the capacity of a created thing to be used by God beyond its natural power—it was Augustine who first developed the specific terminology of *rationes seminales* to describe how such changes in the laws of nature were part of God's plan from the beginning.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
