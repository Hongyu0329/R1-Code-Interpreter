    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which form the basis for the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n### Analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory\n\n1.  **Electron Count and Reaction Type**: Deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a conjugated polyene with four π-bonds, meaning it is an 8π-electron system. Since 8 can be expressed as 4n where n=2, this system follows the rules for 4n π-electron systems. The reaction is an intramolecular electrocyclization that occurs under thermal conditions.\n\n2.  **HOMO Symmetry and Mode of Ring Closure**: According to FMO theory, the stereochemical outcome of a thermal pericyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground-state polyene. For an 8π-electron system (a 4n system), the HOMO (ψ₄) is antisymmetric, meaning the lobes of the p-orbitals at the two termini of the conjugated system have opposite phases on the same face of the π-system. To achieve constructive, in-phase overlap and form a new σ-bond, the termini must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This mode of ring closure is called **conrotatory**. The alternative, a disrotatory closure, would involve unfavorable antibonding interaction and is therefore symmetry-forbidden under thermal conditions.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant and Product**:\n    *   The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the geometry of the substituents at the termini of the reacting conjugated system (C2 and C9) and the mode of ring closure. Let's assume the substituents are methyl groups, leading to the formation of 7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n    *   At the C2 terminus, the double bond has a *Z* configuration.\n    *   At the C9 terminus, the double bond has an *E* configuration.\n    *   To visualize the ring closure, we can draw the polyene in a 'C' shape. The substituents at the termini will point either into or out of the curve. For the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer, the methyl group at C2 points \"inward,\" while the methyl group at C9 points \"outward.\"\n    *   During a **conrotatory** ring closure, both termini rotate in the same direction. Let's consider both possible conrotatory motions:\n        *   **Both rotate clockwise**: The inward-pointing methyl group at C2 moves \"up,\" and the outward-pointing methyl group at C9 also moves \"up.\" This results in both methyl groups being on the same side of the newly formed ring.\n        *   **Both rotate counter-clockwise**: The inward-pointing methyl group at C2 moves \"down,\" and the outward-pointing methyl group at C9 also moves \"down.\" This also results in both methyl groups being on the same side of the ring.\n    *   Therefore, the conrotatory closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene exclusively forms the product where the two methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, which is the **cis-isomer (A)**.\n\n4.  **Formation of the Trans-Isomer (B)**: The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) would require the two methyl groups to end up on opposite sides of the ring. This would necessitate a **disrotatory** ring closure. As established from FMO theory, the disrotatory pathway for an 8π-electron system under thermal conditions is symmetry-forbidden.\n\n### Prediction of the Ratio of A and B\n\nFrontier Molecular Orbital theory predicts that symmetry-allowed reactions have significantly lower activation energies than symmetry-forbidden reactions. The conrotatory pathway to form the *cis*-isomer A is symmetry-allowed, while the disrotatory pathway to form the *trans*-isomer B is symmetry-forbidden.\n\nConsequently, the rate of formation of A will be vastly greater than the rate of formation of B. While the prompt states that both isomers are formed, FMO theory predicts that the reaction should be highly stereospecific, yielding almost exclusively the *cis*-isomer A. The amount of the *trans*-isomer B formed via the forbidden pathway would be negligible under typical thermal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A:B is predicted to be very large.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B will be much greater than 1, with A being the vastly predominant product."
