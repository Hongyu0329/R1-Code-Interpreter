    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately, With No Storage Time\n\nOnce a single-dose ampule is opened, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. This is because ampules are open systems that cannot be resealed after being broken, which increases the risk of contamination.\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period. This guidance is echoed by other regulatory and professional bodies, which state that single-dose ampules are intended for immediate use only.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between a single-dose ampule and a single-dose vial. While both are intended for a single use, the beyond-use date (BUD) guidance differs significantly after they are opened or punctured. If a single-dose *vial* is entered in a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, provided it is stored according to the manufacturer's requirements. However, this allowance does not apply to ampules.\n\nIf a single-dose container is punctured in an environment with air quality worse than ISO Class 5, the beyond-use date is reduced to one hour. However, for ampules, the rule of immediate use and no storage remains regardless of the environment in which they are opened.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must be used immediately and cannot be stored.>>>"
