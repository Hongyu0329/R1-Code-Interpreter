The problem is unanswerable because the definitions of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ are based on a series of extraordinarily complex, and in some cases seemingly non-standard, mathematical operations and optimizations. While many of the individual terms used in the definitions are valid mathematical concepts, their combination creates a set of problems that are not documented in standard literature and are practically intractable to solve. Without being able to determine the values of $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, the set of integers for which the Frobenius number is to be calculated cannot be found.
