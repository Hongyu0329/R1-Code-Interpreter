The critical amount of correlation, defined as the covariance `C` between any neuron in population `v` and any neuron in population `s`, is given by the expression: `C = 2μ(θ - μ) - (μ/N)(1 - μ)`, where `μ` is the average input rate, `θ` is the heterosynaptic offset, and `N` is the number of neurons in each input layer.
