    "A single, contiguous patch of surface code with *N* holes (also called defects or punctures) can encode *N* logical qubits, assuming standard boundary conditions. Each hole introduces a new non-trivial loop on the surface, which allows for the definition of a new, independent logical qubit.\n\nThe problem specifies two separate patches of surface code. Since the patches are distinct, the number of logical qubits they can encode are additive.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** This patch has two holes. Therefore, it can encode 2 logical qubits.\n*   **Patch 2:** This patch also has two holes. It can also encode 2 logical qubits.\n\nBy adding the capacities of each patch, the total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
