    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field, denoted by \\( \\phi \\), is expressed through a functional integral in the imaginary-time formalism. The general form of this partition function is \\( Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]} \\), where \\( S_E[\\phi] \\) is the Euclidean action of the scalar field.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field with mass \\( m \\) is given by the integral over Euclidean spacetime (where imaginary time \\( \\tau \\) runs from 0 to \\( \\beta = 1/T \\), with \\( T \\) being the temperature):\n\n\\( S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right) \\)\n\nThis action is quadratic in the field \\( \\phi \\). To express this in the form of an inner product \\( (\\phi, D_\\phi) \\), we first perform an integration by parts on the kinetic term. Assuming periodic boundary conditions for the field in the imaginary time direction, \\( \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau + \\beta, \\mathbf{x}) \\), and that the fields vanish at spatial infinity, the boundary terms from the integration by parts are zero.\n\nAfter integration by parts, the action becomes:\n\n\\( S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\)\n\nThis expression defines the inner product and the operator \\( D_\\phi \\). The inner product \\( (\\phi, \\psi) \\) for two fields \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\psi \\) is defined by the integral over Euclidean spacetime:\n\n\\( (\\phi, \\psi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\)\n\nWith this definition, the action can be written as:\n\n\\( S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) \\)\n\nwhere \\( D_\\phi \\) is the differential operator:\n\n\\( D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\)\n\nThis operator is the Euclidean version of the Klein-Gordon operator. Therefore, the inner product of \\( (\\phi, D_\\phi) \\) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is given by the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field \\( \\phi \\), the partition function is given by the functional integral \\( Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]} \\), where \\( S_E[\\phi] \\) is the Euclidean action. The inner product in question, \\( (\\phi, D_\\phi) \\), corresponds to the quadratic part of this action.\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free neutral scalar field with mass \\( m \\) is:\n\\[ S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right) \\]\nHere, \\( \\tau \\) is the imaginary time, and \\( \\beta = 1/T \\) is the inverse temperature.\n\nThrough integration by parts, and assuming appropriate boundary conditions (periodicity in imaginary time for bosons), this action can be written as:\n\\[ S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\]\nThis expression is of the form \\( \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) \\).\n\nTherefore, the inner product of \\( (\\phi, D_\\phi) \\) is:\n\\[ (\\phi, D_\\phi) \\equiv \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) D_\\phi \\]\nwhere the operator \\( D_\\phi \\) is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n\\[ D_\\phi = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\]\nThe full term in the exponent of the partition function is \\( -\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi \\phi) \\).>>>"
