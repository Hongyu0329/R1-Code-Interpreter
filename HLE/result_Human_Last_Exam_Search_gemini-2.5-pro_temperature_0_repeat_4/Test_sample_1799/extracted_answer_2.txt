It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first postulate alone. The principle of relativity, by itself, is compatible with different theories of spacetime, including Galilean relativity. To derive the consequences of special relativity, the first postulate must be supplemented by an additional constraint. This can be the explicit statement of the constancy of the speed of light (the second postulate), or other assumptions such as the universal validity of Maxwell's equations or the existence of a finite universal speed limit derived from the symmetries of spacetime. Therefore, the second postulate is considered an essential and independent component in the traditional formulation of the theory.
