    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples to ensure accurate data and sorting. These controls are necessary to address issues like autofluorescence, spectral overlap (compensation), and non-specific binding, which are critical in a multi-color sorting experiment.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This consists of cells that have not been treated with any fluorescent reagents. This control is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells and for setting the initial voltage on the flow cytometer.\n\n*   **Viability Control (1 sample):** This sample contains cells stained only with a viability dye. It is crucial for excluding dead cells, which can non-specifically bind antibodies and exhibit high autofluorescence, leading to false positive results. For cell sorting, ensuring the viability of the sorted population is paramount.\n\n*   **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 samples):** You will need one single-stained sample for each fluorophore in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750). These controls are absolutely essential for calculating the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between the different fluorophores. Compensation can be performed using either cells or compensation beads.\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates in a multicolor experiment, especially for identifying dim or heterogeneous populations. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel except for one. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the five channels to account for the spread of fluorescence from all other dyes into that specific channel.\n\n*   **Streptavidin Beads Control (1 sample):** This control consists of cells incubated with the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin beads but without the biotinylated antibody. This is a crucial negative control to determine any non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate to your cells.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential controls is the sum of these individual control samples: 1 (unstained) + 1 (viability) + 5 (compensation) + 5 (FMOs) + 1 (streptavidin beads) = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
