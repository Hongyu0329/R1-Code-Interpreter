    "The ground space degeneracy of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. Specifically, it is equal to 2^k, where k is the number of independent logical qubits the code can store. The number of logical qubits is, in turn, determined by the number of independent, non-contractible loops for the 'e' (charge) and 'm' (flux) anyonic excitations.\n\nLet's analyze the contribution of each type of hole:\n\n1.  **Smooth Holes**: A smooth hole is created by removing a set of star operators (which are products of Pauli-X operators). This type of boundary is also known as a \"smooth\" or \"Z\" boundary. At a smooth boundary, 'm' anyons (fluxes) can be absorbed or created, meaning that a string of X-operators (which creates 'm' anyons at its ends) can terminate at the boundary. However, 'e' anyons (charges) cannot terminate. Consequently, a closed loop of Z-operators (which measures the flux of 'e' anyons) that encircles a smooth hole is a non-trivial, non-contractible loop. This corresponds to a logical Z operator. For each of the *n* smooth holes, we can define such an independent logical operator. Therefore, *n* smooth holes contribute *n* logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Rough Holes**: A rough hole is created by removing a set of plaquette operators (products of Pauli-Z operators). This is also known as a \"rough\" or \"X\" boundary. At a rough boundary, 'e' anyons can be absorbed, meaning a string of Z-operators can terminate. However, 'm' anyons cannot. Therefore, a closed loop of X-operators (which measures the flux of 'm' anyons) encircling a rough hole is a non-trivial, non-contractible loop. This corresponds to a logical X operator. For each of the *m* rough holes, we can define an independent logical operator of this type. Thus, *m* rough holes contribute *m* logical qubits.\n\nThe total number of logical qubits, *k*, is the sum of the qubits contributed by each type of hole. The logical operators associated with smooth holes (Z-type) and rough holes (X-type) are independent.\n\n*   Total logical qubits (k) = (qubits from smooth holes) + (qubits from rough holes) = n + m\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\n\n*   Ground Space Degeneracy = 2^(n+m)\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
