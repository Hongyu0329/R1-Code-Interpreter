Based on the evidence of interleukin-15's (IL-15) role in supporting T cell function, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with IL-15 will exhibit a more potent and sustained cytokine release profile upon antigen encounter compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This prediction is based on the following points:

*   **Enhanced Effector Cytokine Production:** IL-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to boost the function of T cells. Studies have shown that T cells, including CAR T cells, cultured in the presence of IL-15 demonstrate an increased capacity to produce key effector cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Specifically, CAR T cells exposed to IL-2 and IL-15 have been observed to secrete more proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. Furthermore, a trend towards higher IFN-γ production has been noted in IL-15-armored CAR T cells upon co-culture with target cells. This suggests that upon recognizing a tumor cell, CAR T cells primed with IL-15 would mount a more robust cytokine-mediated attack.

*   **Increased IL-2 Secretion:** Some research indicates that CAR T cells cultured with a combination of IL-7 and IL-15 release significantly higher levels of IL-2 compared to those cultured with IL-2 alone. IL-2 is crucial for T cell proliferation and the amplification of the anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, an increased production of IL-2 by IL-15-manufactured CAR T cells would contribute to their enhanced persistence and expansion, which is a known benefit of using this cytokine in the manufacturing process.

*   **Modulation of the Cytokine Profile:** While promoting effector cytokines, IL-15 may also influence the overall cytokine profile in a way that could be beneficial for the therapeutic outcome. There is some evidence to suggest that CAR T cells produced with IL-15 may release lower levels of cytokines associated with severe side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS). However, it is important to note that engineering CAR T cells to secrete their own IL-15 has been linked to an increased incidence of CRS, indicating that the method of IL-15 delivery (during manufacturing versus autocrine production) is a critical factor.

*   **Support of a Less Differentiated Phenotype:** IL-15 promotes the maintenance of a less differentiated, memory-like phenotype (Tscm and Tcm) in CAR T cells. These less differentiated cells have a higher proliferative potential and are more persistent, which in turn would lead to a larger and more sustained population of cytokine-secreting CAR T cells in the patient over time.

In conclusion, the prediction is that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will have a heightened capacity for releasing key effector cytokines like IFN-γ and IL-2 upon antigen stimulation. This enhanced cytokine response, coupled with the improved persistence and proliferation associated with the IL-15-induced memory phenotype, would likely translate to a more effective and durable anti-tumor response compared to CAR T cells manufactured in its absence. However, the overall impact on the cytokine storm will likely depend on the specific manufacturing protocol and the in vivo context.
