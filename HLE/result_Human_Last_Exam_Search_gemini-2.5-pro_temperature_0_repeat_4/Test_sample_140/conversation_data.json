    "The search results are about general packing problems, such as packing smaller cubes or cuboids into a larger one, or packing LEGO bricks. They confirm that these problems can be complex and that simple division of volumes is not sufficient. The results also mention that for identical blocks, a greedy slicing algorithm is a common approach. My step-by-step calculation using this method seems to be the correct way to solve this problem. The search results do not provide a direct answer to this specific problem but validate the methodology used. I am confident in my calculated answer.\n\nThe problem is to find the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube with an edge length of 15.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the large cube and the volume of a single block.\nVolume of the cube = 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\nVolume of one block = 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\nA simple division of the volumes (3375 / 9 = 375) gives a theoretical maximum, but this does not account for the geometric constraints of packing solid blocks.\n\nTo find the actual number of blocks that can be packed, we can use a systematic approach of filling the cube in layers.\n\n1.  **First Section:** We can align the 9-unit length of the blocks along one of the 15-unit edges of the cube. Let's call this the x-axis. We can create a rectangular section that is 9 units deep along the x-axis, and 15 units wide and 15 units high.\n    *   The number of blocks that fit in this 9x15x15 section is:\n        (9/9) x (15/1) x (15/1) = 1 x 15 x 15 = 225 blocks.\n    *   After filling this section, the remaining space is a block of (15-9) x 15 x 15, which is 6x15x15.\n\n2.  **Second Section:** Now we must pack blocks into the remaining 6x15x15 space. Since the dimension of 6 is smaller than 9, we cannot place the blocks with their longest side parallel to this edge. We must align the 9-unit length along one of the 15-unit edges. Let's choose the y-axis. We can now fill a section that is 6 units wide, 9 units deep (along the y-axis), and 15 units high.\n    *   The number of blocks that fit in this 6x9x15 section is:\n        (6/1) x (9/9) x (15/1) = 6 x 1 x 15 = 90 blocks.\n    *   The remaining space from this step is a block of 6 x (15-9) x 15, which is 6x6x15.\n\n3.  **Third Section:** We are now left with a 6x6x15 space. Again, the 6-unit dimensions are too small for the 9-unit length of the blocks. We must align the 9-unit length along the remaining 15-unit edge (the z-axis). We can fill a section that is 6 units wide, 6 units deep, and 9 units high.\n    *   The number of blocks that fit in this 6x6x9 section is:\n        (6/1) x (6/1) x (9/9) = 6 x 6 x 1 = 36 blocks.\n    *   The final remaining space is a block of 6 x 6 x (15-9), which is 6x6x6.\n\n4.  **Final Remaining Space:** The last remaining space is a 6x6x6 cube. A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into this space in any orientation, as all dimensions are less than 9.\n\nBy summing the number of blocks from each section, we get the total number of blocks that can fit inside the cube:\nTotal blocks = 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
