    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 1377.\n\nHere is a summary of the derivation:\n\n1.  **Object Properties**: Let $X$ be a smooth quintic (degree 5) hypersurface in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n    *   $X$ is a simply connected, smooth complex surface (a real 4-manifold).\n    *   The Betti numbers of $X$ can be calculated. In particular, the second Betti number is $b_2(X) = 53$. This means the second homology group $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group of rank 53.\n    *   The fourth Betti number is $b_4(X) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Rational Homotopy Theory**: The rank of an abelian group (like a homotopy group) is determined by its rationalization, which can be computed using rational homotopy theory. For a simply connected space like $X$, the ranks of its homotopy groups can be determined from its cohomology ring using the theory of Sullivan minimal models.\n\n3.  **The Formula for the Rank of $\\pi_3$**: For a simply connected topological space $X$, the rank of its third homotopy group is given by the dimension of the kernel of the cup product map on the second rational cohomology group. The formula is:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\ker(\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$\n    where $\\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is the exterior square of the second cohomology group.\n\n4.  **Calculation**:\n    *   The second rational cohomology group $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is a vector space of dimension $b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   The fourth rational cohomology group $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is a vector space of dimension $b_4(X) = 1$.\n    *   The exterior square $\\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is a vector space of dimension $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 1378$.\n    *   The map $\\cup: \\Lambda^2 H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q}) \\to H^4(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ is a linear map from a 1378-dimensional space to a 1-dimensional space.\n    *   This map is not the zero map. For instance, the hyperplane class $H \\in H^2(X; \\mathbb{Q})$ has a non-zero cup square, $H \\cup H \\neq 0$. This is because the intersection form of the surface is non-degenerate.\n    *   Since the map is a non-zero linear map to a 1-dimensional space, it must be surjective, and its image has dimension 1.\n    *   By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the kernel is the dimension of the domain minus the dimension of the image:\n        $\\dim(\\ker(\\cup)) = \\dim(\\Lambda^2 H^2) - \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\cup)) = 1378 - 1 = 1377$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1377.\n\n<<<1377>>>"
