The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is PFOS, with a peak concentration of approximately **355,700 Âµg/L**. At these concentrations, the chemical mixture has a calculated Mixture Toxic Unit (MTU) of **1786**, indicating a high potential for toxic effects on the protected algal community. The effect of the mixture is determined to be **additive** based on the standard assumption of concentration addition.
