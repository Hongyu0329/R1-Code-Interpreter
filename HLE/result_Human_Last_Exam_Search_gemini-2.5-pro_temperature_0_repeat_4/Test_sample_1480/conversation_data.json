    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the rule's consequent. The firing strength, represented as `Phi_k(x′)`, is the result of combining the membership values of the antecedent fuzzy sets, while `μG_k_j(y_j)` represents the membership degree of the consequent fuzzy set.\n\nA t-norm, or triangular norm, is a mathematical function that generalizes the intersection (logical AND) in fuzzy logic. There are several types of t-norms, with the most common being:\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** T(a, b) = min(a, b)\n*   **Product t-norm:** T(a, b) = a * b\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** T(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)\n\nWhen a specific t-norm is not stated, the minimum t-norm is typically used by default in fuzzy logic applications.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Phi_k(x′)` = 0.7\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated as follows using the minimum t-norm:\n\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\nIf other t-norms were to be used, the results would be:\n*   **Product t-norm:** 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm:** max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6\n\nAssuming the standard minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
