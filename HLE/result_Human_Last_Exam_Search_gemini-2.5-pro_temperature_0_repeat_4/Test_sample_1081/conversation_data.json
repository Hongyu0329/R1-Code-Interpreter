    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Since the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group, any such group $G$ over a finite field is split. This means $G$ is the Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ are the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the variety of maximal tori, denoted by $\\mathcal{T}$. This variety can be represented as a homogeneous space $\\mathcal{T} \\cong G/N(T)$, where $T$ is a fixed maximal torus and $N(T)$ is its normalizer in $G$.\n\nBy Lang's theorem, the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$ acts transitively on the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $\\mathcal{T}$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is therefore given by the size of this orbit, which can be calculated using the orbit-stabilizer theorem:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_0)|} $$\nwhere $T_0$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-split maximal torus.\n\nThe stabilizer $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_0)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q}$-rational points of the normalizer $N(T_0)$. For a split group, the structure of the normalizer of a split torus is $N(T_0) = T_0 \\rtimes W$, where $W$ is the Weyl group. The group of rational points is $N(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q) = T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\rtimes W(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. Since the group is split, the Frobenius action on the Weyl group is trivial, so $W(\\mathbb{F}_q) = W$.\n\nThe orders of the components are as follows:\n1.  **The order of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$**: For a split group of type $E_8$, the order is given by the formula:\n    $$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\n    The exponent 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system. The integers in the exponents of $q$ (2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30) are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of type $E_8$.\n\n2.  **The order of $T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)$**: A split maximal torus of rank 8 over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ has:\n    $$ |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 $$\n\n3.  **The order of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$**: The Weyl group for $E_8$ has order:\n    $$ |W(E_8)| = 696,729,600 = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\text{} $$\n\nCombining these, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8 \\cdot 696,729,600} $$\n\nThis expression can be written as a polynomial in $q$ with rational coefficients.\n\n<<<The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8 \\cdot 696,729,600} $$>>>"
