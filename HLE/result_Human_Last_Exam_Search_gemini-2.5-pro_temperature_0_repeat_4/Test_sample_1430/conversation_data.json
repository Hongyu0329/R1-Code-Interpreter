    "Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X its 15th symmetric power, denoted as $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, is also known as the Picard number. To determine the smallest and largest possible values for this rank, we first relate it to the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the curve C.\n\n### Relationship between $\\rho(X)$ and $\\rho(J(C))$\n\nFor a smooth projective curve C of genus $g$, and an integer $d \\ge g$, the $d$-th symmetric power $\\text{Sym}^d(C)$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of C. In this case, the genus is $g=3$ and the symmetric power is $d=15$, so the condition $d \\ge g$ is satisfied.\n\nThe Abel-Jacobi map sends an effective divisor of degree 15 to a point in the variety of degree 15 line bundles, $\\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$. This variety is a torsor for the Jacobian $J(C)$ and is isomorphic to it as an unpolarized variety. The fibers of this map are projective spaces. Specifically, $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $\\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$.\n\nFor a projective bundle $\\mathbb{P}(E)$ over a base variety $B$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by $\\rho(\\mathbb{P}(E)) = \\rho(B) + 1$. Applying this to our case, we have:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(\\text{Sym}^{15}(C)) = \\rho(\\text{Pic}^{15}(C)) + 1 = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian, $\\rho(J(C))$, depends on the geometric properties of the curve C. For a \"very general\" curve C of genus $g$, the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian $J(C)$ is simply the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this situation, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1. This is the minimum possible rank.\n\nThus, the smallest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$, which is $g^2$. For a genus 3 curve, the Jacobian $J(C)$ is an abelian threefold, so the theoretical maximum for $\\rho(J(C))$ is $3^2 = 9$.\n\nHowever, not every abelian threefold is the Jacobian of a curve. The existence of a principal polarization, which is inherent to a Jacobian, imposes significant constraints. The maximum rank is achieved for special curves, typically those with extra automorphisms, which lead to Jacobians with complex multiplication (CM).\n\nThe Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$, is a well-studied example of a genus 3 curve with a large Néron-Severi rank. It is known that the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the product of three elliptic curves with complex multiplication by $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic has been computed to be 7.\n\nIt has been established that for a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the maximal possible rank of the Néron-Severi group is indeed 7.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$.\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 8.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 8.>>>"
