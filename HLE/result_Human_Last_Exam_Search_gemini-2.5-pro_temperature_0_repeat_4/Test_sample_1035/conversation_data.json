    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\). This is a well-known problem in graph theory, and the total number of vertices is referred to as the capacity of the cover.\n\nFirst, we must distinguish between partitioning and covering the edges.\n*   **Partitioning:** If the bipartite graphs must be edge-disjoint, the Graham-Pollak theorem states that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( n-1 \\). For \\( n=35 \\), this would be 34 bipartite graphs. A common construction uses star graphs, leading to a significantly larger total number of vertices.\n*   **Covering:** If the edge sets of the bipartite graphs can overlap, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). This interpretation typically yields a smaller total number of vertices. Given the phrasing \"covering all the edges\", this is the more standard interpretation.\n\nFor \\( K_{35} \\), the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed for a covering is:\n\\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\)\nSince \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), we have \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\). So, at least 6 bipartite graphs are required.\n\nA standard and efficient construction to achieve this covering is as follows:\n1.  Assign a unique binary vector of length \\( k = 6 \\) to each of the \\( n=35 \\) vertices of the complete graph. We can use the binary representations of the integers 0 to 34.\n2.  For each of the 6 bit positions, create a complete bipartite graph. For the \\( i \\)-th position (where \\( i \\) ranges from 1 to 6), the vertex set of the bipartite graph is partitioned into two sets: those vertices whose binary label has a '0' at the \\( i \\)-th position, and those whose label has a '1' at that position.\n3.  Any edge in \\( K_{35} \\) connects two vertices with different binary labels. These labels must differ in at least one bit position. If they differ at the \\( i \\)-th position, that edge is included in the \\( i \\)-th bipartite graph. Thus, this family of 6 bipartite graphs covers all edges of \\( K_{35} \\).\n\nIn this construction, each of the 6 bipartite graphs is defined on the entire set of 35 vertices of \\( K_{35} \\). Therefore, the total number of vertices in this family of graphs is the sum of the number of vertices in each graph:\nTotal vertices = (Number of bipartite graphs) Ã— (Number of vertices in each graph)\nTotal vertices = \\( 6 \\times 35 = 210 \\)\n\nThis value of \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) is a well-known upper bound for the minimum capacity. There is also a lower bound, established by Hansel, which is \\( n \\log_2 n \\). For \\( n=35 \\), this lower bound is approximately \\( 35 \\times 5.129 \\approx 179.5 \\). While the exact minimum for \\( n=35 \\) is not definitively settled in literature as a simple formula, the value of 210 is the result from the standard optimal construction.\n\n<<<210>>>"
