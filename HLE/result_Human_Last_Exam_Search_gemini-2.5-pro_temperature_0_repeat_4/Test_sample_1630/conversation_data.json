    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### 1. Degree of the Resulting Polynomial\n\n*   Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. We can write them as:\n    $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n    $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   The composition $f(g(x))$ is found by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n    $f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^3 + b(g(x))^2 + c(g(x)) + d$.\n*   The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$. In this case, the degree is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   A fixed point of $f(g(x))$ is a solution to $f(g(x)) = x$. This can be rewritten as $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is also a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n*   According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n### 2. The Constraints on the Derivatives\n\n*   We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n*   The derivative of a degree 3 polynomial $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is a quadratic polynomial $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n*   For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, its graph (a parabola) must open upwards and lie entirely above the x-axis. This requires the leading coefficient to be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and the discriminant to be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$). The same conditions apply to the polynomial $g(x)$.\n*   The condition that the derivatives are always positive implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n### 3. Geometric Interpretation and Achievability\n\nThe problem of finding the number of solutions to $f(g(x)) = x$ can be viewed as finding the number of intersection points of two curves. Let $y = g(x)$. The equation becomes $f(y) = x$. We are therefore looking for the number of solutions to the system of equations:\n1.  $y = g(x)$\n2.  $x = f(y)$\n\nEach of these equations defines a plane algebraic curve of degree 3. The problem is to find the maximum number of intersection points between these two cubic curves.\n\n*   **Bézout's Theorem**: This theorem states that the number of intersection points of two plane algebraic curves of degrees $m$ and $n$ is at most $m \\times n$, provided the curves do not share a common component. Here, both curves have degree 3, so the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe question now is whether it is possible to achieve all 9 intersections as real points while respecting the constraints $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$. The conditions that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing mean that the curves they define are non-self-intersecting and extend from $(-\\infty, -\\infty)$ to $(+\\infty, +\\infty)$. While these constraints impose a certain structure on the curves, they do not prevent them from intersecting up to the maximum number of times predicted by Bézout's theorem. It is possible to construct two such strictly increasing cubic polynomials where the graph of $y=g(x)$ and the graph of $x=f(y)$ (which is the graph of $y=f^{-1}(x)$) intersect at 9 distinct points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
