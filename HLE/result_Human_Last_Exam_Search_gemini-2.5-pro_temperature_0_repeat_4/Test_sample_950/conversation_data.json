    "The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring is denoted by $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nAn abelian group can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part. The torsion subgroup consists of all elements of finite order. The rank of an abelian group is defined as the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. For a torsion group, every element has finite order, which implies that any non-empty set of elements is linearly dependent over the integers. Consequently, the largest linearly independent subset is the empty set, which has a cardinality of 0. Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian consists entirely of elements of order 2. This means the torsion subgroup is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. As a torsion group, its rank is 0.\n\nWhile the rank is strictly 0, it is useful to know that the integral cohomology of $G(3, 5)$ does contain non-trivial torsion. The integral cohomology groups for $G(3, 5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$, are:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group: $T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This is a torsion group, and as explained, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
