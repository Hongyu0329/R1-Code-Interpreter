    "I have been unable to identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that Bártfa was a significant free royal town in the 15th century with its own administration, including a town judge (richtár), specific lists of these officials for the year 1461 are not readily available in the searched online resources.\n\nA key potential source of this information is the book \"Bardejov v XV. storočí\" (Bardejov in the 15th Century) by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka, which includes a chapter titled \"Bardejovskí richtári v XV. storočí\" (Judges of Bardejov in the 15th Century). However, the content of this chapter, which would likely contain a list of the judges from that period, could not be accessed through the available search tools.\n\nOther historical documents mention the town council and communications with Bártfa around this period, but do not name the specific judge for the year 1461. Therefore, without access to more detailed archival records or the specific content of the aforementioned publication, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 remains elusive.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the answer to your question.>>>"
