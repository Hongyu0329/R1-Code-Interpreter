    "**Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368.**\n\nWhile historical records show that Chaucer traveled to the continent on diplomatic missions during 1368, the consensus among scholars suggests he was in England at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death. By 1368, Chaucer was an esquire in the court of King Edward III, a position that kept him in close proximity to the royal household.\n\nThere is evidence of Chaucer undertaking a diplomatic mission to the continent in 1368, with some sources suggesting a trip to France and others a possible journey to Milan, Italy, for the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp. One record confirms he was to travel through Dover at some point during the year. However, the timeline of these travels in relation to Blanche's death in September is not precise.\n\nA significant piece of evidence pointing to his presence in England is his composition of \"The Book of the Duchess,\" a poignant elegy written in honor of Blanche. This work, his first major poem, suggests he was in England to receive the news of her death and the commission for the commemorative poem from her grieving husband, John of Gaunt. Furthermore, in 1369, Chaucer and his wife were recorded as official mourners for Queen Philippa in England, further solidifying his presence within the English court circle around this time.\n\nWhile he did travel for the crown in 1368, the lack of a definitive record placing him abroad on the specific date of Blanche's death, combined with the significant literary work he produced in her memory, makes England the most probable location.\n\n<<<C>>>"
