For a p-electron with spin-orbit coupling, the possible common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ are:
For the $j=1/2$ state:
The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $(3/4)ħ^2$, and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $\pm(1/2)ħ$.

For the $j=3/2$ state:
The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $(15/4)ħ^2$, and the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are $\pm(1/2)ħ$ and $\pm(3/2)ħ$.
