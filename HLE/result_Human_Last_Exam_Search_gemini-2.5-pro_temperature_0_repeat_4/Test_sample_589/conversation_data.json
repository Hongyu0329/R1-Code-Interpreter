    "The 2007 film *It's a Boy Girl Thing* features a scene where a teenager, who has magically swapped bodies with their neighbor, rides a pink bicycle head-on toward an oncoming car in a game of chicken. The film was produced by major studios including Elton John's Rocket Pictures and distributed by Icon Productions.\n\nThe scene involves the character of Woody Deane, a high school football player, who finds himself in the body of his studious and well-behaved neighbor, Nell Bedworth. In an act of rebellion and to tarnish her reputation, Woody, in Nell's body, takes her pink bicycle and defiantly pedals directly into the path of an approaching car, forcing it to swerve at the last moment.\n\n<<<It's a Boy Girl Thing>>>"
