    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community, often denoted as S(q, ω). This function is also closely related to the **thermal scattering law**, S(α, β), which is a dimensionally-scaled version of the dynamic structure factor used in nuclear data processing codes for criticality safety analysis.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, often referred to as the Van Hove correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the collective dynamics of particles in a system.\n\nIn the context of nuclear engineering and physics, this is particularly important for understanding how neutrons scatter off materials within a nuclear reactor or a fissile solution. The dynamic structure factor is directly proportional to the double differential scattering cross-section, which is a fundamental quantity in neutron transport calculations.\n\nFor practical applications in nuclear criticality safety, the thermal scattering law, S(α, β), is used. This is essentially the dynamic structure factor expressed in terms of dimensionless momentum (α) and energy (β) transfer variables. Nuclear data processing codes, such as NJOY, use this formalism to generate thermal neutron scattering cross-section libraries that are then used in criticality calculations with software like MCNP. Therefore, while \"dynamic structure factor\" is the fundamental physical term, \"thermal scattering law\" is the common practical term used by the nuclear criticality community when dealing with processed nuclear data.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
