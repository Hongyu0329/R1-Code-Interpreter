The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% molar and 12.5 wt% Ni. For water splitting, the ideal ratio for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a Ni:Ce of 3:1 or 1:1, while for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a Ni:Ce ratio of 1:2 is most effective.
