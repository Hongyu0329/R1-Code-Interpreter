    "### Optimal Nickel-to-Ceria Ratio Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal ratio of nickel (Ni) to cerium (Ce) in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends on the specific application, namely the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting (WS). Research indicates that different optimal ratios exist for each of these catalytic processes.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, studies have shown that a range of Ni concentrations can be effective. One study found that Ni-Ceria catalysts with a nickel content between 5 and 12.5 weight percent (wt%) all exhibit high activity for CO conversion in the temperature range of 300–450 °C. Within this range, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni showed nearly identical and very high CO conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively. Another investigation focusing on the reverse WGS reaction identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar.\n\nIn the realm of **water splitting**, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is influenced by which half-reaction is being targeted, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the OER, a key step in water splitting, catalysts with atomic ratios of Ni to Ce of 3:1 (Ni75Ce25Ox) and 1:1 (Ni50Ce50Ox) have demonstrated enhanced activity. This is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, which are beneficial for the reaction. A computational study further supports the favorability of a 3Ni/1Ce ratio for the water-splitting reaction due to its electronic properties.\n\nConversely, for the HER, a different optimal ratio has been reported. A study on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (which corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of 1:2) exhibited the best performance for hydrogen evolution. When used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, this Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF material also demonstrated high efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target reaction:\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a Ni content of approximately **7% molar to 12.5 wt%** appears to be optimal.\n*   For **water splitting**, the ideal ratio varies:\n    *   For the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, a higher nickel content with a **Ni:Ce ratio of 3:1 or 1:1** is preferred.\n    *   For the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a lower nickel content with a **Ni:Ce ratio of 1:2** has shown to be most effective.\n\nThese findings underscore the importance of tailoring the catalyst composition to the specific chemical transformation in order to achieve maximum catalytic efficiency.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is between 7% molar and 12.5 wt% Ni. For water splitting, the ideal ratio for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a Ni:Ce of 3:1 or 1:1, while for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a Ni:Ce ratio of 1:2 is most effective.>>>"
