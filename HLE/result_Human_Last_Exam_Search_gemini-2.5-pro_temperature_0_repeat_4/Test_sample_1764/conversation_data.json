    "I have gathered definitions for ultrametric and Banach spaces, as well as for isometric embeddings. The key challenge is to determine the *smallest possible number* of such embeddings. The search results indicate that for any finite ultrametric space and any infinite-dimensional Banach space, at least one isometric embedding exists. However, the question is about the *smallest possible number*, which could be zero if certain conditions on the Banach space (like its cardinality or dimension) are not met. The search results also touch upon embeddings into specific Banach spaces like $l_p$ and $l_\\infty$, and the concept of distortion, which is related but not central to the question about the number of *isometric* embeddings. I need to investigate if there are conditions under which no isometric embedding is possible. Specifically, I need to find out how the cardinality of the Banach space B comes into play. It is possible that if B is \"too small\" relative to X, no isometric embedding exists.I have gathered significant information. A key finding by Shkarin (2004) is that every finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. This implies that if the Banach space B is infinite-dimensional, there is at least one such embedding.\n\nThe question now hinges on the cardinality of B.\n\nCase 1: B is infinite-dimensional.\nAs stated, at least one isometric embedding exists. The question is about the *smallest possible number*. If one embedding exists, is it possible that this is the only one? The concept of \"linearly rigid metric spaces\" which admit a unique (up to isometry) linearly dense isometric embedding into a Banach space is relevant here. However, the problem does not state that the embedding has to be linearly dense. Without this constraint, it is likely that multiple isometric embeddings can exist. For example, if $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding, then for any vector $b_0 \\in B$, the map $g(x) = f(x) + b_0$ is also an isometric embedding, provided the affine shift does not violate the properties of the Banach space, which it generally doesn't. This would imply a large number of embeddings if any exist. However, the question asks for the *smallest possible number*.\n\nCase 2: B is finite-dimensional.\nA finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. Specifically, an $n+1$ point ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since any finite-dimensional Banach space is topologically equivalent to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$, the question of existence seems to be resolved. However, the cardinality of the Banach space is given as K. If the cardinality of the finite ultrametric space X, let's say $|X|=m$, is greater than the cardinality of the Banach space K, then no injective map from X to B can exist. An isometric embedding must be injective, because if $f(x) = f(y)$ for $x \\neq y$, then $d_B(f(x), f(y)) = 0$, but $d_X(x, y) > 0$, which contradicts the isometry property. Therefore, if $|X| > K$, no isometric embedding is possible.\n\nLet's consider the cardinality K of a Banach space B. A Banach space is a vector space over the real or complex numbers. If the dimension of the Banach space is $n$, then as a set, it is in bijection with $\\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\\mathbb{C}^n$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{C}^n$ (for $n>0$) is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$. If the Banach space is infinite-dimensional and separable, its cardinality is also $c$. If it is non-separable, its cardinality can be larger. The problem states B is a Banach space of cardinality K.\n\nLet $|X| = m$. For an isometric embedding to exist, we must have $m \\le K$.\n\nIf $m > K$, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nIf $m \\le K$, and B is an infinite-dimensional Banach space, we know at least one embedding exists.\n\nLet's re-read the question carefully: \"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of X in B?\". This asks for a single number. This number should be the minimum possible, across all possible choices of X and B that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's consider the trivial case. Let X be a single-point space, $X = \\{x_0\\}$. Then $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ must satisfy $\\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\| = 0$, which is always true. So any point in B can be the image of $x_0$. The number of such embeddings is K. This is not a fixed number.\n\nLet's consider a two-point space $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2) = d > 0$. An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ must satisfy $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d$. We need to find two points in B at a distance d. If such points exist, say $b_1, b_2$, then $f(x_1)=b_1, f(x_2)=b_2$ is one embedding. $f(x_1)=b_2, f(x_2)=b_1$ is another. Also, for any $b_0 \\in B$, $f(x_1)=b_1+b_0, f(x_2)=b_2+b_0$ is also an embedding. The number of embeddings seems to be large if any exist.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible number*. This suggests we should look for a scenario where this number is minimal.\n\nThe most constrained scenario is when no such embedding exists. As argued before, if the cardinality of X is greater than the cardinality of B, no injective map, and thus no isometric embedding, can exist. Let's assume X is a finite ultrametric space with $|X| = m$. Let B be a Banach space with cardinality $K$. If we choose $m > K$, then the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Is it possible to choose such X and B?\n\nA finite ultrametric space X can have any finite cardinality $m \\ge 1$. A Banach space B must have a cardinality of at least $c$ (the continuum), unless it is the trivial space $\\{0\\}$. A non-trivial Banach space is a vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, and if its dimension is at least 1, it contains a copy of $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, so its cardinality is at least $c$. A finite set cannot be a non-trivial Banach space. A Banach space must be a complete normed vector space. A finite-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ is complete. If the dimension is $n \\ge 1$, the cardinality is $c$. If the dimension is 0, the space is $\\{0\\}$, which is a Banach space of cardinality 1.\n\nLet's consider the case where B is the trivial Banach space $\\{0\\}$. Its cardinality is $K=1$. Let X be a finite ultrametric space with $|X| = m > 1$. Then there is no injective map from X to B, so there are no isometric embeddings. The number of embeddings is 0.\n\nWhat if X has $|X|=1$? Let $X=\\{x_1\\}$. Then $d(x_1, x_1)=0$. Let $B=\\{0\\}$. The map $f(x_1) = 0$ is an isometric embedding. So there is 1 embedding.\n\nSo, if we can choose $B=\\{0\\}$ (cardinality $K=1$) and $X$ with $|X| > 1$, the number of embeddings is 0. If we choose $B=\\{0\\}$ and $|X|=1$, the number is 1.\n\nThe question is \"What is the smallest possible number...\". This implies we should find the minimum number over all possible valid choices of X and B.\n\nLet's consider non-trivial Banach spaces. Their cardinality K is at least $c$. A finite ultrametric space X has finite cardinality, say $m$. So $m < c = K$. In this case, an embedding is not ruled out by cardinality. As Shkarin proved, if B is infinite-dimensional, an embedding always exists. What if B is finite-dimensional? Any finite-dimensional Banach space is a $\\mathbb{R}^n$ or $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with some norm. It is known that any finite metric space (and thus any finite ultrametric space) can be isometrically embedded in $(\\mathbb{R}^N, ||\\cdot||_\\infty)$ for some sufficiently large N.\n\nSo, if B is a non-trivial Banach space, it seems at least one embedding always exists. Let's re-examine Shkarin's result. \"every finite ultrametric space embeds into every infinite dimensional Banach space\". This leaves the case of finite-dimensional B open.\n\nLet X be a finite ultrametric space with $|X|=n+1$. It can be isometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Any n-dimensional Banach space is linearly homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This does not guarantee an isometric embedding for any norm.\n\nHowever, the question is about the *smallest possible number*. If we can find *any* pair (X, B) satisfying the conditions for which the number of embeddings is 0, then that's the answer.\n\nLet's construct such a pair.\nLet $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$ be an ultrametric space with $d(a,b) = d(b,c) = d(a,c) = 1$. This is a valid ultrametric space (it's an equilateral triangle, which satisfies the ultrametric inequality since for any three points, two distances are equal and the third is less than or equal to them).\nLet $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual norm (a Banach space of cardinality $c$). Can we isometrically embed X into B? We need to find three points $f(a), f(b), f(c) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|f(a)-f(b)|=1$, $|f(b)-f(c)|=1$, and $|f(a)-f(c)|=1$.\nLet $f(a) = x$, $f(b) = y$, $f(c) = z$.\n$|x-y|=1 \\implies y = x \\pm 1$.\n$|y-z|=1 \\implies z = y \\pm 1$.\n$|x-z|=1$.\nCase 1: $y = x+1$. Then $z = (x+1) \\pm 1$, so $z=x+2$ or $z=x$.\nIf $z=x+2$, then $|x-z| = |x-(x+2)| = 2 \\neq 1$. No solution.\nIf $z=x$, then $|x-z| = 0 \\neq 1$. No solution.\nCase 2: $y = x-1$. Then $z = (x-1) \\pm 1$, so $z=x$ or $z=x-2$.\nIf $z=x$, then $|x-z| = 0 \\neq 1$. No solution.\nIf $z=x-2$, then $|x-z| = |x-(x-2)| = 2 \\neq 1$. No solution.\nSo, the 3-point equilateral space with distance 1 cannot be isometrically embedded into $\\mathbb{R}$. $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Banach space. So we have found a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nTo be sure, let's verify the premises.\n- X is a finite ultrametric space: Yes, the 3-point equilateral space is ultrametric. Let the points be x, y, z. d(x,y)=1, d(y,z)=1, d(x,z)=1. The ultrametric inequality is $d(u,w) \\le \\max(d(u,v), d(v,w))$. Let's check for (x,y,z): $d(x,z) = 1 \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z)) = \\max(1,1) = 1$. This holds.\n- B is a Banach space of cardinality K: Yes, $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual absolute value as norm is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=c$.\n\nWe have found a valid pair (X, B) for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings must be non-negative, the smallest possible number cannot be less than 0. Therefore, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nFinal check: Does the question imply that for *any* X and B, we should find the number of embeddings? No, it asks for the *smallest possible number*. This means we are free to choose X and B (as long as they are a finite ultrametric space and a Banach space, respectively) to minimize this number.\n\nThe existence of a single case where there are no embeddings is sufficient to establish 0 as the minimum possible number. The example of the equilateral triangle with side 1 and the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$ provides this case.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.The question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\nAn isometric embedding is a function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $d_X(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|_B$ holds, where $d_X$ is the metric on $X$ and $\\|\\cdot\\|_B$ is the norm on $B$.\n\nFor an embedding to be possible, the cardinality of the domain $X$ cannot be greater than the cardinality of the codomain $B$, because an isometric embedding must be an injective map.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios for the Banach space $B$.\n1.  **Trivial Banach space**: The space $B = \\{0\\}$ is a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$. If we choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ with more than one point, for instance, $X = \\{a, b\\}$ with $d(a, b) > 0$, then the cardinality of $X$ is 2, which is greater than the cardinality of $B$. Therefore, no injective map from $X$ to $B$ exists, and thus no isometric embedding is possible. In this case, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n2.  **Non-trivial Banach space**: Any non-trivial Banach space (a space with more than just the zero vector) over the real or complex numbers has a cardinality $K$ of at least that of the continuum, $c$. A finite ultrametric space $X$ has a finite cardinality, say $n$. Since $n < c$, a simple cardinality argument does not forbid an embedding.\n\nHowever, we can still find a case where no isometric embedding exists even if the Banach space is non-trivial. Consider the following example:\n*   Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space consisting of three points $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ such that the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This is an equilateral triangle with side length 1. This space is ultrametric because for any three points $u, v, w$, the ultrametric inequality $d(u, w) \\le \\max\\{d(u, v), d(v, w)\\}$ holds trivially, as $1 \\le \\max\\{1, 1\\}$.\n*   Let $B$ be the Banach space of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual norm (the absolute value). The cardinality of $B$ is $K=c$.\n\nAn isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ would require finding three points in $\\mathbb{R}$, say $a, b, c$, such that:\n*   $|a - b| = 1$\n*   $|b - c| = 1$\n*   $|a - c| = 1$\n\nFrom $|a - b| = 1$, we have $b = a+1$ or $b = a-1$.\nFrom $|b - c| = 1$, we have $c = b+1$ or $c = b-1$.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n*   If $b = a+1$, then $c = (a+1)+1 = a+2$ or $c = (a+1)-1 = a$.\n    *   If $c = a+2$, then $|a - c| = |a - (a+2)| = 2$, which is not 1.\n    *   If $c = a$, then $|a - c| = 0$, which is not 1.\n*   If $b = a-1$, then $c = (a-1)+1 = a$ or $c = (a-1)-1 = a-2$.\n    *   If $c = a$, then $|a - c| = 0$, which is not 1.\n    *   If $c = a-2$, then $|a - c| = |a - (a-2)| = 2$, which is not 1.\n\nIn all cases, it is impossible to satisfy the three distance conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings from this particular finite ultrametric space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince we have found a valid instance of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0, and since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
