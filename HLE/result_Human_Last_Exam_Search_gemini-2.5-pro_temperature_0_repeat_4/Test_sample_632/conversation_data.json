    "Until 1950, the unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, which was subsequently removed by the city administration, was the tramway. This included the tracks set into the piazza's surface and the associated overhead electrical lines that powered the trams.\n\nFollowing a major reorganization of Rome's tram network in 1929, many lines in the historic center were suppressed, including one that passed through the Piazza della Rotonda. However, tram service to the area was later reinstated. After World War II, a general policy of replacing trams with buses was implemented across the city. The last tram line to service the area near the Pantheon, number 24, was definitively suppressed in November 1951. This led to the eventual removal of the tram tracks and the supporting overhead cables, which were in some cases attached to the historic buildings in the piazza.\n\n<<<the tramway>>>"
