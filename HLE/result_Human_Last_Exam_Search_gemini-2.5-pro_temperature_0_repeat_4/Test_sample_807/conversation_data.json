    "The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is commonly known as Rhodamine B. This substance is a fluorescent dye that typically appears as a green powder but produces a brilliant reddish-violet or fluorescent pink color when dissolved. It is used as a tracer dye in water, a biological stain, and a colorant in textiles and plastics.\n\nCrayola states that its crayons are made from paraffin wax and color pigments, and all of its products are nontoxic. The company emphasizes its commitment to safety, having its products evaluated by independent toxicologists to ensure they contain no known toxic substances in quantities that would be harmful to the human body.\n\nRhodamine B, however, has known health and safety concerns. In California, it is listed as a suspected carcinogen, and products containing it must carry a warning label. Due to these safety concerns and Crayola's strict non-toxic policy, it is highly unlikely that this chemical would be used in their crayons. Searches for Crayola's ingredients do not show Rhodamine B as a listed pigment. While some novelty crayon sets feature labels with chemical names that produce a similar color, these are not indicative of the actual ingredients in Crayola crayons.\n\nTherefore, no Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<No Crayola crayon contains this chemical.>>>"
