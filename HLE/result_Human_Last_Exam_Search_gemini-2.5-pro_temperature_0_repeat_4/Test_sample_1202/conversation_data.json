    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it can have several different fates. The mechanisms responsible for the retention and subsequent divergence of these duplicate genes are key drivers of evolutionary innovation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the potential fates and the mechanisms involved:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This process involves the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic information between homologous sequences, such as duplicate genes. Gene conversion tends to homogenize the sequences of the duplicates, working against divergence. Therefore, it is not a primary mechanism for retaining divergent copies.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. One copy accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene\". While this is a frequent outcome, it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention and divergence.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new, beneficial function. This process explains both the retention of the two genes (as they serve different purposes) and their divergence.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of these original functions or regulatory controls through degenerative mutations. As a result, both genes are required to carry out the full scope of the ancestral function, leading to their retention and divergence.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms. It is not a molecular mechanism that acts directly on genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the primary evolutionary models that explain how duplicate genes are retained and diverge. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes. This is because it relies on common, degenerative mutations to partition functions, creating a situation where both copies become necessary for survival. This provides a period of relaxed selection, preserving the duplicate from being lost to pseudogenization and allowing time for neofunctionalization to potentially occur later. Therefore, subfunctionalization is a powerful and highly probable mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
