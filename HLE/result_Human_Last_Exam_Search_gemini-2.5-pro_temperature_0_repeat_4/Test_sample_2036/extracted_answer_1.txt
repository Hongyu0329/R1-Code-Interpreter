To ensure separation, the arriving aircraft must be established in the circling pattern for runway 12, clear of the departure path for runway 30. A safe point for the controller to clear the takeoff would be when the arriving aircraft is on its downwind leg, which for a Category C aircraft would be at a position where the distance between the two aircraft is at least 5 nautical miles and their tracks are diverging. This would correspond to the arriving aircraft being approximately 5 to 5.5 NM from the VOR.
