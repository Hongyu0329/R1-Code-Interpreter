    "While the epic poem, the Aeneid, is primarily set in the Mediterranean, it mentions several real-world rivers, some of which are among the longest in the world. The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic are the Nile, the Ganges, and the Don.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Nile River** in Africa, with a length of approximately 6,650 kilometers (about 4,132 miles). It is widely considered the longest river on Earth and flows northward through northeastern Africa before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe second longest is the **Ganges River**, located on the Indian subcontinent. It flows for about 2,510 to 2,525 kilometers (approximately 1,560 to 1,569 miles). The Ganges originates in the western Himalayas and flows through India and Bangladesh to the Bay of Bengal.\n\nThe third longest river mentioned is the **Don River** in Russia. The Don flows for about 1,870 kilometers (around 1,162 miles) from its source near Moscow to the Sea of Azov.\n\nOther notable real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include:\n*   **Aras River**: This river, which flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, has a length of 1,072 kilometers (about 666 miles).\n*   **Hydaspes River**: Now known as the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus, it flows through India and Pakistan and is approximately 725 kilometers (about 450 miles) long.\n*   **Hebrus River**: Today called the Maritsa, this river runs through Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey for about 480 kilometers (around 300 miles).\n*   **Tiber River**: The most significant river in the narrative of the Aeneid, the Tiber flows through Rome and has a length of about 405 kilometers (around 252 miles).\n\nThe Aeneid also features several mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, and Phlegethon, which do not have a measurable physical length.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Ganges, and the Don.>>>"
