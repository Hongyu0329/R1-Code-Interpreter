The set `M` should be defined as the space of continuous functions on the interval `[0, 1]` that satisfy the boundary conditions, equipped with the supremum norm. Specifically:

**M = (C₀, ||·||_∞)**

where:
1.  **C₀** is the set of all continuous functions `u` defined on the interval `[0, 1]` that satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions `u(0) = 0` and `u(1) = 0`.
2.  **||·||_∞** is the supremum norm, defined as `||u||_∞ = sup_{x ∈ [0, 1]} |u(x)|`.

The space `(C₀[0, 1], ||·||_∞)` is a closed subspace of the Banach space `C[0, 1]` (the space of all continuous functions on `[0, 1]`), and is therefore a complete metric space itself.

While the operator `T` is defined on this space, to prove it is a contraction, one typically shows that `T` maps a closed ball within `M` into itself and is a contraction on that ball. Therefore, the proof involves selecting a set `B_R = {u ∈ C₀[0, 1] | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}` for a suitable radius `R > 0`, which is also a complete metric space. The fundamental space `M` remains `C₀[0, 1]`.
