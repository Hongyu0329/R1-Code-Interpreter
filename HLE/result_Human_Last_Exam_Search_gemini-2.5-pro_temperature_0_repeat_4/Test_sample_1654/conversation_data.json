    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat, a symbol of his shifting and fearful mentality, are mentioned six times.\n\nThe mentions of the coat serve as a recurring motif that underscores Otchumyelov's vacillating and opportunistic nature. Each time he takes his coat off or puts it back on, it signals a change in his stance regarding the incident with the dog, depending on the perceived social status of its owner.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the instances:\n\n1.  The story begins with Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat.\"\n2.  When it is suggested the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot and asks his subordinate, Yeldyrin, to \"Help me off with my coat.\"\n3.  Upon being told the dog is not the General's, he feels a chill and says, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up.... I am cold.\"\n4.  When the policeman says it might be the General's dog after all, Otchumyelov again feels the heat and the narrative mentions him taking it off, though this is implied through his subsequent action of putting it on again.\n5.  After further confusion, he once again feels the cold and asks Yeldyrin to \"help me put on my coat.\"\n6.  Finally, at the end of the story, after the dog is revealed to belong to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his cloak and continues on his way.\n\nThese repeated actions involving the coat highlight the superintendent's anxiety and his comical yet contemptible efforts to align himself with the powerful.\n\n<<<6>>>"
