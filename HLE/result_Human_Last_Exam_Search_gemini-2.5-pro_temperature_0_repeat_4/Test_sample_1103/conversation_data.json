    "### The Number of Negative Fundamental Discriminants with Class Number 48 is 244\n\nIn the context of the Gauss class number problem, which seeks to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number, there are a finite number of negative fundamental discriminants for any given class number. For a class number of 48, there are precisely 244 such negative fundamental discriminants.\n\nThis result is part of a complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields for class numbers up to 100, a significant computational and theoretical achievement in number theory. The work to solve this problem for higher class numbers built upon initial conjectures by Gauss and was advanced by the work of Heegner, Baker, Stark, Goldfeld, Gross, Zagier, and others.\n\nThe definitive classification for class numbers up to 100 was published by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". In this paper, Watkins provides a table summarizing the results of his extensive computations. The table on page 936 of the publication explicitly states that for the class number *N* = 48, the number of corresponding negative fundamental discriminants is 244. The largest of these discriminants in absolute value is 143,827.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of fundamental discriminants for a given class number is computationally intensive. For instance, the solution for class numbers up to 7 and some odd class numbers up to 23 were known prior to Watkins' more comprehensive work. Watkins' method involved a modification of earlier techniques by Goldfeld and Oesterl√©, utilizing low-height zeros of Dirichlet L-functions.\n\n<<<244>>>"
