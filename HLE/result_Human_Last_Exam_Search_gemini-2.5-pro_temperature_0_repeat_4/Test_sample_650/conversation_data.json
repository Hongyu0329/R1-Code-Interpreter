    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size.\n\n### Algorithm Breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n;` These are two assignment operations, which take constant time.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` This is an integer division.\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` This involves one multiplication and one subtraction.\n    *   All operations in this step are considered to take constant time, assuming that `n` fits within a machine's word size.\n\n2.  **Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The `while (q > 0)` loop is the core of the algorithm. We need to determine how many times it iterates.\n    *   Inside the loop, the value of `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Effectively, in each iteration, the value of `q` is divided by `c`.\n    *   The loop starts with `q = ⌊n/c⌋`. In the next iteration, `q` becomes approximately `n/c²`, then `n/c³`, and so on.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^k < 1`, which is equivalent to `c^k > n`.\n    *   By taking the logarithm of base `c` on both sides, we find that `k > log_c(n)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations of the loop is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, and the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n    *   The operations inside the loop (`i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`) are all elementary arithmetic and assignment operations, each taking constant time.\n\n3.  **Return (Step 3):**\n    *   Returning the result takes time proportional to the number of digits, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Complexity Calculation:\n\nThe total time complexity is dominated by the `while` loop. Since the loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times and each iteration takes constant time, the overall complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are ignored. Therefore, the complexity can be expressed as `O(log n)`.\n\nThis analysis assumes that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) on numbers up to size `n` can be performed in constant time. This is a common assumption in the RAM model of computation for numbers that fit within a processor's word size. If we consider arbitrary-precision arithmetic where `n` can be very large, the cost of the division and multiplication operations would depend on the number of bits in `n`, which is `log(n)`. In that case, the complexity would be higher. However, for the standard analysis of this algorithm, constant-time arithmetic is assumed.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
