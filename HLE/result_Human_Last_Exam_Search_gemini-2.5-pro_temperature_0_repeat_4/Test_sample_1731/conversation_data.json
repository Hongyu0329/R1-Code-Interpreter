    "In the framework of large deviation theory, the equilibrium properties of a physical system are understood as the most probable macroscopic state. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide the mathematical tools to quantify the probability of deviations from this most probable state. For a system of light quanta, i.e., a photon gas, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics, these theorems can be used to derive the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems to a Bose gas of photons successfully reproduces the foundational results of Bose and Planck within the large deviation framework.\n\n### **Theoretical Framework**\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem is concerned with the probability of the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In statistical mechanics, this can be applied to the distribution of particles over different states or spatial cells. The theorem states that the probability of observing a macroscopic configuration (a set of occupation numbers for different states) is exponentially small for large numbers of particles, with the rate of decay given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed distribution and the true underlying distribution. The equilibrium state corresponds to the distribution that minimizes this rate function, which is equivalent to maximizing the statistical entropy.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of large deviations of the sum of i.i.d. random variables from their expected value. In the context of a photon gas, this applies to the total energy of the system, which is the sum of the energies of individual photons. The theorem provides an exponential bound on the probability of such deviations, where the rate function is related to the thermodynamic free energy. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Cramér-Chernoff large deviation function reaches its minimum value.\n\n### **Application to the Bose Gas of Light Quanta (Photon Gas)**\n\nA photon gas in thermal equilibrium, such as black-body radiation, is a collection of non-interacting bosons. A crucial characteristic of this system is that the number of photons is not conserved, as they can be absorbed and emitted by the walls of the container. This leads to the chemical potential of the photon gas being zero at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nBy applying the large deviation theorems to this system, the following results for the equilibrium state are obtained:\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Distribution:** The most probable distribution of photons among the available energy levels, `ε`, is found by maximizing the entropy under the constraint of a fixed average total energy. This procedure, within the large deviation framework, yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean occupation number `<n_ε>` of a state with energy `ε`:\n\n    `<n_ε> = 1 / (exp(βε) - 1)`\n\n    where `β = 1 / (k_B * T)`, `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, and `T` is the temperature. This is the celebrated Planck distribution for photons.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy:** The mean energy (U) of the photon gas at equilibrium is the sum of the energies of all photons, weighted by the equilibrium distribution. It is calculated by summing over all possible energy states:\n\n    `U = Σ_ε ε * <n_ε> = Σ_ε (ε / (exp(βε) - 1))`\n\n    For a gas in a volume V, the sum can be converted to an integral over the density of states, which leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the energy density (U/V) is proportional to T⁴.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium Entropy:** The entropy (S) of the photon gas is a measure of the number of microscopic arrangements that correspond to the equilibrium macroscopic state. For a system of bosons, the entropy is given by the formula:\n\n    `S = k_B * Σ_ε [ (1 + <n_ε>) * ln(1 + <n_ε>) - <n_ε> * ln(<n_ε>) ]`\n\n    Substituting the equilibrium value of `<n_ε>` from the Planck distribution into this expression gives the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas. This calculation shows that the entropy `S` is proportional to `V * T³`.\n\nIn conclusion, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems provide a rigorous probabilistic foundation for the statistical mechanics of a photon gas. They affirm that the equilibrium state described by the Planck distribution is the most probable state and allow for the derivation of the well-established expressions for the equilibrium mean energy and entropy.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nThe equilibrium mean energy of a photon gas is given by the sum over all energy states `ε` of the energy of the state multiplied by its average occupation number according to the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential:\n`U = Σ_ε (ε / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1))`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe equilibrium entropy of a photon gas is given by the sum over all energy states `ε` of the statistical entropy for bosons, using the equilibrium occupation numbers:\n`S = k_B * Σ_ε [ (1 + <n_ε>) * ln(1 + <n_ε>) - <n_ε> * ln(<n_ε>) ]`, where `<n_ε> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n>>>"
