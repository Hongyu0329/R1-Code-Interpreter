    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\n*   **CIV**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (I = 1) comes before a larger value (V = 5), it is subtracted. C represents 100. Therefore, CIV is 100 + (5 - 1) = 104.\n*   **XXX**: X represents 10. When repeated, the values are added. So, XXX is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII**: This numeral is broken down as follows: MMM = 3000, DCCC = 800, LXXX = 80, and VIII = 8. Adding these together gives 3000 + 800 + 80 + 8 = 3888.\n\nNow, we can write the equation with modern numbers:\n\n104 / 30 - 3888\n\nNext, we perform the calculations:\n\n1.  **Division**: 104 ÷ 30 = 3.4666... (a repeating decimal)\n2.  **Subtraction**: 3.4666... - 3888 = -3884.5333...\n\nThe solution can also be expressed as a fraction. 104/30 simplifies to 52/15. So the equation is 52/15 - 3888. To subtract, we find a common denominator:\n\n52/15 - (3888 * 15)/15 = 52/15 - 58320/15 = -58268/15\n\nConverting the fraction -58268/15 to a decimal gives approximately -3884.5333.\n\n<<<-3884.5333...>>>"
