    "To determine the number of integer values for side AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB, we must analyze the conditions of the ambiguous case in trigonometry (SSA).\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometric Setup\nLet the sides of the triangle be `a, b, c` and the angles opposite to them be `A, B, C`.\nWe are given:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `m∠B = 30°`\n*   `b = AC` is the side we are examining.\n*   `c = AB` is the side for which there are two possible values.\n\nThe existence of two possible triangles is a known scenario in the \"Side-Side-Angle\" (SSA) case.\n\n### 2. Applying the Law of Sines\nThe Law of Sines states:\n`a / sin(A) = b / sin(B) = c / sin(C)`\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n`S / sin(A) = b / sin(30°)`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for `sin(A)`:\n`sin(A) = (S * sin(30°)) / b`\n\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the equation becomes:\n`sin(A) = S / (2b)`\n\n### 3. Conditions for Two Possible Triangles\nFor there to be two possible values for side `AB`, there must be two possible valid triangles. This occurs when there are two possible values for angle A. Let's call them `A₁` (an acute angle) and `A₂` (an obtuse angle).\n\nThe two conditions for this are:\n1.  **`0 < sin(A) < 1`**: This ensures that there are two possible angles, `A₁` and `A₂ = 180° - A₁`, that have the same sine value.\n    *   `0 < S / (2b) < 1`\n    *   Since `S` and `b` are side lengths, they are positive, so `S / (2b) > 0` is always true.\n    *   The condition `S / (2b) < 1` simplifies to `S < 2b`, or `b > S/2`.\n\n2.  **The second angle `A₂` must form a valid triangle**: The sum of angles in the second triangle must be less than 180°.\n    *   `A₂ + B < 180°`\n    *   `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`\n    *   `210° - A₁ < 180°`\n    *   `30° < A₁`\n\n    Since `A₁` is an acute angle, for `A₁ > 30°`, we must have `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`.\n    *   `S / (2b) > 1/2`\n    *   This simplifies to `S > b`.\n\nCombining these two conditions, for two triangles to exist, the length of side `AC` (which is `b`) must be within the open interval:\n`S/2 < b < S`\n\n### 4. Computing the Number of Integer Values\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` (or `b`). This means we need to count the number of integers in the interval `(S/2, S)`.\n\nThe value `S = SNYWR` is not a standard mathematical constant and cannot be determined from the problem statement alone. Without a numerical value for `S`, a final numerical answer cannot be computed.\n\nHowever, the number of integers can be expressed with a formula dependent on `S`. The number of integers in an open interval `(x, y)` is `floor(y-1) - ceil(x) + 1` or, more simply, the number of integers between the first integer greater than `x` and the last integer less than `y`.\n\nLet's denote the number of integer values as `N`.\n*   The smallest integer value for `b` is `floor(S/2) + 1`.\n*   The largest integer value for `b` is `S - 1` (since `b` must be strictly less than `S`).\n\nThe total number of integers is `(S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - floor(S/2)`.\n\nThis can be simplified based on whether `S` is even or odd:\n*   **If S is even**, let `S = 2k`. The number of integers is `(2k - 1) - k = k - 1 = S/2 - 1`.\n*   **If S is odd**, let `S = 2k + 1`. The number of integers is `(2k) - k = k = (S-1)/2`.\n\nSince the value of `S` is not provided, a final numerical answer cannot be calculated."
