This problem is theoretical and does not permit a precise numerical calculation from the given variables. The answer lies in a qualitative analysis of the competing evidence. The evidence for the pattern being a statistical artifact (strong local anti-correlation and a bottleneck structure) is more compelling than the evidence for a true violation (a single-subgraph high-confidence pattern). Therefore, an extremely high ratio of new, robust evidence would be required to confirm a fairness violation.
