    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a sequence of moves on a grid that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such walks of length *n* is denoted by a(*n*).\n\nCalculating the exact number of self-avoiding walks is a significant challenge in combinatorics, and no simple formula exists. However, values for a(*n*) for small *n* have been computed through various methods.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, the number of possible walks, a(10), is 44,100.\n\nHere is a list of the number of self-avoiding walks for small *n*:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
