    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that defines the structure. Coiled coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted by the letters `abcdefg`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nFirst, we need to establish the register of the heptad repeat in the given 32-amino-acid sequence. A key feature of many coiled coils, particularly a subtype known as leucine zippers, is the regular spacing of leucine residues. Let's examine the positions of the leucine (L) residues in the sequence:\n\n`G E I A Q S **L** K E I A K S **L** K E I A W S **L** K E I A Q S **L** K G`\n\nThe leucine residues are found at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28. The consistent spacing of seven residues between each leucine strongly suggests that leucine occupies the same position within each heptad repeat. In classic coiled coils, the 'd' position is frequently occupied by leucine.\n\nAssuming Leucine (L) is at the **'d'** position, the 'a' position of the same heptad would be three residues prior (`d-3=a`). Let's identify the amino acids at the 'a' positions based on this assumption:\n*   **Heptad 1:** The 'd' position is L at residue 7. The 'a' position is residue 4, which is Alanine (**A**).\n*   **Heptad 2:** The 'd' position is L at residue 14. The 'a' position is residue 11, which is Alanine (**A**).\n*   **Heptad 3:** The 'd' position is L at residue 21. The 'a' position is residue 18, which is Tryptophan (**W**).\n*   **Heptad 4:** The 'd' position is L at residue 28. The 'a' position is residue 25, which is Alanine (**A**).\n\nThis gives us the following pairing for the core 'a' and 'd' positions for the four heptads:\n*   **Heptad 1:** a=A, d=L\n*   **Heptad 2:** a=A, d=L\n*   **Heptad 3:** a=W, d=L\n*   **Heptad 4:** a=A, d=L\n\n### 2. Determining Oligomeric State from Core Residues\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictates the packing efficiency and, consequently, the number of helices in the coiled coil. Landmark studies on the GCN4 coiled coil established a set of rules based on the distribution of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L):\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'. This is because the beta-branched side chain of isoleucine packs efficiently at the 'a' position, while the gamma-branched leucine fits well at the 'd' position in a dimeric interface.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Favored by Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd'.\n\nIn our sequence, the 'd' positions are consistently Leucine (L), which strongly argues against a tetrameric state. The 'a' positions are predominantly Alanine (A), with one Tryptophan (W).\n\n*   The `d=L` pattern is a hallmark of dimeric leucine zippers.\n*   The `a=A` pattern does not fit the canonical rules for trimers or tetramers. Alanine is a small, non-branched hydrophobic residue. While it contributes to the hydrophobic core, its small size can create packing defects in the more constrained cores of higher-order oligomers. In a dimeric structure, the interface is more accommodating to this variation.\n*   The single bulky Tryptophan (W) at an 'a' position is an anomaly but can be more easily accommodated within the more flexible dimeric interface compared to the tighter packing of trimers or tetramers.\n\nGiven that the sequence has Leucine consistently at the 'd' position and predominantly small Alanine residues at the 'a' position, the packing arrangement most closely resembles that of a **dimer**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
