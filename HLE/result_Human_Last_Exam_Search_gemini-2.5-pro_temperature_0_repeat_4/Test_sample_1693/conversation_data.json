    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the passenger ship **SS *Brazza***.\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a tonnage of 10,387 gross register tons (GRT), was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-37 on May 28, 1940. The attack occurred off the coast of Portugal while the *Brazza* was on a voyage from Bordeaux to Casablanca.\n\nSeveral other French ships were lost in the period leading up to the armistice. For instance, the destroyer *Jaguar*, with a full load displacement of approximately 3,000 tons, was sunk on May 23, 1940, but this was the result of an attack by German E-boats (motor torpedo boats), not a U-boat. Similarly, the torpedo boat *Orage*, with a displacement of about 1,825 tons, was sunk on the same day by the Luftwaffe (German air force). The tanker *Monique*, at 7,011 GRT, was also sunk by a U-boat on June 22, 1940, the day of the armistice, but it was smaller than the *Brazza*.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, the *Brazza* stands as the largest French vessel lost to a U-boat attack prior to the 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<SS Brazza>>>"
