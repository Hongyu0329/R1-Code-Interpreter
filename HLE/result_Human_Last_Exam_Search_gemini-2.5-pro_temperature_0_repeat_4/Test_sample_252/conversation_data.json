    "The question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography. A \"full spectral volume\" implies three spatial dimensions (x, y, z) and a spectral dimension (λ), creating a 4D dataset. The technique must capture this from a single 2D image, a method known as snapshot imaging.\n\nComputed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a relevant snapshot technique. A typical CTIS system uses a disperser, such as a diffraction grating, to project spectrally-dispersed views of a scene onto a 2D sensor. The resulting image contains a central, undispersed (panchromatic) image (the zeroth diffraction order) and multiple, spectrally-smeared images (higher diffraction orders) arranged around it. These multiple dispersed images are treated as different projections of the scene's data cube, from which the spectral information can be tomographically reconstructed.\n\nA single 2D diffraction grating can produce a pattern of multiple projections (e.g., a 5x5 grid) on the detector array. This is sufficient for reconstructing a 3D (x, y, λ) hyperspectral data cube of a 2D scene.\n\nHowever, the question specifies the reconstruction of a \"full spectral volume,\" which includes the depth dimension (z). Capturing this 4D (x, y, z, λ) information in a single snapshot is more complex. While a single grating can encode spectral information, it does not inherently encode depth information from a single viewpoint. To achieve this, some systems have been proposed that use more than one grating. For instance, a technique known as Snapshot Spectral Tomographic Imaging (SSTI) uses two identical gratings. The arrangement of two gratings creates a shearing effect that is dependent on both wavelength and the axial (depth) position of the object, allowing for the encoding and subsequent reconstruction of the 4D spectral volume.\n\nWhile a single, specially designed computer-generated hologram (a type of diffraction grating) is the core dispersive element in many CTIS systems for 2D scene analysis, the explicit requirement to reconstruct a 3D spatial volume plus the spectral dimension from a single snapshot points toward systems that can encode depth. The dual-grating SSTI system is a direct example of such a capability. Therefore, to ensure the encoding of depth information for a full 3D spatial volume in a snapshot, a second grating is necessary.\n\n<<<B>>>"
