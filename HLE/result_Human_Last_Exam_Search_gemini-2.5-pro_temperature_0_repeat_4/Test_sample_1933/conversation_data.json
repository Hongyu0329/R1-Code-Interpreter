    "The VC dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concept Class\nThe logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for the construction of formulas using the four unary predicates from schema $S$ (let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$), existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunctions ($\\land$), and the logical constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$). We are interested in the sets of elements that can be defined by formulas in this logic that have one free variable, say $x$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this language can be broken down into two parts: a quantifier-free part that depends on $x$, and a series of sentences (formulas with no free variables). A general formula looks like:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv Q(x) \\land C$\nwhere:\n*   $Q(x)$ is a quantifier-free formula with the free variable $x$. Since only conjunction is allowed, $Q(x)$ must be a conjunction of atomic predicates, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. These are also known as monotone monomials.\n*   $C$ is a conjunction of sentences of the form $\\exists y \\, M(y)$, where $M(y)$ is also a monotone monomial.\n\nIn any given model (a universe with specific interpretations for the predicates), the sentence part $C$ is either true or false.\n*   If $C$ is false in the model, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, and the defined set is the empty set ($\\emptyset$).\n*   If $C$ is true in the model, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $Q(x)$, and the defined set is the set of all elements that satisfy the conjunction of predicates in $Q(x)$.\n\nTherefore, in any model, the class of sets (concepts) that can be defined by this logic is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the base predicate sets $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$, plus the empty set.\n\n### 2. VC Dimension of Intersections\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of a concept class formed by the intersections of 4 given sets. This is a standard result in computational learning theory. The VC dimension of a concept class consisting of all finite intersections of $n$ base sets is exactly $n$. For this problem, $n=4$.\n\n### 3. Proof of the VC Dimension\nTo prove that the VC dimension is 4, we need to show two things:\n1.  There exists a set of size 4 that can be shattered.\n2.  No set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\n**Lower Bound (VCdim $\\ge 4$):**\nWe must construct a model and a set $S$ of size 4 that can be shattered.\n*   Let the universe be $U = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$.\n*   Let the set to be shattered be $S = U$.\n*   Define the interpretation of the four predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ as subsets of $U$:\n    *   $P_1 = \\{s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$\n    *   $P_2 = \\{s_1, s_3, s_4\\}$\n    *   $P_3 = \\{s_1, s_2, s_4\\}$\n    *   $P_4 = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$\n    In general, $P_i = S \\setminus \\{s_i\\}$.\n\nNow, for any desired subset $S' \\subseteq S$, we can define it using a formula. Let $I = \\{i \\mid s_i \\notin S'\\}$. The concept defined by the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i$ is precisely $S'$. For example, to select the subset $\\{s_1, s_2\\}$, we choose $I=\\{3, 4\\}$ and the corresponding concept is $P_3 \\cap P_4 = \\{s_1, s_2, s_4\\} \\cap \\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\} = \\{s_1, s_2\\}$. The formula for this is $P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$, which is in our allowed language. This construction works for all $2^4=16$ subsets of $S$, thus shattering it. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VCdim $\\le 4$):**\nWe need to show that no set of size 5 can be shattered. Let $S = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points. The concepts are intersections of the 4 predicate sets $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n\nAssume $S$ is shattered. For each element $x_j \\in S$, consider the subset $S_j = S \\setminus \\{x_j\\}$. Since $S$ is shattered, there must be a concept $C_j$ (an intersection of some of the $P_i$'s) that selects exactly $S_j$. This means $x_j \\notin C_j$, but $x_k \\in C_j$ for all $k \\neq j$.\nThe fact that $x_j \\notin C_j$ implies that there is at least one predicate, say $P_{i_j}$, such that $x_j \\notin P_{i_j}$ and $P_{i_j}$ is part of the intersection forming $C_j$. The fact that $x_k \\in C_j$ for all $k \\neq j$ implies that $x_k \\in P_{i_j}$ for all $k \\neq j$.\n\nSo, for each of the 5 points $x_j$, we have found a predicate $P_{i_j}$ that separates it from the other 4 points. This gives us a mapping from the 5 points in $S$ to the 4 predicates. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two points, say $x_a$ and $x_b$, must be mapped to the same predicate, say $P_k$.\nThis leads to a contradiction:\n*   Because $x_a$ maps to $P_k$, we have $x_a \\notin P_k$ but $x_b \\in P_k$.\n*   Because $x_b$ maps to $P_k$, we have $x_b \\notin P_k$ but $x_a \\in P_k$.\nIt is impossible for $x_b$ to be both in and not in $P_k$. Therefore, the initial assumption that $S$ can be shattered is false. This proves the VC dimension cannot exceed 4.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it must be exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
