    "The first step of breaking down the problem was to understand the general properties of the Riemann tensor. The search results confirm that the Riemann tensor possesses several symmetries. Specifically, it is antisymmetric in its first two and last two indices, and symmetric under the exchange of these two pairs of indices. Additionally, it satisfies the first (algebraic) Bianchi identity. These symmetries reduce the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor in an n-dimensional manifold to n²(n²-1)/12.\n\nThe next step is to understand what a Kähler manifold is and what extra constraints this structure imposes on the Riemann tensor. This will be the focus of the next search query. After that, I will be able to combine the information to find the final answer.I have gathered information about the general symmetries of the Riemann tensor and the definition and properties of a Kähler manifold. The search results indicate that a Kähler manifold has a complex structure, a Riemannian structure, and a symplectic structure which are all compatible. This compatibility imposes constraints on the geometry, such as the holonomy group being a subgroup of the unitary group U(n). Some results mention that on a Kähler manifold, certain components of the Christoffel symbols vanish in holomorphic coordinates, and that the Ricci tensor has a simplified form. However, the direct impact of the Kähler condition on the symmetries of the full Riemann tensor and the precise number of its independent components is not yet explicitly stated. I need to find a source that directly discusses the symmetries of the Riemann tensor specifically on a Kähler manifold and how they reduce the number of independent components.I have now gathered sufficient information to answer the user's request. The search results have provided the general symmetries of the Riemann tensor, the definition of a Kähler manifold, and crucially, the additional symmetries imposed on the Riemann tensor by the Kähler condition. Specifically, the search results indicate that on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension n (and real dimension 2n), the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor are of the form R<sub>i_jk_l</sub>, R<sub>i_j_kl</sub>, R<sub>_ij_k_l</sub>, and R<sub>_ij_kl</sub>. Furthermore, there are additional symmetries such as R(u, v, z, w) = R(z, w, u, v) and R(u, v, z, w) = R(u, v, Jz, Jw) where J is the complex structure. One of the search results explicitly states that the number of independent components is (n(n+1)/2)^2. I can now synthesize this information to provide a complete answer.\n\nOn a Kähler manifold of complex dimension n (and therefore real dimension 2n), the Riemann tensor possesses additional symmetries beyond those of a general Riemannian manifold. These extra symmetries significantly reduce the number of its independent components.\n\nA general real 2n-dimensional Riemannian manifold has a Riemann tensor with  n²(4n²-1)/3  independent components. However, the presence of a compatible complex structure on a Kähler manifold introduces further constraints.\n\nThe key additional symmetries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold can be summarized as follows:\n*   The only non-vanishing components of the curvature tensor are those with an equal number of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices in the first and second pairs of indices. In local complex coordinates (z¹, ..., zⁿ), these are of the type R<sub>i_jk_l</sub>, where i, j, k, l are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic indices.\n*   The Riemann tensor is compatible with the complex structure J, which leads to relations like R(X, Y)J = J(R(X, Y)).\n\nDue to these additional symmetries, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension n is given by the square of the number of independent components of a symmetric tensor on an n-dimensional vector space. This results in:\n\n(n(n+1)/2)²\n\nTherefore, a Kähler manifold of complex dimension n has (n(n+1)/2)² independent components for its Riemann tensor.\n\n<<< (n(n+1)/2)**2 >>>"
