    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" found on a Zapotec monument. This artifact, known as Monument 3, was discovered at San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico.\n\nThe monument is a stone carving of a slain captive, with two glyphs between his legs that are interpreted as his name, \"1 Earthquake,\" based on the 260-day ritual calendar. While initially dated to 500–600 BCE, making it the earliest writing in Mesoamerica at the time of its discovery, some scholars have expressed doubts about this dating, suggesting the monument may have been reused.\n\nOther early examples of recorded dates in pre-Columbian writing systems include:\n\n*   **Olmec:** While the Olmec Cascajal Block, dated to around 900 BCE, is considered by many to be the oldest writing in the Americas, it does not contain a calendrical date. Another Olmec artifact, a cylinder seal from around 650 B.C., shows early glyphs that are considered a form of writing.\n*   **Maya:** The earliest known Maya writing includes a depiction of the date \"7 Deer\" from the 260-day calendar. These painted mural fragments were found at San Bartolo, Guatemala, and date to between 300 and 200 B.C.\n*   **Epi-Olmec:** The Chiapa de Corzo stela features the oldest known Long Count date, which corresponds to 36 BCE. This is the earliest monument in the Americas to be inscribed with its own specific date.\n\nDespite the debate over its precise dating, the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph on Zapotec Monument 3 is widely cited as the earliest known recorded calendrical date in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is \"1 Earthquake,\" found on Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote, Oaxaca, Mexico, dated to approximately 500-600 BCE.>>>"
