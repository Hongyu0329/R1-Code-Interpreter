    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 divides all coefficients (0, 8, 14) except for the leading coefficient (1).\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2 = 4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\nAccording to Eisenstein's criterion, these conditions are sufficient to conclude that $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the Galois group are therefore 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nNext, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^9 \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, the discriminant is not a perfect square. A key theorem in Galois theory states that the Galois group of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group of $P(x)$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24) and the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a depressed quartic $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$. For our polynomial, with $c=8$ and $d=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe now test this cubic polynomial for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. Testing these divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This is a crucial piece of information. The structure of the Galois group is related to the reducibility of the resolvent cubic.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Galois Group\nThe properties we have found are:\n1.  The polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible.\n2.  The discriminant is not a perfect square.\n3.  The resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis specific combination of properties leads to the conclusion that the Galois group is either the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$. To distinguish between these two, we can examine the other roots of the resolvent cubic. By dividing $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$, we get the quadratic factor $y^2 + 8y + 8$. The roots of this quadratic are $y = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational. Since the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group is identified as $D_4$.\n\nThe order of the dihedral group $D_4$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
