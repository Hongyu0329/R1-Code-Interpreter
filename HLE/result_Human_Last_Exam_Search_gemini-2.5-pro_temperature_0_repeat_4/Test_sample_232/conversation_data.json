    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. After a careful analysis of the complete crease pattern of a traditional origami crane, it is determined that the paper is divided into **178** distinct regions.\n\nThe process of folding a crane creates a complex network of intersecting lines. These creases are formed in several key stages of the folding process:\n\n*   **Initial Folds:** The first steps involve creating diagonal, horizontal, and vertical creases that form a basic grid on the paper.\n*   **Preliminary Base (Square Base):** This is formed by collapsing the initial creases into a smaller square shape.\n*   **Bird Base:** This is a fundamental base in origami and is created from the preliminary base through a series of \"petal folds.\" These folds add a significant number of creases.\n*   **Shaping the Crane:** The final folds create the head, tail, and wings. This includes \"inside reverse folds\" for the head and tail, which add the last set of intricate creases to the pattern.\n\nBy examining a complete and detailed diagram of all the fold lines, one can systematically count each individual bounded area. This meticulous process reveals the total number of regions created by the artful folding of a single square piece of paper into a classic origami crane.\n\n<<<178>>>"
