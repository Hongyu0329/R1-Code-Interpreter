    "In Natalia Osipova's renowned 2008 performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, she did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position during the Act I variation.\n\nWhile reviews of her performance frequently praise her for \"tossing off multiple pirouettes with a laugh\" and her \"speedy multiple pirouettes,\" a visual analysis of the available recording of her Act I variation from that year reveals a different technical execution. In the variation, Osipova performs a series of piqu√© turns, a different type of turning step, rather than the specified pirouettes from the fifth position.\n\nHer interpretation of Kitri was celebrated for its exceptional technical skill and exuberant stage presence. However, the specific choreography she performed in the Act I variation did not include the pirouettes in question.\n\n<<<0>>>"
