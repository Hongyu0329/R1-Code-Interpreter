    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a differential operator is commonly denoted as $a_1(x)$ in the local form or $A_1$ in the integrated form. The heat kernel for the operator $D^2$ (the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator) has an asymptotic expansion for small $t$:\n$K(t, x, x; D^2) \\sim \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{d/2}} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x) t^n$\nwhere $d$ is the spacetime dimension and $a_n(x)$ are the local Seeley-DeWitt coefficients.\n\nThe operator $D^2$ for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is given by the Lichnerowicz formula:\n$D^2 = -g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu + \\frac{1}{4}R + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}$\nHere, $\\nabla_\\mu$ is the covariant derivative on the spinor bundle coupled to the gauge field, $R$ is the scalar curvature of the spacetime manifold, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the gauge field strength tensor, and $\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2}[\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu]$ with $\\gamma^\\mu$ being the Dirac gamma matrices.\n\nThis operator can be written in the standard form $\\Delta = -(\\nabla^2 + E)$, where $\\nabla^2 = g^{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla_\\mu\\nabla_\\nu$ is the connection Laplacian (with a negative sign convention) and $E$ is an endomorphism on the spinor bundle. Comparing the forms, we identify:\n$E = - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}R \\cdot I + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}\\right)$\nwhere $I$ is the identity operator on the fiber (the tensor product of spinor and gauge representation spaces).\n\nThe general formula for the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, $a_1(x)$, for an operator of the form $-(\\nabla^2 + E)$ is:\n$a_1(x) = \\text{tr}\\left(E + \\frac{1}{6}R \\cdot I\\right)$\nThe trace, denoted by 'tr', is taken over the fiber space.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E$:\n$a_1(x) = \\text{tr}\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}R \\cdot I - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{6}R \\cdot I\\right)$\n$a_1(x) = \\text{tr}\\left(-\\frac{1}{12}R \\cdot I - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}\\right)$\n\nTo obtain the scalar coefficient, we perform the trace over the spinor and gauge group indices.\n$a_1(x) = -\\frac{1}{12}R \\cdot \\text{Tr}_S(I_S)\\text{Tr}_V(I_V) - \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}_S(\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu})\\text{Tr}_V(F_{\\mu\\nu})$\nThe trace of the sigma matrices $\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}$ over the spinor space is zero due to the cyclic property of the trace ($\\text{Tr}(\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu) = \\text{Tr}(\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\mu)$). Therefore, the term involving the gauge field strength vanishes.\n\nThis leaves the final expression for the second coefficient:\n$a_1(x) = -\\frac{1}{12}R \\cdot \\text{dim}(S) \\cdot \\text{dim}(V)$\nwhere $\\text{dim}(S)$ is the dimension of the spinor representation (which is $2^{\\lfloor d/2 \\rfloor}$ in $d$ dimensions) and $\\text{dim}(V)$ is the dimension of the representation of the gauge group.\n\nThis coefficient, when integrated over the manifold, gives the Einstein-Hilbert action term in the spectral action expansion.\n\n<<<$- \\frac{\\text{dim}(S) \\cdot \\text{dim}(V)}{12} R$>>>"
