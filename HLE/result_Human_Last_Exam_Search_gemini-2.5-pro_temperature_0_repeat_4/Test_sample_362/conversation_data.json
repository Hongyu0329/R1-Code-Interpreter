    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, which reacts with the carbonyl compound. A key advantage of this method is that the double bond forms specifically at the location of the original carbonyl group, offering precise control over the product's structure.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It is also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide. Its structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and (C₆H₄Cl) is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) is exchanged with the substituted ethylidene group (=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)) from the ylide. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\nThe resulting alkene product has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl). The systematic name for this compound is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe reaction typically produces a mixture of geometric isomers, (E) and (Z), around the newly formed double bond. The specific ratio of these isomers can be influenced by the reaction conditions and the nature of the ylide. Unstabilized ylides, like the one in this reaction, often favor the formation of the Z-isomer.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
