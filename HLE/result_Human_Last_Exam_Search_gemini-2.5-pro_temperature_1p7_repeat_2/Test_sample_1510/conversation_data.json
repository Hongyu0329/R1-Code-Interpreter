    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry properties, including their associated point group. The order of a point group relates to the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern at a point. A point group of order 2 means that the symmetries at a point are limited to the identity operation and one other symmetry operation, which can be either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection.\n\nThe crystallographic point groups are restricted to those that can be combined with a lattice. The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group of C2. Its symmetries consist of translations and 180-degree rotations.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group of D1. It has translations and reflections along parallel axes.\n*   **pg**: This group's point group is also D1. Its symmetries involve translations and glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group D1. It contains translations, reflections, and glide reflections with parallel axes.\n\nOther wallpaper groups, such as pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm, have a point group of D2, which is of order 4, and are therefore not included. Groups with higher-order rotations, such as p3 or p4, will also have point groups of a higher order.\n\n<<<4>>>"
