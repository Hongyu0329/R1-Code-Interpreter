    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four distinct colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that appears colorless when pure but quickly develops a yellow hue when exposed to light, leading it to also be known as yellow phosphorus. Therefore, white and yellow are considered variations of the same allotrope.\n\nRed phosphorus has a color that can range from orange-red to a deep red or dark red-purple. It is typically a powder with a deep red color.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and, as its name suggests, is black and flaky, with an appearance similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is another distinct allotrope. It can appear as violet, red/purple, or as dark orange, brown, or have a steely blue luster depending on how it is prepared and viewed. Some sources consider it a crystalline form of red phosphorus.\n\nIn summary, the distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White** (which can appear yellowish)\n*   **Red** (with variations in shade)\n*   **Black**\n*   **Violet** (which can appear as purple or dark orange/brown)\n\nTherefore, there are four observable colors for pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<4>>>"
