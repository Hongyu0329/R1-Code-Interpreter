    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to describing changes in the laws of nature, including both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine introduced and adapted a concept from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy into Christian theology known as ***rationes seminales***, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\" This terminology provided a sophisticated framework for understanding how nature could undergo significant changes while still being under the providential order of God.\n\nThese *rationes seminales* are invisible, \"seedlike principles\" or latent potentialities that God embedded within the created world from the very beginning. They contain the blueprints for all things that would later come into existence, developing over time as conditions become suitable. This concept allowed Augustine to explain events that appear to be \"new\" or to contravene the normal course of nature without suggesting that God was constantly intervening in a chaotic way.\n\n**Application to the Virgin Birth:**\nAugustine argued that the virgin birth was a \"notable miracle.\" He explained that while the bodies of all other humans develop from the seminal reasons God placed in the elements, the body of Christ was an exception. His conception, without the lust associated with normal human procreation, meant that He was not subject to the original sin that Augustine believed was transmitted through this process. In his famous phrase, Augustine taught that miracles are not necessarily \"contrary to nature\" (*contra naturam*), but rather \"contrary to what we know of nature\" (*contra quam est nota natura*), because the ultimate cause is hidden within God's will. Mary's virginity was a unique event where God acted directly, signifying that the members of the Church would later be born spiritually from a \"virgin Church.\"\n\n**Application to the Fall:**\nAugustine taught that the Fall of man corrupted human nature, which was \"vitiated by original sin.\" The perfection of the original created order was lost, and humanity became subject to concupiscence, disease, and death. The framework of *rationes seminales* helps to explain this change. The Fall introduced a disordered condition into creation, altering how the original \"seminal reasons\" function within human nature. After the Fall, humanity's natural abilities, including reason and will, became weakened and misdirected toward evil. This theological framework accounts for a systemic change in how natural laws operated in relation to humanity, establishing a \"new normal\" of corruption passed down through generations.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
