    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nNewton famously mapped the seven colors of the visible spectrum—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—to the notes of a diatonic musical scale. Specifically, he used the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nFollowing this mapping:\n*   Red corresponds to D\n*   Orange corresponds to E\n*   Yellow corresponds to F\n*   **Green corresponds to G**\n*   Blue corresponds to A\n*   Indigo corresponds to B\n*   Violet corresponds to C\n\nThe combination of yellow and blue produces the color green. Therefore, the range on Newton's color circle between green and blue begins with the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
