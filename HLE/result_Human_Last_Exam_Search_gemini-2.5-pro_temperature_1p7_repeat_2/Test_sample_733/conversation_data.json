    "According to the classification provided in the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\" by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart, there are 16 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset S of a group G is called product-free if for any elements a and b in S, their product ab is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion (also called locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the group G.\n\nThe complete classification of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 was established by Giudici and Hart. Their analysis shows that a finite group has such a set if and only if it is one of the following 16 groups:\n\n**Cyclic Groups (6 groups):**\n*   C₅ (cyclic group of order 5)\n*   C₆ (cyclic group of order 6)\n*   C₇ (cyclic group of order 7)\n*   C₈ (cyclic group of order 8)\n*   C₉ (cyclic group of order 9)\n*   C₁₀ (cyclic group of order 10)\n\n**Other Abelian Groups (3 groups):**\n*   C₂ × C₂ (the Klein four-group)\n*   C₂ × C₄\n*   C₂ × C₂ × C₂ (the elementary abelian group of order 8)\n\n**Dihedral Groups (4 groups):**\n*   D₆ (dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n*   D₈ (dihedral group of order 8)\n*   D₁₀ (dihedral group of order 10)\n*   D₁₂ (dihedral group of order 12)\n\n**Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups (2 groups):**\n*   Q₈ (the quaternion group of order 8)\n*   Q₁₂ (the dicyclic group of order 12)\n\n**Other Groups (1 group):**\n*   A₄ (the alternating group on four elements)\n\nSumming these up (6 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 1) gives a total of 16 distinct finite groups.\n\n<<<16>>>"
