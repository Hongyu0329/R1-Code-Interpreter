    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded by using anti-commuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. For a single Grassmann variable, let's call it `ψ`, the anti-commuting property means that `ψ² = 0`. This mathematical property is the direct embodiment of the Pauli principle, as it ensures that any state with two identical fermions vanishes.\n\nTo perform integrals over these Grassmann variables, a specific set of rules, known as Berezin integration, is defined. The integration measure for a single Grassmann variable `dψ` is not a value in the traditional sense but is defined by its operational effect on functions of `ψ`. The fundamental rules for this integration are:\n\n1.  ∫ dψ = 0\n2.  ∫ dψ ψ = 1\n\nThe first rule states that the integral of a constant is zero. The second rule is a normalization convention. This normalization is crucial because it defines a non-trivial result for the integral of a single fermion's state variable, which is the only non-vanishing state due to the `ψ² = 0` rule. Therefore, the value of the measure, as defined by this normalization, that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle within the path integral formalism is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
