    "I have gathered information on the starting and ending positions of the following ballet steps: Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, Assemblé, Glissade derrière, and Gargouillade.\n\n- **Entrechat six:** Starts in fifth position with one foot in front and ends in fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n- **Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves moving from a closed position (like fifth) to an open position (like second) and can return to the closed position. The term \"changé\" implies a change of feet. An échappé battu adds beats of the legs. While a simple échappé might return to the original position, the addition of \"changé\" indicates the feet will have switched places upon returning to fifth position.\n- **Assemblé:** This step begins in fifth position and ends in fifth position. The leg brushes out and then \"assembles\" with the other leg in the air to land back in fifth.\n- **Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade derrière\" begins with the back foot and ends with the same foot in the back, maintaining the same starting position.\n- **Gargouillade:** This is described as an embellished pas de chat, starting in fifth position and ending in fifth position. It involves circular movements of both legs in the air.\n\nBased on this, it seems there might be more than one correct answer depending on the specific execution of the step. For instance, a \"Glissade derrière\" explicitly states the ending position is the same as the starting position.  An \"Assemblé\" also starts and ends in fifth position. A \"Gargouillade\" is also described as starting and ending in fifth position.\n\nLet's re-evaluate \"Glissade derrière\". Some sources state it maintains the same foot in the back throughout, thus the position is unchanged.  Others mention glissades can be done with or without a change of feet. However, the specific term \"derrière\" implies the back leg starts the movement and returns to the back.\n\nLet's look closer at the other options to be certain. \"Entrechat six\" explicitly involves a change of feet. \"Échappé battu changé\" also explicitly includes \"changé,\" meaning change.\n\nThis leaves \"Assemblé\", \"Glissade derrière\", and \"Gargouillade\" as potential answers.  Most definitions of assemblé state it begins and ends in fifth position. Similarly for gargouillade, it is described as starting and ending in 5th position.\n\nLet's consider the most definitive answer. A glissade's primary function is often to travel and link other steps, which might imply a change of position in space even if the foot configuration is the same. An assemblé can also travel, but the core definition is about bringing the legs together. The definition for Glissade derrière very clearly states it \"begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back\" and \"The position of the feet do not change due to this and end just where they began\". This is a very strong and direct statement.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to re-examine all definitions. An assemblé's core principle is to \"find your home base,\" which means starting and ending in fifth position.  A gargouillade, being an embellished pas de chat, typically starts and ends in fifth position.\n\nThe question asks which step *has* the same ending and starting leg *position*. This can be interpreted as the configuration of the legs (e.g., fifth position) rather than the exact location on the stage.\n\nLet's assume the question means the configuration of the legs.\n- Entrechat six: Changes from, for example, right foot front to left foot front.\n- Échappé battu changé: \"Changé\" means the feet are switched.\n- Assemblé: Starts and ends in fifth position. While the dancer may travel, the leg *position* (fifth) is the same.\n- Glissade derrière: Starts and ends in the same position without the feet changing.\n- Gargouillade: Starts and ends in fifth position.\n\nGiven that multiple options seem to fit the description, I might be misinterpreting something or one definition is more universally true or less prone to variations. Let's look for a key distinction.\n\nAssemblé: The purpose is to assemble the legs in the air and land in fifth. This fundamentally starts and ends in the same position.\nGlissade derrière: \"Derrière\" specifies that the back leg initiates and returns to the back, implying no change in foot position.\nGargouillade: Described as starting and ending in 5th position.\n\nIs there a nuance I am missing? Perhaps some of these steps can be performed with a change of feet as a variation. Glissade can be \"changé\". However, \"Glissade derrière\" specifically describes no change. An assemblé can be done \"dessus\" (over) or \"dessous\" (under) which implies a change of which foot is in front, but a basic assemblé starts and lands in the same fifth position.\n\nLet's think about what a single, definitive answer would be.  While Glissade derrière is defined as not changing feet, the term Glissade itself is broad. Assemblé, by its very name (\"to assemble\"), implies returning to a closed position, which is the starting position of fifth.  It is a core part of its identity. Let's review the definition again. \"start and end assemblé in fifth position.\"  \"Legs assemble at the same time and return to fifth position.\" \"Dancer leaps from one foot and lands on two feet, in fifth position.\" This seems to be the most consistent and fundamental definition without qualifiers.\n\nWhile Glissade derrière and Gargouillade also fit the description, let's reconsider. Gargouillade is an embellished step, and while it starts and ends in 5th, its complexity might allow for variations. Glissade has many forms, and while \"derrière\" is specific, it's a variation of a step that can change. Assemblé's primary definition across multiple sources consistently points to starting and ending in the same position (fifth). It is a fundamental building block defined by this characteristic.  Therefore, it is the strongest candidate for the most unequivocally correct answer.After analyzing the definitions of the provided classical ballet steps, the one with the ending leg position consistently being the same as the starting position is the assemblé.\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times, and the dancer lands with the opposite foot in front from where they started. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"échappé\" describes a movement from a closed to an open position, and \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will have switched places upon returning to the closed position, making the start and end positions different.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The French word \"assemblé\" means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" In this step, the dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and then \"assembles\" the legs together in the air before landing. A fundamental principle of the assemblé is that it begins and ends in the fifth position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. In a \"glissade derrière,\" the dancer begins with the back foot and ends with the same foot in the back, meaning the foot position does not change. While this also fits the description, some glissades can be performed with a change of feet (\"changé\").\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is an embellished \"pas de chat\" that typically starts and finishes in the fifth position. However, like the glissade, as a more complex step, variations may exist.\n\nOf the choices provided, the most definitive answer where the fundamental execution of the step involves starting and ending in the same leg position is the **assemblé**. Its very name and core technical definition emphasize returning to the initial closed position.\n\n<<<C>>>"
