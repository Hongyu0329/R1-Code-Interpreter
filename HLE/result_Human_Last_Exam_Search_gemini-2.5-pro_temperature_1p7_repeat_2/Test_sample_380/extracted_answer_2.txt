In summary, your physical reasoning is correct. The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for Alfv√©n ion cyclotron waves does indeed use the magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial; it follows the Parker spiral. The use of "Y and Z" components in a definition refers to the axes perpendicular to the local magnetic field in a dynamically adjusted, field-aligned coordinate system, which is the appropriate framework for this analysis.
