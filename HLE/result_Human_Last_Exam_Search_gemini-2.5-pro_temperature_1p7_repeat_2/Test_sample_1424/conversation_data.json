    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, for a non-interacting system has a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship is most clearly seen through its spectral representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function, which describes the propagation of a particle without any interactions, can be expressed in frequency-momentum space. For a given momentum **k** and frequency ω, the bare Green's function G_0(**k**, ω) is given by:\n\n***G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ_k)***\n\nHere:\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum **k**.\n*   **ω** is the frequency or energy of the particle.\n*   **iδ_k** is an infinitesimal term in the denominator that dictates the boundary conditions for the time evolution of the particle. The sign of δ_k depends on whether the particle is being added to or removed from the system. For an occupied state (hole), it is -iδ, and for an unoccupied state (particle), it is +iδ, ensuring causality.\n\nThis functional form reveals that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane correspond directly to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. In essence, G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the particle's energy and its allowed energy eigenvalue for a given momentum state. The path integral formalism provides a method to derive this propagator by integrating over all possible paths of the non-interacting particle.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 in frequency-momentum space is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵ_k), expressed as G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ_k).>>>"
