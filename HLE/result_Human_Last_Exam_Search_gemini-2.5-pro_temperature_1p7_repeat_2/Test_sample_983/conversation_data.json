    "The next number in the sequence is 2484.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nAll numbers in this sequence are divisible by 6. However, simply listing all multiples of 6 does not reproduce the given sequence as there are gaps. A deeper analysis of the differences between consecutive terms does not reveal a simple arithmetic or geometric progression for the entire sequence.\n\nA pattern can, however, be identified by examining the differences between the last few terms of the sequence:\n*   2142 - 2130 = 12\n*   2274 - 2142 = 132\n*   2340 - 2274 = 66\n*   2352 - 2340 = 12\n\nThis reveals a repeating pattern in the differences: 12, 132, 66, 12. Assuming this pattern continues, the next difference in the sequence should be 132.\n\nTo find the next number, we add this difference to the last number in the sequence:\n2352 + 132 = 2484.\n\n<<<2484>>>"
