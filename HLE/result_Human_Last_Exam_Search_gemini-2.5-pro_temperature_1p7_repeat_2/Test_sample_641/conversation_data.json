    "I have determined the necessary steps to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will find the order of the group PSU(4, q).\nThen, I will determine the number of conjugacy classes of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q odd.\nNext, I will find the orders of the centralizers for each class of involutions.\nAfterward, I will calculate the size of each conjugacy class of involutions.\nFinally, I will sum the sizes of these classes to determine the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) and provide the definitive answer.\n\nI will now execute the first step of this plan."
