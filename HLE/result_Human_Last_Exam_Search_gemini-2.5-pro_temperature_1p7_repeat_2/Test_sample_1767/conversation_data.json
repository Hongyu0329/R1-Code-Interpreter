    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional topological insulator characterized by an integer topological invariant known as the Chern number. This number determines the number of chiral edge states, which are one-dimensional conducting channels that exist at the boundaries of the material.\n\nWhen two such insulators are brought together, the topological properties of the combined system are determined by the sum of their individual Chern numbers. This principle is demonstrated in the construction of materials with higher Chern numbers by stacking layers of Chern insulators. For instance, stacking *n* layers of a material with a Chern number of C=1 results in a system with a total Chern number of C=*n*.\n\nSimilarly, at the interface or junction between two regions with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, the number of conducting edge states that form is determined by the difference between the two Chern numbers, |C1 - C2|. In the case presented, where two insulators with C=1 are joined, the overall system can be viewed as a single, larger Chern insulator.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction of two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
