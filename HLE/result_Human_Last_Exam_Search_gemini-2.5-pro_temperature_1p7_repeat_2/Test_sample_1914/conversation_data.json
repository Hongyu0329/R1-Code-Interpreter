    "There are 23 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This information is based on the database of finite categories available at `smallcats.info`, a resource for the classification of small categories.\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects and morphisms (arrows) between them, along with a rule for composing morphisms that is associative and has identity morphisms. The classification of categories up to isomorphism involves determining all possible structures (definitions of composition) and then identifying which ones are structurally identical.\n\nFor the case of 2 objects and 4 total morphisms, there are always two identity morphisms, leaving two other non-identity morphisms to be arranged between the two objects. The different ways to assign the domains and codomains of these two morphisms, and the different ways to define their compositions, lead to a number of distinct category structures. After eliminating the ones that are isomorphic to each other, 23 unique categories remain.\n\n<<<23>>>"
