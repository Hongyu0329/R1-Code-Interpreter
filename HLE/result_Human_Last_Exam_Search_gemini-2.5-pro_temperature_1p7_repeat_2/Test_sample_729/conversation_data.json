    "A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup of the form G^k = <g^k | g ∈ G> for some integer k. To determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, Q_128, we must first understand its structure and then compute the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of its elements for all possible integers k.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, can be represented by the following presentation:\nQ_128 = <a, x | a^64 = 1, x^2 = a^32, xax^-1 = a^-1>\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are of two types: those within the cyclic subgroup generated by 'a', which are of the form a^i, and those outside this subgroup, of the form a^i*x, for i = 0, 1, ..., 63.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group G. We will analyze the generators for G^k for different values of k.\n\n*   **When k is an odd integer:**\n    The k-th power of an element a^i is (a^i)^k = a^(ik). Since k is odd, the greatest common divisor of k and 64 is 1. Consequently, the set of all such powers {a^(ik) | i = 0, ..., 63} generates the entire cyclic subgroup <a>.\n    The k-th power of an element a^i*x is (a^i*x)^k. Since x^2 = a^32 (which has order 2 and is central), for odd k, this simplifies to either a^i*x or a^(i-32)*x.\n    The subgroup generated by <a> and any element of the form a^j*x is the entire group Q_128. Thus, for any odd integer k, G^k = Q_128.\n\n*   **When k is an even integer:**\n    Let k = 2^s * m, where m is an odd integer and s ≥ 1.\n    The k-th power of a^i is a^(ik). These elements generate the cyclic subgroup <a^k> = <a^(2^s*m)> = <a^(2^s)>.\n    The k-th power of a^i*x is ((a^i*x)^2)^(k/2) = (a^32)^(k/2). Since a^32 has order 2, this power is a^32 if k/2 is odd (i.e., s=1) and 1 if k/2 is even (i.e., s>1).\n\n    We can now determine the power subgroups for different values of s:\n    *   **s = 1** (e.g., k = 2, 6, 10): G^k = <a^2, a^32> = <a^2>, which is the cyclic subgroup of order 32, C_32.\n    *   **s = 2** (e.g., k = 4, 12, 20): G^k = <<a^4>, 1> = <a^4>, which is the cyclic subgroup of order 16, C_16.\n    *   **s = 3** (e.g., k = 8, 24, 40): G^k = <<a^8>, 1> = <a^8>, which is the cyclic subgroup of order 8, C_8.\n    *   **s = 4** (e.g., k = 16, 48): G^k = <<a^16>, 1> = <a^16>, which is the cyclic subgroup of order 4, C_4.\n    *   **s = 5** (e.g., k = 32, 96): G^k = <<a^32>, 1> = <a^32>, which is the cyclic subgroup of order 2, C_2.\n    *   **s ≥ 6** (e.g., k = 64, 128): G^k = <<a^64>, 1> = <1>, which is the trivial subgroup, C_1.\n\nCounting the distinct subgroups generated by these powers, we have:\n1.  Q_128 (for odd k)\n2.  C_32 (for k = 2m, m odd)\n3.  C_16 (for k = 4m, m odd)\n4.  C_8 (for k = 8m, m odd)\n5.  C_4 (for k = 16m, m odd)\n6.  C_2 (for k = 32m, m odd)\n7.  C_1 (for k = 64m)\n\nThese are all the possible power subgroups of the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
