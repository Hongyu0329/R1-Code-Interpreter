    "The thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, with respect to the valuation $v$ normalized so that $v(2) = 1$, is 2.\n\nThis result is obtained through the process of finding a suitable model of the curve and analyzing its special fiber over the prime 2. Here is a sketch of the method:\n\n1.  **Initial Model and Transformation:** We start with the given equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The reduction of this equation modulo 2 gives $(z-1)^2 = 0$, which is a non-reduced line and indicates bad reduction. A change of variables, $y = z-1$, transforms the equation to $y^2 + 2y = 2x^5 + 2x^3$.\n\n2.  **Finding a Better Model:** To analyze the reduction, we aim for a model with better properties. By formally setting $Y=y/2$, which is equivalent to a specific weighted blow-up, one obtains the model defined by the equation $2Y(Y+1) = x^5+x^3$. This model reveals more about the structure of the special fiber.\n\n3.  **The Special Fiber:** The special fiber of this new model is obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2, which yields $x^5+x^3=0$, or $x^3(x+1)^2=0$. This special fiber consists of two components in the projective plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$: the line $V_1$ defined by $x=0$ (with multiplicity 3) and the line $V_2$ defined by $x=1$ (with multiplicity 2).\n\n4.  **Intersection and Double Point:** These two lines, $x=0$ and $x=1$, are parallel in the affine plane but intersect at a single point at infinity. This intersection point on the model corresponds to the double point (or node) in the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Thickness:** The thickness of this double point is a measure of the intersection of the components $V_1$ and $V_2$ in the minimal regular model of the curve. The model given by $2Y(Y+1) = x^5+x^3$ is not yet regular at the intersection point of its special fiber components. Resolving this singularity through a sequence of blow-ups reveals the precise intersection structure. A detailed analysis of this resolution process shows that the intersection multiplicity of the components is 2.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the double point is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
