As the local median function is applied iteratively, the edges of the binary image will undergo a smoothing process. Sharp convex corners will become rounded, while sharp concave corners will be filled in. Straight edges will tend to remain stable. Small features, such as thin lines or small regions that are less than half the size of the filter's neighborhood, will be removed. The overall effect is the simplification of the shapes in the image, leading to objects with smoother boundaries, a phenomenon related to geometric curvature flow.
