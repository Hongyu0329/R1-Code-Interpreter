    "The product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**, along with the byproduct **triphenylphosphine oxide**.\n\n**Reactants:**\n\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** Also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, it is a sterically hindered aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane:** This is a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. Its structure consists of a triphenylphosphine group attached to an ethylidene chain, which is substituted with a 2-chlorophenyl group at the second carbon.\n\n**Reaction:**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. In this specific reaction, the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are replaced by a carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe aldehyde's carbon atom forms a double bond with the ylide's α-carbon (the carbon attached to the phosphorus). This results in the formation of the alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n**Product Structure:**\n\nThe resulting alkene, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene, has the following structure:\n\n```\n      H   H\n      |   |\n(CH₃)₃C-C==C-CH₂- (o-chlorophenyl)\n```\n\nThe stereochemistry of the double bond (whether it is the E or Z isomer) depends on the specific reaction conditions and the nature of the ylide. The ylide in this case is not strongly stabilized, which would typically favor the Z-isomer. However, the significant steric hindrance from the bulky tert-butyl group of pivalaldehyde could influence the stereochemical outcome. Without further information on the reaction conditions, a definitive assignment of the major stereoisomer is not possible.\n\n<<<The product is 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene."
