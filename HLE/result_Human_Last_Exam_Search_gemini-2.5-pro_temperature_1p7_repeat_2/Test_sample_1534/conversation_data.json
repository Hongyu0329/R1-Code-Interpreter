    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nRecent advancements in neuroanatomical studies, including the creation of a detailed 3D brain atlas for the dwarf cuttlefish, have clarified the organization of its complex brain structure. The brain is broadly divided into the supraesophageal and subesophageal masses, with the palliovisceral lobe being a key component of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n\nDetailed atlases and comparative studies with the closely related *Sepia officinalis* reveal that the palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger cluster of lobes known as the palliovisceral lobe complex. This complex, located in the posterior-most region of the main brain mass, is responsible for controlling locomotion, such as escape jets and fin movements, as well as the chromatophores on the mantle.\n\nThe lobes within this complex that are situated immediately posterior to the main palliovisceral lobe are the paired fin lobes, which control the muscles of the fins, and the posterior chromatophore lobes. The posterior chromatophore lobes contain the motor neurons that control the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and back of the head, playing a crucial role in the cuttlefish's remarkable ability to camouflage. The entire posterior subesophageal mass, including these lobes, is encased at the very back by cranial cartilage.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
