    "Unfortunately, after multiple attempts using various search queries, I am unable to retrieve the specific symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle.\n\nThe most authoritative source for this information is the website \"packomania.com\" by Eckard Specht, which maintains a comprehensive database of the best-known circle packings and their properties, including the symmetry group in Schoenflies notation. However, the search tools are unable to extract the specific data for N=1135 from the detailed tables on that website. The information is highly likely to be listed on that page, but it is not accessible through the search snippets.\n\nTherefore, I cannot provide the specific Schoenflies notation for the symmetry group in question.\n\n<<<We are unable to provide an answer to your request.>>>"
