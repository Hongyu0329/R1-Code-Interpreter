    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a ligand substitution reaction occurs. The bidentate ligand L replaces the two monodentate chloride (Cl⁻) ligands.\n\nThe starting ruthenium complex is an octahedral species. The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is a symmetric, bidentate ligand, similar to 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy).\n\nThe resulting product is the complex ion `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`. This is an octahedral metal complex with three bidentate ligands. A complex of the general formula `[M(AA)2(BB)]`, where M is a metal and AA and BB are two different symmetric bidentate ligands, is chiral. This means the molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable.\n\nThese non-superimposable mirror images are a pair of isomers known as enantiomers. In coordination chemistry, these are often designated by the stereochemical descriptors Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda).\n\nTherefore, the reaction forms a pair of enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
