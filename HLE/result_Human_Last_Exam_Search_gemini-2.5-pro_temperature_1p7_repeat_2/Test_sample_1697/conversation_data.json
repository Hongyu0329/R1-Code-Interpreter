    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench. Here's a breakdown of the steps to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**\n    *   **Reactants:** The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two potential directing groups for metalation on the benzene ring: the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n    *   **Reagents:** *sec*-Butyllithium (*sec*-BuLi) is a very strong base, and its reactivity is enhanced by tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). THF is the solvent. TMEDA chelates the lithium ion, breaking up the butyllithium aggregates and increasing its basicity, which facilitates the deprotonation of the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Mechanism:** In a DoM reaction, the strong base deprotonates the aromatic ring at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing metalation group (DMG). The DMG coordinates to the lithium ion, bringing the base close to a nearby proton. Amide groups are powerful directing groups. In this case, the *N,N*-diethylcarboxamide group is a stronger directing group than the dimethylamino group.\n    *   The *N,N*-diethylcarboxamide group at position 1 will direct the *sec*-BuLi to deprotonate one of the adjacent protons at the ortho positions (C2 or C6). The proton at C2 is the most acidic because it is positioned *ortho* to both the powerful -CONEt₂ directing group and the -NMe₂ group at C3. Therefore, lithiation occurs specifically at the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n    *   **Reactant:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added to the reaction mixture.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in an S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction, displacing the iodide ion. This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond at the C2 position.\n\n**Final Product:**\n\nThe sequence of regioselective lithiation at the C2 position followed by methylation with methyl iodide yields **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
