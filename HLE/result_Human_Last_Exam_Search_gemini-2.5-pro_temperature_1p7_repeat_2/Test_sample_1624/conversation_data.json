    "I have gathered some initial information about connected metric spaces. A key takeaway is that a connected metric space with more than one point must be uncountable and, more specifically, has at least the cardinality of the continuum. The property of being connected is topological, meaning it's preserved under homeomorphisms. I've also refreshed my understanding of dense open subsets.\n\nThe next steps in my plan are crucial for directly addressing the user's question. I need to understand how the existence of a dense open subset, where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R, interacts with the connectedness of the whole space X to determine its cardinality. I will need to search for information on how the cardinality of a dense subset relates to the cardinality of the whole space, and how the local homeomorphism to R constrains the cardinality of the dense subset U. This will allow me to synthesize the information and determine if an upper bound on the cardinality of X exists.I have gathered significant information. The key findings are:\n\n1.  A connected metric space with more than one point has a cardinality of at least the continuum, c (2^ℵ₀).\n2.  A separable metric space (one with a countable dense subset) has a cardinality of at most the continuum.\n3.  The dense open subset U, where every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R, is a 1-manifold. This means U is separable, as it is second-countable.\n4.  If a topological space has a dense subset that is separable, the space itself is separable. Since U is a dense and separable subset of X, X must also be separable.\n5.  Therefore, X is a separable metric space. As a result, its cardinality is at most the continuum.\n6.  Since X is a connected metric space (and not a single point, as U is non-empty and open), its cardinality is at least the continuum.\n\nCombining these points, the cardinality of X is exactly the continuum. There is indeed an upper bound, and a very specific one. I am now ready to construct the final answer.\n\nAn upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ exists, and it is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n1.  **Properties of the dense open subset U**:\n    The set $U$ is a dense open subset of $X$. The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-manifold. A key property of any manifold is that it is second-countable, which means it has a countable basis for its topology.\n\n2.  **Separability of U and X**:\n    A topological space with a countable basis is separable, meaning it contains a countable dense subset. Therefore, $U$ is a separable space. Since $U$ is a dense subset of $X$, and separability is a property that extends from a dense subset to the entire space in metric spaces, $X$ is also a separable space. This means $X$ contains a countable dense subset.\n\n3.  **Upper bound on the cardinality of X**:\n    A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most the continuum, $c$. This can be shown by considering a countable dense subset $D$ of $X$. Every point in $X$ is the limit of a sequence of points in $D$. Since there are $c$ such sequences, the cardinality of $X$ cannot exceed $c$.\n\n4.  **Lower bound on the cardinality of X**:\n    The space $X$ is a connected metric space. If $X$ consists of more than one point, it must be uncountable. In fact, a connected metric space with at least two points has a cardinality of at least the continuum, $c$. This can be demonstrated by choosing two distinct points $a, b \\in X$ and considering the continuous function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = d(a, x)$, where $d$ is the metric on $X$. The image $f(X)$ is a connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, which means it must be an interval. Since $0 = f(a) \\in f(X)$ and $d(a, b) > 0$ is in $f(X)$, the interval $f(X)$ is non-trivial and thus has cardinality $c$. As the image of $X$ under $f$ has cardinality $c$, the cardinality of $X$ must be at least $c$. The existence of the non-empty open set $U$ ensures that $X$ is not a single point.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    From points 3 and 4, we have that the cardinality of $X$ is both at most $c$ and at least $c$. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ is exactly $c$.\n\nThus, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$, which is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
