    "The smallest number of edges, denoted by $e$, for which a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ exists, can be determined by constructing such a graph with the minimum possible number of vertices and edges.\n\nA group of order 3 is the cyclic group $C_3$. For a graph to have this automorphism group, it must possess a 3-fold rotational symmetry but lack any reflectional symmetry. This means the graph must be \"chiral\".\n\nMany simple, highly symmetric graphs, like the triangle ($C_3$), have an automorphism group of order 6 ($D_3$), which includes three rotations and three reflections. To eliminate the reflections while preserving the rotations, one must introduce an asymmetric feature that is replicated symmetrically.\n\nThe smallest known graph with this property was presented by Harary and Palmer in 1966. The construction is as follows:\n*   **Vertices:** The graph has 9 vertices, which can be grouped into three sets of three: $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$, and $\\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$.\n*   **Edges:** The graph is constructed with 9 edges to have $C_3$ symmetry.\n    *   First, form three \"arms\" or paths of length 2. These are the edges $\\{v_1, u_1\\}, \\{u_1, w_1\\}$; $\\{v_2, u_2\\}, \\{u_2, w_2\\}$; and $\\{v_3, u_3\\}, \\{u_3, w_3\\}$. This accounts for 6 edges.\n    *   To make the graph connected and break the reflectional symmetry, \"twisted\" edges are added. These connect the end of one arm to the middle of the next arm. Specifically, the edges are $\\{w_1, u_2\\}$, $\\{w_2, u_3\\}$, and $\\{w_3, u_1\\}$. This adds 3 more edges.\n\nThe resulting graph is connected and has 9 vertices and a total of $6 + 3 = 9$ edges.\n\nThe 3-fold rotational symmetry that maps vertex subscript $i$ to $i+1$ (modulo 3) is an automorphism by construction. However, any potential reflectional symmetry is broken. For instance, a reflection that fixes the first arm (`v1-u1-w1`) and swaps the other two would require the edge $\\{w_1, u_3\\}$ to exist if $\\{w_1, u_2\\}$ exists, but it does not.\n\nThis 9-vertex, 9-edge graph is the smallest connected graph with an automorphism group of order 3. Therefore, the smallest number of edges required is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
