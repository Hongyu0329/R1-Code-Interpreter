    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon compound with molecular formula C7H14, a detailed analysis of its ¹³C NMR spectrum is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Provided Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of one, suggesting the presence of either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows six signals, which indicates that two of the seven carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent.\n    *   **145(s)**: The chemical shift in the 120-150 ppm range is characteristic of a carbon in a C=C double bond. The multiplicity '(s)' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom not bonded to any hydrogen atoms).\n    *   **112(t)**: This signal is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity '(t)' for triplet indicates a CH2 group. The combination of a quaternary and a CH2 carbon in the alkene region strongly points to a terminal alkene group of the form `>C=CH2`.\n    *   **48(t)**: This signal in the aliphatic region corresponds to a CH2 group (triplet). Its downfield shift suggests it is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, such as the C=C double bond.\n    *   **27(d)**: This aliphatic signal corresponds to a CH group (doublet).\n    *   **22(q)** and **21(q)**: These two signals in the aliphatic region are both quartets, indicating two distinct types of CH3 groups. The hint about signal overlapping and the need to account for all seven carbons suggests that one of these signals represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n\n### Structural Elucidation:\n\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce the following fragments:\n*   A terminal alkene group: `>C=CH2`\n*   A methylene group: `-CH2-`\n*   A methine group: `-CH-`\n*   Three methyl groups (`-CH3`), two of which are chemically equivalent.\n\nThe methine group (`-CH-`) and the two equivalent methyl groups strongly suggest the presence of an isopropyl group, `–CH(CH3)2`. For the two methyls of the isopropyl group to be equivalent, the carbon atom to which it is attached (C3 in this case) must be prochiral, not a true chiral center.\n\nThe remaining fragments are the `>C=CH2` group, the `-CH2-` group, and the third non-equivalent `-CH3` group. These can be combined to form an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`).\n\nAssembling the three main fragments, the isopropyl group `–CH(CH3)2` and the ethyl group `–CH2CH3` must both be attached to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH2` group. This yields the following structure:\n\n          CH₂CH₃\n          |\n    CH₂ = C — CH(CH₃)₂\n\n### IUPAC Nomenclature:\n\nTo name this structure according to IUPAC rules, we must identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n1.  If the chain goes through the ethyl group, it is a 4-carbon chain (but-1-ene) with an isopropyl substituent at position 2. This would be named 2-isopropylbut-1-ene.\n2.  If the chain goes through the isopropyl group, it is also a 4-carbon chain (but-1-ene) with an ethyl substituent at position 2 and a methyl substituent at position 3.\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, when there is a tie in the length of the parent chain, the chain with the greater number of substituents is chosen. Path 2 yields two substituents (ethyl and methyl), whereas Path 1 yields only one (isopropyl). Therefore, Path 2 is preferred.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for the compound is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\nFinal verification of the structure with the NMR data confirms the assignments:\n*   `=C<` (quaternary): 145(s)\n*   `=CH2`: 112(t)\n*   `-CH2-` (of the ethyl group): 48(t)\n*   `-CH<` (of the isopropyl group): 27(d)\n*   `-CH3` (of the isopropyl group, two equivalent): one of the quartet signals (21 or 22 ppm).\n*   `-CH3` (of the ethyl group): the other quartet signal.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
