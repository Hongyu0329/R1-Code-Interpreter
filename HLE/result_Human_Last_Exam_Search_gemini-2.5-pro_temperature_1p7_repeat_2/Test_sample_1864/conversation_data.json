    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, a comprehensive set of controls is crucial for accurate and reproducible results. Based on established best practices, you should prepare up to 14 essential control samples.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n**I. Instrument and Staining Quality Controls (8 tubes):**\n\n*   **1. Unstained Control:** This sample contains only your cells without any fluorescent dyes or antibodies. It is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells and for setting the initial voltage for your detectors.\n*   **2. Viability Control (1 Tube for Compensation):** For any cell sorting experiment, a viability dye is non-negotiable to ensure you are sorting live, healthy cells and to exclude dead cells, which can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence. This requires a single-stained sample with only the viability dye to be used for compensation calculations. The addition of a viability dye effectively makes this a six-color panel.\n*   **3. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 Tubes):** These controls are essential to correct for spectral overlap, where the signal from one fluorochrome \"spills\" into the detector for another. You need one single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel:\n    *   AF350-positive cells\n    *   GFP-positive cells (with no other stains)\n    *   PE-positive cells\n    *   AF647-positive cells\n    *   AF750-positive cells\n*   **4. Streptavidin Non-specific Binding Control (1 Tube):** If you are using a biotinylated primary antibody followed by a fluorescently-labeled streptavidin (e.g., Streptavidin-PE), you must include a control of cells stained *only* with the fluorescent streptavidin conjugate. This control assesses any background signal coming from the streptavidin reagent binding non-specifically to your cells.\n\n**II. Gating Controls (6 tubes):**\n\n*   **5. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (6 Tubes):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for populations that are dim or not well-separated. An FMO control sample is stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. This reveals the spread of fluorescence from the other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing you to set a precise gate that separates true positive from negative signals. For a six-color panel (including the viability dye), you would prepare six FMO controls:\n    *   FMO-Viability Dye (all stains except the viability dye)\n    *   FMO-AF350 (all stains except AF350)\n    *   FMO-GFP (Non-GFP expressing cells stained with all other fluorochromes to define the GFP gate)\n    *   FMO-PE (all stains except PE)\n    *   FMO-AF647 (all stains except AF647)\n    *   FMO-AF750 (all stains except AF750)\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential controls is the sum of these individual samples:\n1 (Unstained) + 1 (Viability Comp) + 5 (Color Comps) + 1 (Streptavidin) + 6 (FMOs) = **14 controls**.\n\nWhile this number may seem high, preparing these controls is a critical investment to ensure the purity and viability of your sorted cells and the reliability of your experimental data. Some FMO controls may be omitted in subsequent experiments once the panel is well-established, but they are essential when first setting up the experiment.\n\n<<<14>>>"
