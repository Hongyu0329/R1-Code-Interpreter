    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The firing strength is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the membership degree of the consequent is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a type of binary operation that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. While there are several types of t-norms, the problem does not specify which one to use. Common t-norms include the minimum t-norm, the product t-norm, and the Łukasiewicz t-norm.\n\nIf the specific t-norm is not stated, the **minimum t-norm** is often used by default. Using this t-norm, the rule activation level is calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Rule Activation Level** = `min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n*   **Rule Activation Level** = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Rule Activation Level** = `0.7`\n\nFor completeness, using other common t-norms would result in:\n\n*   **Product t-norm**: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n*   **Łukasiewicz t-norm**: `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nAssuming the common practice of using the minimum t-norm for rule activation in the absence of other specifications, the activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
