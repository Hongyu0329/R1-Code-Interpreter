    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are utilized. This is determined by calculating the number of functions for each atom and summing them.\n\n**Breakdown by Atom:**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   The core 1s orbital is represented by one contracted function.\n    *   The valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p orbitals) are each split into two, creating 2 functions per orbital (2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz). This results in 8 valence functions (4 orbitals x 2 functions/orbital).\n    *   Total per Carbon: 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 6-31G basis set uses 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   The 1s valence orbital is split into two contracted functions.\n\n**Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n\n*   **Carbon atoms:** There are 7 carbon atoms in toluene.\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom = 63 functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** There are 8 hydrogen atoms in toluene.\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
