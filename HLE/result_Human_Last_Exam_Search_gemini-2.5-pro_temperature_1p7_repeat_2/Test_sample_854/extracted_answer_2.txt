The laboratory made a mistake because their Quality Control (QC) procedure was fundamentally flawed and misinterpreted. They tested a selective medium, which was supposed to inhibit bacteria, with a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*). The growth of the bacterium on the control plate was the expected result for a failed batch with an inactive antibiotic, but the lab personnel incorrectly interpreted this growth as a successful QC check, believing it showed the agar could support growth. This misinterpretation was compounded by the improper preparation of Batch 3, where the heat-sensitive antibiotic chloramphenicol was destroyed by being added before autoclaving.
