The ideal Ni/Ce ratio depends on the specific catalytic reaction; for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an optimal range is often found around 2.5-7% molar Ni, while for water splitting, a higher Ni content, such as a 3:1 Ni/Ce ratio (Ni<sub>75</sub>Ce<sub>25</sub>O<sub>x</sub>) or a Ce/Ni ratio of 2, has shown to be more effective.
