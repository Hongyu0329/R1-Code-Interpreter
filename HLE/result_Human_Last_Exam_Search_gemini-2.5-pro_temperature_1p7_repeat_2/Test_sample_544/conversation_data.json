    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of Pummerer rearrangement. In this reaction, the sulfoxide is first activated by the strong electrophile, triflic anhydride. This activation facilitates the formation of a highly reactive thionium ion intermediate.\n\nThe trimethylsilyl cyanide then acts as a nucleophile source, providing a cyanide ion (CN⁻) that attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion. The final product of this sequence is an α-cyano sulfide.\n\nThe resulting chemical structure is C₆H₅SCH₂CN. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this compound is named by identifying the principal functional group, which is the nitrile (-CN). The parent alkane is therefore acetonitrile. The C₆H₅S- group attached to the second carbon atom is named as a \"phenylthio\" substituent.\n\n<<<2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile>>>"
