    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, one must integrate the probability density function over that interval. The probability density is the square of the normalized wave function.\n\n### 1. The Wave Function\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length `a` is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nHere, `n` is the quantum number. For this problem, `n = 2`. Thus, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\n### 2. The Probability Density Function\n\nThe probability density, |ψ(x)|², represents the likelihood of finding the particle at a specific position `x`.\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n### 3. Setting Up the Integral\n\nThe probability `P` of finding the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a` is the integral of the probability density over this range:\nP = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo simplify the integration, the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2 is used. In this context, θ = 2πx/a.\nP = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]/2 dx\nP = (1/a) ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) [1 - cos(4πx/a)] dx\n\n### 4. Solving the Integral\n\nIntegrating the expression yields:\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nSubstituting the limits of integration:\nP = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }\nP = (1/a) * { 0.01a - (a/4π)[sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)] }\n\nSimplifying the sine terms:\nsin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSo the expression becomes:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)[sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nFor the state n=2, the wave function has a node at the center of the box (x = a/2), meaning the probability of finding the particle at this exact point is zero. The interval is centered around this node. Since the interval is very small, we can use the small-angle approximation for the sine function, sin(θ) ≈ θ - θ³/6.\nLet θ = 0.02π.\n\nP ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π)[(0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6]\nP ≈ 0.01 - 0.01 + (1/2π) * (0.02π)³/6\nP ≈ (1/12π) * (0.000008π³)\nP ≈ (8 x 10⁻⁶ * π²)/12\nP ≈ (2/3) * π² * 10⁻⁶\n\nUsing the value of π² ≈ 9.8696:\nP ≈ (2/3) * 9.8696 * 10⁻⁶\nP ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
