    "This puzzle is based on the book *The GCHQ Puzzle Book*. The sequence of numbers corresponds to London bus routes that must be taken in order to solve a particular puzzle in the book. The puzzle involves traversing London and collecting clues from each bus route.\n\nThe key to solving the sequence is to understand that the numbers represent a journey. Each number is a bus route, and the sequence implies a continuous trip where the end of one leg of the journey is near the start of the next. The repeated numbers indicate return journeys on the same bus route.\n\nLet's break down a part of the sequence to illustrate the logic:\n*   The journey starts with **Bus 111**.\n*   Then, the traveler takes **Bus 142**. The connection here is not immediately obvious from a direct tube or bus link between the end of the 111 route (Kingston or Heathrow) and the start of the 142 route (Watford Junction or Brent Cross). This suggests that other means of transport (like the Tube) are used to get from the end of one bus route to the beginning of the next.\n*   The sequence continues with a return journey on **Bus 111**.\n\nWithout the context of the book and the specific locations the puzzle intends for the traveler to visit on each route, deciphering the entire logic behind every bus change and the reason for each specific route is challenging. The puzzle is designed to be solved by following the instructions in *The GCHQ Puzzle Book*.\n\nTherefore, to find the next number in the sequence, one would need to be following the puzzle in the book. The sequence is not a mathematical or logical one in a traditional sense, but rather a set of instructions for a real-world (or map-based) treasure hunt. The final number in the given sequence is 124, which runs between Catford and Eltham. To know the *next* bus to take, one would have to identify the clue at the end of the route 124 journey as described in the puzzle book.\n\nSince the solution is external to the provided sequence and requires a specific book, it is not possible to determine the next number just from the sequence itself.\n\n<<<The next number in the sequence cannot be determined without referring to \"The GCHQ Puzzle Book\", as the sequence represents a journey with clues at each stop.>>>"
