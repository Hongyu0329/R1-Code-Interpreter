    "To compute the determinant of the given adjacency matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe can use the formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values from matrix A:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1)((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1)((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 6 = 0\n\\]\nAlternatively, we can observe that the sum of the entries in each row is zero:\n*   Row 1: 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 2: -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\n*   Row 3: -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\n\nIf the sum of the entries in each row of a square matrix is zero, the matrix is singular, and its determinant is 0. This is because the vector `[1, 1, 1]` is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0, and a matrix having 0 as an eigenvalue guarantees its determinant is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
