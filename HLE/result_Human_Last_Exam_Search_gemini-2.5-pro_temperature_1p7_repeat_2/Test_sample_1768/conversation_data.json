    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by a ribosome during translation and does not contain any stop codons. To identify the correct reading frame for the provided sequence, it must be translated in all three possible frames. The correct frame is the one that contains no stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).
