    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of K-vector spaces is $n$-resolvable where **$n$ is the cardinality of the finite poset $I$ that discretises the functor $f$**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the concepts that lead to this answer:\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called tame if its behavior is entirely determined by its values on a finite sub-poset $I \\subset J$. More formally, $f$ is the left Kan extension of a functor from a finite poset $I$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$. This finite poset $I$ is called the discretisation of the functor.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattices and Homological Algebra:** When the domain $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors, denoted `tame(J, Vect_K)`, is an abelian category. This is a crucial property because it means that standard tools of homological algebra, such as kernels, images, and resolutions, can be applied to these functors.\n\n*   **n-Resolvable:** In this context, a functor being \"n-resolvable\" means it has a minimal free resolution of length $n$. A resolution is a sequence of \"free\" or \"projective\" objects that represents the original object. The length of the shortest such sequence is the object's projective dimension.\n\n*   **Length of the Resolution:** For a tame functor indexed by an upper semilattice, a minimal free resolution always exists. The construction of this resolution, often accomplished using a tool called the Koszul complex, shows that its length (the projective dimension) is bounded by the size of the finite poset $I$ used to discretise the functor.\n\nTherefore, for any given tame functor $f$, the value of $n$ for which it is $n$-resolvable depends on the specific finite poset $I$ that defines it. The functor is resolvable by a free resolution of length at most $|I|$, the number of elements in the discretising poset.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the finite poset $I$ that provides the discretisation of the functor $f$.>>>"
