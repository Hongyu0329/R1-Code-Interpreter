    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 5. This is the smallest grid size (n x n) on which a trefoil knot can be represented. The grid number is the same for a knot and its mirror image, so both the left-hand and right-hand trefoil knots have a minimal grid number of 5.\n\nResearch indicates that for grid number 5, there are a total of 10 distinct grid diagrams that represent the trefoil knot. These 10 diagrams are split between the two chiralities (left-handed and right-handed). One source includes a figure showing all 5 minimal grid diagrams for the *right-hand* trefoil knot. This implies that the other 5 diagrams must represent the left-hand trefoil.\n\nThese 5 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are distinct from each other under the operations of translation and rotation. Therefore, there are 5 such grid diagrams.\n\n<<<E>>>"
