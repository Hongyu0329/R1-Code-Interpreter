    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth is Kris Kelvin. While on the space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris, Kris attaches strips of paper to the air vents to replicate the sound, a poignant reflection of his longing for his home planet. This act highlights the film's theme of nostalgia and the deep-seated human connection to Earth.\n\nThe film explores the psychological turmoil of its characters as they are confronted by physical manifestations of their memories, a phenomenon caused by the sentient ocean of Solaris. Kris, a psychologist sent to evaluate the remaining crew, finds himself haunted by a replica of his deceased wife, Hari. Amidst the sterile and alien environment of the space station, Kris's subtle act of recreating the sound of rustling leaves underscores his longing for the natural world he has left behind. An art installation was even based on this scene, where the characters attempt to create a sound environment that mimics the life on Earth they miss.\n\n<<<A>>>"
