    "After a gene duplication event, the new duplicate gene has several possible fates. The most common is pseudogenization, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. Therefore, pseudogenization leads to the loss of a functional gene, not its retention and divergence.\n\nGene conversion is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences, which tends to homogenize the two gene copies. This counteracts divergence and, while it can contribute to retaining duplicates by removing mutations, it does not explain their functional divergence.\n\nAdaptive radiation is a large-scale evolutionary event where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill various ecological niches. Gene duplication is considered a significant factor that can fuel adaptive radiation by providing the genetic raw material for new traits, but it is not itself the mechanism of retention and divergence at the level of individual genes.\n\nThis leaves two primary mechanisms that explain how duplicate genes are retained and diverge in function:\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization**: This occurs when one gene copy acquires a new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy retains the original ancestral function. This is an adaptive process driven by positive selection for the new function, ensuring both copies are preserved.\n*   **Subfunctionalization**: This process involves the partitioning of the ancestral gene's functions or expression patterns between the two duplicate copies. Each copy loses some aspect of the original function through degenerative mutations, making both copies necessary to fully perform the ancestral role. This is often considered a neutral process and a common pathway for preserving duplicate genes.\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are critical and widely accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. They represent the primary pathways by which both copies of a gene are maintained in the genome following duplication, as they diverge to perform either new or complementary roles. Some evolutionary models even propose that subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state, preserving a gene from being lost, which may then later allow for neofunctionalization to occur. Considering the options provided, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are directly responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, different studies suggest the prevalence of one over the other can vary depending on the organism and other factors. Both are considered major and highly likely mechanisms.\n\nSince the provided answer choices contain both \"Neofunctionalization\" and \"Subfunctionalization\" as distinct options, and the question asks for the *most likely* mechanism, we must evaluate them comparatively. Subfunctionalization, as described by the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a powerful explanation for the retention of duplicates through neutral processes (accumulation of degenerative mutations), which are generally more frequent than the specific beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization. This often makes subfunctionalization a highly probable, and perhaps more common, initial route for the preservation of duplicated genes.\n\nConsidering all options, both C and D are the only correct mechanisms that describe both retention and divergence. Between the two, subfunctionalization is frequently cited as a widespread mechanism that facilitates the preservation of a large number of duplicate genes.\n\nGiven that both are key mechanisms, and without further context to favor one, both are strong answers. However, if forced to choose the most encompassing or generally applicable mechanism for initial retention that leads to divergence, one could argue for either. In the context of a multiple-choice question, both are often presented as the two primary fates beyond loss.\n\nLet's reconsider. The question asks for the most likely mechanism. Both C and D are the key contenders. They are not mutually exclusive and can occur in sequence. The choice depends on which is considered more frequent. For the purpose of providing a single best answer based on common models, subfunctionalization is often highlighted as a pervasive and powerful force for duplicate gene retention because it relies on more probable neutral mutations.\n\n<<<D>>>"
