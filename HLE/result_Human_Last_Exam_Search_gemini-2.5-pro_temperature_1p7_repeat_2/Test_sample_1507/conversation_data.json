    "The user is asking for the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation of the outer hull of the great icosahedron.\n\nBased on the search results, I can answer this question.\n\n1.  **What is the great icosahedron?** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. It has 20 intersecting equilateral triangle faces.\n\n2.  **What is its convex hull?** The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n\n3.  **What are the faces of the convex hull (the regular icosahedron)?** The faces of a regular icosahedron are 20 equilateral triangles.\n\n4.  **What is the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this surface?** Since the surface of the convex hull (the regular icosahedron) is already composed of 20 triangles, the minimal triangulation is the surface itself. Therefore, 20 triangles are needed. No further division of the faces is necessary as they are already triangles.\n\nThe question asks for the number of *visible* triangles from the outside. The outer hull (convex hull) is by definition the visible surface from the outside. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron, which has 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the number of visible triangles is 20.The minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces of its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. Since the faces are already triangles, no further subdivision is needed. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
