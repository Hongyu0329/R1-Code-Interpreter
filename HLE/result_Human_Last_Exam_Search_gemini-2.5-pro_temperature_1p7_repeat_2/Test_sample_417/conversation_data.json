    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a thorough analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\nThe molecule possesses a C3 rotational symmetry axis passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry ensures that the three large substituent arms are chemically equivalent. Consequently, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals in one arm and in the central core, and then sum them. Protons that are chemically equivalent due to symmetry or rapid conformational changes will produce a single signal.\n\n**Analysis of the Central Core:**\nThe central core is a 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n1.  **Ring Methyl Groups**: The three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. This will result in a single signal.\n2.  **Methylene Bridge Protons (-CH2-)**: There are three methylene groups that link the benzene ring to the chiral indazole substituents. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three -CH2- groups are equivalent. However, each methylene group is attached to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived substituent). This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are non-equivalent and will give rise to two distinct signals, typically appearing as a pair of doublets (an AB quartet). Thus, these three equivalent bridges will produce two signals in total.\n\n**Analysis of one Substituent Arm:**\nThe substituent arm, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`, is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from (+)-camphor. This rigidity and chirality lead to non-equivalence for many of its protons.\n1.  **Pyrazole Proton**: There is a single proton on the pyrazole ring system (at position C3 of the indazole). This gives **one signal**.\n2.  **Camphor Skeleton Protons**:\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton**: The proton at the C4 bridgehead is in a unique environment, giving **one signal**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C5)**: The two protons on the C5 carbon are diastereotopic (endo and exo) and are therefore chemically non-equivalent. This results in **two signals**.\n    *   **Methylene Protons (C6)**: Similarly, the two protons on the C6 carbon are also diastereotopic, giving another **two signals**.\n3.  **Methyl Group Protons**:\n    *   **Bridgehead Methyl (C7)**: The methyl group on the C7 bridgehead has a unique chemical environment and produces **one signal**.\n    *   **Gem-Dimethyl Protons (C8)**: The two methyl groups attached to the C8 position are diastereotopic because of the molecule's overall chirality. They are non-equivalent and will show **two separate signals**.\n\n**Summary of Signals:**\n\n*   **From the Central Core:**\n    *   Ring -CH3 groups: 1 signal\n    *   Bridge -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n*   **From one Substituent Arm:**\n    *   Pyrazole CH: 1 signal\n    *   Bridgehead CH: 1 signal\n    *   C5 -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n    *   C6 -CH2- protons: 2 signals\n    *   C7 -CH3 group: 1 signal\n    *   C8 gem-dimethyl groups: 2 signals\n    *   **Total from arm**: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9 signals\n\nAdding the signals from the core and one arm gives the total number of expected peaks:\nTotal Peaks = (1 + 2) [from core] + 9 [from arm] = 12 peaks.\n\nTherefore, 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
