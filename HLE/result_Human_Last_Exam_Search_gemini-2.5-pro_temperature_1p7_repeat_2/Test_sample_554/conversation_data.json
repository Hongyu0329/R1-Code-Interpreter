    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule, as the term \"perfluoro\" indicates the replacement of all C-H bonds with C-F bonds. The exact number depends on the specific structure of the nanocar.\n\nSeveral distinct nanocar structures have been synthesized. For instance, one nanocar with a flexible chassis has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. In a perfluorinated version of this molecule, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with fluorine atoms. Therefore, this perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nAnother example is a nanocar with the chemical formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O. If this molecule were to be perfluorinated, it would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nA further example is the \"Nanotruck,\" a related molecular machine, which has the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄. A perfluorinated version of this \"nanotruck\" would have 18 fluorine atoms.\n\nSince the question is hypothetical and refers to \"a\" perfluoronanocar, we can consider the specific and well-defined example of the nanocar with a flexible chassis.\n\n<<<34>>>"
