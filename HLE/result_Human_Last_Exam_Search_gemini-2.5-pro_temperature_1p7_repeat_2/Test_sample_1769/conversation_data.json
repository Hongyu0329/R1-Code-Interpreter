    "Had the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be \"suster\" or \"swester\".\n\nThe Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor* or *swuster*. These forms are derived from the Proto-Germanic **swestēr*, which in turn comes from the Proto-Indo-European **swésōr*. The current Modern English word, \"sister,\" shows the influence of the Old Norse equivalent, *systir*. This Norse influence is responsible for the 'i' vowel in the first syllable of the modern word.\n\nWithout this Scandinavian influence, the Old English *sweostor* would have followed a more native phonological development. In Middle English, forms like *suster* were common, developing from the Old English *swuster* variant. This path aligns with the evolution of the word in other West Germanic languages that did not experience the same level of Norse contact. For instance, the Dutch word is *zuster*, and the German word is *Schwester*.\n\nFollowing the developmental trajectory of similar Old English words, *sweostor* would likely have evolved into \"suster\" or possibly \"swester\" in Modern English. The \"eo\" vowel sound in Old English typically evolved into different sounds in Modern English, with \"u\" being a common outcome, as seen in the persistence of \"suster\" into Middle English. Therefore, \"suster\" stands as the most probable modern form in an alternate linguistic timeline devoid of Norse influence.\n\n<<<suster or swester>>>"
