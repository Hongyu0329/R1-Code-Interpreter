The optimal configuration is to use **Spreading Factor 7 (SF7)** and the **lowest possible transmission power (starting from 2 dBm)** that achieves a Packet Error Rate (PER) not exceeding 1%. The exact power level will be determined by the ADR algorithm based on the measured path loss and the required link margin to overcome the Rician fading.
