    "The search for an island town meeting the precise criteria of being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, situated on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name, has proven to be complex. Initial investigations into the world's most remote inhabited islands, such as Tristan da Cunha, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island, did not yield a conclusive match.\n\nWhile these islands are of volcanic origin and extremely isolated, their main settlements—Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, Adamstown, and Hanga Roa, respectively—do not sit on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that explicitly shares the settlement's name. For instance, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas on Tristan da Cunha lies on a coastal plain at the base of a volcano, not within a named caldera bay. Adamstown on Pitcairn is near Bounty Bay, but not on a bay of the same name that is also a caldera. Hanga Roa on Easter Island is on a bay, but the bay itself is not a caldera.\n\nThe island of Santorini in Greece is a well-known inhabited caldera, with its villages clinging to the caldera rim. However, it does not meet the remoteness criterion as it is part of the Cyclades island group and approximately 200 kilometers from mainland Greece.\n\nDeception Island in Antarctica is a flooded volcanic caldera known as Port Foster, with an inner cove named Whalers Bay where a whaling station once operated and research stations are now seasonally inhabited. However, there is no permanent town, and the names of the bay, the caldera, and any settlement do not align.\n\nOther locations with settlements inside calderas, such as on the islands of Fogo in Cape Verde, the Azores, and the Gambier Islands, have been considered. However, none have been confirmed to meet both the extreme isolation and the specific naming requirements of the question.\n\nSimilarly, the harbors of Akaroa and Lyttelton on New Zealand's Banks Peninsula are indeed formed by volcanic calderas and have towns of the same name. But, as part of New Zealand's South Island, they are not remote.\n\nGiven the available information, no island town has been identified that definitively satisfies all the conditions of the query. The unique combination of extreme isolation, a town situated on a bay that is a volcanic caldera, and the sharing of the same name for the town, bay, and caldera, may not exist or is not documented in readily available sources.\n\n<<<There is no island town that verifiably meets all the specified criteria.>>>"
