    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint) that satisfy the condition $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$. This is the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$.\n\nFor such an adjunction to exist, the map $f$ must preserve all suprema (joins), and the map $g$ must preserve all infima (meets).\n\nThe objects of the simplex category, $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, are finite total orders, and as such are complete lattices.\nA map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins. For an order-preserving map between two chains, this is equivalent to preserving the bottom element (the empty join). Thus, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$. For any such map $f$, a unique right adjoint $g$ is defined by $g(j) = \\sup\\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$.\n\nDually, a map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets. For an order-preserving map between chains, this is equivalent to preserving the top element (the empty meet). Thus, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $g(n) = m$. For any such map $g$, a unique left adjoint $f$ exists.\n\nThese two characterizations are equivalent. If $f(0)=0$, its right adjoint $g$ satisfies $g(n)=m$. Conversely, if $g(n)=m$, its left adjoint $f$ satisfies $f(0)=0$.\nTherefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nFor this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. We need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ with $f(0) = 0$.\nSuch a map is defined by a sequence of integers $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to determine the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, i.e., $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$, with values taken from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This is a combination with repetition problem. We are choosing $k=23$ values from a set of $N=37+1=38$ possible values.\n\nThe number of such sequences can be calculated using the stars and bars formula:\n$\\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can establish a bijection between these non-decreasing sequences and strictly increasing sequences. Let $y_i = f(i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$. The sequence $0 \\le y_1 \\le y_2 \\le \\dots \\le y_{23} \\le 37$ can be mapped to a strictly increasing sequence $z_1, \\dots, z_{23}$ by setting $z_i = y_i + i - 1$.\nThe new sequence satisfies:\n$0 \\le z_1 < z_2 < \\dots < z_{23} \\le 37 + 23 - 1 = 59$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 distinct numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 59\\}$, which has $60$ elements. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nNow we calculate the value of the binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!}$\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60 \\times 59 \\times \\dots \\times 38}{23 \\times 22 \\times \\dots \\times 1} = 463,764,789,830$.\n\n"
