    "## The Dawn of Recorded Time in the Americas: Unearthing the Earliest Pre-Columbian Date\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **36 BCE**. This significant historical marker is inscribed on Stela 2, a stone monument discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The date is recorded in the Long Count calendar, an intricate system of timekeeping developed in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe inscription on Stela 2 corresponds to the Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13. The Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) corroborates this, identifying it as the most ancient date recorded in Mesoamerica, equivalent to December 8, 36 BCE in the Gregorian calendar. This discovery solidifies Chiapa de Corzo, a site with Olmec and later Maya influences, as a crucial location in the history of writing and timekeeping in the ancient Americas.\n\nFor many years, the distinction of the earliest recorded date was held by Tres Zapotes Stela C, an artifact from an Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico. Its inscription corresponds to the Long Count date of 7.16.6.16.18, which translates to September 3, 32 BCE. However, subsequent analysis of the Chiapa de Corzo stela established its earlier origins.\n\nWhile the Long Count calendar provides a linear and precise method of dating, other, even earlier forms of date recording existed. For instance, at San José Mogote, a Zapotec site in Oaxaca, Mexico, Monument 3 features a glyph interpreted as a day name within the 260-day sacred calendar, possibly \"1 Earthquake.\" This inscription is dated to as early as 600 BCE, but it represents a position within a recurring calendrical cycle rather than a specific year.\n\nFurthermore, in San Bartolo, Guatemala, a painted glyph representing the day \"7 Deer\" from the 260-day calendar was discovered in a sealed archaeological context. Radiocarbon dating of this artifact places it between 300 and 200 BCE.\n\nAlthough these examples from San José Mogote and San Bartolo demonstrate an earlier use of calendrical glyphs, the Long Count inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 remains the earliest known **fully recorded date** that can be precisely correlated to a specific point in history.\n\nThere had been some scholarly debate that Stela 2 from Takalik Abaj in Guatemala might predate the Chiapa de Corzo monument, with a suggested date range of 236 BCE to 19 BCE. However, more recent studies now indicate a later date for this artifact, likely after 41 CE. This leaves Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo as the current record holder for the earliest known recorded date in the Americas.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
