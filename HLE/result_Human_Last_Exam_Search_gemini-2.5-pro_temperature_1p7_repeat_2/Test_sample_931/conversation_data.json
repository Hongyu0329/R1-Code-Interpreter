    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that primarily feed on soft-bodied arthropods like aphids. They are considered beneficial insects in agricultural settings because they prey on pests.\n\nIn addition to insects, some adult snakeflies have been observed consuming pollen and nectar. Gut analysis has confirmed the presence of pollen, although it's not definitively known if it is an essential food source. There is no scientific record of them feeding on fungus or leaf tissue.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult snakeflies feed on both nectar and aphids.\n\n*   **A. Nectar:** They have been reported to feed on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they are known to eat pollen in general, the specific \"Māhoe\" type is not explicitly recorded.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence they feed on fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** There is no evidence they feed on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** They are well-documented predators of aphids.\n\nTherefore, the correct choices are A and E.\n\n<<<F>>>"
