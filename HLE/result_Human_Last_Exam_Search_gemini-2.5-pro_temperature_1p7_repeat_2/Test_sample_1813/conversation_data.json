    "I am unable to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) with the available information.\n\nHere is a summary of the findings:\n\n*   The term \"generalized Markov number\" can refer to solutions of several different Diophantine equations that are generalizations of the classical Markov equation `x² + y² + z² = 3xyz`. The notation \\( m_{p/q} \\) suggests a generalization where the numbers are indexed by rational numbers `p/q`, similar to how classical Markov numbers are.\n*   The most likely relevant generalization is the one studied by Banaian, Sen, Gyoda, Maruyama, and Sato, which corresponds to the integer solutions of the equation `x² + y² + z² + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz`. The notation in the query suggests the case where k=1, i.e., `x² + y² + z² + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz`.\n*   The computation of these numbers for a given rational `p/q` involves a complex algorithm based on the theory of cluster algebras and snake graphs on orbifolds. The process involves:\n    1.  Determining the simple continued fraction of the rational number `p/q`.\n    2.  Constructing a corresponding \"orbifold snake graph\".\n    3.  Determining a new continued fraction based on the properties of this graph.\n    4.  The generalized Markov number is the numerator of this new continued fraction.\n*   The search results do not provide a direct, explicit formula or a simplified version of this algorithm that can be executed without specialized knowledge of this advanced mathematical theory. While research papers give examples for certain rational numbers, the specific rules to generalize from these examples are not provided.\n*   A specific search for the value of \\( m_{4/7} \\) did not yield any pre-computed results or the specific continued fraction associated with it.\n\nDue to the highly specialized and complex nature of the required computation, which is at the level of current mathematical research, it is not possible to provide a definitive numerical answer.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer for the continued fraction.>>>"
