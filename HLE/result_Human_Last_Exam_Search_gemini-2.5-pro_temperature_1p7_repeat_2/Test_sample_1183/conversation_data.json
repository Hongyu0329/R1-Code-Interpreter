    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a highly symmetric, planar molecule. It is a derivative of triangulene, which consists of fused benzene rings in a triangular shape. This specific structure has three ethynyl groups (`-C#CH`) substituted on the core.\n\nThe parent triangulene molecule has a high degree of symmetry. The arrangement of the fused rings and the placement of the three ethynyl groups results in a molecule with the following key symmetry elements:\n*   A principal three-fold (C₃) rotational axis perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n*   Three two-fold (C₂) rotational axes in the plane of the molecule.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ).\n*   A center of inversion (i).\n\nA molecule possessing these symmetry elements belongs to the D₃ₕ point group. Computational studies and the inherent structure of similar non-Kekulé polynuclear aromatic compounds confirm their high symmetry. The D₃ₕ point group is characterized by a three-fold rotational axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
