    "A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane of a dynamical system that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. In systems with saddle points, the stable and unstable manifolds of these points form the separatrices.\n\n### 1. Identifying Equilibrium Points\n\nFirst, we find the equilibrium points of the system by setting both differential equations to zero:\n1.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n2.  Substituting these values into $d'(t)=0$:\n    *   If $u=0$, the equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   If $u=1$, the equation becomes $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, which is $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n### 2. Stability Analysis of Equilibrium Points\n\nTo determine the nature of these equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node**.\n*   **At (-1, 1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n*   **At (0, 0):** The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the stability is undetermined by linearization.\n\n### 3. Finding the Separatrix\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (-1, 1). A trajectory that lies on such a manifold is an invariant algebraic curve. We search for a simple algebraic curve that is a solution to the system and passes through the saddle point.\n\nLet's test the candidate curve $d = -u^2$.\nThis curve passes through the saddle point, since for $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2 = -1$.\n\nTo verify if it is a solution trajectory, we differentiate $d = -u^2$ with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u \\frac{du}{dt}$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $u'(t)$:\n$\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u((u-1)u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation of the system:\n$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u(1-u)u^2$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 - (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d'(t) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nSince both expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution to the system of differential equations. As this curve is a trajectory that passes through the saddle point (-1, 1), it constitutes a separatrix of the system. Specifically, since for $0<u<1$ the value of $u$ decreases with time, this trajectory flows from the saddle point (-1, 1) towards the origin (0, 0), making it the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThis separatrix divides the phase plane into regions with distinct dynamic behaviors, particularly influencing whether trajectories tend towards positive or negative values of $d$ as they approach the line $u=0$.\n\n<<<The equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.>>>"
