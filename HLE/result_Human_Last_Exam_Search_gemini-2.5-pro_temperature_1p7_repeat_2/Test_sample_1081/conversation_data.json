    "For a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is independent of the number of elements $q$ in the field. This number is determined by the structure of the Weyl group associated with the root system of type $E_8$.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields states that the set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori of $G$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism. For a group of type $E_8$ over a finite field, the group is of split type, which implies that the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n\nConsequently, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is precisely the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a finite group of order 696,729,600. The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is known to be 112.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
