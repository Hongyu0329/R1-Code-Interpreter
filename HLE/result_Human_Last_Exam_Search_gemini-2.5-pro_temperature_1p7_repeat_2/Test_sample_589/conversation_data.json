    "The Hollywood feature film that features a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car is the 2014 supernatural horror film *It Follows*, produced by Northern Lights Films, Animal Kingdom, and Two Flints, and distributed by RADiUS-TWC.\n\nIn the movie, the protagonist, Jay (played by Maika Monroe), is pursued by a relentless, shape-shifting supernatural entity. Pink is a recurring color associated with her character and her innocence. After the entity attacks her friend in his home, Jay flees on a bicycle. Although the film features scenes with a pink bike and cars, the specific action of her pedaling *directly toward* an oncoming vehicle is a memorable moment of suspense.\n\n<<<It Follows>>>"
