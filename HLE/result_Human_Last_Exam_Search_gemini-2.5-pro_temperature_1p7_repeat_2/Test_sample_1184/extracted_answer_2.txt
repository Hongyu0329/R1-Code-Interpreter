Here is a summary of the key residues and their functions:**

**For Interaction with the α1-subunit:**

*   **Beta Interaction Domain (BID):** Located within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain (residues 233-409).
*   **Key Residues:** A 31-amino acid stretch, mapping approximately to **residues 292-322** of the human β1-subunit (isoform 1), forms the core binding site for the α1-subunit's AID.

**For Fine-Tuning Gating Properties:**

*   **N-Terminus:** While direct evidence for CaV2.3 is still being uncovered, analogous channel studies suggest that basic residues like **Lysine 3 and Lysine 4** at the N-terminus are likely hotspots for modulating voltage-sensor stability.
*   **HOOK Domain:** **Serine 161 (S161)** has been identified as a likely phosphorylation site that, when modified, can significantly alter the voltage-dependence of channel activation and inactivation.
