    "I was unable to find any information about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence during World War II. It is possible that the name is misspelled or that this individual's story is not widely documented.\n\nHowever, research into similar topics revealed the story of **Andr√© Peulevey**, whose real name was Joseph Scheinmann. He was a German Jew who fled to France, became a prominent figure in the French Resistance, and later worked as a spy for the British. While not a Belgian refugee, his story involves espionage and collaboration with British intelligence during the same period.\n\nWithout further information or clarification on the name \"Andre Vernault,\" it is not possible to provide his true profession.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question as I could not find any information about an individual named Andre Vernault fitting the description provided.>>>"
