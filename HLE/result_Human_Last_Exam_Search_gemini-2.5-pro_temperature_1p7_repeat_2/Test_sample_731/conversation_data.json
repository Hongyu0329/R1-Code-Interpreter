    "A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, we first need to understand its structure.\n\nThe semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ of order $2^n$ is defined by the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n\nFor a size of 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$. Thus, the group in question is $SD_{512}$, and its presentation is:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe cyclic subgroups can be divided into two categories: those contained entirely within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**:\n    The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256. The number of subgroups in a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. For the order 256 ($=2^8$), the number of divisors is $8+1=9$. These subgroups are generated by powers of $r$.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$**:\n    These subgroups are generated by elements of the form $sr^k$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 255. The order of these elements depends on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n    *   **When $k$ is even**: The element $sr^k$ has an order of 2. There are 128 even values for $k$ (0, 2, ..., 254), and each generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives 128 such subgroups.\n    *   **When $k$ is odd**: The element $sr^k$ has an order of 4. There are 128 odd values for $k$ (1, 3, ..., 255). However, these elements do not all generate unique subgroups. The subgroups generated by $sr^k$ and $sr^{k+128}$ are identical. Therefore, the 128 elements of order 4 form $128 / 2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nNone of the subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^k$ are contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$ (except for the trivial identity element subgroup, which is already counted in the first category). Therefore, we can sum the counts from all categories to get the total number of power subgroups.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups from $\\langle r \\rangle$) + (Subgroups from $sr^k$ with $k$ even) + (Subgroups from $sr^k$ with $k$ odd)\nTotal = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nA known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups, $c(G)$, in a semidihedral group $G = SD_{2^n}$ is $c(SD_{2^n}) = n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$. For $n=9$, this confirms the result:\n$c(SD_{512}) = 9 + 2^{9-2} + 2^{9-3} = 9 + 2^7 + 2^6 = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\n<<<201>>>"
