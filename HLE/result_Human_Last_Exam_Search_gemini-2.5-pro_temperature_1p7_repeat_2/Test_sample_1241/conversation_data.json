    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $p_i$, we need to solve the system of linear equations that arises when the derivatives in the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations are set to zero. In the steady state, the probabilities of being in each state are constant, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nFirst, we must address a likely typo in the second equation of the system. In a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, a transition from state $i$ to state $j$ (with rate $\\lambda_{ij}$) contributes a positive term $+\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ to the derivative $P_j'(t)$ and a negative term $-\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ to the derivative $P_i'(t)$. The given system is:\n1.  $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n2.  $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n3.  $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n4.  $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nThe first equation shows a flow from state 0 to state 1 at a rate of $\\lambda_{01}$. This should result in a positive term for $P_1'(t)$, not a negative one. The second equation should therefore be corrected to:\n$P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nNow, we set the derivatives to zero and substitute the given values for the transition rates:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe system of linear equations for the stationary probabilities ($p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$) is:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$ (Normalization condition)\n\nLet's solve this system:\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2 \\implies 0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\n\nTherefore, we have the relationship:\n$p_1 = p_2 = p_3$\n\nNow, use equation (1) to express $p_0$ in terms of $p_1$:\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1$\n\nSubstitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} p_1) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get 0.946.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
