    "An American in Paris*, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\nThe film features an elaborate seventeen-minute ballet sequence that showcases various Parisian settings. One of the key moments in this sequence is a dance number set on a stylized replica of the Place de la Concorde. This set includes a recreation of the famous fountains of the Place de la Concorde, which in reality are located in close proximity to the Luxor Obelisk. The entire ballet, including the Place de la Concorde scene, was filmed on a soundstage in Hollywood.\n\nOther Best Picture winners, such as *Gigi* (1958), were also filmed in Paris and feature the actual Place de la Concorde. However, with its 1951 release, *An American in Paris* precedes these films. The production of the film involved the creation of detailed sets to evoke the spirit of Paris, with different sections of the final ballet designed in the style of various French painters. A model of the Place de la Concorde fountain was constructed at MGM studios to facilitate the planning of the choreography and camera work for this specific scene.\n\nWhile *Around the World in 80 Days*, the 1956 Best Picture winner, had filming locations in Paris, there is no evidence to suggest that the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk were featured in the movie. Therefore, the depiction in *An American in Paris* marks the first instance of a Luxor Obelisk's location appearing in a Best Picture-winning film.\n\n<<<An American in Paris (1951)>>>"
