    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the renormalization group flow exhibits a non-trivial infrared fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of the theory.\n\nTo find the fixed point coupling, one calculates the beta function for the coupling constant, u, and finds the value u* for which the beta function is zero. The beta function to the lowest order in u and ϵ is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + A u²\n\nwhere A is a constant that depends on the normalization of the coupling constant and fields. For a common normalization choice, the beta function is:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3/(8π²)) u²\n\nSetting β(u*) = 0 to find the fixed point gives:\n\n-ϵu* + (3/(8π²)) (u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has a trivial solution at u* = 0, which corresponds to the Gaussian fixed point. The non-trivial solution, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is:\n\nu* = (8π²/3)ϵ\n\nDifferent conventions for the definition of the coupling constant exist. For instance, a dimensionless coupling `g` might be used, related to `u` by a factor. Another common result is derived from the beta function β(λ) = -ελ + 3λ², which leads to a fixed point at λ* = ε/3.\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of ϵ is directly proportional to ϵ. For a standard normalization, this expression is:\n\n<<<u* = (8π²/3)ϵ>>>"
