    "The user wants to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequence.\n\nTo do this, I need to understand the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" interactions and how the amino acid sequence, particularly the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat, influences the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the heptad repeat of the sequence:** I need to assign the 'a' through 'g' positions to the amino acid sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. This will reveal which amino acids are at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. Coiled-coils have a repeating seven-residue pattern, often denoted as (abcdefg)n. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and are critical for the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing that drives oligomerization.\n\n2.  **Identify the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions:** Based on the heptad repeat assignment, I will list the amino acids found at each 'a' and 'd' position throughout the sequence.\n\n3.  **Relate 'a' and 'd' residues to oligomeric state:** I'll use the search results to understand the established rules for how specific amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictate whether a coiled-coil will be a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc. For example, some combinations of Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Valine (V) at these positions are known to favor specific oligomers.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the information and make a prediction:** I will combine the sequence analysis with the principles of coiled-coil formation to predict the most likely oligomeric state.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Analyze the heptad repeat and identify 'a' and 'd' residues.**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nLet's assign the heptad repeat positions. The pattern is `abcdefg`. I will start by assuming the first hydrophobic residue in a potential core position is 'a' or 'd'. Looking at the sequence, we see a pattern of hydrophobic residues. Let's try assigning 'a' to the Isoleucine (I) at position 3.\n\n*   `G E I A Q S L`\n*   `a b c d e f g`  <- This doesn't seem right as 'G' and 'E' would be at 'e' and 'f' from the previous repeat, which are typically charged/polar.\n\nLet's try another alignment. The repeating nature `(X-X-I/L-X-X-X-L/I)` is a hallmark. Let's align based on the prominent hydrophobic residues.\n\nLet's assume the standard `(abcdefg)n` pattern.\n\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nLet's label the positions. A common way to start is to look for the first clear hydrophobic pairing. Isoleucine (I) and Alanine (A) often appear at 'a' and 'd'.\n\nLet's try starting with Isoleucine (I) at position 3 as 'a'.\n`g a b c d e f`\n`G E I A Q S L` -> a=I, d=Q (Glutamine - polar, not ideal for 'd')\n\nLet's try starting with Isoleucine (I) at position 3 as 'd'.\n`d e f g a b c`\n`G E I A Q S L` -> a=E (Glutamate - charged), d=I (hydrophobic). Not a good fit for 'a'.\n\nLet's look at the full sequence for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues.\nThe hydrophobic residues are: I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L\n\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nThere are four clear `I/L-X-X-I/L` motifs. Let's try assigning heptads based on this. A common pattern is Hydrophobic-Polar-Polar-Hydrophobic-Polar-Polar-Polar. This is not strictly followed but 'a' and 'd' are key.\n\nLet's try a different registration.\nLet's assume the sequence starts with `c d e f g a b`.\n`G E I A Q S L` -> a=S, d=E (doesn't fit)\n\nLet's assume it starts with `f g a b c d e`.\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n`f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g`\n\nLet's break it down into heptads.\nHeptad 1: `GEIAQSL`\nHeptad 2: `KEIAKSL`\nHeptad 3: `KEIAWSL`\nHeptad 4: `KEIAQSL`\nEnding: `KG`\n\nLet's assign positions `abcdefg` to each heptad.\n\n| Heptad | a | b | c | d | e | f | g |\n| :--- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |\n| 1 | G | E | I | A | Q | S | L |\n| 2 | K | E | I | A | K | S | L |\n| 3 | K | E | I | A | W | S | L |\n| 4 | K | E | I | A | Q | S | L |\n| end | K | G | | | | | |\n\nIn this registration:\n'a' positions: G, K, K, K\n'd' positions: A, A, A, A\n\nThis is not a typical coiled-coil pattern. The 'a' position should be hydrophobic. Let's re-evaluate the registration.\n\nLet's try a different phasing. The registration is key. Many prediction tools are needed for this, but based on visual inspection: The sequence `(I/L)xxx(I/L)` is a strong indicator.\n\nLet's look at the sequence again: `G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\nThe hydrophobic residues are spaced at `i, i+4`. This is the hallmark of the `a` and `d` positions in a heptad repeat `(abcdefg)`. So if `I` is at an 'a' position, `L` will be at the 'e' position. If `I` is at a 'd' position, `L` will be at the 'a' position of the next repeat.\n\nLet's try the most common convention: `(a) b c (d) e f g`\nLet's assign 'a' to Isoleucine (I) at position 3.\n\nSequence: `G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\nHeptad positions: `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n\nLet's lay it out:\n\n| Position | Residue | Heptad Position |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | G | e |\n| 2 | E | f |\n| 3 | I | g | -> This assignment is incorrect. Let's restart.\n\nThe sequence has 4 repeats of \"EIAxSLK\"\n\nThe core `(a, d)` positions are usually occupied by hydrophobic residues like I, L, V, A. Let's identify the hydrophobic residues in the given sequence: I, A, L, I, A, L, I, A, W, L, I, A, L.\nThe sequence is: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nLet's try to establish the heptad repeat `abcdefg`.\n`a b c d e f g`\n`K E I A Q S L`\n\nLet's analyze the given full sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nThe sequence seems to be constructed of 4 heptad repeats.\nLet's break it down:\nRepeat 1: `GEIAQSL`\nRepeat 2: `KEIAKSL`\nRepeat 3: `KEIAWSL`\nRepeat 4: `KEIAQSL`\nWith `KG` at the end.\n\nThis doesn't seem to produce the canonical hydrophobic core. Let's try shifting the frame.\n\nLet's focus on the canonical pattern. The `(a,d)` positions are key. Let's assume the `I` at position 3 is `a`.\nThen `d` is at position 6 (`S`). This is polar, so this framing is wrong.\n\nLet's assume the `A` at position 4 is `d`.\nThen `a` is at position 1 (`G`). This is not ideal.\n\nThere must be a standard way to register this. Let's look for known motifs. The sequence looks like a designed peptide.\nLet's try to align it manually looking for the `a` and `d` positions as hydrophobic.\nThe hydrophobic residues are: I, L, A, W.\n\nSequence: G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G\n\nLet's propose a heptad register: `g a b c d e f`\n`GEIAQSL` gives a=E, d=S (Wrong)\n\nLet's try `f g a b c d e`\n`GEIAQSL` gives a=I, d=L (Hydrophobic, good!)\n\nLet's use this register:\nPosition: `f g a b c d e`\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L`\n'a' pos: I, 'd' pos: L\n\nLet's apply this to the whole sequence.\n`f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\n**Heptad 1:**\na = I (pos 3)\nd = L (pos 7)\n\n**Heptad 2:**\na = I (pos 10)\nd = L (pos 14)\n\n**Heptad 3:**\na = I (pos 17)\nd = L (pos 21)\n\n**Heptad 4:**\na = I (pos 24)\nd = L (pos 28)\n\nThis register seems incorrect due to the `K` `E` residues now being in `f, g` and then `b,c` positions which are typically hydrophilic. But `a` and `d` positions are key.\n\nLet's check another register:\n`e f g a b c d`\n`GEIAQSL` -> a=A, d=L. (Also hydrophobic!)\n\nLet's apply this register to the whole sequence:\n`e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\n**Heptad 1:**\na = A (pos 4)\nd = L (pos 8 -> K, not L) -> This register is incorrect.\n\nGoing back to the `f g a b c d e` register:\n`G E **I** A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\n`f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e** f g **a** b c d **e**`\nHere `d` is not `L`. My manual highlighting was wrong.\n\nLet's look at the sequence again: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nLet's highlight hydrophobic residues (I, L, V, A, M, F, Y, W).\n`G E **I** **A** Q S **L** K E **I** **A** K S **L** K E **I** **A** **W** S **L** K E **I** **A** Q S **L** K G`\n\nAha! We see a pattern `I-A-x-x-L`. This corresponds to `a-b-c-d-e` or `d-e-f-g-a`.\nLet's assume the pattern `(a)b c(d)e f g`. If I is at 'a', then A is at 'b' and L is at 'd+2' which is 'f'. Doesn't fit.\n\nLet's assume the pattern `(d)e f g(a)b c`. If I is at 'd', then A is at 'e' and L is at `g+3` which is 'c'. Doesn't fit.\n\nThere must be an error in my approach or a subtlety I'm missing.\nLet's rethink the problem. Coiled-coils are defined by the `(abcdefg)n` heptad repeat. The core positions `a` and `d` are predominantly hydrophobic and their side chains pack into each other in a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement. The nature of the residues at `a` and `d` determines the oligomeric state.\n\nResearch shows:\n*   **Dimers:** Often have `a=I`, `d=L` or `a=V`, `d=L`. Polar residues like Asn (N) at `a` positions can also force dimer formation.\n*   **Trimers:** Often have `a=I`, `d=I` or `a=L`, `d=I`.\n*   **Tetramers:** Often have `a=L`, `d=I` or `a=I`, `d=A` in some contexts. Beta-branched residues (I, V) at 'a' positions tend to disfavor tetramers, while Leucine at 'a' is more accommodating. Having Ile at `a` and Leu at `d` specifies a dimer, while swapping to Leu at `a` and Ile at `d` can result in a tetramer.\n\nLet's try to find the register again, this time with high confidence. The most reliable method is to use a prediction tool, but since I cannot do that, I must deduce it from the sequence.\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (Length is 32)\nThis is roughly 4.5 heptads.\n\nLet's reconsider the segmentation:\n`GEIAQSL`\n`KEIAKSL`\n`KEIAWSL`\n`KEIAQSL`\n`KG`\n\nThis assumes a register starting at residue 1.\nIf we assign `abcdefg` starting from `G`:\n`a=G, d=A` (bad)\n`a=E, d=S` (bad)\n`a=I, d=L` (This seems to be the most common student error, misidentifying `e` as `d`). If `a=I(3)`, then `d` is `S(6)`.\n`a=A, d=K` (bad)\n`a=Q, d=E` (bad)\n`a=S, d=I` (bad)\n`a=L, d=A` (Let's check this)\n\nIf `a=L(7)`, `d=K(11-7=4 -> pos 10)`. No, `d` would be at pos `7+3=10`. Pos 10 is I. So `a=L, d=I`. This is promising.\nLet's verify this register:\n`c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\n**Heptad 1 (and a bit of 2):**\na = L (pos 7)\nd = I (pos 10)\n\n**Heptad 2:**\na = L (pos 14)\nd = I (pos 17)\n\n**Heptad 3:**\na = L (pos 21)\nd = I (pos 24)\n\n**Heptad 4:**\na = L (pos 28)\nd = G (pos 32) -> G at 'd' is highly disruptive.\n\nThis seems more plausible, but the `G` at the end is problematic. However, coiled coils can have \"skips\" or interruptions. Let's analyze the core pairs we found:\n*   L at 'a', I at 'd'\n*   L at 'a', I at 'd'\n*   L at 'a', I at 'd'\n*   L at 'a', G at 'd' (This last one is probably at the end of the helix and may not contribute to packing in the same way, or could be a capping motif).\n\nThe dominant pairing is **`a=L, d=I`**.\n\nNow let's consult the literature (search results) on what `a=L, d=I` means for the oligomeric state.\nFrom result: Harbury et al. found that the GCN4-LI mutant (Leucine at 'a', Isoleucine at 'd') formed a **tetrameric** (four-stranded) coiled-coil. This is a very strong piece of evidence from a foundational study in the field.\n\nResult also mentions: \"...switching the positions of L to a and I to d resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four-alpha-helices) coiled coil.\" This refers to the same classic experiment.\n\nThe knobs-into-holes packing explains this. The packing of side chains in the hydrophobic core is extremely specific. Beta-branched amino acids like Isoleucine (I) and Valine (V) are bulkier near the backbone compared to Leucine (L). The geometry of a tetramer core can better accommodate Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position than a dimer or trimer core. The \"knobs\" (side chains from one helix) fit into \"holes\" (crevices created by side chains on the adjacent helix). The specific shape and size of the knob (the residue at 'a' or 'd') and the corresponding hole dictates the superhelical twist and the number of helices that can pack together efficiently.\n\nSo, the repeating `a=L, d=I` pattern is a strong indicator of a tetrameric structure.\n\nWhat about the other residues?\n- The middle heptad has a `W` (Tryptophan) at the `e` position. (`KEIA**W**SL`).\n`a=I, b=A, c=W, d=S, e=L`\nThis is in the register: `f g a b c d e`.  `a=I, d=S`.  This is wrong.\n\nLet's re-verify the register, it's the most critical step.\nThe sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\nA very common design motif uses Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' or vice versa.\nLet's assume the first I is 'a'.\nPosition: `g a b c d e f`\n`G E I A Q S L` => a=I, d=Q (bad)\n\nLet's assume the first I is 'd'.\nPosition: `c d e f g a b`\n`G E I A Q S L` => a=S, d=I (bad)\n\nMy previous `a=L, d=I` finding seems most plausible. Let me write it out more carefully.\n`a` positions are `x`\n`d` positions are `y`\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n`1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32`\n\nLet's assume the core positions are **Isoleucine (I)** and **Leucine (L)**.\n`I` is at 3, 10, 17, 24. A perfect 7-residue repeat.\n`L` is at 7, 14, 21, 28. A perfect 7-residue repeat.\n\nThis `i, i+4` spacing is the canonical `a, e` or `d, a` relationship.\nCase 1: `a` positions are 3, 10, 17, 24 (`I`). `d` positions would be `a+3`, so 6, 13, 20, 27.\nResidues at `d`: S(6), S(13), S(20), S(27). These are all Serine. Serine is polar. This would be a highly unstable core. This register is wrong.\n\nCase 2: `d` positions are 3, 10, 17, 24 (`I`). `a` positions would be `d+4`, so 7, 14, 21, 28.\nResidues at `a`: L(7), L(14), L(21), L(28). These are all Leucine.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   **`a` positions: L, L, L, L**\n*   **`d` positions: I, I, I, I**\n\nThis fits perfectly!\nThis corresponds to the `c d e f g a b` repeating pattern.\nLet's write it out to be certain.\n`c d e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b`\n`G E I A Q S **L** K E **I** A K S **L** K E **I** A W S **L** K E **I** A Q S **L** K G`\nd=I(3), a=L(7)\nd=I(10), a=L(14)\nd=I(17), a=L(21)\nd=I(24), a=L(28)\nThe register is confirmed.\n\nThe dominant hydrophobic core interaction is **Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position**.\n\nAs established from the search results, this specific `(a=L, d=I)` arrangement is a classic design principle for creating **tetramers**. The packing of the beta-branched Isoleucine at the `d` position and the less bulky Leucine at the `a` position is sterically favorable in a four-helix bundle. Conversely, having isoleucine at the `a` position leads to steric clashes in a tetramer and thus favors dimer formation.\n\nThe one unusual residue is the Tryptophan (W) at position 19.\nIn our confirmed register: `c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f...`\nPosition 19 is an `f` position. (`...d(17) e(18) f(19) g(20) a(21)...`).\n`f` positions are on the solvent-exposed face of the coiled-coil, so having a bulky hydrophobic Tryptophan there is unusual but should not disrupt the core packing that determines the oligomeric state. It might influence higher-order assembly or solubility.\n\nTherefore, based on the well-established principles of knobs-into-holes packing demonstrated by Harbury and others, the sequence with Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions is designed to form a tetramer.\n\nFinal Answer check:\n- Sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n- Register analysis shows a consistent pattern of `a=L` and `d=I`.\n- Literature search confirms that the `a=L, d=I` pattern specifies a tetrameric oligomeric state.\n- The other residues are generally consistent with their positions in the heptad repeat (polar/charged at `e, g` and solvent-exposed `b, c, f`).\n\nThe answer is 4. This corresponds to choice C.To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`, and specifically the amino acids occupying the core `a` and `d` positions. These positions are critical for the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing that dictates the stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil.\n\n**1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat and Core Residues:**\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. In this sequence, the prominent hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), and Alanine (A). We can observe a clear repeating pattern of these residues. Let's analyze the spacing:\n*   Isoleucine (I) appears at positions 3, 10, 17, and 24. This is a perfect 7-residue repeat (3, 3+7, 3+14, 3+21).\n*   Leucine (L) appears at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28. This is also a perfect 7-residue repeat (7, 7+7, 7+14, 7+21).\n\nThe core `a` and `d` positions in a heptad repeat are spaced as `i` and `i+3` (if starting from `a`) or `i` and `i+4` (if looking at `d` and the next `a`). The observed `i, i+4` spacing between Leucine and the following Isoleucine (e.g., L at 7 and I at 10) is a strong indicator that these residues occupy the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's test this assignment: If the `a` position is Leucine (L) and the `d` position is Isoleucine (I):\n*   If `a` = position 7 (L), then `d` must be `a+3` = position 10. The residue at position 10 is Isoleucine (I). This fits.\n*   Let's check the next pair. If `a` = position 14 (L), then `d` = position 17 (I). This also fits.\n*   This pattern continues for the entire length of the core sequence: (a=L, d=I).\n\nThis establishes the following heptad register:\n*   **`a` positions:** Leucine (L) at 7, 14, 21, 28.\n*   **`d` positions:** Isoleucine (I) at 3, 10, 17, 24.\n(This corresponds to a `cdefgab` phasing of the sequence).\n\n**2. Relating Core Residues to Oligomeric State:**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions has a strong influence on the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil due to the specific requirements of knobs-into-holes packing.\n*   **`a=I`, `d=L`**: This combination is known to strongly favor the formation of **dimers**.\n*   **`a=I`, `d=I`** or **`a=L`, `d=I`**: These patterns often lead to **trimers** and **tetramers**.\n*   **`a=L`, `d=I`**: Foundational studies by Harbury et al. demonstrated that systematically placing Leucine at the 'a' positions and the β-branched amino acid Isoleucine at the 'd' positions results in a **tetrameric** (four-helix) coiled-coil.\n\nThe sequence in question, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, has a consistent core of **Leucine at the `a` positions** and **Isoleucine at the `d` positions**. This specific arrangement is a well-established design feature for producing a tetramer. The bulkier, β-branched isoleucine side chain is better accommodated at the `d` position in a four-helix bundle, while leucine fits well at the `a` position.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and the specific amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions, the protein sequence is predicted to form a tetramer.\n\nThe correct oligomeric state would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
