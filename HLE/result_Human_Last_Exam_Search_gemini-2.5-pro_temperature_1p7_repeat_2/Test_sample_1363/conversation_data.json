    "In the world of ballroom dancing, the technique of each dance dictates the possibilities and limitations of its figures. The reverse turn, a standard figure in many ballroom dances, involves a turn to the left. \"Overturning\" a turn means rotating more than the standard amount for that figure. After a thorough review of the technical descriptions for each dance, one stands out as having a reverse turn that is technically impossible to overturn without fundamentally violating its core principles.\n\nThe dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the **Viennese Waltz**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Viennese Waltz:** The Viennese Waltz is characterized by its high speed and continuous rotation down the line of dance. The reverse turn in Viennese Waltz has a specific technique that includes a crossing of the feet for both the leader and follower. Due to the rapid tempo, there is very little time to execute additional rotation. Attempting to overturn the reverse turn, which would be necessary to navigate a corner of the ballroom, is considered exceptionally difficult and is practically never done. Dancers will instead use a change step to transition to a natural turn, which can be underturned to go around a corner. Forcing an overturn in a Viennese Waltz reverse turn would disrupt the dance's characteristic smooth, gliding, and continuous flow, and would be a significant departure from its established technique.\n\nIn the other dances listed, overturning figures, including variations of the reverse turn, is possible and sometimes even a specific part of the syllabus:\n\n*   **English Waltz:** This slower waltz allows for more time and includes figures such as the \"Overturned Running Spin Turn,\" indicating that the concept of overturning is part of its technical vocabulary.\n*   **European Tango:** While the Tango has a unique staccato action, overturned figures are used in choreography, demonstrating that it is not against the fundamental technique of the dance.\n*   **Slow Foxtrot:** The Slow Foxtrot also has overturned figures like the \"Spin Overturn.\" While the lady must be precise in her heel turn within a reverse turn and not overturn it herself, this does not preclude the couple from overturning the entire figure.\n*   **Quickstep:** This dance frequently incorporates overturned figures, such as the \"Overturned V6\" and \"Overturned Progressive Chass√©,\" making it a dance that readily embraces variations in rotation.\n\nTherefore, the Viennese Waltz is the correct answer because its unique combination of high speed and specific footwork makes the overturning of a reverse turn a practical and technical impossibility without disregarding the essence of the dance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
