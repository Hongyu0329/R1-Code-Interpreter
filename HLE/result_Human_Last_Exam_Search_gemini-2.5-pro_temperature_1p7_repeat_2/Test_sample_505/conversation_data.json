    "Based on the principles of topological quantum error correction, here is the breakdown of how many logical qubits can be encoded:\n\n1.  **Logical Qubit in a Single Patch:** A single, standard patch of planar surface code, due to its boundaries, inherently encodes one logical qubit.\n\n2.  **The Role of Holes:** Holes are intentionally created defects within the surface code lattice. A common method for creating a robust and well-defined logical qubit is to introduce a pair of holes (e.g., two Z-cut holes or two X-cut holes). Creating such a pair of holes within a patch allows for the encoding of one additional, independent logical qubit.\n\n3.  **Qubits per Patch:** Therefore, a single patch of surface code that also contains two holes (one pair) can encode a total of two logical qubits:\n    *   One logical qubit is encoded by the global properties and boundaries of the patch itself.\n    *   A second logical qubit is encoded by the pair of holes created within it.\n\n4.  **Total for Two Patches:** Since the problem specifies two distinct patches of surface code, and assuming they are independent quantum memories, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each patch.\n\nTherefore, each of the two patches encodes 2 logical qubits, for a total of 4.\n\n2 patches * (1 qubit from patch boundary + 1 qubit from the pair of holes) = 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
