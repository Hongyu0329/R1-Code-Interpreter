Given the body of evidence about the role of interleukin-15 in supporting T cell function, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting T cell activation, proliferation, survival, and effector functions.
