    "Here are the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid:\n\nFirst, the **Araxes River**, with a length of approximately **1,072 kilometers (666 miles)**, is the longest river mentioned in the Aeneid. Virgil references it in Book VIII as a river that \"scorned a bridge,\" alluding to the Roman efforts to conquer the region. This river flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran.\n\nSecond is the **Po River**, identified with the mythological **Eridanus River** mentioned in the Aeneid. The Po is Italy's longest river, stretching for about **652 kilometers (405 miles)**. In the Aeneid, the Eridanus is one of the rivers of the underworld.\n\nThe third longest is the **Tiber River**, which flows through Rome and has a length of approximately **406 kilometers (252 miles)**. The Tiber is a significant river in the Aeneid, as its river god, Tiberinus, appears to Aeneas in a dream to confirm that he has reached his fated destination.\n\nBeyond these, other rivers are mentioned in the Aeneid, but they are considerably shorter. The Rhine is also mentioned, and while it is a major European river, its full length is not contained within the geographical scope of the events of the Aeneid in the same way the others are central to the narrative. The underworld rivers—Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe—are primarily mythological and, while some have real-world counterparts, they are small streams. For instance, the Acheron in Greece is about 52 kilometers long. Other minor rivers like the Timavus (about 2 kilometers long) and the Simois are also mentioned.\n\n<<<1. Araxes River (1,072 km)\n2.
