    "For a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit), the maximal rank of its complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional system (qudit) is defined by the generalized Pauli operators $\\{P_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$. These $d^2$ operators form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The channel action is given by:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\rho$ is the density matrix, and the coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$.\n\n2.  **The Complementary Channel**: The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information flow into the environment. Its output, for an input state $\\rho$ to the original channel, is an operator on the $d^2$-dimensional environment space. The density matrix of the complementary channel's output, $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$, has matrix elements given by:\n    $\\sigma_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho A_l^\\dagger A_k) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho (\\sqrt{p_l}P_l)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_k}P_k)) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(\\rho P_l^\\dagger P_k)$\n\n3.  **Maximizing the Rank**: The rank of the matrix $\\sigma$ depends on the choice of the Pauli channel (the probabilities $p_k$) and the input state $\\rho$. To find the maximal rank, we must optimize over both.\n    *   **Choice of Channel**: To maximize the rank of the matrix $\\sigma$, we should prevent any rows and columns from being identically zero. This is achieved by selecting a channel where all probabilities $p_k$ are strictly positive, i.e., $p_k > 0$ for all $k$. An example of such a channel is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k$. With this choice, the rank of $\\sigma$ becomes the rank of the matrix $C$ with elements $C_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho P_l^\\dagger P_k)$.\n    *   **Choice of Input State**: The rank of the matrix $C$ is determined by the properties of the input state $\\rho$. This matrix can be interpreted as the Gram matrix of the set of $d \\times d$ matrices $\\{P_k \\rho^{1/2}\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. The rank of a Gram matrix is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in the set.\n    The set of matrices $\\{P_k\\}$ forms a basis for the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_d$. Therefore, the vector space spanned by $\\{P_k \\rho^{1/2}\\}$ is the space $\\mathcal{M}_d \\rho^{1/2} = \\{M \\rho^{1/2} | M \\in \\mathcal{M}_d\\}$.\n    A result from linear algebra states that the dimension of this space is given by $d \\times \\text{rank}(\\rho^{1/2})$. Since $\\text{rank}(\\rho^{1/2}) = \\text{rank}(\\rho)$, the rank of the complementary channel's output for an input state $\\rho$ is $d \\times \\text{rank}(\\rho)$.\n    To maximize this quantity, we must maximize the rank of the density matrix $\\rho$. A density matrix for a qudit is a $d \\times d$ matrix, and its maximum possible rank is $d$. This is achieved by any full-rank state, such as the maximally mixed state $\\rho = I/d$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: By choosing a Pauli channel with all non-zero probabilities and an input state $\\rho$ of full rank ($d$), the rank of the complementary channel is:\n    Maximal Rank = $d \\times \\text{rank}(\\rho)_{\\text{max}} = d \\times d = d^2$.\n    Since the complementary channel outputs a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix, its rank cannot exceed $d^2$. Thus, the maximal achievable rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
