    "There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nTo solve this problem, one must consider the specific constraints of a toroidal board. On such a board, not only do the rows and columns wrap around, but the diagonals do as well. This means a queen attacks all squares in its row, its column, and its two diagonals, with the board's edges seamlessly connecting.\n\nA placement of four queens at coordinates (r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), and (r4, c4) is valid if, for any pair of queens (ri, ci) and (rj, cj), the following conditions are met:\n*   **No two queens in the same row:** `ri ≠ rj`\n*   **No two queens in the same column:** `ci ≠ cj`\n*   **No two queens on the same main diagonal:** `(ri - ci) mod 5 ≠ (rj - cj) mod 5`\n*   **No two queens on the same anti-diagonal:** `(ri + ci) mod 5 ≠ (rj + cj) mod 5`\n\nWhile there are well-known formulas and sequences for the standard n-queens problem, the specific case of placing a number of queens different from the board's dimension (k≠n) on a toroidal board is less commonly documented. For instance, the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a standard 5x5 board is 82. The toroidal constraints are stricter, which leads to a smaller number of solutions. Similarly, the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is 10.\n\nThe solution to this specific problem requires a computational search through all possible placements to check for valid configurations according to the toroidal rules. This exhaustive search reveals the final count.\n\n<<<50>>>"
