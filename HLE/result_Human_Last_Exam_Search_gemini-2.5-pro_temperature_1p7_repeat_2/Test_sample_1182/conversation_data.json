    "The number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers is 2.\n\nHere is a sketch of the derivation:\n1.  **Original Equation:** The curve is given by $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. This is a hyperelliptic curve defined over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, and we are interested in its reduction over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n2.  **Genus Calculation:** The degree of the polynomial on the right-hand side is $d=5$. The curve is singular at the point at infinity, but after resolving this singularity, the genus of the curve is found to be $g=2$.\n\n3.  **Change of Variables:** To analyze the reduction modulo 2, we seek a better model of the curve. Let's perform a change of variables. Let $x = 2X$ and $y=2Y$. This is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n    $(2Y)^2 = 8(2X) + (2X)^2 + 4(2X)^3 + 4(2X)^4 + 8(2X)^5$\n    $4Y^2 = 16X + 4X^2 + 32X^3 + 64X^4 + 256X^5$\n    Dividing by 4 gives a new integral model over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n    $C_2: Y^2 = X^2 + 4X + 8X^3 + 16X^4 + 64X^5$.\n\n4.  **Finding a Regular Model:** The special fiber of the model $C_2$ (i.e., the equation modulo 2) is $Y^2 \\equiv X^2 \\pmod 2$, which is $(Y-X)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. This is a non-reduced line, which means the model $C_2$ is not regular. To find a regular model, we can perform another transformation. Let $W = (Y-X)/2$. We can show this is an integral transformation. This leads to the model:\n    $C_3: W^2 + WX - X(1 + 2X^2 + 4X^3 + 16X^4) = 0$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Regular Model's Special Fiber:** We examine the model $C_3$ modulo 2 to find its special fiber:\n    $\\bar{C}_3: W^2 + WX - X = 0$.\n    To check if this curve is smooth, we look for singular points by taking partial derivatives:\n    *   $\\partial/\\partial W = 2W + X \\equiv X \\pmod 2$\n    *   $\\partial/\\partial X = W - 1 \\pmod 2$\n    A singular point would require $X \\equiv 0$ and $W \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. However, substituting $(X, W) = (0, 1)$ into the fiber's equation gives $1^2 + 1(0) - 0 = 1 \\neq 0$. Thus, there are no singular points, and the special fiber $\\bar{C}_3$ is smooth. It is a conic, which has genus $g_0=0$.\n    The model $C_3$ is a regular model for the curve.\n\n6.  **Stable Reduction and Number of Double Points:** We have found a regular model whose generic fiber has genus $g=2$ and whose special fiber is a smooth curve of genus $g_0=0$. When the genus of the special fiber of a minimal regular model is less than the genus of the generic fiber, the reduction is not good.\n\n    The special fiber of the stable model is obtained by contracting components of the minimal regular model's special fiber until it becomes stable. In our case, the special fiber is a single smooth component of genus 0. To become a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2, it must acquire double points (nodes). The number of double points, $\\delta$, is given by the formula relating the genus of the generic fiber ($g$), the geometric genus of the stable fiber's normalization ($g_0$), and $\\delta$:\n    $g = g_0 + \\delta$.\n    Substituting the values we found:\n    $2 = 0 + \\delta$.\n    This gives $\\delta = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 2 double points.\n\n<<<2>>>"
