    "For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is dominated by the contribution from the region where $x$ is small. This allows us to develop an asymptotic expansion for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe denominator can be written as $f(x) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. Since $g(0) = 0$, the integrand is large near $x=0$, which is the basis for the approximation. For small $x$, $g(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\n\nThe analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ can be derived using the method of asymptotic expansions. The formula is given by the first two terms of the asymptotic series:\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5} + B \\cdot \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are constants that depend on the structure of the function in the denominator.\n\n1.  **Leading Term:** The dominant term of the approximation comes from simplifying the denominator to $\\epsilon + 9x^5$.\n    $A \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$\n    By performing a change of variables $u = (9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}x$, the integral can be solved, yielding the coefficient:\n    $A = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}}$\n    Here $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\n2.  **Second Term:** The next term in the expansion accounts for the $5x^6$ term in the denominator. It is obtained by calculating the integral of the first-order correction term.\n    The coefficient $B$ is found to be:\n    $B = - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} = - \\frac{5 \\Gamma(7/5)\\Gamma(3/5)}{9^{7/5}}$\n\nCombining these gives the final analytical approximation.\n\n<<<An approximate analytical formula for the integral for small $\\epsilon$ is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\nThis can also be expressed using the Gamma function as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{\\Gamma(7/5)\\Gamma(3/5)}{9^{7/5}} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$>>>"
