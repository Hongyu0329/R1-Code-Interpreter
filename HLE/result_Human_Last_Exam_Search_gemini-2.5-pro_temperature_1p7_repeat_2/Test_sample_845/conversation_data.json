    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis interval, which is the time elapsed between two consecutive heartbeats, is the fundamental measurement from which HRV is calculated. While IBI is a common and accurate term, especially in the context of data from photoplethysmography (PPG), you may also encounter other names for this value, including:\n\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval (BBI)**\n*   **RR interval**, which specifically refers to the time between the R peaks on an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform.\n*   **Heart period**\n*   **Pulse interval**\n\nHRV is quantified by analyzing the variations in these successive IBIs.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI)>>>"
