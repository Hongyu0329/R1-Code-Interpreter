    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's journey culminates in his death on a bus is the 1969 classic *Midnight Cowboy*. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n\nIn the film's poignant final act, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and his ailing friend, Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), board a bus to Florida, a place Ratso has long dreamed of reaching. Ratso's health deteriorates rapidly during the trip, and he ultimately passes away in his seat as they near their destination. Joe, realizing his friend is gone, puts his arm around him as the bus continues toward Miami.\n\nWhile a pivotal scene takes place on the bus leading to a character's demise, a detailed review of the script and scene descriptions does not indicate that a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" specifically upon boarding. At one point during the journey, Ratso does say \"Thanks, Joe\" after Joe adjusts a window shade for him. However, his fate was already sealed by his severe illness before they even embarked on the trip.\n\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"
