    "In the context of disordered electronic systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to symmetry class D, which is characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotation symmetries, the target space of the corresponding sigma-model with `n` replicas is a specific type of supermanifold.\n\nThe target manifold for a supersymmetric sigma-model of class D with `n` replicas is given by the quotient space of supergroups `SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)`. The non-Grassman (or bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic part of this supermanifold.\n\nTo find the number of these variables, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic part of this target space. The bosonic part of a supergroup quotient `G/H` is the quotient of their maximal bosonic subgroups, which we can denote as `G_b / H_b`.\n\nFor the supergroup `SpO(2n, R|2n)`, the maximal bosonic subgroup is `Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)`.\nFor the supergroup `U(n|n)`, the maximal bosonic subgroup is `U(n) × U(n)`.\n\nTherefore, the bosonic sector of the target space is the manifold `(Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n))`. The number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize this space is its dimension, which is calculated as:\n`dim(Sp(2n, R)) + dim(O(2n)) - 2 * dim(U(n))`\n\nThe dimensions of these classical Lie groups are given by standard formulas:\n*   `dim(Sp(2n, R)) = n(2n + 1)`\n*   `dim(O(m)) = m(m - 1) / 2`\n*   `dim(U(n)) = n^2`\n\nThe problem specifies the use of two replicas, so we set `n=2`. The relevant manifold for the bosonic sector is `(Sp(4, R) × O(4)) / (U(2) × U(2))`. We calculate the dimensions of the constituent groups:\n\n*   `dim(Sp(4, R)) = 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10`\n*   `dim(O(4)) = 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6`\n*   `dim(U(2)) = 2^2 = 4`\n\nNow, we can compute the dimension of the bosonic target space:\n`dim = dim(Sp(4, R)) + dim(O(4)) - (dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2)))`\n`dim = 10 + 6 - (4 + 4)`\n`dim = 16 - 8 = 8`\n\nThus, 8 non-Grassman variables are needed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
