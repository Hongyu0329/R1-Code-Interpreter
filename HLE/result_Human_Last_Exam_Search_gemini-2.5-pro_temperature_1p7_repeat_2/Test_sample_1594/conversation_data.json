    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter H.\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The main buildings of the two institutes are parallel to one another and are joined in the center by a connecting structure. This central connector and the two long, parallel buildings create the distinct shape of the letter \"H\". The schools also share an internal courtyard, which is the space enclosed by the buildings.\n\n<<<H>>>"
