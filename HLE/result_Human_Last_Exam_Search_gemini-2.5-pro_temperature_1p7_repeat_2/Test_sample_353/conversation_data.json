    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given by:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1-x_0^2}{x_0^2}}\\right)$\n\nwhere $x_0$ is the unique real root of the polynomial $p(x) = 16x^3 - 20x^2 + 5$. This root can be expressed exactly as:\n\n$x_0 = \\frac{5}{12} + \\frac{1}{12}\\sqrt{100 - 60\\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{1}{12}\\sqrt{100 + 60\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is approximately 73.35 degrees. This exact value was first derived by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. The derivation and results were later simplified by Gander and Wanner.\n\nThe stability region for the BDF4 method is shown in various numerical analysis texts and online resources. For a method to be $A(\\alpha)$-stable, the sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha\\}$ must be contained within the stability region of the method. The angle $\\alpha$ represents the largest such angle for which this condition holds. For BDF methods of order greater than 2, the stability angle is less than 90 degrees, meaning they are not A-stable.\n\n<<<arctan(sqrt((1 - (5/12 + (1/12)*(100 - 60*sqrt(3))**(1/3) + (1/12)*(100 + 60*sqrt(3))**(1/3))**2) / ((5/12 + (1/12)*(100 - 60*sqrt(3))**(1/3) + (1/12)*(100 + 60*sqrt(3))**(1/3))**2)))>>>"
