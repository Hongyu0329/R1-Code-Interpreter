    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system near its critical point is calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion. This expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, d_c, where ε = d_c - d.\n\nFor a system with a scalar order parameter, which belongs to the Ising universality class, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The epsilon expansion provides a method to approximate critical exponents in dimensions close to d_c.\n\nFor the given spatial dimension d=3, the value of ε is:\nε = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nTo the first order in the epsilon expansion, the critical exponent for the specific heat, α, is given by the formula for the O(n) model (with n=1 for the Ising case):\nα = (4-n)ε / (2(n+8)) = (3ε)/18 = ε/6\n\nUsing the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - νd, where ν is the correlation length exponent, and the first-order expansion for ν, ν ≈ 1/2 + (n+2)ε / (4(n+8)), we can verify this result for n=1:\nα = 2 - (1/2 + 3ε/36)(4-ε) = 2 - (1/2 + ε/12)(4-ε) = 2 - (2 - ε/2 + ε/3 - O(ε²)) = ε/6 + O(ε²)\nThis confirms that the first-order approximation for α is indeed ε/6.\n\nSubstituting the value ε = 1 for a three-dimensional system, we get:\nα = 1/6\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
