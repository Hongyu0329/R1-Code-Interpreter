    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is, strictly speaking, infinite-dimensional. This is due to the pressure term appearing as a gradient, which allows for an arbitrary function of time to be added to the pressure without altering the equations.\n\nHowever, in common practice, the question refers to the finite-dimensional Lie algebra of the most physically relevant continuous point symmetries. The transformations that form this finite-dimensional Lie group and their corresponding dimensions are:\n\n*   **Time translation:** Shifting the time variable `t` by a constant. (1 dimension)\n*   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates `x` by a constant vector. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Scaling:** A dilation transformation of space, time, velocity, and pressure. (1 dimension)\n\nThe sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry groups gives the dimension of the finite-dimensional part of the Lie group of symmetries.\n\nTherefore, the dimension is 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
