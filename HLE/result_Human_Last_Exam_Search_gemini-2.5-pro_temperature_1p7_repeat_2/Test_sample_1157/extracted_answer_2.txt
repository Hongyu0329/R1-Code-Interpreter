The appropriate management involves stabilizing the patient's diabetes, performing wound care on the extraction sites, and planning for a cast-metal removable partial denture. The prognathic mandible (SNB of 88Â°) must be considered in the denture design. The key cells are the non-viable PDL cells, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts involved in resorption and ankylosis. The chosen abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and left second premolar due to their strategic position for supporting a removable prosthesis.
