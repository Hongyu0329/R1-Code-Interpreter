The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is a functional integral over Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄ that are anti-periodic in the imaginary time interval [0, β]. S_E is the Euclidean action of the system.
