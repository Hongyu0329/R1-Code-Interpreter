    "In the imaginary time representation, the formula for the fermionic partition function, denoted by Z, is expressed using Feynman's path integral formalism. This formulation involves integrating over anticommuting fields rather than ordinary numbers, which reflects the fermionic nature governed by the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe key elements required for this formula are:\n\n*   **Grassmann Variables**: Fermionic fields, `ψ` and its conjugate `ψ̄`, are not described by ordinary numbers. Instead, they are represented by Grassmann numbers, which are anticommuting variables. This is necessary to correctly represent the anticommutation relations of fermionic creation and annihilation operators in the path integral framework.\n*   **Imaginary Time**: The calculation of a thermal partition function, `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`, where `β` is the inverse temperature, is achieved by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time, `t → -iτ`. In this formalism, the imaginary time dimension is compactified on a circle with circumference `β`.\n*   **Euclidean Action (S_E)**: The Minkowskian action `S` is replaced by the Euclidean action `S_E` in the exponent. The Euclidean action is typically of the form:\n    `S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^dx L_E(ψ̄, ∂_τ ψ̄, ψ, ∂_τ ψ)`\n    where `L_E` is the Euclidean Lagrangian density.\n*   **Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions**: A crucial feature for fermions is that the fields must obey anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This means that a field `ψ` at imaginary time `τ` is related to the field at `τ + β` by a minus sign:\n    `ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)`\n    `ψ̄(x, τ + β) = -ψ̄(x, τ)`\n    These boundary conditions are a direct consequence of the fermionic statistics when evaluating the trace in the partition function.\n\nCombining these elements, the formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a functional integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` that satisfy the anti-periodic boundary conditions:\n\n<br>\n***\n### Formula for the Fermionic Partition Function\n\nThe partition function `Z` is given by the path integral:\n\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])`\n\nwhere:\n*   `D[ψ̄]D[ψ]` is the functional integration measure over the Grassmann-valued fields `ψ(x, τ)` and `ψ̄(x, τ)`.\n*   `S_E[ψ̄, ψ]` is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system.\n*   The integral is taken over all field configurations that are **anti-periodic** in the imaginary time `τ` over the interval `[0, β]`.\n\nFor a general theory of interacting fermions described by a Euclidean Lagrangian `L_E`, the action is:\n\n`S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  L_E(ψ̄(x, τ), ψ(x, τ))`\n\nThis path integral formalism provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.\n\n***\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is Z = ∫ D[ψ̄]D[ψ] e^(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is a functional integral over Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄ that are anti-periodic in the imaginary time interval [0, β]. S_E is the Euclidean action of the system.>>>"
