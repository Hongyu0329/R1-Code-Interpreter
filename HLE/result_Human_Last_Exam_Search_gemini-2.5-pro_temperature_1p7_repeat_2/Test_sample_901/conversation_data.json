    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Reagents and Reaction Type**: The substrate is a substituted cyclohexane with a bromine leaving group. Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base, and tert-butyl alcohol is the solvent. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Stereochemistry of the Substrate**: The designation (1S,2R) for 1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, meaning they are *cis* to each other.\n\n3.  **Mechanism Requirement for E2 in Cyclohexanes**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen to be removed and the leaving group must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) arrangement. This means both the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must be in axial positions for the elimination to occur.\n\n4.  **Chair Conformations of *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane**:\n    *   To undergo E2 elimination, the bromine atom must be in an axial position.\n    *   In the chair conformation where the bromine at C1 is axial, the *cis* methyl group at C2 must be in an equatorial position.\n    *   In this conformation, there are two adjacent (beta) carbons with hydrogens that could be eliminated: C2 and C6.\n\n5.  **Possible Products (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann)**:\n    *   **Path A (Zaitsev product)**: Removal of the axial hydrogen from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (and generally more stable) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Path B (Hofmann product)**: Removal of the axial hydrogen from C6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n6.  **The Role of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a very large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically crowded hydrogen at C2. It will preferentially abstract the more accessible proton at C6. This preference for the less hindered proton leads to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product.\n\nTherefore, the reaction predominantly yields the less substituted alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
