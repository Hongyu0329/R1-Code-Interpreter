To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change from a stable, extended 'trans' form to a bent, more compact 'cis' form upon exposure to sunlight at sunrise. At sunset, in the absence of sunlight, it must slowly and spontaneously revert from the 'cis' form back to the extended 'trans' form.
