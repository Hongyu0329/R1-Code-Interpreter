The number of possible 8x8 crossword puzzle grids that meet all the specified criteria (180-degree rotational symmetry, a minimum word length of 3 letters, full interconnectivity, and no "cheater" squares) is not a publicly available figure. Determining this number would require a dedicated computational program to generate and validate all possible grid patterns against this complex set of rules. While the rules themselves are standard in American-style crossword construction, the precise enumeration for an 8x8 grid is not published in readily accessible sources.
