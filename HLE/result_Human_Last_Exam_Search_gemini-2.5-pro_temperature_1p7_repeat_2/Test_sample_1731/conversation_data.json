    "## The Equilibrium State of Light Quanta: A Large Deviation Perspective\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta can be determined using the powerful framework of large deviation theory, specifically through the application of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. This approach provides a statistical basis for understanding the macroscopic properties of a photon gas, leading to results consistent with the foundational work of Bose and Planck.\n\nAt the heart of this analysis is the idea that the probability of a system spontaneously adopting a macroscopic configuration different from its equilibrium state is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is quantified by a \"rate function\" or \"large deviation function\". For a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, this rate function is minimized, which, in turn, maximizes the system's entropy.\n\n**Determining the Mean Energy**\n\nIn the context of a photon gas, which is a collection of non-interacting bosons, the Cramér-Chernoff theorem is employed to analyze the distribution of energy. The number of photons in a given energy state is not fixed, a key feature of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium, leading to a chemical potential of zero.\n\nBy applying the principles of large deviation theory, the mean occupation number for photons of a specific frequency ν is derived. Consequently, the mean energy for photons in a given cell of phase space is found to be consistent with Planck's law of black-body radiation. This result, originally derived by Bose using statistical arguments, is reproduced within the large deviation framework.\n\nSpecifically, the large deviation approach, through the Cramér-Chernoff theorem, leads to the well-known expression for the mean energy of photons in a frequency range dν:\n\n⟨E⟩ = (8πhν³/c³) * (1 / (e^(hν/k_B T) - 1)) dν\n\nwhere:\n*   h is Planck's constant\n*   ν is the frequency\n*   c is the speed of light\n*   k_B is the Boltzmann constant\n*   T is the temperature\n\n**Deriving the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is particularly suited for analyzing the spatial distribution of particles. In the case of photons, it provides a way to calculate the large deviation probabilities associated with different spatial arrangements. The theorem establishes a direct link between the probability of a particular macroscopic state and its relative entropy with respect to the equilibrium distribution.\n\nIn a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the system will be found in its most probable configuration. According to the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, this corresponds to the state of maximum entropy. The large deviation function, in this context, is directly related to the thermodynamic entropy of the system. For a Bose gas of photons, the equilibrium condition of maximizing the probability distribution is equivalent to maximizing the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy.\n\nThe calculations based on the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and the principles of large deviation theory yield the entropy of the photon gas, which aligns with the results derived from Planck's radiation law. The entropy (S) is proportional to the natural logarithm of the probability of the most likely spatial distribution of the photons.\n\nIn essence, the application of large deviation theorems demonstrates that the equilibrium state of a photon gas, characterized by its mean energy and entropy, is the most probable state, not just in a qualitative sense, but in a precisely quantifiable way governed by the exponential decay of probabilities for states away from equilibrium.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, as derived through the application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff large deviation theorems, are consistent with the results of Bose and Planck. The mean energy follows Planck's distribution law, and the entropy is the maximum possible value corresponding to the most probable distribution of the photon gas at thermodynamic equilibrium.>>>"
