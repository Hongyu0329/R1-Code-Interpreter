The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, as derived through the application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cram√©r-Chernoff large deviation theorems, are consistent with the results of Bose and Planck. The mean energy follows Planck's distribution law, and the entropy is the maximum possible value corresponding to the most probable distribution of the photon gas at thermodynamic equilibrium.
