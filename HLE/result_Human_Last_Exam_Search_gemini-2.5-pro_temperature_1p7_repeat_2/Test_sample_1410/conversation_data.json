    "White can win in 5 moves with optimal play from both sides.\n\nThe winning sequence begins with a brilliant rook sacrifice:\n\n1.  **Rxe1!** If Black takes the rook with their own rook (1...Rxe1), the following sequence unfolds:\n2.  **Qxf7+ Kh7**\n3.  **Bg6+ Kh8**\n4.  **Qf8+!!** A stunning queen sacrifice to force the win.\n5.  **...Rxf8**\n6.  **Nf7#**\n\nThis is a forced checkmate. If Black chooses another move after White's first move (1. Rxe1), the checkmate arrives sooner. For instance, if Black plays 1...Nxe1, White continues with 2. Qxf7+ Kh7 3. Bg6+ Kh8 leading to a quicker mate. Therefore, with optimal defense from Black to prolong the game, White delivers checkmate in 5 moves.\n\n<<<5>>>"
