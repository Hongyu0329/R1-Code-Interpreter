    "While no Beatles song features a direct leap from a tonic (I) chord to a minor fifth (v) chord in its opening, the song **\"Because\"** from the 1969 album *Abbey Road* presents a harmonically complex and unconventional introduction that creates a similar sense of tension and resolution.\n\nThe introduction to \"Because\" begins on a C# minor chord, which in the context of the song's key of D major, functions as the minor seventh (vii). It then moves through a series of chords, including a D diminished and an A major, before resolving to the tonic D major at the start of the verse. This progression, while not a straightforward I to v jump, establishes a similar feeling of moving from a stable home base to a more dissonant and unexpected chord before returning.\n\nThe Beatles were renowned for their innovative and often complex chord progressions, frequently departing from standard rock and pop formulas. Songs like \"A Hard Day's Night\" with its famous opening Fadd9 chord, and \"If I Fell,\" which changes key within the first eight bars, are prime examples of their harmonic adventurousness. While a direct tonic to minor fifth opening is not found in their catalog, the spirit of such a progression—creating surprise and harmonic interest—is very much in line with their songwriting style.\n\n<<<\"Because\">>>"
