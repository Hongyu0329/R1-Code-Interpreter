Approximately 100 million logical Toffoli gates (which translates to several hundred million logical T-gates). This number is determined by the benchmark algorithm (e.g., factoring a 2048-bit number) and represents the logical gate count for both scenarios. However, for the distance-5 implementation with a 1% physical error rate, the physical resources required to execute each logical gate would be extraordinarily high due to the immense overhead of magic state distillation.
