    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n\n### 1. Market Equilibrium\n\nThe market equilibrium (Q_E, P_E) is found by setting the supply and demand functions equal to each other:\n\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\nAt equilibrium, `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the prices are equal:\n\n`ln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis equation is a transcendental equation and does not have a simple analytical solution. It must be solved using numerical methods. By employing a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity and price to be approximately:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E):** ≈ 4.885\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P_E):** ≈ 4.606\n\n### 2. Total Welfare Calculation\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of the areas known as consumer surplus and producer surplus. It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price.\n\nTotal Welfare (TW) is calculated as:\n\n`TW = ∫[Demand(Q) - Supply(Q)] dQ`\n\nThis translates to:\n\n`TW = ∫ [18e^(-arctan(Q))] dQ - ∫ [ln(Q³ - 2)] dQ`\n\nThe integration limits are determined by the valid domain for each function. For the demand curve, the integration is from 0 to Q_E. For the supply curve, the function is defined when `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > ∛2`. Thus, the integration for the supply function is from `∛2` to `Q_E`.\n\nThe formula for total welfare is:\n\n`TW = ∫_0^(Q_E) 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ - ∫_(∛2)^(Q_E) ln(Q³ - 2) dQ`\n\nThese integrals also require numerical evaluation. Performing the numerical integration yields:\n\n*   Integral of the demand function: ≈ 35.158\n*   Integral of the supply function: ≈ 10.518\n\nSubtracting the value of the supply integral from the demand integral gives the total welfare:\n\n`Total Welfare ≈ 35.158 - 10.518 = 24.64`\n\nThus, the total welfare is approximately **24.64**.\n\n<<<24.64>>>"
