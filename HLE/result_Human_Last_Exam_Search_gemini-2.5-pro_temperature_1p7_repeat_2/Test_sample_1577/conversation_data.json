    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The degeneracy arises from the existence of logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but act non-trivially on the ground states. These logical operators correspond to non-contractible loops on the surface.\n\nThe toric code has two types of fundamental excitations, often called electric charges ('e') and magnetic fluxes ('m'). These are created at the ends of string operators made of Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators, respectively.\n\nThe boundaries of the toric code can be of two main types:\n*   **Smooth (or dual) boundaries:** At these boundaries, the star operators are truncated. Magnetic flux ('m') excitations can terminate (be absorbed) at a smooth boundary.\n*   **Rough (or primal) boundaries:** At these boundaries, the plaquette operators are truncated. Electric charge ('e') excitations can terminate at a rough boundary.\n\nFor a surface with a given topology, the GSD is 2^k, where *k* is the number of independent logical qubits. The logical operators are formed by strings of Pauli operators that are not contractible to a point and commute with the Hamiltonian. On a surface with boundaries, these can be closed loops wrapping around handles of the surface, or strings connecting pairs of boundaries.\n\nLet's consider a surface of genus g=0 (a sphere) with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes. This creates *n* smooth boundaries and *m* rough boundaries.\n*   A logical Z-operator corresponds to a string of Pauli-Z operators. To commute with all the star operators (which are products of Pauli-X), this string must either be a closed loop or terminate at boundaries where the star operators are not enforced, i.e., smooth boundaries. On a sphere, there are no non-contractible closed loops. Therefore, logical Z-operators must be strings connecting pairs of smooth boundaries. With *n* smooth boundaries, we can form *n-1* independent logical Z-operators.\n*   Similarly, a logical X-operator corresponds to a string of Pauli-X operators. To commute with all the plaquette operators (products of Pauli-Z), this string must either be a closed loop on the dual lattice or terminate at boundaries where the plaquette operators are not enforced, i.e., rough boundaries. On a sphere, this means logical X-operators must be strings connecting pairs of rough boundaries. With *m* rough boundaries, we can form *m-1* independent logical X-operators.\n\nThe logical X-operators and logical Z-operators commute with each other. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the number of independent X and Z logical operators.\nAssuming that there is at least one of each type of hole (*n* > 0 and *m* > 0), the total number of logical qubits *k* is:\nk = (number of independent Z-operators) + (number of independent X-operators)\nk = (n - 1) + (m - 1)\nk = n + m - 2\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is 2^k, which equals 2^(n+m-2). This matches one of the provided answers. This formula accurately reflects the case where both types of boundaries exist. For instance, on an annulus (a sphere with 2 holes) with one smooth and one rough boundary (n=1, m=1), the GSD is 2^(1+1-2) = 2^0 = 1, which is correct.\n\n<<<B>>>"
