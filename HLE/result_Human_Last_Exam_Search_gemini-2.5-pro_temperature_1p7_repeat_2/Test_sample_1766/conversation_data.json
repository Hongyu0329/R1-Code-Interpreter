    "In the quantum mechanical treatment of a p-electron, the interaction between its orbital and spin angular momenta, known as spin-orbit coupling, leads to a new set of conserved quantities represented by the total angular momentum operator, **J**, and its projection onto the z-axis, **J<sub>z</sub>**. The eigenvalues of the corresponding squared operator, **J²**, and **J<sub>z</sub>** provide crucial information about the energy levels and quantum states of the electron.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. An electron possesses an intrinsic spin angular momentum quantum number *s* = 1/2. The total angular momentum, **J**, is the vector sum of the orbital angular momentum, **L**, and the spin angular momentum, **S** (**J** = **L** + **S**).\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which ranges from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps. For a p-electron:\n*   *j<sub>min</sub>* = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   *j<sub>max</sub>* = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the p-electron can exist in two states characterized by *j* = 1/2 and *j* = 3/2. The common eigenvalues of **J²** and **J<sub>z</sub>** can be determined for each of these states.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the **J²** operator are given by ħ²*j*(*j* + 1), while the eigenvalues of the **J<sub>z</sub>** operator are given by ħ*m<sub>j</sub>*, where *m<sub>j</sub>* can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nThe common eigenvalues are therefore:\n*   **For the j = 3/2 state:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of **J²** is ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n    *   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of **J<sub>z</sub>** are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\n*   **For the j = 1/2 state:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of **J²** is ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n    *   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -1/2 and 1/2. The corresponding eigenvalues of **J<sub>z</sub>** are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nThese eigenvalues represent the quantized values of the square of the total angular momentum and its projection along the z-axis for a p-electron under spin-orbit coupling.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, there are two possible sets of common eigenvalues for J² and Jz:\n\n1.  **For j = 3/2:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ².\n    *   The eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.\n\n2.  **For j = 1/2:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ².\n    *   The eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
