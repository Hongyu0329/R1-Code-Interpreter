For a p-electron, there are two possible sets of common eigenvalues for J² and Jz:

1.  **For j = 3/2:**
    *   The eigenvalue of J² is (15/4)ħ².
    *   The eigenvalues of Jz are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ.

2.  **For j = 1/2:**
    *   The eigenvalue of J² is (3/4)ħ².
    *   The eigenvalues of Jz are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.
