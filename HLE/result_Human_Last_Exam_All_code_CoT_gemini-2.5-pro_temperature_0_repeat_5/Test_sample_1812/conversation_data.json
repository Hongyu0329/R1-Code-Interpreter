    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix, I will use Python with the NumPy library, which is well-suited for matrix operations.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the 3x3 matrix `A` as a NumPy array.\n2.  State the general formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix for clarity.\n3.  Substitute the values from the given matrix `A` into the formula and print the full equation.\n4.  Show the step-by-step simplification of the equation.\n5.  Finally, use `numpy.linalg.det()` to compute the definitive result and print it. This ensures accuracy and demonstrates the computational steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and explains the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem mentions a Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13, but the core task is to\n    # compute the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given adjacency matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]] is:\")\n    print(\"det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n    \n    # Extract elements for printing the formula\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n    # Print the equation with numbers\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e} * {i}) - ({f} * {h})) - ({b})(({d} * {i}) - ({f} * {g})) + ({c})(({d} * {h}) - ({e} * {g}))\")\n\n    # Calculate intermediate terms\n    term1 = e * i - f * h\n    term2 = d * i - f * g\n    term3 = d * h - e * g\n    \n    print(\"\\nSimplifying the terms inside the parentheses:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}({term1}) - ({b})({term2}) + ({c})({term3})\")\n\n    # Calculate the value of each major term\n    term1_val = a * term1\n    term2_val = b * term2\n    term3_val = c * term3\n    \n    print(\"\\nMultiplying the terms:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {term1_val} - ({term2_val}) + ({term3_val})\")\n\n    # Final calculation\n    final_result = term1_val - term2_val + term3_val\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {final_result}\")\n\n    # Using numpy to verify the result\n    det_A = np.linalg.det(A)\n    # Round to handle potential floating point inaccuracies for what should be an integer result\n    final_det = int(np.round(det_A))\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the determinant of the adjacency matrix is {final_det}.\")\n\nsolve_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
