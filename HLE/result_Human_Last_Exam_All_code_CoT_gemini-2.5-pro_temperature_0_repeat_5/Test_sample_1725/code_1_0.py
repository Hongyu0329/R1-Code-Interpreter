    This function solves the theoretical problem about the continuum model of a crystal.

    Part A: Dimension of the fibers of pi.
    The connection C is identified with the 3x3 distortion tensor C_ij.
    The fiber of the bundle pi is the space of all possible values of C at a point.
    This is the space of 3x3 real matrices.
    The dimension of this space is 3 * 3 = 9.

    """
    Part B: Number of coefficients specifying E.
    The energy E must be a scalar under the cubic group O_h and quadratic in the
    dislocation density tensor alpha (which is the curl of C).
    The number of independent coefficients is the number of independent quadratic invariants
    of a general 3x3 tensor under O_h.
    This corresponds to the number of irreducible representations in the decomposition
    of the 9D space of 3x3 matrices under O_h.
    The decomposition is A_1g + E_g + T_1g + T_2g.
    There are 4 irreducible representations.
    Therefore, there are 4 independent coefficients.
