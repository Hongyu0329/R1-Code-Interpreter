    Given a sequence <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2> of functions from omega_1 to omega_1
    which is increasing modulo finite sets (i.e., f_alpha <* f_beta for alpha < beta),
    there necessarily exists an uncountable set X subset of omega_2 and a function g: omega_1 -> omega_1
    such that for every beta in X and gamma in omega_1, f_beta(gamma) < g(gamma).
