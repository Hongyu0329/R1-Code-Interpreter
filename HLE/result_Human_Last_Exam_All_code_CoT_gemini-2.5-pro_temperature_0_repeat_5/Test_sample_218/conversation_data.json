    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Relate Irreps to Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Use the Hook Length Formula:** The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. The formula is:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell. The hook length of a cell is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one (for the cell itself).\n\n3.  **Execute the Plan:**\n    *   We will generate all possible partitions of the integer 25.\n    *   For each partition, we will calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the Hook Length Formula.\n    *   We will then check if this dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    *   We will count how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It uses the `sympy` library to generate the partitions of 25. You may need to install it first (`pip install sympy`). The code will print each partition and its dimension if it's below the threshold, and finally, it will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    corresponding to the given partition using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Calculate the product of hook lengths\n    hook_product = 1\n    for i, part_len in enumerate(partition): # i is the row index (0-based)\n        for j in range(part_len): # j is the column index (0-based)\n            # Number of cells to the right\n            hooks_right = part_len - (j + 1)\n            \n            # Number of cells below\n            hooks_down = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    hooks_down += 1\n            \n            # Hook length is hooks_right + hooks_down + 1 (for the cell itself)\n            hook_length = hooks_right + hooks_down + 1\n            hook_product *= hook_length\n            \n    # Calculate dimension using the formula n! / product_of_hooks\n    # Python's integers handle the large numbers involved\n    if hook_product == 0:\n        return 0\n    dimension = math.factorial(n) // hook_product\n    return dimension\n\ndef find_irreps_below_threshold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of irreps of S_25 with dimension less than a threshold.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    threshold = 500000\n    count = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Finding irreps of S_{n} with dimension < {threshold}:\\n\")\n\n    # Generate all partitions of n\n    # The partitions() function from sympy yields dictionaries\n    all_partitions_gen = partitions(n)\n\n    for p_dict in all_partitions_gen:\n        # Convert the partition from sympy's dict format to a tuple\n        # e.g., {3:1, 1:2} becomes (3, 1, 1)\n        p_list = []\n        for val, num in sorted(p_dict.items(), reverse=True):\n            p_list.extend([val] * num)\n        \n        partition_tuple = tuple(p_list)\n        \n        # Calculate the dimension for the current partition\n        dim = calculate_dimension(partition_tuple)\n        \n        # Check if the dimension is below the threshold\n        if dim < threshold:\n            count += 1\n            # As requested, output the numbers for each qualifying representation\n            print(f\"Partition {partition_tuple}: dimension = {dim}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of irreducible representations with dimension strictly less than {threshold}: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_irreps_below_threshold()\n<<<62>>>\n```"
