    print("Problem: In 3D graphics and simulation, a 'plane' is an infinitely thin 2D surface with no volume or thickness.")
    print("Technical Reason: Most fluid solvers (including FLIP solvers) discretize the simulation space into a 3D grid of voxels. For an object to be treated as a solid obstacle, it must have volume to occupy these voxels. An infinitely thin plane has no volume and will likely be ignored by the solver, allowing fluid to pass straight through it.")
    print("Solution: To function correctly, the obstacle must be a 3D object. You should use a thin cube (a cuboid) instead of a plane.")
