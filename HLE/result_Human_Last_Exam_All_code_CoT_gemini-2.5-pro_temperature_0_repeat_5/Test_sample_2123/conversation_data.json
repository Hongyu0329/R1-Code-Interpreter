    "This is a classic literary and linguistic riddle. To solve it, we need to connect Vienna, the Russian language, and an English poet through a specific essay. Here is the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the answer, presented in a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Acknowledge that this is a riddle, not a computational problem.\n2.  The solution relies on a chain of connections between an English author, the German language spoken in Vienna, and a famous poet.\n3.  The English author is G.K. Chesterton, who wrote an essay about his travels.\n4.  While in Vienna, he saw the German word for \"pears,\" which is \"Birnen,\" on a fruit stall.\n5.  This German word reminded him of the surname of the Scottish (often referred to as English in a broader sense) poet Robert Burns.\n6.  A Russian translation of Chesterton's essay would, therefore, contain the name \"Burns\" in the context of describing the streets of Vienna.\n7.  The script will print this logical path and then the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a literary riddle by explaining the logical steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Solving the riddle: 'In the Russian translation of a certain essay, the surname of an English poet appears when describing the wide boulevards of Vienna.'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Step 1: The riddle refers to a specific, real-world essay.
