    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of parameters required to describe the target space of the relevant sigma-model. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Model:** The problem specifies a supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with `n=2` replicas. We are interested in the bosonic (non-Grassman) sector.\n2.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For symmetry class D, the target space for the bosonic fields is the symmetric space `G/K`, where `G = O(2n)` and `K = O(n) x O(n)`. Here, `n` is the number of replicas.\n3.  **Determine the Number of Variables:** The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is equal to its dimension. The dimension of a symmetric space `G/K` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(K)`.\n4.  **Calculate Group Dimensions:** The dimension of an orthogonal group `O(N)` is given by the formula `dim(O(N)) = N(N-1)/2`.\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** We will substitute `n=2` into the formulas:\n    *   Calculate `dim(G) = dim(O(2*2)) = dim(O(4))`.\n    *   Calculate `dim(K) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2))`.\n    *   Subtract `dim(K)` from `dim(G)` to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model of symmetry class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    n = 2\n\n    print(\"To find the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model of symmetry class D, we must calculate the dimension of its bosonic target manifold.\")\n    print(f\"For class D with n={n} replicas, this manifold is the symmetric space G/K = O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n)).\")\n    print(\"The number of variables is the dimension of this space, which is calculated as: dim(G) - dim(K).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # The dimension of the orthogonal group O(N) is N*(N-1)/2.\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the dimension of G = O(2n)\n    N_G = 2 * n\n    dim_G = N_G * (N_G - 1) // 2\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the group G = O(2n) = O({N_G}).\")\n    print(f\"dim(O({N_G})) = ({N_G} * ({N_G} - 1)) / 2 = {dim_G}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the subgroup K = O(n) x O(n)\n    N_K = n\n    dim_O_n = N_K * (N_K - 1) // 2\n    dim_K = dim_O_n + dim_O_n\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the subgroup K = O(n) x O(n) = O({N_K}) x O({N_K}).\")\n    print(f\"The dimension of a single O({N_K}) group is ({N_K} * ({N_K} - 1)) / 2 = {dim_O_n}.\")\n    print(f\"dim(K) = dim(O({N_K})) + dim(O({N_K})) = {dim_O_n} + {dim_O_n} = {dim_K}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the final number of variables\n    num_variables = dim_G - dim_K\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the final number of variables by finding the dimension of the manifold G/K.\")\n    print(f\"Number of variables = dim(G) - dim(K)\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {dim_G} - {dim_K} = {num_variables}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The number of non-Grassman variables needed is {num_variables}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
