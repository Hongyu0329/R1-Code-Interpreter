    "My plan is to solve this problem by using a fundamental theorem from the theory of integral lattices. Instead of performing a complex calculation or a database lookup, I will show that the existence of such a lattice leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  I will start with the given properties of the lattice: it is a positive definite, even lattice of dimension 17.\n2.  I will use a key theorem that relates the signature of an integral lattice to the squared norm of a special vector within it, called the characteristic vector. The theorem states that for any integral lattice `L`, there exists a vector `w` in `L` such that `(w, w) ≡ signature(L) (mod 8)`.\n3.  For a positive definite lattice of dimension 17, the signature is 17. So, the theorem implies that `(w, w) ≡ 17 (mod 8)`, which simplifies to `(w, w) ≡ 1 (mod 8)`.\n4.  Next, I will use the property that the lattice is \"even\". By definition, this means the squared norm of any vector in the lattice must be an even integer. Since the characteristic vector `w` is in the lattice, `(w, w)` must be an even integer.\n5.  Finally, I will show the contradiction: a number `(w, w)` cannot be both an even integer and congruent to 1 modulo 8. An even number can never leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 8 (or any even number).\n6.  This contradiction proves that no such lattice can exist, so the answer is 0.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this reasoning and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2\n    by using a fundamental theorem to show their non-existence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The properties of the hypothetical lattice L.\n    dimension = 17\n    determinant = 2\n    \n    # For a positive definite lattice, the signature is equal to the dimension.\n    signature = dimension\n\n    print(\"Problem: How many positive definite even lattices are there of dimension 17 and determinant 2?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"We will use a proof by contradiction based on a theorem about integral lattices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Assume such a lattice L exists.\")\n    print(f\"It has dimension n = {dimension} and is positive definite, so its signature is {signature}.\")\n    print(f\"It is an 'even' lattice, meaning for any vector v in L, its squared norm (v, v) is an even integer.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the characteristic vector theorem.\")\n    print(\"A theorem for any integral lattice L states that there exists a characteristic vector w in L\")\n    print(\"such that its squared norm (w, w) is congruent to the signature of L modulo 8.\")\n    print(\"Formula: (w, w) ≡ signature(L) (mod 8)\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the required norm property.\")\n    print(f\"For our lattice L, signature(L) = {signature}.\")\n    print(f\"So, the theorem implies: (w, w) ≡ {signature} (mod 8)\")\n    \n    congruence_result = signature % 8\n    print(f\"This simplifies to: (w, w) ≡ {congruence_result} (mod 8)\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Use the 'even' property of the lattice.\")\n    print(\"Since w is a vector in the even lattice L, its squared norm (w, w) must be an even integer.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Find the contradiction.\")\n    print(f\"We have two conflicting conditions for the number (w, w):\")\n    print(f\"1.
