    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of `a(4)`, which represents the maximal number of prime implicants for any Boolean function with 4 variables.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the core problem:** The question asks for a specific value, `a(4)`, from a sequence known in digital logic design and combinatorics. This is not a simple calculation but a known result from the field.\n2.  **Find the correct sequence:** There is some historical confusion about this sequence. Early upper bounds (related to antichains of product terms, OEIS A000375) were not always achievable by an actual Boolean function. The correct sequence, representing the true maximums, is given by OEIS A114732.\n3.  **Determine the function that yields the maximum:** For `n â‰¤ 4`, the maximum number of prime implicants is achieved by the **n-variable parity function**. This function is true if and only if an odd number of its inputs are true.\n4.  **Calculate the number of prime implicants:** For the parity function, no two of its minterms are adjacent in the n-dimensional hypercube. This means no simplification is possible, and every minterm of the function is also a prime implicant. The number of minterms in the n-variable parity function is `2^(n-1)`.\n5.  **Construct the solution for n=4:**\n    *   The number of prime implicants will be `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`.\n    *   The code will generate these 8 prime implicants (which are the minterms with an odd number of 1s in their binary representation).\n    *   To satisfy the prompt's requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", the code will print the full Boolean equation for the 4-variable parity function, which is the sum of its 8 prime implicants. The final answer is the count of these terms.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the prime implicants and find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_a4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n    This is achieved by the 4-variable parity function, whose prime implicants are its minterms.\n    This script generates those minterms, forms the Boolean equation, and counts them.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n    variables = ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n    prime_implicants = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 2^n possible minterms for n variables.\n    # A minterm is represented by an integer from 0 to 2^n - 1.\n    for i in range(2**n):\n        # The parity function consists of minterms with an odd number of uncomplemented variables.\n        # This corresponds to integers with an odd number of '1's in their binary representation.\n        if bin(i).count('1') % 2 == 1:\n            # This minterm is a prime implicant for the parity function.\n            # We format it into a human-readable string.\n            term_parts = []\n            binary_representation = format(i, f'0{n}b')\n            for j in range(n):\n                if binary_representation[j] == '1':\n                    term_parts.append(variables[j])  # Uncomplemented variable\n                else:\n                    term_parts.append(variables[j] + \"'\")  # Complemented variable\n            prime_implicants.append(\"\".join(term_parts))\n\n    print(\"The Boolean function with the maximal number of prime implicants for n=4 is the parity function.\")\n    print(\"Its prime implicants are the minterms that make the function true.\")\n    \n    # The final equation is the sum (OR) of these prime implicants.\n    # We print each term of the equation as requested.\n    equation = \" + \".join(prime_implicants)\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is: f(w,x,y,z) =\", equation)\n\n    # The value a(4) is the number of terms in this equation.\n    result = len(prime_implicants)\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of terms (prime implicants) in the equation is {result}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, a(4) = {result}.\")\n\nsolve_a4()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
