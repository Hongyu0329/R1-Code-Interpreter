def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the largest n for the given group theory problem.
    
    Let d(G) be the minimal size of a generating set of G.
    Let A be the alternating group on 5 letters, A_5.
    Let B_n be the direct power of n copies of A.
    Let C_n be the free product of 50 copies of B_n.
    We want to find the largest n such that d(C_n) <= 100.
    
    1. By the Grushko-Neumann theorem, d(C_n) = 50 * d(B_n).
       So, 50 * d(B_n) <= 100, which means d(B_n) <= 2.
    
    2. B_n = A_5^n. For a finite perfect group like A_5, d(A_5^n) = max(d(A_5), n).
       We know d(A_5) = 2. So, d(B_n) = max(2, n).
       
    3. The inequality becomes max(2, n) <= 2.
