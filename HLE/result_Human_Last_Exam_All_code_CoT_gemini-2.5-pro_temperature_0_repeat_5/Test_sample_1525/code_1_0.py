    This function analyzes the provided statements about the Datalog claim.

    A. The recursive definition of P_k is criticized for order-dependence, which is a valid point as "order of appearance" in a set of rules is ambiguous. This statement is correct.

    B. This statement misrepresents the claim and incorrectly analyzes the composition of operators. It is incorrect.

    C. This statement correctly describes a general property of the operators (that γ⁻¹ is not a true inverse of γ), but it discusses the composition γ⁻¹[γ[P]], which is not the central topic of the claim's equation. We will consider this not directly "about the claim".

    D. This statement correctly points out the same ambiguity as in A, but applied to the set of facts S₀. This statement is correct.

    E. This statement provides a correct conceptual interpretation of the claim's meaning: that coarse-grained inference is equivalent to a more complex fine-grained process under the given conditions. This statement is correct.

    Based on this analysis, statements A, D, and E are correct.
    The total count of correct statements is 3.
