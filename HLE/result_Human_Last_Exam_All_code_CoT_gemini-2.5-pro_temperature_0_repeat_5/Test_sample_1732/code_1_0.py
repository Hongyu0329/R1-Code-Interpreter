# This script solves the quadratic equation derived from the problem's conditions.
# As explained in the derivation, the problem reduces to solving for 'd' in the equation:
# 50*d^2 - d - 51 = 0
# We are looking for a solution where d > 1.

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation a*d^2 + b*d + c = 0
a = 50
b = -1
c = -51

# Calculate the discriminant
discriminant = (b**2) - 4 * a * c

# Find the two solutions for d using the quadratic formula
# d = (-b Â± sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)
sol1 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
sol2 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)

# The problem states that d > 1. We find which solution meets this condition.

if sol1 > 1:

elif sol2 > 1:
