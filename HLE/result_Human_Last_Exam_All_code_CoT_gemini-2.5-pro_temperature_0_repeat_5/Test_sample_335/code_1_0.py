# Step 1: Compute the simplicial volume for the first component, K1 = C_{4,3}(Conway).
# The simplicial volume of a (p,q)-cable of a knot J is |p| * ||S^3 \ J||.
# For K1, the companion knot is the Conway knot and the cable parameters are (4,3), so p=4.

# The simplicial volume of a twisted Whitehead double of a knot J is the sum of

# The simplicial volume of the pattern part is the simplicial volume of the
# Whitehead link complement after a 1/n = -1/2 Dehn surgery on one component.
# The simplicial volume of the Whitehead link complement is 4. For a p/q surgery
# with |p/q| <= 1, the volume of the resulting manifold remains 4.
