    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any PLL case, we need to find the smallest set of stickers whose states (i.e., colors) are unique for each of the 21 PLL permutations. We can think of this as an information problem: how many data points (sticker colors) are needed to uniquely identify one of 21 possibilities?\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that logically deduces the answer by:\n1.  Calculating the total number of available stickers to observe.\n2.  Testing the sufficiency of seeing 3 stickers (the stickers on one face) and showing it fails.\n3.  Discussing why 4 stickers are also insufficient, based on known computational results.\n4.  Concluding that 5 stickers are sufficient, as specific sets of 5 have been proven to work.\n5.  Printing the final answer based on this logical progression.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to identify any of the 21 PLL cases on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the basic parameters of the problem.\n    # There are 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces in the last layer.\n    # Corners have 2 side-facing stickers each.
