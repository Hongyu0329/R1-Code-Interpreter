def find_mutualists():
    """
    This function identifies the indices of organisms that are mutualists
    of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    A mutualistic relationship is one where both organisms benefit. In this context,
    it refers to pollinators who get nectar and help the plant reproduce.

    The identified mutualists are:
    - 1: Danaus plexipus (Adult) - Pollinator
    - 2: Megachile frigidus (Adult) - Pollinator
    - 4: Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult) - Pollinator
    - 5: Pepsis thisbe (Adult) - Pollinator
    - 6: Megachile ericetorum (Adult) - Pollinator

    The non-mutualists are:
    - 3: Formica rufa (Adult) - Tends aphids, not a direct mutualist with the plant.
    - 7: Danaus plexipus (Larva) - Herbivore, eats the plant.
    - 8-12: All other larvae - Do not interact directly with the plant.
