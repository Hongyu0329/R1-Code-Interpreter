    Calculates the length of a specific locus on a cube's surface and expresses it as a percentage.

    The problem considers a cube of side length r and a point P at the midpoint of an edge.
    The locus C is the set of all points on the cube's surface at a geodesic distance r from P.
    We need to calculate (Length of C) / (2 * pi * r) as a whole number percentage.

    Through geometric analysis by unfolding the cube's faces, we find:
    1. The locus C is composed of 6 circular arcs.
    2. Each arc is part of a circle of radius r.
    3. Each arc subtends an angle of pi/3 radians.
    """

    # Angle of each arc in radians
    angle_rad = math.pi / 3

    # The side length 'r' and 'pi' will cancel out, but we show them for clarity.
    # Let's use symbolic representation in the print statements.

    # The length of a single arc is r * angle_rad
    # Total length of C = num_arcs * r * angle_rad
    # L = 6 * r * (pi/3) = 2 * pi * r

    # The value to divide by is D = 2 * pi * r
    
    # The ratio is L / D = (2 * pi * r) / (2 * pi * r) = 1

    # The final percentage is ratio * 100
