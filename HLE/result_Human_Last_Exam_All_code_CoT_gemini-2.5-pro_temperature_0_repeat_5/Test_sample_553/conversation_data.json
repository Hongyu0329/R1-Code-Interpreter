    "This is a great music theory question! The song you're referring to is \"Michelle\" from The Beatles' 1965 album, Rubber Soul.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Identify the song title and the artist.\n2.  Explain the key the song is in.\n3.  Define the tonic (I) chord and the minor fifth (v) chord within that key.\n4.  Print out a clear explanation of how this chord progression appears at the beginning of the song.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song that starts with a\n    tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    artist = \"The Beatles\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n\n    # Define the chords based on the key of F Major\n    # The Roman numeral for the tonic chord is I\n    tonic_chord_numeral = \"I\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"F Major\"\n\n    # The Roman numeral for the minor fifth chord is v\n    minor_fifth_chord_numeral = \"v\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by {artist} that features this progression is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the musical analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The tonic chord (numeral {tonic_chord_numeral}) is {tonic_chord_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The minor fifth chord (numeral {minor_fifth_chord_numeral}) is {minor_fifth_chord_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn the opening line, 'Michelle, ma belle', the harmony jumps from the tonic F Major chord to the C minor chord, creating its distinctive, melancholic sound.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
