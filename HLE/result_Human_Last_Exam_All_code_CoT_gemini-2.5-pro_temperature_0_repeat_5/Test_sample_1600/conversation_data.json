    "To find the value of a(3), we first need to understand the formula for a(n). The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron propagator in quantum electrodynamics, denoted as a(n), is given by the product of a double factorial and a Catalan number.\n\nThe formula is:\n`a(n) = (2n - 1)!! * C_n`\n\nWhere:\n1.  `(2n - 1)!!` is the double factorial of `(2n - 1)`, which is the product of all odd integers from 1 up to `(2n - 1)`.\n2.  `C_n` is the n-th Catalan number, which can be calculated as `C_n = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n)`.\n\nFor the specific case of `a(3)`, we set `n = 3`.\n\n1.  **Calculate the double factorial part:**\n    `(2*3 - 1)!! = 5!! = 5 * 3 * 1 = 15`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Catalan number part (C₃):**\n    `C₃ = (1 / (3 + 1)) * (2*3 choose 3) = (1/4) * (6 choose 3)`\n    `(6 choose 3) = 6! / (3! * 3!) = 720 / (6 * 6) = 20`\n    `C₃ = (1/4) * 20 = 5`\n\n3.  **Calculate a(3):**\n    `a(3) = 15 * 5 = 75`\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef double_factorial(k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the double factorial k!! for an odd integer k.\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k % 2 == 0:\n        # Double factorial is typically defined for non-negative integers.\n        # This implementation focuses on the odd case needed for the formula.\n        return 0\n    if k == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\ndef catalan_number(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the nth Catalan number C_n.\"\"\"\n    # Formula: C_n = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)\n    if n < 0:\n        return 0\n    numerator = math.factorial(2 * n)\n    denominator = math.factorial(n + 1) * math.factorial(n)\n    # Use integer division as the result is always an integer\n    return numerator // denominator\n\n# The problem asks for a(3), which corresponds to n=3.\nn = 3\n\n# Calculate the double factorial term: (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!!\ndf_val = double_factorial(2 * n - 1)\n\n# Calculate the Catalan number term: C_3\ncn_val = catalan_number(n)\n\n# Calculate the final value a(3)\na_n_val = df_val * cn_val\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"To find a(3), we use the formula a(n) = (2n - 1)!! * C_n.\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n}:\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = (2*{n} - 1)!! * C_{n}\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {2*n - 1}!! * {cn_val}\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {df_val} * {cn_val}\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {a_n_val}\")\n```\n<<<75>>>"
