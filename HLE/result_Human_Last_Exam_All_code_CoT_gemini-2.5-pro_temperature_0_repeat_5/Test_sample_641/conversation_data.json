    "This problem requires calculating the number of involutions in the finite group PSU(4, 997). An involution is an element `x` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x != 1`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Group:** The group is PSU(n, q), the Projective Special Unitary group, with n=4 and q=997. Elements of PSU(n, q) are cosets `gZ`, where `g` is in SU(n, q) and `Z` is the center of SU(n, q).\n2.  **Condition for Involution:** A coset `gZ` is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity coset `Z`, and `gZ` is not the identity coset. This translates to `g^2 ∈ Z` and `g ∉ Z`.\n3.  **Determine the Center Z:** The center `Z` of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `λI` where `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. For n=4 and q=997, `Z` has order `d = gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n4.  **Identify Pre-images:** We need to count the number of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}` but `g ∉ {I, -I}`. This set of elements can be split into two disjoint sets:\n    *   `S₁ = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g² = I, g ∉ Z}`: These are the non-central involutions in SU(4, q).\n    *   `S₂ = {g ∈ SU(4, q) | g² = -I}`: If `g² = -I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`, so `g ∉ Z` is automatically satisfied.\n5.  **Count the Elements:**\n    *   The number of elements in `S₁` is given by the formula `|S₁| = q⁴(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1)`.\n    *   For `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` (which `997 = 4*249 + 1` is), the number of elements in `S₂` is given by `|S₂| = |SU(4, q)| / (2 * |SL(2, q)|)`, which simplifies to `|S₂| = (q⁵(q³ + 1)(q⁴ - 1)) / 2`.\n6.  **Calculate Final Number:** The total number of such pre-image elements is `|S| = |S₁| + |S₂|`. Since the center `Z` has 2 elements, each involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to exactly 2 elements in `S`. Therefore, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is `|S| / 2 = (|S₁| + |S₂|) / 2`.\n7.  **Implementation:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculation with `q = 997`, as the numbers involved are very large. The script will print out the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in the group PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # An involution in PSU(4, q) is an element gZ (where Z is the center of SU(4, q))\n    # such that (gZ)^2 = Z and gZ != Z.
