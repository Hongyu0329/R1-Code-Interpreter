  # The reasoning for all answers being 'No' is based on a counterexample
  # using a hyperbolic group with torsion, such as G = Z_2 * Z_2, and a
  # rational (and context-free) subset K = {a}, where 'a' is a torsion element.
  #
  # A: Not every geodesic word is fully quasireduced because alpha(K) can contain
  #    elliptic elements (like 'a'), which are not loxodromic.
  #
  # B: A fully quasireduced word must represent a loxodromic element. If K
  #    consists only of elliptic elements, so will alpha(K). In this case, no
  #    such word exists, so no universal bound can guarantee its existence.
  #
  # C: alpha(K) does not contain 'only' quasigeodesic words because it can
  #    contain elliptic elements, which are not loxodromic ('quasigeodesic').
