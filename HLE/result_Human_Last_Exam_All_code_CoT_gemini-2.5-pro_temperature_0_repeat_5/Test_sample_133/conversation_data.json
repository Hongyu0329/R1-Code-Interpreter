    "To find the optimal moves for 'O' to win as fast as possible, we need to analyze the game state and find moves that lead to a guaranteed win in the minimum number of turns. This is a classic game theory problem that can be solved by looking ahead a few moves.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent the Board**: I will represent the Connect 4 board as a 6x7 grid (a list of lists in Python).\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins**: First, I'll check if 'O' has any moves that win immediately (creating a line of four). A quick analysis shows there are no such moves.\n3.  **Look for Forced Wins (Forks)**: Since there's no immediate win, the next best strategy is to find a move that creates a \"fork\" â€“ a situation where 'O' has two different ways to win on the next turn, and the opponent 'X' can only block one of them. This guarantees a win for 'O' on its subsequent move.\n4.  **Analyze Moves**: I will write a Python script to systematically analyze each possible move for 'O'. For each move, the script will:\n    a.  Simulate 'O' making that move.\n    b.  Consider all possible counter-moves by 'X'.\n    c.  For each of 'X's counter-moves, check if 'O' then has a winning move.\n    d.  If 'O' has a winning move regardless of what 'X' does, the initial move is considered optimal.\n5.  **Identify and Output Optimal Moves**: The script will identify all such moves that guarantee a win in the shortest number of turns (which is 2 turns for 'O' in this case) and print them in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this analysis and find the optimal moves.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\n# Constants for the board dimensions and players\nROWS = 6\nCOLS = 7\nPLAYER_O = 'O'\nPLAYER_X = 'X'\nEMPTY = '.'\n\ndef get_initial_board():\n    \"\"\"Returns the board state from the problem description.\"\"\"\n    return [\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_O, EMPTY, EMPTY],\n        [PLAYER_O, EMPTY, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X],\n        [PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_X, PLAYER_O, PLAYER_X]\n    ]\n\ndef get_valid_moves(board):\n    \"\"\"Finds the lowest empty spot in each column.\"\"\"\n    valid_moves = []\n    for c in range(COLS):\n        for r in range(ROWS -
