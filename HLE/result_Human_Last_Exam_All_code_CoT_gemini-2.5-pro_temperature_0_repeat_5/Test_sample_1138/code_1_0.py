    # The question asks which statement is true regarding digital signature schemes,
    # using ECDSA as an example of a scheme whose security is defined against existential forgery.
    # Let's evaluate each option.

    # A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new,
    #    different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.
    # This property is known as Strong Unforgeability. Secure schemes like ECDSA are designed to have this
    # property. Thus, an adversary's success probability is negligible.
    is_A_true = True
    print("Analysis of A: This statement describes strong unforgeability. It is a security goal for ECDSA. The statement is TRUE.")

    # B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk
    #    with no more than negligible probability.
    # This is the fundamental security property of any public-key cryptosystem. If the secret key could be
    # recovered, the system would be completely broken. The security of ECDSA relies on the hardness of the
    # Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which prevents key recovery.
    is_B_true = True
    print("Analysis of B: This statement describes the difficulty of key recovery, a fundamental security assumption for ECDSA. The statement is TRUE.")

    # C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally
    #    bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.
    # This statement talks about schemes that are insecure ("existentially forgeable"). For some such broken schemes,
    # it is indeed possible to perform a universal forgery (signing a chosen message). So, the statement is logically true,
    # although it describes insecure schemes, not ECDSA.
    is_C_true = True
    print("Analysis of C: This statement is true for some insecure schemes. A scheme could be so broken that universal forgery is possible.")

    # D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally
    #    bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.
    # This statement claims that message recovery is hard for ALL schemes. This is false. Some signature standards,
    # like ISO/IEC 9796-2, are designed to have message recovery. The "For all" makes the statement false.
    is_D_true = False
    print("Analysis of D: This statement is false because some signature schemes are designed with message recovery. The 'For all' qualifier is too strong.")

    # E. More than one of the options A-D are true.
    # Since A and B (and C) are true, this option is correct.
    is_E_true = is_A_true and is_B_true
