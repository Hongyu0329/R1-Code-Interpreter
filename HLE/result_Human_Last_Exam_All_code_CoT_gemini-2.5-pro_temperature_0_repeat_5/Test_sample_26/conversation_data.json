    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The user wants to find the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n2.  **Relate Rank to Rational Homology:** The rank of a finitely generated abelian group (like a homotopy group) is a \"rational\" property. It can be calculated by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and finding the dimension of the resulting vector space. The Rational Hurewicz Theorem provides a powerful connection between rational homotopy and rational homology.\n\n3.  **Apply the Rational Hurewicz Theorem:** This theorem states that for a simply connected space $Y$, the rank of the $n$-th homotopy group is equal to the $n$-th Betti number: `rank(π_n(Y)) = b_n(Y)`.\n\n4.  **Show X is Simply Connected:** I will use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to show that $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(X)$ must be zero.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Betti Number:** With $X$ shown to be simply connected, we have `rank(π_3(X)) = b_3(X)`. I will then use Poincaré Duality for the manifold $X$ (which is a compact, orientable 4-manifold) to relate $b_3(X)$ to $b_1(X)$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Rank:** The first Betti number, $b_1(X)$, is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. By the integral Hurewicz theorem, this group is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, and thus $b_1(X)=0$. This will give the final answer for the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth\n    quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Introduction to the problem\n    print(\"We want to find the rank of the third homotopy group, rank(pi_3(X)),\")\n    print(\"where X is a smooth quintic hypersurface in the complex projective space CP^3.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Use the Rational Hurewicz Theorem\n    print(\"Step 1: Relate rank to rational homology.\")\n    print(\"The rank of an abelian group is its dimension after tensoring with the rational numbers Q.\")\n    print(\"The Rational Hurewicz Theorem states that for a simply connected space Y,\")\n    print(\"rank(pi_n(Y)) is equal to the n-th Betti number, b_n(Y).\")\n    print(\"So, if X is simply connected, rank(pi_3(X)) = b_3(X).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Show X is simply connected\n    print(\"Step 2: Show X is simply connected using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem.\")\n    print(\"X is a complex surface (real dimension 4) in CP^3 (real dimension 6).\")\n    print(\"The Lefschetz theorem implies that the inclusion i: X -> CP^3 induces an isomorphism\")\n    print(\"on homotopy groups below the middle dimension, so pi_1(X) is isomorphic to pi_1(CP^3).\")\n    \n    pi_1_cp3 = 0\n    print(f\"The space CP^3 is known to be simply connected, so pi_1(CP^3) = {pi_1_cp3}.\")\n    pi_1_x = pi_1_cp3\n    print(f\"Therefore, pi_1(X) = {pi_1_x}, and X is simply connected.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Use Poincare Duality\n    print(\"Step 3: Use Poincare Duality to find b_3(X).\")\n    print(\"Since X is a compact, orientable 4-manifold, Poincare Duality holds.\")\n    print(\"This means b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X).
