    # The generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics are given by:
    # dX_i/dt = R_i*X_i*(1 - X_i/K_i) + (Gamma/N) * sum_{j=1 to N} (A_i - A_j)*R_i*R_j*X_i*X_j
    #
    # An equilibrium is a state where dX_i/dt = 0 for all i.
    # The equation can be written as:
    # X_i * [ R_i*(1 - X_i/K_i) + (Gamma/N) * sum_{j=1 to N} (A_i - A_j)*R_i*R_j*X_j ] = 0

    # The question asks for the number of equilibria that can exist as parameters vary.
    # This means we are looking for the maximum possible number of equilibria for a valid
    # choice of parameters (R_i, K_i, A_i, Gamma >= 1).

    # Let's consider a special case to simplify the system. We can choose the parameters A_i
    # to be all equal. For instance, let A_i = 1 for all i = 1, ..., N.
    # In this case, the term (A_i - A_j) is always (1 - 1) = 0.

    # The complex interaction term becomes zero:
    # (Gamma/N) * sum_{j=1 to N} (A_i - A_j)*R_i*R_j*X_i*X_j = 0

    # The system of N equations decouples and simplifies to N independent logistic equations:
    # dX_i/dt = R_i * X_i * (1 - X_i / K_i)

    # Now, we find the equilibria for this simplified system. For each species i,
    # the equilibrium condition dX_i/dt = 0 is:
    # R_i * X_i * (1 - X_i / K_i) = 0

    # Since the parameter R_i >= 1, this equation has two solutions for the abundance X_i:
    # 1. X_i = 0
    # 2. 1 - X_i / K_i = 0  =>  X_i = K_i

    # An equilibrium for the N-species system is a vector (X_1, X_2, ..., X_N) where each
    # X_i is at its own equilibrium state. Since each of the N species has 2 possible
    # equilibrium states (0 or K_i), the total number of distinct equilibria for the
    # system is the product of the number of choices for each species.

    # Total number of equilibria = 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (N times)

    # This shows that 2^N equilibria can exist. It can be proven that this is the maximum
    # possible number of equilibria for this system.

    # The final equation for the number of equilibria is 2^N.
    # We will print this formula.
