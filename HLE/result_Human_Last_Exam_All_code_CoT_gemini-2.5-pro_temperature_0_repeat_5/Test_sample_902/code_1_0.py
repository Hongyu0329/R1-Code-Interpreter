    print("  - Consider the set 'S' of all Python programs with source code length less than 10000 characters.")
    print("  - From this set, consider only those programs that halt and return an integer.")

    print("     - Therefore, program Q is one of the programs in the set 'S' used to define `Huge_int`.")
    print("\n  4. THE CONTRADICTION:")
    print("     - Since Q is in the set 'S', the integer it returns must be less than or equal to the maximum, `Huge_int`.")
    print("     - So, `output(Q) <= Huge_int`.")

    print("     - The only way to resolve this contradiction is to reject our initial assumption.")
    print("     - Our assumption was that program 'P' exists.")
    print("     - Therefore, no program 'P' can exist to compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")

    print("Final Answer: No, such a program does not exist because the function is uncomputable.")
