    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For non-interacting or weakly interacting systems, these invariants are additive.\n2.  **Define the initial state:** We have two systems (Chern insulators). Let's call their Chern numbers C1 and C2.\n3.  **Assign values:** According to the problem, C1 = 1 and C2 = 1.\n4.  **Calculate the final state:** The Chern number of the combined system (the junction), C_total, is the sum of the individual Chern numbers: C_total = C1 + C2.\n5.  **Construct the code:** Write a Python script that defines the variables, performs the addition, and prints an explanation along with the final equation.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive.\n# When two topological systems, like Chern insulators, are brought together\n# to form a junction without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number\n# of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nC1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nC2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the Chern number of the junction\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"First insulator's Chern number, C1 = {C1}\")\nprint(f\"Second insulator's Chern number, C2 = {C2}\")\nprint(\"The total Chern number of the junction, C_total, is C1 + C2.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
