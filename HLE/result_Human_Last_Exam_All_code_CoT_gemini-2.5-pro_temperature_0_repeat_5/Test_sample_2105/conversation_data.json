    "To determine the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for the major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule**: The starting compound is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide (Perylene-S-S-Perylene). The major reduction product of a disulfide is the corresponding thiol (R-SH). Therefore, the molecule of interest is perylene-3-thiol.\n\n2.  **Represent the Molecule as a Graph**: We will represent the perylene-3-thiol molecule as an undirected graph where atoms are the vertices and chemical bonds are the edges. As specified in the prompt, we must include all hydrogen atoms in this graph. We will use the `rdkit` library to generate the molecule from its SMILES string and `networkx` to represent it as a graph.\n\n3.  **Calculate All-Pairs Shortest Paths**: Both the Wiener and Szeged indices are based on the shortest path distances between all pairs of atoms in the molecular graph. We will compute these distances for all pairs of vertices.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Wiener Index (W)**: The Wiener index is defined as the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths between all unique pairs of vertices in the graph.\n    $W = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{u,v} d(u,v)$\n    where $d(u,v)$ is the shortest distance between vertices $u$ and $v$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz)**: The Szeged index is calculated by summing contributions from each edge in the graph. For an edge `e = (u, v)`, its contribution is the product of the number of vertices closer to `u` than to `v` ($n_u$) and the number of vertices closer to `v` than to `u` ($n_v$).\n    $Sz = \\sum_{e=(u,v)} n_u(e) \\cdot n_v(e)$\n\n6.  **Compute and Display the Ratio**: Finally, we will compute the ratio Sz/W and print the individual index values along with the final ratio in an equation format.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It requires the `rdkit` and `networkx` libraries to be installed.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_molecular_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Wiener and Szeged indices for perylene-3-thiol and their ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the molecule (perylene-3-thiol) and create its graph representation\n    # The SMILES string for perylene-3-thiol is Sc1cc2c3c(ccc2cc1)c4cccc5c4c3ccc5\n    smiles = \"Sc1cc2c3c(ccc2cc1)c4cccc5c4c3ccc5\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    \n    # Add hydrogen atoms to the molecular graph, as required\n    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    \n    # Create a NetworkX graph from the RDKit molecule object\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for atom in mol.GetAtoms():\n        G.add_node(atom.GetIdx())\n    for bond in mol.GetBonds():\n        G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx())\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate all-pairs shortest paths\n    # The result is a dictionary where dist[u][v] gives the shortest path length\n    dist = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Wiener Index (W)\n    # Sum of distances between all unique pairs of nodes\n    wiener_index = 0\n    nodes = list(G.nodes())\n    for i in range(len(nodes)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes)):\n            u, v = nodes[i], nodes[j]\n            wiener_index += dist[u][v]\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the Szeged Index (Sz)\n    # Sum of n_u * n_v for each edge (u, v)\n    szeged_index = 0\n    for u, v in G.edges():\n        n_u = 0\n        n_v = 0\n        for w in G.nodes():\n            dist_wu = dist[w][u]\n            dist_wv = dist[w][v]\n            if dist_wu < dist_wv:\n                n_u += 1\n            elif dist_wv < dist_wu:\n                n_v += 1\n        szeged_index += n_u * n_v\n\n    # Step 6: Compute and print the ratio\n    if wiener_index == 0:\n        ratio = 0\n    else:\n        ratio = szeged_index / wiener_index\n\n    print(f\"Molecule: Perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S)\")\n    print(f\"Total atoms (including H): {mol.GetNumAtoms()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Szeged Index (Sz): {szeged_index}\")\n    print(f\"Wiener Index (W): {wiener_index}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Szeged Index / Wiener Index = {szeged_index} / {wiener_index} = {ratio}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_molecular_indices()\n```\n<<<2.564056939501779>>>"
