    "Of course, I can help with that. The user is asking a biological question but has requested the answer be delivered via a script.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the specific protein that acts as an inhibitor for macrophage/microglial engulfment of amyloid. When this protein's function is blocked or \"broken down,\" the engulfment process can proceed.\n2.  Create a Python script that stores the name of this protein and a brief explanation of its mechanism.\n3.  The script will then use the `print()` function to display this information to the user in a clear and readable format.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n```python\ndef find_protein_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of a protein\n    that inhibits amyloid engulfment by macrophages/microglia.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein in question is a receptor on microglia (the brain's macrophages)\n    # Its human name is LilrB2, and its mouse equivalent is PirB.\n    protein_name = \"LilrB2 (Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2)\"\n    mouse_equivalent = \"PirB\"\n    \n    # Explanation of its role\n    explanation = (\n        \"LilrB2 is a receptor found on the surface of microglia (the brain's primary immune cells, which act like macrophages).\\n\"\n        \"When amyloid-beta oligomers bind to the LilrB2 receptor, it triggers a signaling cascade that suppresses the microglia's ability to clear amyloid plaques.\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, when this protein's function is inhibited or 'broken down' (for example, by using a blocking antibody), it allows the microglia to resume the engulfment and clearance of amyloid.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(\"The protein that, when its function is broken down or inhibited, allows for macrophage/microglial engulfment of amyloid is:\")\n    print(\"=======================================================================================================================\")\n    print(f\"Protein in Humans: {protein_name}\")\n    print(f\"Protein in Mice: {mouse_equivalent}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Mechanism of Action ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Execute the function to display the information\nfind_protein_info()\n```\n<<<LilrB2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
