    "This is a problem in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory. To solve it, we need to determine the connectivity of the spaces involved and then analyze the induced map on the first few non-trivial homotopy groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Spaces**: Define the source space $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  **Source Connectivity**: Calculate the connectivity of the source space $X$. The connectivity of a space is the largest integer $n$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\le n$. We will use the following rules:\n    *   `conn(S^n) = n - 1`\n    *   `conn(ΩX) = conn(X) - 1`\n    *   `conn(X ∧ Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1`\n    *   `conn(ΣX) = conn(X) + 1`\n3.  **Target Connectivity**: Calculate the connectivity of the target space $Y$, noting that $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$.\n4.  **Analyze Homotopy Groups**: Based on the connectivity of $X$ and $Y$, determine the first dimension `k` where the homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X)$ and $\\pi_k(Y)$ can be non-trivial.\n5.  **Calculate First Non-Trivial Groups**: Compute $\\pi_k(X)$ and $\\pi_k(Y)$ using the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem and the Hurewicz Theorem.\n6.  **Analyze the Map**: The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. We will analyze $f_*$ for the first few non-trivial dimensions.\n7.  **Conclusion**: Combine the results to determine the connectivity of the map.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the connectivity of a map from homotopy theory.\")\n    print(\"Map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the connectivity of the source space X\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Connectivity of the Source Space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) ---\")\n    conn_s4 = 4 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of S^4 is n-1 = 4 - 1 = {conn_s4}\")\n    conn_s6 = 6 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of S^6 is n-1 = 6 - 1 = {conn_s6}\")\n\n    conn_omega_s4 = conn_s4 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^4 is conn(S^4) - 1 = {conn_s4} - 1 = {conn_omega_s4}\")\n    conn_omega_s6 = conn_s6 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^6 is conn(S^6) - 1 = {conn_s6} - 1 = {conn_omega_s6}\")\n\n    conn_wedge = conn_omega_s4 + conn_omega_s6 + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is conn(Omega S^4) + conn(Omega S^6) + 1 = {conn_omega_s4} + {conn_omega_s6} + 1 = {conn_wedge}\")\n\n    conn_source = conn_wedge + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the source space X is conn(wedge) + 1 = {conn_wedge} + 1 = {conn_source}\")\n    print(f\"This means pi_i(X) = 0 for all i <= {conn_source}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the target space Y\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Connectivity of the Target Space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6) ---\")\n    # S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^(4+6) = S^10\n    conn_s10 = 10 - 1\n    print(f\"S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^10, which has connectivity n-1 = 10 - 1 = {conn_s10}\")\n    conn_target = conn_s10 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the target space Y = Omega(S^10) is conn(S^10) - 1 = {conn_s10} - 1 = {conn_target}\")\n    print(f\"This means pi_i(Y) = 0 for all i <= {conn_target}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the map on homotopy groups\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Analysis of the Map on Homotopy Groups ---\")\n    # Both spaces are 8-connected, so the map is an isomorphism for i < 9.\n    first_nontrivial_dim = conn_source + 1\n    print(f\"Both spaces are {conn_source}-connected.
