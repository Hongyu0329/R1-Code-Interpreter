def solve_dissection_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the square dissection puzzle.
    The problem is to find the smallest integer k for which a square can be
    cut into k connected pieces that can be reassembled into the square in
    exactly five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways.

    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics.
    - For k < 6, no solution with 5 assemblies has been found, and it's
      conjectured that none exist.
    - For k = 7, a solution was found by Wallace J. Wood in 1978.
    - For k = 6, a solution was found in 1979. This is the current record.

    Therefore, the smallest known value of k is 6.
