    explanation = """
    The 1907 earthquake in Kingston, Jamaica, led to a significant diplomatic incident. The United States dispatched naval ships with aid, supplies, and marines. However, the British Governor of Jamaica, Sir Alexander Swettenham, took offense at the landing of armed American personnel without his express permission. He wrote an insulting letter to the American Admiral, rejecting the aid and demanding their departure. This action caused a major diplomatic rift between the U.S. and Britain.

    The question asks for the view of the local Jamaican population. Historical sources, such as editorials in Jamaica's 'Gleaner' newspaper from that time, show that the local population was overwhelmingly critical of Governor Swettenham. They were suffering immensely and were grateful for the desperately needed American aid. The Governor's actions were seen as arrogant, tactless, and sacrificing the welfare of Jamaicans for the sake of imperial pride. The local elites and merchant class led the condemnation, which resulted in London forcing Governor Swettenham to apologize and resign.

    Now let's evaluate the options:

    A. The locals were wary of American intervention due to differing racial policy: While concern about American racial policies (Jim Crow) and imperial ambitions was a real factor in the Caribbean, the immediate and overwhelming local response to this specific incident was gratitude for the life-saving aid, not wariness.

    B. The locals wanted independence from the British Empire but preferred Canadian annexation to American annexation: This was a separate, ongoing discussion in some circles but not the primary reaction to the earthquake crisis.

    C. The locals were loyal British subjects and preferred colonial administration to American intervention: This is the most accurate, albeit nuanced, choice. While the locals were furious with the Governor and wanted American *aid*, they did not call for an end to British rule or for an American takeover. Their solution was to appeal to the higher authority in London to remove the incompetent governor. This action demonstrates that they still operated within the framework of the British Empire, viewing themselves as loyal subjects who trusted the overarching system of colonial administration (i.e., the Crown and the Colonial Office) to correct the error of its local representative. They preferred this system to a full-blown American political or military intervention that could supplant British sovereignty.

    D. The locals were agnistic to Ango-American affairs, anticipating Canadian annexation: This is incorrect. The locals were deeply involved and had strong opinions on the matter.

    E. The locals preferred American annexation over British rule due to the economic ties between the countries and associated material benefits: This is an overstatement. There was no widespread call for American annexation, even though the material benefits of their aid were appreciated.

    Conclusion: Option C best captures the fundamental political reality. The population acted as loyal British subjects seeking redress from the Empire, preferring the established colonial system over a potential American takeover, despite their anger at the local governor and their gratitude for American aid.
