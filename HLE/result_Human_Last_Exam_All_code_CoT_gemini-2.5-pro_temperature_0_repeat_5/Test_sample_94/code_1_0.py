    # The physicist in question is Albert Baez. The story is that while he was
    # working on X-ray optics, he was inspired by a janitor cleaning a long,
    # cylindrical piece of equipment. The janitor's cleaning motion created a
    # line of reflected light, which gave Baez the idea to use two crossed
    # cylindrical mirrors to focus X-rays to a single point. This led to the
    # development of the Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray microscope.
