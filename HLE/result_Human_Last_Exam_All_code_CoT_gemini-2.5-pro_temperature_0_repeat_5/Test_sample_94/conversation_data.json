    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the physicist:\n\n1.  I will analyze the key phrases in your question: \"physicist,\" \"microscopy field,\" \"optical effect,\" and the very specific anecdote about a \"custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n2.  The anecdote is the most unique clue. I will use it to pinpoint the specific discovery and the scientist involved.\n3.  The story describes the inspiration for the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, which is used in X-ray microscopy.\n4.  The physicist associated with this story is Albert Baez.\n5.  I will then create a Python script to print his name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the physicist\n    based on the provided historical anecdote.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The physicist in question is Albert Baez. The story is that while he was\n    # working on X-ray optics, he was inspired by a janitor cleaning a long,\n    # cylindrical piece of equipment. The janitor's cleaning motion created a\n    # line of reflected light, which gave Baez the idea to use two crossed\n    # cylindrical mirrors to focus X-rays to a single point. This led to the\n    # development of the Kirkpatrick-Baez X-ray microscope.\n    physicist_name = \"Albert Baez\"\n    print(f\"The physicist better known for work in the microscopy field who discovered an optical effect after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker is: {physicist_name}\")\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Albert Baez>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
