    print("The problem asks for the minimal ordinal delta for which there exists a 'tower' of uncountable subsets of omega_1.")
    print("Let's analyze the definition of the tower <x_alpha : alpha in delta>:")
    print("1. Each x_alpha is an uncountable subset of omega_1.")
    print("2. For alpha < beta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable. This means x_beta is an 'almost subset' of x_alpha (written x_beta <=* x_alpha). This forms a decreasing chain.")
    print("3. There is no single uncountable set y that is an 'almost subset' of all x_alpha in the tower. This means the tower has no lower bound (or 'pseudo-intersection').")
    print("The minimal length delta of such a tower is a cardinal number known as the tower number for omega_1, denoted t(omega_1).\n")

    print("### Step 1: Proving the lower bound (delta >= omega_2) ###")
    print("We will show that any tower of length omega_1 (or less) must have a pseudo-intersection. This implies that an unbounded tower must be longer than omega_1.")
    print("Let <x_alpha : alpha < omega_1> be a tower satisfying conditions 1 and 2.")
    print("We will construct an uncountable set y such that y <=* x_alpha for all alpha < omega_1.")
    print("The construction of y = {eta_beta : beta < omega_1} proceeds by transfinite recursion on beta < omega_1:")

    print("  a) eta_beta is greater than all previously chosen elements {eta_gamma : gamma < beta}.")
    print("  b) eta_beta belongs to the intersection of all x_alpha for alpha <= beta.")
    
    print("\nLet's justify this construction:")
    print("At step beta, let S_beta = sup{eta_gamma : gamma < beta}. Since beta is a countable ordinal, S_beta is a supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals, so S_beta < omega_1.")
    print("Let X_beta = intersection_{alpha <= beta} x_alpha.")
    print("For any alpha <= beta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable. The set x_beta \\ X_beta is the union of {x_beta \\ x_alpha} for alpha <= beta. This is a countable union of countable sets, so it is countable.")
    print("Since x_beta is uncountable, X_beta (which is x_beta minus a countable set) must also be uncountable.")
    print("Because X_beta is uncountable, it cannot be contained in the countable initial segment [0, S_beta]. Thus, we can always choose eta_beta from X_beta such that eta_beta > S_beta.")
    print("This completes the recursive construction of the sequence <eta_beta>.\n")

    print("Now, let's verify that y = {eta_beta : beta < omega_1} is a pseudo-intersection:")
    print("The set y is uncountable because it is the range of a strictly increasing sequence of length omega_1.")
    print("Fix an alpha < omega_1. We need to show that |y \\ x_alpha| is countable.")
    print("Consider an element eta_beta in y. By construction, if beta >= alpha, then eta_beta was chosen from X_beta, which is a subset of x_alpha. So, eta_beta is in x_alpha.")
    print("This means that if eta_beta is NOT in x_alpha, it must be the case that beta < alpha.")
    print("Therefore, the set y \\ x_alpha is a subset of {eta_beta : beta < alpha}.")
    print("The set {eta_beta : beta < alpha} has cardinality |alpha|, which is countable because alpha < omega_1.")
    print("So, |y \\ x_alpha| is countable for all alpha < omega_1. This means y is a pseudo-intersection.\n")
    
    print("This proves that any tower of length omega_1 has a pseudo-intersection. Therefore, an unbounded tower must have a length delta > omega_1.")
    print("Since delta is a cardinal, the minimal possible value for delta must be at least omega_2.\n")

    print("### Step 2: The upper bound and the final answer ###")
    print("It is a theorem in ZFC (standard set theory) that a tower of length omega_2 without a pseudo-intersection does exist. The construction is more advanced and relies on building a 'dominating family' of functions from omega_1 to omega_1.")
    print("This existence theorem shows that the minimal length delta is at most omega_2.")
    print("Combining the lower bound (delta >= omega_2) and the upper bound (delta <= omega_2), we find the minimal possible value for delta.\n")

    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("The minimal possible value for delta is omega_2.")
    # The prompt asks to output numbers in an equation. As there is no equation,
    # I will print the final answer in a clear format.
