    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we'll establish an upper bound for the chromatic number of any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices.\n2.  Next, we'll show that this upper bound is achievable by constructing a specific non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires this number of colors.\n3.  Finally, we'll apply this result to the given number of vertices, $n=12345$, and write a Python script to compute the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Upper Bound**\n\nA proper vertex coloring requires that any two adjacent vertices have different colors. In a complete graph $K_n$, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, so we need $n$ distinct colors. Thus, $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n\nThe problem states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color in a proper coloring.\n\nWe can devise a coloring strategy based on this:\n- Assign color 1 to both vertex $u$ and vertex $v$.\n- For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, we can assign each a new, unique color.\n\nThis strategy uses a total of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors. This demonstrates that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. Therefore, we have the upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n**Step 2: Showing the Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that $n-1$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to find a non-complete graph that actually requires $n-1$ colors.\n\nConsider the graph $G'$ created by taking the complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge $(u, v)$.\n- This graph $G'$ is not complete by definition.\n- In this graph $G'$, consider the set of $n-1$ vertices consisting of vertex $u$ and all other vertices except $v$. These $n-1$ vertices are all mutually adjacent, forming a clique of size $n-1$.\n- A clique of size $k$ is a subgraph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Coloring a clique of size $k$ requires at least $k$ different colors.\n- Since our graph $G'$ contains a clique of size $n-1$, it must require at least $n-1$ colors for a proper coloring. So, $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion and Calculation**\n\nFrom Step 1, we know that for any non-complete graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. From Step 2, we know there exists a non-complete graph $G'$ for which $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$.\nCombining these, we conclude that the maximum number of colors required for a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices is exactly $n-1$.\n\nFor this problem, the number of vertices is $n = 12345$. The maximum number of colors is $n - 1$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # If a graph on n vertices is not complete, it means there is at least one pair of\n    # non-adjacent vertices. These two vertices can be given the same color.\n    # The remaining n-2 vertices can be colored with n-2 other distinct colors in the worst case.\n    # This gives an upper bound of n-1 colors.\n    # To show this is the maximum, consider a complete graph Kn with one edge removed.\n    # This graph is not complete, but it still contains a clique of size n-1,\n    # which requires n-1 colors.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    # Print the equation as requested\n    print(f\"The maximum number of colors is given by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
