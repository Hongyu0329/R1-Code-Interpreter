    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor N**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ where $p^a$ are the prime power factors of $N$. A character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive. First, we find the prime factorization of $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n    The conductors of the component characters are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Order of the Character**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We need this lcm to be $6$. This implies two conditions:\n    a. The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of $6$.\n    b. The set of orders of all components must contain a multiple of $2$ and a multiple of $3$.\n\n3.  **Count Valid Component Characters**: For each prime power factor $p^a$, we count the number of primitive characters whose order divides $6$.\n    *   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters mod 4 is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is $2$. Since $2|6$, there is **1** choice.\n    *   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters mod 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The primitive characters are those that are not characters mod 3. Their orders are $3$ and $6$. Both divide $6$. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$. So there are **4** choices.\n    *   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters mod 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. The primitive characters are all non-trivial ones, with orders $2, 3, 6$. All these orders divide $6$. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So there are **5** choices.\n    *   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters mod 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The primitive characters have orders $2, 5, 10$. Only order $2$ divides $6$. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) = 1$. So there is **1** choice.\n    *   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters mod 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The primitive characters have orders $2, 3, 4, 6, 12$. Those whose orders divide $6$ are orders $2, 3, 6$. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So there are **5** choices.\n\n4.  **Combine and Verify**: We multiply the number of choices for each component to get the total number of combinations: $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n    Now, we must verify that every character constructed this way has an order of exactly $6$.\n    *   The component for conductor 4 must have order $2$. Thus, the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of $2$.\n    *   The component for conductor 9 must have order $3$ or $6$. Thus, the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of $3$.\n    *   Therefore, the final order is a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\n    *   Since the order of every component was chosen to be a divisor of $6$, their lcm must also divide $6$.\n    *   Combining these, the order must be exactly $6$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of valid combinations we found.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef count_order_in_cyclic(d, m):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of elements of order d in a cyclic group of order m.\"\"\"\n    if m % d == 0:\n        return phi(d)\n    return 0\n\ndef get_primitive_char_counts_by_order(p, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive characters for conductor p^a, grouped by order.\n    Returns a dictionary {order: count}.\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = {}\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: return {}\n        if a == 2: return {2: 1} # Primitive char mod 4 has order 2\n        # For a >= 3, group is C2 x C_{2^(a-2)}, imprimitive is C2 x C_{2^(a-3)}\n        # This is more complex, but not needed for N=36036\n        return {} \n    else: # p is odd\n        group_order = phi(p**a)\n        if a == 1:\n            # All non-trivial characters are primitive\n            for d in range(2, group_order + 1):\n                if group_order % d == 0:\n                    counts[d] = phi(d)\n        else: # a > 1\n            imprimitive_group_order = phi(p**(a-1))\n            # Iterate through all possible orders d in the full group\n            for d in range(2, group_order + 1):\n                if group_order % d == 0:\n                    num_total = phi(d)\n                    num_imprimitive = count_order_in_cyclic(d, imprimitive_group_order)\n                    num_primitive = num_total - num_imprimitive\n                    if num_primitive > 0:\n                        counts[d] = num_primitive\n    return counts\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    target_order = 6\n    \n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {target_order}.\")\n    print(\"A primitive character chi mod N can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters chi_{p^a} for each prime power p^a in the factorization of N.\")\n    print(\"The order of chi is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components chi_{p^a}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factor N\n    factors = {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 1, 11: 1, 13: 1} # N = 4 * 9 * 7 * 11 * 13\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The prime power factorization of N is N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1 * 11^1 * 13^1.\")\n\n    # Step 2: For each component, find the number of primitive characters whose order divides the target order.\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: For a character to have order {target_order}, the order of each of its components must divide {target_order}.\")\n    print(\"We count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6.\")\n\n    component_counts = {}\n    \n    # Analysis for each factor\n    for p, a in sorted(factors.items()):\n        pa = p**a\n        prim_chars = get_primitive_char_counts_by_order(p, a)\n        count_pa = sum(c for d, c in prim_chars.items() if target_order % d == 0)\n        component_counts[pa] = count_pa\n        \n        valid_orders = [d for d in prim_chars if target_order % d == 0]\n        print(f\"For conductor {pa}, primitive characters with orders dividing 6 are: {valid_orders}.
