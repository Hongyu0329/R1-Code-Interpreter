    print("    - Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. The hypercomputer cannot compute Ω.")

    # Step 3: Determining the nature of Omega and its relation to set S
    print("\nStep 3: Concluding the Nature of Ω and its Membership in S")
    print("  - From our analysis, the only logical conclusion is that the hypercomputer cannot compute Ω.")
    print("  - Therefore, Ω is a non-computable number (relative to this hypercomputer).")
    print("  - The set S contains numbers computable by a *standard Turing machine*, which is less powerful than the hypercomputer.")

    print("  - The hypercomputer is trapped. To determine if Ω is in S, it must first determine if Ω is computable.")
    print("  - However, its own process of determination is what Ω's definition is about.")
    print("  - It cannot arrive at the conclusion 'I cannot compute Ω' because that conclusion itself would be a definitive (and paradoxical) computation about Ω.")
    print("  - This is a direct parallel to Gödel's incompleteness: a formal system cannot prove certain true statements about its own limitations.")
    print("  - The hypercomputer cannot resolve this self-referential paradox, so it halts without a definitive answer.")

    # Step 5: Evaluating the options based on the analysis
    print("\nStep 5: Matching Our Conclusion to the Answer Choices")
    print("  - Our analysis shows: Ω is a non-computable number, it is outside the set S, and the hypercomputer's failure is due to an unresolvable self-referential paradox.")
    print("  - This reasoning directly supports choice A.")
