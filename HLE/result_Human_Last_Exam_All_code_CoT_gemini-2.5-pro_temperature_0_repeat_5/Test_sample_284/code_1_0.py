    Calculates the critical exponent for the Fourier restriction problem on the moment curve in R^3.

    The problem asks for the largest possible value of p such that no non-zero L^p function
    on R^3 can have its Fourier support on the moment curve {(t, t^2, t^3): 0 <= t <= 1}.

    This is a known result in harmonic analysis. The property holds for p > p_c and fails for p <= p_c,
    where p_c is the critical exponent. The formula for p_c for the moment curve in R^n is:
    p_c = n * (n + 1) / 2.

    The question is interpreted as asking for this critical value p_c.
