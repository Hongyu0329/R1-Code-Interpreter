    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The problem asks about the semidihedral group of size 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted as $SD_{2^n}$. Since the size is 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of the group. So, the task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Group Structure:** The group $SD_{2^n}$ consists of two main parts:\n    *   A maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1}$. For $n=9$, this is a cyclic group of order 256.\n    *   A coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$, containing the other half of the elements.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** I will count the cyclic subgroups in each part separately.\n    *   **Subgroups in $\\langle r \\rangle$:** A cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup for each divisor of $m$. The order of $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $2^{n-1} = 256$. The number of divisors of $2^8$ is $8+1=9$. So, there are $n=9$ cyclic subgroups entirely within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    *   **Subgroups generated by elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$:** We need to find the orders of elements of the form $sr^i$ and count how many distinct cyclic subgroups they generate.\n        *   Elements where $i$ is even ($sr^{2k}$) all have order 2. There are $2^{n-2} = 2^7 = 128$ such elements, and each generates a unique subgroup.\n        *   Elements where $i$ is odd ($sr^{2k+1}$) all have order 4. There are $2^{n-2} = 128$ such elements. The number of distinct cyclic subgroups they generate is the number of elements divided by $\\phi(4)$, which is $128 / 2 = 64$.\n\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** The cyclic subgroups generated by elements from the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$ are distinct from those within $\\langle r \\rangle$ (except for the trivial subgroup, which is already accounted for). Therefore, the total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from each part.\n\nBased on this plan, I will now provide the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_semidihedral_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n for the given group size.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # A \"power subgroup\" is a cyclic subgroup.\n    # The formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in SD_{2^n} is n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3).\n\n    # 1.
