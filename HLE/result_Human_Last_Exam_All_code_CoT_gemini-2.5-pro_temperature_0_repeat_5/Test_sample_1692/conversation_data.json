    "To solve this problem, we need to find the single elementary cellular automaton rule that governs the evolution of the given sequences. An elementary cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each being either 0 or 1. The state of a cell in the next step is determined by its current state and the state of its two neighbors (left and right). A \"rule\" defines the output (0 or 1) for each of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods. These rules are numbered from 0 to 255.\n\nOur plan is to systematically check every possible rule from 0 to 255. For each rule, we will perform a two-step simulation:\n1.  Apply the rule to the initial state (`01101001`) to generate a candidate for the intermediate state (`????????`). We will assume periodic boundary conditions, where the grid wraps around.\n2.  Apply the same rule to this new intermediate state to generate a final state.\n3.  Compare this calculated final state with the given final state (`10000111`).\n\nIf the states match, we have found the correct rule. Since the problem guarantees a unique solution, we will find exactly one rule that works. The intermediate state generated by this rule is our answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    gen_t0 = \"01101001\"\n    gen_t2 = \"10000111\"\n    n = len(gen_t0)\n    \n    solution_found = None\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # Get the 8-bit binary representation of the rule\n        # This string maps neighborhoods '111', '110', ..., '000' to their output\n        rule_binary = format(rule_num, '08b')\n        rule_map = {\n            '111': rule_binary[0], '110': rule_binary[1], '101': rule_binary[2],\n            '100': rule_binary[3], '011': rule_binary[4], '010': rule_binary[5],\n            '001': rule_binary[6], '000': rule_binary[7]\n        }\n\n        # --- Step 1: Evolve from gen_t0 to gen_t1 ---\n        gen_t1 = \"\"\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighborhood with periodic (wrap-around) boundaries\n            left = gen_t0[i - 1]\n            center = gen_t0[i]\n            right = gen_t0[(i + 1) % n]\n            neighborhood = left + center + right\n            gen_t1 += rule_map[neighborhood]\n\n        # --- Step 2: Evolve from gen_t1 to a calculated gen_t2 ---\n        calculated_gen_t2 = \"\"\n        for i in range(n):\n            left = gen_t1[i - 1]\n            center = gen_t1[i]\n            right = gen_t1[(i + 1) % n]\n            neighborhood = left + center + right\n            calculated_gen_t2 += rule_map[neighborhood]\n\n        # --- Step 3: Check if the calculated final state matches the given one ---\n        if calculated_gen_t2 == gen_t2:\n            solution_found = gen_t1\n            break\n    \n    # The problem guarantees a unique solution is found\n    if solution_found:\n        print(solution_found)\n\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n```\n<<<00001111>>>"
