    # Question 2: What is the expected value of X_20?

    # an even number, so it can never become 0. The game never ends.

    # Question 3: In general, for odd n>1 what is the expected value of X_n?

    # Question 4: For odd n>30 what is the expected number of times that between
    # the two gifts there are exactly 10 and n-12 friends.
    # This corresponds to a distance of 11 or n-11. The walk is on even integers,
    # so only n-11 is reachable. The formula for the expected number of visits is:
    expected_visits_formula = "4*(n-11)/(n+1)"

    # Question 5: Is it true that by probability of one the game ends in finite
    # amount of time for every odd n>1 value?
    # Yes, for odd n, the random walk of the distance is on a finite, connected
    # state space, so the absorbing state 0 is always reached.
