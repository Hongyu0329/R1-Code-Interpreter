# Step 1: Decipher the clues to find the three cities.
# Clue 1: Irving Wallace's "The Miracle" is set in Lourdes, France, where the apparitions of a "lady in white" (Our Lady of Lourdes) occurred.
city1 = "Lourdes"

# Clue 2: The poem by Yuri Krasnokutsky refers to the Neva River ("a cold stream") as being in the "blood" of the poet. The Neva River is the main river of St. Petersburg.
city2 = "St. Petersburg"

# Clue 3: The "Dolac" market is in Zagreb and is nicknamed "The Belly of Zagreb". This is an allusion to Ã‰mile Zola's novel "Le Ventre de Paris" ("The Belly of Paris"), which describes the central market Les Halles. Therefore, the main analogue was in Paris.
city3 = "Paris"

# Step 2: Format the cities into the required trilogy format and print the result.
print(f"{{{city1}, {city2}, {city3}}}")
