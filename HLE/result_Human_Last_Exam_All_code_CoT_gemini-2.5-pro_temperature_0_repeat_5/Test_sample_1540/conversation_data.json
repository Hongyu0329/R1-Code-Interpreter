  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nLittle Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.\n\nInput\nEach of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput\nIf the first string is less than the second one, print \"-1\". If the second string is less than the first one, print \"1\". If the strings are equal, print \"0\". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the strings are compared.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem and determine the memory usage for an efficient C program.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  First, I will provide a Python script that correctly solves the string comparison problem as per the contest rules. This script will be simple and directly implement the required logic.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the requirements for the most memory-efficient C program to solve the same problem.\n3.  I will identify the necessary variables for such a C program: two character arrays to store the input strings and a loop counter.\n4.  I will calculate the memory required for each variable in bytes, assuming a standard system architecture (where a `char` is 1 byte and an `int` is 4 bytes).\n5.  Finally, I will sum these values to find the total memory `m` and provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the two strings from input\n        s1 = input()\n        s2 = input()\n\n        # Convert both strings to the same case (e.g., lowercase)\n        # for case-insensitive comparison.\n        s1_lower = s1.lower()\n        s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n        # Perform the lexicographical comparison\n        if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n\n    except EOFError:\n        # Handle case where there is no input\n        pass\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nNow, for the analysis of the most memory-efficient C program:\n\nTo solve this problem in C with maximum memory efficiency, we need to declare variables to store the input and process it. The unavoidable memory cost comes from storing the two strings.\n\n1.  **String Storage**: The problem states the maximum string length is 100. In C, a string (character array) needs an extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   `char s1[101];` -> This allocates 101 bytes (101 characters * 1 byte/char).\n    *   `char s2[101];` -> This also allocates 101 bytes.\n\n2.  **Processing Variable**: We need to iterate through the strings to compare them character by character. A simple integer variable is the most efficient way to do this.\n    *   `int i;` -> On virtually all modern competitive programming platforms (32-bit or 64-bit), an `int` occupies 4 bytes.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables is the sum of the memory for each declared variable.\n\nm = (memory for s1) + (memory for s2) + (memory for i)\nm = 101 bytes + 101 bytes + 4 bytes\nm = 206 bytes\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required for variables in a standard, portable C program that solves this problem.\n\n<<<206>>>"
