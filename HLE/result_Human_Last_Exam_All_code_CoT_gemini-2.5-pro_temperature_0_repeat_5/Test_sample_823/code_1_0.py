    print("--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---\n")

    # --- Option A ---
    print("A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k.")
    print("Analysis: This is false. Consider the class of all k-by-k grids. This class has bounded degree (4) and unbounded treewidth (the treewidth of a k-by-k grid is k). However, the longest induced cycle in any grid has length 4. Therefore, this class does not contain arbitrarily long induced cycles.\n")

    # --- Option B ---
    print("B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph.")
    print("Analysis: This is true. A significant result in graph theory states that a class of graphs with bounded maximum degree has unbounded treewidth if and only if it contains arbitrarily large grid subgraphs. Since C has both bounded degree and unbounded treewidth, it must contain k-by-k grids as subgraphs for any k.\n")

    # --- Option C ---
    print("C. C is a family of expander graphs.")
    print("Analysis: This is false. Expander graphs do have unbounded treewidth, but not all graphs with unbounded treewidth are expanders. The class of k-by-k grids is again a counterexample. Grids have poor expansion properties, as a separator cutting the grid in half has a size proportional to sqrt(n), not n, where n is the number of vertices.\n")

    # --- Option D ---
    print("D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k.")
    print("Analysis: This is likely false. While many graphs with large treewidth do have large induced matchings, there is no theorem stating this must always be the case. For instance, a complete graph K_n has unbounded treewidth but its induced matching number is 1. While K_n does not have bounded degree, this shows that large treewidth alone doesn't guarantee large induced matchings. There is no established theorem that adding the bounded degree constraint forces this property.\n")

    # --- Option E ---
    print("E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size.")
    print("Analysis: This is true. A fundamental result of the Robertson-Seymour graph minor theory is that a class of graphs has unbounded treewidth if and only if it contains clique-minors of unbounded size. This follows from the fact that a graph with a sufficiently large treewidth is guaranteed to contain a large clique minor. This property holds for any graph, regardless of its degree.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both options B and E are true statements that follow from the premises.")
    print("However, there is a key distinction:")
    print("- Statement E follows from the 'unbounded treewidth' premise alone.")
    print("- Statement B requires both the 'unbounded treewidth' and the 'bounded degree' premises. Without the bounded degree constraint, a class of graphs with unbounded treewidth (e.g., complete graphs) does not necessarily contain large grid subgraphs.")
    print("\nSince the problem explicitly includes the bounded degree constraint, it is intended to be used. The conclusion that uniquely depends on all given premises is the most likely intended answer.")
    print("Therefore, B is the best answer as it synthesizes all the information given about the class C.")
