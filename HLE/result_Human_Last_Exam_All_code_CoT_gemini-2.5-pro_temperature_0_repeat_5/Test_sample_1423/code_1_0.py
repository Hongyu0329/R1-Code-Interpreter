    # The problem states N uses at most 5 distinct digits.
    # Let k be the number of distinct digits, so 1 <= k <= 5.
    # Let h(k) be the maximum possible length of a valid number N using k distinct digits.
    # The condition is that any substring of N must have at least one digit that appears exactly once.
    
    # A string is invalid if it contains a substring where every digit appears at least twice.
    # For example, with k=2 (digits '1', '2'), the string '1212' is invalid because in '1212',
    # both '1' and '2' appear twice.
    
    # The maximum length h(k) follows the formula: h(k) = 2^k - 1.
    # This is a known result from combinatorics on words.
    # For example:
    # h(1) = 2^1 - 1 = 1. (e.g., "1")
    # h(2) = 2^2 - 1 = 3. (e.g., "121")
    # h(3) = 2^3 - 1 = 7. (e.g., "1213121")
    
    # We need to find the maximum possible number of digits, given that N can use
    # at most 5 distinct digits. This means we want to find the maximum value of h(k)
    # for k in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
    
    # The function h(k) = 2^k - 1 is an increasing function of k.
    # Therefore, the maximum value will occur at the largest possible k, which is 5.
    
    k = 5
