# Plan:
# 1. Store the letters of the statements identified as correct in a list.
# 2. Sort the list to ensure lexicographical order.
# 3. To satisfy the instruction "output each number in the final equation",
#    the code will format the output as a comma-separated string, treating
#    each letter as an element of the final answer set.
# 4. Print the final formatted string.
