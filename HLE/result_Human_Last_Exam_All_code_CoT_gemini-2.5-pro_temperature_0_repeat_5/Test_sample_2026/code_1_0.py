# This script calculates the area of the surface of initial values (x₀, y₀, z₀)
# for which the given nonlinear boundary value problem has a solution.

# From the problem statement, we are given the condition:
# α + β + γ = 10^25 * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
# Let's define the constant C = 10^25.
C = 10**25

# Through perturbation analysis, we derived the relationship for the initial values:
# 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) = C
# This simplifies to the equation of a sphere: x₀² + y₀² + z₀² = C / 2.
# The radius squared (R²) of this sphere is C / 2.
radius_squared = C / 2

# The final equation for the initial values is x₀² + y₀² + z₀² = R²
coeff_x_sq = 1
coeff_y_sq = 1
coeff_z_sq = 1
rhs = radius_squared

print("The relationship between the initial values x₀, y₀, z₀ is given by the equation of a sphere:")
# We print the equation with its numerical components.
print(f"{coeff_x_sq}*x₀² + {coeff_y_sq}*y₀² + {coeff_z_sq}*z₀² = {rhs:.1e}")

print("\nThe numbers in the final equation are:")
print(f"Coefficient of x₀²: {coeff_x_sq}")
print(f"Coefficient of y₀²: {coeff_y_sq}")
print(f"Coefficient of z₀²: {coeff_z_sq}")
print(f"Right-hand side (R²): {rhs:.1e}")

# The area of this spherical surface is given by the formula A = 4 * π * R².
surface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius_squared

print(f"\nThe area of this surface is 4 * π * R².")
print(f"Area = {surface_area:.4e}")

# Final answer to be provided in the specified format.
# The calculated area is 4 * pi * (5 * 10^24) = 20 * pi * 10^24 = 2 * pi * 10^25
# which is approximately 6.2832e+25.
