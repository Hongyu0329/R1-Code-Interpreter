    Analyzes the statements about the junction tree algorithm and prints the letters of the true statements.
    
    - A: False. Approximate inference is more efficient for high treewidth graphs.
    - B: False. The algorithm is sensitive, not resilient, to high treewidth.
    - C: True. The nodes of a junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm works with their joint distributions (potentials).
    - D: False. The premise of resilience to high treewidth is incorrect.
    - E: True. High treewidth leads to large cliques, making the algorithm's exponential complexity a practical barrier.
    - F: False. Same as D.
    - G: True. The need to handle joint distributions over large cliques (a consequence of high treewidth) is the reason for the algorithm's lack of resilience.
    - H: False. The complexity is exponential, not linear, with respect to the number of variables in the largest clique.
    - I: True. Efficiency diminishes exponentially as the size of the largest clique grows linearly.
    - J: False. Efficiency is heavily dependent on the size of the largest clique.
    - L: False. The running intersection property applies to any two cliques, not just cases with three or more. This is an incomplete description.
