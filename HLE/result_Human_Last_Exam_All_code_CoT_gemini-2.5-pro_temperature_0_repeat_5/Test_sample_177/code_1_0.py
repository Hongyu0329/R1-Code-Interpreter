The goal is to make a T cell function like an Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC). The primary role of a professional APC is to process antigens from the environment (exogenous antigens) and present them to helper T cells.

Let's analyze the options based on this requirement:

1.  **MHC class II:** This is the molecular platform used by professional APCs to present processed exogenous antigens to CD4+ helper T cells. T cells do not normally express MHC class II. Engineering them to express this molecule would grant them the core function of an APC.

2.  **MHC class I:** This molecule is already present on T cells. It presents endogenous (internal) peptides, signaling to cytotoxic T cells if the cell is infected or cancerous. It does not fulfill the role of presenting external antigens.

3.  **CD80 / CD86:** These are co-stimulatory molecules. While essential for providing the 'second signal' to fully activate a T cell, they do not present the antigen itself (the 'first signal'). They are part of the APC machinery but are not the presenting receptor.

4.  **TIM-4:** This receptor is involved in clearing apoptotic cells and is not directly part of the antigen presentation pathway to T cells.

Conclusion: To enable a T cell to act as an APC, the most critical receptor to add is MHC class II.
