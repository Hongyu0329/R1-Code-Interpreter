# The problem asks for the number of internal adjunctions from [m] to [n].
# Here, m = 23 and n = 37.
m = 23
n = 37

# This is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps L: [m] -> [n]
# such that L(0) = 0.
# This reduces to a combinatorial problem of choosing m values for L(1), ..., L(m)
# from the set {0, 1, ..., n} with replacement, in non-decreasing order.
# The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m).

# The parameters for the binomial coefficient C(a, b) are:
a = n + m
b = m

# Calculate the result
result = math.comb(a, b)

# Print the explanation and the final result
