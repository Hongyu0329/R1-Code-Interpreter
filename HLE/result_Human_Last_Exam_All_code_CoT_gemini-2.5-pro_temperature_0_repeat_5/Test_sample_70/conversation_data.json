    "This problem requires us to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. The key is the assumption that \"values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\"\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Rank of a Flag**: I will interpret the rank of a flag's matrix representation based on its geometric pattern of colors. The rank is the number of linearly independent row patterns (or column patterns). A \"pattern\" is a unique sequence of colors across a row or column. For example, a flag with only horizontal stripes has a rank of 1, because all its columns have the same pattern of colors, making them linearly dependent.\n2.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark**: I will determine the rank of the Danish flag based on this definition. The flag has a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design creates two distinct types of row patterns:\n    *   Rows that are part of the horizontal white bar: `(White, White, White, ...)`\n    *   Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar, but are crossed by the vertical bar: `(Red, ..., White, ..., Red)`\n    These two patterns are linearly independent, meaning one cannot be created by multiplying the other by a scalar. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n3.  **Identify African Flags with Rank 2**: I will search for African flags whose designs are also composed of exactly two fundamental, linearly independent patterns. I will categorize them by their structure:\n    *   **Eliminate Rank 1 flags**: These are flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes and no other features (e.g., Nigeria, Egypt, Gabon).\n    *   **Eliminate Rank > 2 flags**: These are flags with complex patterns like diagonals (Namibia), multiple independent design elements, or complex hoist shapes (South Africa).\n    *   **Identify Rank 2 flags**: These typically fall into a few categories:\n        *   A solid-colored field with a single central emblem (e.g., Morocco).\n        *   A field of stripes (horizontal or vertical) with a single central emblem (e.g., Ghana, Algeria).\n        *   A design with a vertical bar at the hoist and horizontal stripes on the fly side (e.g., Benin).\n4.  **Generate the Code**: I will write a Python script to print the final list of countries whose flags have a rank of 2.\n\n```python\ndef find_rank_2_african_flags():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of African nations whose flags\n    have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The rank is determined by the number of linearly independent color patterns\n    in the flag's design.\n\n    - Denmark's flag rank is 2, based on its two patterns: (Red, White, Red) and (White, White, White).\n\n    The following flags are identified as having a rank of 2 based on their structure:\n    - Type A (Solid Field + Central Emblem): e.g., Morocco, Somalia.\n    - Type B (Stripes + Central Emblem): e.g., Ghana, Senegal, Angola.\n    - Type C (Hoist Bar + Horizontal Stripes): e.g., Benin, Madagascar.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The following flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank (2) as the flag of Denmark:\")\n\n    # List of countries whose flags have a rank of 2\n    countries = [\n        \"Algeria\",\n        \"Angola\",\n        \"Benin\",\n        \"Burkina Faso\",\n        \"Cameroon\",\n        \"Cape Verde\",\n        \"Ghana\",\n        \"Madagascar\",\n        \"Mauritania\",\n        \"Morocco\",\n        \"Senegal\",\n        \"Somalia\"\n    ]\n\n    # Print each country name from the list\n    for country in sorted(countries):\n        print(f\"- {country}\")\n\nfind_rank_2_african_flags()\n```\n<<<['Algeria', 'Angola', 'Benin', 'Burkina Faso', 'Cameroon', 'Cape Verde', 'Ghana', 'Madagascar', 'Mauritania', 'Morocco', 'Senegal', 'Somalia']>>>"
