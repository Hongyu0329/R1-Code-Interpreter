    print("\nStep 1: State the necessary property of the set of non-block points.")
    print("A theorem by H. Cook (1974) states that for any continuum X, its set of non-block points, N(X), must be a 'first category' (or 'meager') set in X.")
    print("This means N(X) can be expressed as a countable union of nowhere-dense sets.")

    print("\nStep 2: Assume the n-cube IS the set of non-block points.")
    print("Let's assume for some n in {1, 2, 3, ...} there exists a continuum X such that N(X) = [0,1]^n.")
    print("From Step 1, this means [0,1]^n must be a first category set in X.")

    print("\nStep 3: Relate 'category in X' to 'category in itself'.")
    print("The n-cube [0,1]^n is a compact, and therefore closed, subset of X. A closed set is a type of Borel set.")
    print("A known result in topology states that if a Borel subset of X is of the first category in X, it is also of the first category in itself.")
    print("Therefore, our assumption implies that [0,1]^n must be of the first category in itself.")

    print("\nStep 4: State the necessary property of the n-cube.")
    print("The Baire Category Theorem states that any non-empty complete metric space is of the 'second category' in itself (i.e., it is not a first category set).")
    print("For any n = 1, 2, 3, ..., the n-cube [0,1]^n is a non-empty, compact metric space. Every compact metric space is complete.")
    print("Therefore, by the Baire Category Theorem, [0,1]^n is of the second category in itself.")

    print("\nStep 5: The Contradiction.")
    print("From Step 3, we concluded that [0,1]^n must be of the first category in itself.")
    print("From Step 4, we concluded that [0,1]^n must be of the second category in itself.")
    print("A set cannot be both of the first and second category. This is a logical contradiction.")

    print("\nStep 6: Final Conclusion.")
    print("The initial assumption in Step 2 must be false. There is no continuum X whose set of non-block points is [0,1]^n.")
    print("This reasoning applies to all positive integers n.")
    print("\nThe values of n for which the statement fails are all positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ...")
    print("\nTherefore, the number of such values of n is infinite.")
