    This function calculates the number of topologically distinct compactifications
    of the ray with a specific remainder X, chosen to minimize this number.

    The number of such compactifications is the number of orbits of the set of
    non-empty, closed, connected subsets of X under the action of Homeo(X).

    as it is the simplest space satisfying the conditions:
    - Nondegenerate (2 points)
    - Locally-connected (points are open and connected)
    - Compact (finite)
    - Metric (discrete metric)
