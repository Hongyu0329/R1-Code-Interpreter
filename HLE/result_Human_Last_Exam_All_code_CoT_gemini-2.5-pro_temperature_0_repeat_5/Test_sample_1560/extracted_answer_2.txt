The final state is probabilistic, determined by the measurement on the first ququint. The system collapses into one of five possible states. The most likely outcome occurs with a probability of 3/10, where the measurement yields $|2\rangle_A$, and the system's final state is $|2\rangle_A \otimes (1/\sqrt{3}) * (|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
