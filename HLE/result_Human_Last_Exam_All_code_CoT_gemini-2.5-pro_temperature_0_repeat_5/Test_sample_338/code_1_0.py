def solve_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the logic puzzle by identifying 'Alice'.

    The puzzle's solution hinges on the blind person H's statement. H's confusion implies that there are at least two valid scenarios (configurations of hats) that would produce the observed K/DK/K/DK/K/DK/K sequence of answers. H knows the hat type (Color or Number) for everyone except Alice, which means that for 6 of the people, their hat type is the same across all valid scenarios, while for Alice, the hat type is different.

    The core logic revolves around two possible scenarios that H considers:
    Scenario 1: 4 Color hats, 3 Number hats.
    Scenario 2: 5 Color hats, 2 Number hats.

    Let's analyze the hat types in these two scenarios that would lead to the same K/DK sequence.
    The person whose hat type changes between these scenarios is Alice.

    - In both scenarios, the people who say "I know" (A, C, E, G) are deduced to be Color hat wearers.
    - In both scenarios, the people who say "I don't know" (B, F) are deduced to be Number hat wearers.
    - The ambiguity centers on person D.

    Scenario 1: 4 Color hats, 3 Number hats.
      - A, C, E, G are Colors.
      - B, F, D are Numbers.
      - In this case, D has a NUMBER hat.

    Scenario 2: 5 Color hats, 2 Number hats.
      - A, C, E, G, D are Colors.
      - B, F are Numbers.
      - In this case, D has a COLOR hat.

    H can deduce the hat types for A, B, C, E, F, G as they are consistent across both valid scenarios.
    - A, C, E, G are always Color.
    - B, F are always Number.

    However, H cannot determine D's hat type, as it could be a Number (in Scenario 1) or a Color (in Scenario 2).
    Therefore, D is Alice.
