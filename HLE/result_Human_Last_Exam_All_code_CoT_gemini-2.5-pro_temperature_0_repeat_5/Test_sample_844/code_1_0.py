    print("  - MA biotype (from cotton) prefers a sucrose-only diet.")

    print("2. Evaluating the answer choices:")

    # Statement A
    print("\n[A] CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA's preference for a raffinose-rich diet implies it has a superior ability to metabolize it compared to MA, which prefers a diet without raffinose.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")

    # Statement B
    print("\n[B] CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("  - Reasoning: This is stated almost verbatim in the text.")
    print("  - Verdict: TRUE.")

    # Statement C
    print("\n[C] Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA moves from watermelon (high raffinose) to cotton (low raffinose). Galactosidase metabolizes raffinose. Less substrate (raffinose) typically leads to lower enzyme activity.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")
    
    # Statement E
    print("\n[E] Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("  - Reasoning: MA moves from cotton (low raffinose) to watermelon (high raffinose). More substrate (raffinose) would likely induce higher enzyme activity (galactosidase).")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")

    # Statement D
    print("\n[D] Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: While the decrease in galactosidase activity is plausible (as in C), the reason given is 'higher glucose levels in cotton'. The text does not mention glucose levels in cotton, only that it's suitable for the sucrose-preferring aphid. The most direct cause for a change in galactosidase activity is the level of its substrate, raffinose, not glucose. The reason provided is not supported by the text.")
    print("  - Verdict: NOT TRUE, as the causal link is unsubstantiated.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Conclusion: Statement D provides a reason that is not supported by the information in the text.")
