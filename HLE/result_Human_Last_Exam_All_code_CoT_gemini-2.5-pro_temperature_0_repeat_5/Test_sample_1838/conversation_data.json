    "To find the central pixel of the line from (1, 1) to (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Generate all pixels:** First, I'll implement Bresenham's line algorithm to generate the complete list of integer coordinates (pixels) that form the line between the start and end points.\n2.  **Identify the list:** The algorithm will produce an ordered list of pixel coordinates, starting from (1, 1) and ending at (11, 5).\n3.  **Find the center:** Once the list of all pixels on the line is generated, I will find the total number of pixels. The central pixel is the one located at the middle index of this list (e.g., for a list of 11 pixels, the 6th pixel is the center).\n4.  **Output the coordinates:** Finally, the code will print the (x, y) coordinates of this central pixel.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # Store all pixels of the line\n    pixels = []\n\n    # Calculate deltas\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # Decision parameter, initialized for the first step\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    # The loop runs as long as x is less than or equal to the end x-coordinate\n    while x <= x2:\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n        if p < 0:\n            # Next point is (x+1, y)\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            # Next point is (x+1, y+1)\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n            y += 1\n        x += 1\n    \n    # The loop generates one extra point, so we remove it.\n    # A more common implementation would loop `dx` times.\n    # Let's adjust the loop to be more standard.\n    \n    # --- Corrected Bresenham's Implementation ---\n    pixels_corrected = []\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    # Add the starting point\n    pixels_corrected.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Loop dx times to generate the remaining points\n    for _ in range(dx):\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            y += 1\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n        pixels_corrected.append((x, y))\n\n    # Find the middle index\n    # For a list of N items, the middle index is N // 2\n    middle_index = len(pixels_corrected) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels_corrected[middle_index]\n\n    # Output the final result\n    print(f\"The central pixel is at coordinates: ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel()\n<<<(6, 3)>>>\n```"
