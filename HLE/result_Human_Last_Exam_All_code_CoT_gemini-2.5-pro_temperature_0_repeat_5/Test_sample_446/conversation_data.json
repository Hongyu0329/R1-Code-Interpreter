    "This is a knowledge-based question related to molecular biology. The RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) sequence is a famous motif recognized by integrin receptors. The binding affinity and specificity are heavily influenced by the amino acids flanking this core motif. I will write a Python script to explain the reasoning and identify the most likely candidate based on well-documented scientific findings.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Acknowledge that all provided peptides contain the core RGD binding motif.\n2.  Explain that the flanking sequences are critical for determining binding affinity and specificity to different integrin subtypes.\n3.  Identify the `RGDSP` sequence as a canonical, well-studied motif derived from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein that binds to integrins.\n4.  Scan the answer choices to find the peptide containing this well-known `RGDSP` sequence.\n5.  Conclude that the peptide containing the `RGDSP` motif is the one most famously found to bind integrins in in vitro assays.\n\n```python\ndef identify_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a list of RGD-containing peptides to determine\n    which is most likely to bind an integrin receptor based on known motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Peptides for Integrin Binding:\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\n    # Step 1: The core RGD motif\n    print(\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
