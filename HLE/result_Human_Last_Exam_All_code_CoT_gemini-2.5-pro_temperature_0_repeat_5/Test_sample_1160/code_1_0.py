    Problem Analysis:
    Let C_n = [0, 2n]^3 be a discrete cube and S = (n, 0, 0) be the starting point of a simple random walk on Z^3.
    We are looking for p_n, the probability that the walk escapes from C_n.
    "Escaping" is interpreted as hitting the boundary of C_n before returning to the starting point S.
    The escape probability p_n is related to the Green's function G_{C_n}(S, S) by the formula:
    p_n = 1 / (d * G_{C_n}(S, S))
    where d=6 is the number of neighbors in Z^3, and G_{C_n}(S, S) is the expected number of visits to S before the walk leaves C_n.

    Asymptotic Behavior of the Green's Function:
    The main task is to find how G_{C_n}(S, S) behaves as n -> infinity.
    The starting point S is on a face of the cube. For large n, the geometry resembles an infinite slab of thickness 2n.
    For a random walk starting on the boundary of a slab of thickness L, the Green's function at the starting point grows linearly with L.
    Therefore, G_{C_n}(S, S) is proportional to n for large n.
    G_{C_n}(S, S) ~ c * n for some constant c.

    Calculating the Limit:
    From the above, p_n is proportional to 1/n.
    p_n ~ C / n for some constant C.
    We need to compute the limit: L = lim_{n->inf} [ln(1/p_n) / ln(n)].
    Substituting p_n ~ C/n, we get:
    L = lim_{n->inf} [ln(n/C) / ln(n)]
    L = lim_{n->inf} [(ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n)]
    L = lim_{n->inf} [1 - ln(C)/ln(n)]
    As n -> infinity, ln(n) -> infinity, so ln(C)/ln(n) -> 0.
    The limit is 1.
