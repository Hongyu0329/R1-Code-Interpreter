        "III": "Correct. When taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone in Suboxone is not significantly absorbed. Therefore, the primary active ingredient in both is buprenorphine, leading to a similar therapeutic and safety profile.",

Suboxone is safer regarding the deterrence of intravenous misuse, while both are similarly safe when taken sublingually as prescribed. (Note: The phrase 'due to the lack of naloxone' is a clear typo and should be 'due to the presence of naloxone' to be logical)."
