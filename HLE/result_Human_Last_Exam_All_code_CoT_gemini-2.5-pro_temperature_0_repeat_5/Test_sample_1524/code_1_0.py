    print("For n(ε_0) to be large, its denominator, exp((ε_0 - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1, must approach zero.")
    print("This happens only when μ gets infinitesimally close to ε_0 from below.")
    print("Thus, at the critical temperature and in the condensed phase, the chemical potential is effectively 'pinned' to the ground state energy: μ ≈ ε_0.\n")

    print("Step 6: Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print("We need to find the choice that matches this conclusion. Let's analyze option C:")
    print("C. μ must be equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature.")
    print("The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0 is, by definition, the ground state energy ε_0.")
    print("Therefore, this statement is equivalent to saying μ = ε_0, which is the correct condition for the chemical potential during Bose-Einstein condensation.\n")
