    "To solve the initial value problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of ODE**: The equation $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ is a first-order ordinary differential equation. It is also a separable equation.\n2.  **Separate the variables**: We can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. We group all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other side:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n3.  **Integrate both sides**: We integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition**: We use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n5.  **Find the particular solution**: Now we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n6.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}\n    $$\n    Solving for $x(1)$, we get:\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define initial values\nt0, x0 = 0, -8\n# Define target time\nt1 = 1\n\n# The general solution after integration is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n# We find C using the initial condition x(0) = -8\n# -1/(-8) = 0^2/2 - 0 + C\nC = Fraction(-1, x0)\nprint(f\"The differential equation is x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t) with x(0) = {x0}.\")\nprint(\"After separating variables (dx/x^2 = (t-1)dt) and integrating, we get the general solution:\")\nprint(\"-1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing the initial condition x(0) = -8, we find the constant C:\")\nprint(f\"-1/({x0}) = ({t0}^2)/2 - {t0} + C\")\nprint(f\"C = {C}\")\n\n# The particular solution is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + 1/8\nprint(\"\\nSo, the particular solution is:\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(t) = t^2/2 - t + {C}\")\n\n# Now, we find x(1) by substituting t=1\nprint(\"\\nTo find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the equation:\")\n# -1/x(1) = 1^2/2 - 1 + 1/8\nterm1 = Fraction(t1**2, 2)\nterm2 = Fraction(-t1, 1)\nterm3 = C\nresult_rhs = term1 + term2 + term3\n\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = ({t1}^2)/2 - {t1} + {C}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {term1} + ({term2}) + {term3}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {result_rhs}\")\n\n# Solve for x(1)\nx1 = -1 / result_rhs\nprint(\"\\nFinally, we solve for x(1):\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = -1 / ({result_rhs})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {x1}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
