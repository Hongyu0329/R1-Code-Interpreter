    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name. He has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". This might be a confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\n\nSince the event you're asking about never occurred, there is no year to provide. I will provide a Python script to clarify this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Goodluck Jonathan's official full name.\n    full_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n\n    # The name in question.\n    other_name = \"Azikiwe\"\n\n    # Explanation based on public records.\n    explanation = (\n        f\"Based on public records, {full_name} has never publicly identified himself as '{other_name}'.\\n\"\n        f\"His middle name is 'Ebele', not 'Azikiwe'.\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\"\n    )\n\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Run the function to provide the answer.\ncheck_name_and_year()\n```\n<<<Based on public records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe'. Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
