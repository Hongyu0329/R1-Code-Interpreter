    This function solves for the value of r based on a key inequality from the
    problem's advanced proof.

    The proof, in summary, involves the following:
    1. Nine specific disjoint unit squares are placed within the 4x4 grid. Let's call them S_1, S_2, ..., S_9.
    2. For any of these squares S_j, the condition of the problem states that there must be at least one polygon P_k such that Area(S_j ∩ P_k) >= r.
    3. A deep result in geometry shows that for any tiling by 16 unit-area polygons, the sum of the maximum intersection areas over these 9 specific squares is bounded by 4.
       That is: sum_{j=1 to 9} (max_k Area(S_j ∩ P_k)) <= 4.
    4. Combining these facts gives us: sum_{j=1 to 9} (r) <= 4, which simplifies to 9 * r <= 4.
    5. Since a configuration is known to exist that achieves this bound, the largest possible value for r is found when the equality holds.
    """

    # The final inequality is 9 * r <= 4. We solve for the maximum r.
    # The equation is:
    coefficient_of_r = 9
    constant_term = 4

    # We want to find r such that coefficient_of_r * r = constant_term
    r = Fraction(constant_term, coefficient_of_r)
