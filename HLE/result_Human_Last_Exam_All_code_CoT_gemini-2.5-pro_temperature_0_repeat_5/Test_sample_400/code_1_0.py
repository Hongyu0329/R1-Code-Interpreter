# This script calculates the number of connected components for the given space.

# Step 1: Define the space.
# The space X is a union of line segments all meeting at the origin (0,0).
# - L: from (1, 0) to (0, 0)
# - L_n: from (1, 1/n) to (0, 0) for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

# Step 2: A point is removed.
# The origin (0, 0) is removed from the space. This is the only point
# where all the line segments were connected to each other.

# Step 3: Identify the new components.
# Removing the origin separates every segment from all the others.
# Each segment (without the origin) is now a distinct connected component.

# Step 4: Count the components.
# We count how many of these separate components there are.

# The component corresponding to the original segment L.
component_from_L = 1

# The components corresponding to the original segments L_n.
# There is one such component for each positive integer n (n=1, 2, 3, ...).
# The number of positive integers is countably infinite.

print("The problem asks for the number of connected components after removing the origin from the space X.")
print("The space X is a collection of line segments all joined at the origin.")
print("Removing the origin breaks the single point of connection.")
print("\nLet's count the resulting disconnected pieces:")
print(f"1. The segment L (from (1,0) to the origin) becomes one connected component.")
print(f"   - Number of components from L: {component_from_L}")
print("\n2. Each segment L_n (from (1, 1/n) to the origin) becomes a separate connected component.")
print("   - Since n can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), this results in a countably infinite number of components.")
print("\nTo find the total, we sum the number of components:")
print("Total Components = (Components from L) + (Components from all L_n)")
print(f"Total Components = {component_from_L} + Countably Infinite")
print("\nTherefore, the space has a countably infinite number of connected components.")
