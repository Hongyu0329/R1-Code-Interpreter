Step-by-step analysis of the options:

1.  **Statement A (Ming Dynasty):** This statement is correct. The Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) was a period when many aspects of Han Chinese culture were consolidated and formalized. The phoenix crown (凤冠) and ornate red robes became standard, high-status bridal wear, which was then emulated by other classes.

2.  **Statement B (Zhou Dynasty):** This statement is correct. In the early rituals of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC), as documented in classic texts, the bride's departure from her home was a solemn ceremony. Covering the face, often with a veil or by riding in a covered carriage, was part of the ritual to signify modesty and the transition.

3.  **Statement C (Tang and Song Dynasties):** This statement is INCORRECT. The key error is the mention of the 'folding fan' (折扇). Historical evidence shows that the folding fan was introduced to China from either Japan or Korea, likely during the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127), and it did not become popular until the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, it could not have been a custom for brides in the Tang Dynasty (618–907). While brides in the Tang and Song might have used a rigid, non-folding fan (团扇) to shield their face, the specific claim about folding fans is an anachronism.

4.  **Statement D (Post-Song Dynasty):** This statement is correct. The 'xiapei' (霞帔), a long, decorative stole, and the elaborate 'phoenix crown' (凤冠) were indeed key components of formal attire for women of rank in the Ming and Qing dynasties (which came after the Song). They were symbols of status and were prominently featured in wedding ceremonies.

5.  **Statement E (Qing Dynasty):** This statement is correct. During the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), Han Chinese women largely continued their own traditions for wedding attire. The described outfit—a red blouse, an outer red robe, a red skirt (often a 'horse-face skirt' or 马面裙), and embroidered shoes—is an accurate depiction of typical Han bridal wear from that period.

Conclusion: The statement that is historically inaccurate is C.
