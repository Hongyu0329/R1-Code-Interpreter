    # --- Statement 1 Analysis ---
    # The statement is: "There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured."
    # The problem text explicitly states that the phenotype has "no bearing on fitness"
    # and that "all genotypes have equal fitness". These are the definitions of
    # no natural selection.

    print("Verdict: MUST BE TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: The problem explicitly states that the trait has 'no bearing on fitness' and 'all genotypes have equal fitness'. This is the definition of an absence of selection.\n")

    # --- Statement 2 Analysis ---
    # The statement is: "Parents will not raise their offspring."
    # The problem states "discrete and non-overlapping generations". This is a common
    # modeling assumption meaning the parental generation reproduces and then is gone
    # before the offspring generation reproduces. It does not make any claims about
    # parental care (e.g., provisioning a nest, feeding young) before the parents die.
    # Therefore, we cannot be certain this statement is true.
    statement_2_is_true = False
    print("Analysis of Statement 2: 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
    print("Verdict: NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: 'Discrete and non-overlapping generations' is a model about reproductive timing. It does not preclude the possibility of parental care before the parental generation dies out.\n")

    # --- Statement 3 Analysis ---
    # The statement is: "The population will never speciate even in future generations."
    # The conditions given (no mutation, no selection, etc.) describe the population's
    # current state. The statement makes a claim about the indefinite future ("never").
    # The problem does not guarantee these conditions will hold forever. Future events,
    # such as the introduction of mutations or the formation of a geographic barrier,
    # could lead to speciation.
    statement_3_is_true = False
    print("Analysis of Statement 3: 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
    print("Verdict: NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: The conditions describe the population now, not for all of eternity. Future changes (e.g., mutations, environmental changes) could initiate speciation.\n")

    # --- Statement 4 Analysis ---
    # The statement is: "The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the
    # phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals."
    # Random mating across the entire region ensures that allele frequencies (the genetic
    # component) are uniform. However, the phenotype is a product of both genes and
    # environment (Vp = Vg + Ve). The broad-sense heritability is 0.7, meaning 30% of
    # the phenotypic variance is due to environmental factors. The problem does not
    # state that the environment is uniform. A systematic environmental difference
    # between the west and east (e.g., in nutrition or climate) could cause a
    # substantial difference in the average phenotype.
    statement_4_is_true = False
    print("Analysis of Statement 4: 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.'")
    print("Verdict: NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: While random mating homogenizes gene frequencies, the environment may differ between the west and east. Since 30% of phenotypic variance is environmental, a systematic environmental difference could create a substantial phenotypic difference between the two groups.\n")

    # Based on the analysis, only statement 1 must be true.
    # This corresponds to answer choice A.
