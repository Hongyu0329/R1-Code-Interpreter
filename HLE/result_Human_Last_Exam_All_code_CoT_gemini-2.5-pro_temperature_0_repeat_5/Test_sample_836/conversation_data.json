    "Of course, I can help with that. The question you're asking is about the terminology used in the field of nuclear reactor physics and noise analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the function:** The \"generalized pair correlation function\" in this context describes the correlation of neutron population fluctuations between two different points in space and time. Let's denote it as $C(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$.\n2.  **Define the transform:** The \"space-time, double Fourier transform\" converts this function from the space-time domain to the wavevector-frequency domain.\n3.  **Apply physical assumptions:** For a reactor in a steady state, the underlying stochastic process is assumed to be stationary and homogeneous. This means the correlation function only depends on the time difference, $\\tau = t_1 - t_2$, and the spatial separation, $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$.\n4.  **Identify the resulting function:** The Fourier transform of this correlation function is a measure of how the power of the neutron fluctuations is distributed over frequency and wavevector.\n5.  **State the common name:** In the nuclear criticality community, this transformed function is most commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. Because it originates from a correlation between two distinct points, the more specific term is the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this function and its mathematical definition for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef get_transform_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name for the space-time, double Fourier\n    transform of the generalized pair correlation function in nuclear criticality.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = \"Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)\"\n    \n    # The generalized pair correlation function C depends on two space-time points.\n    # C = C(r1, t1; r2, t2)\n    \n    # Under assumptions of stationarity and homogeneity, it depends on the difference:\n    # C = C(r1 - r2, t1 - t2) = C(r, tau)\n    \n    # The Fourier transform of C(r, tau) is the CPSD, often denoted S(k, w) or CPSD(k, w).\n    definition = \"S(k, w) = Integral[d(tau)] Integral[d(r)] C(r, tau) * exp[-i*(k.r - w*tau)]\"\n    \n    print(\"The common name for the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is:\")\n    print(f\"--- {name} ---\")\n    print(\"\\nIt is defined as the Fourier transform of the correlation function C(r, tau):\")\n    print(definition)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_transform_name()\n```\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density>>>"
