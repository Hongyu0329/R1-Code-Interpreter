    "My plan is to analyze each ballet step provided in the answer choices to determine if its standard execution results in the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n1.  **Define the criterion:** The core requirement is that the final leg position must be identical to the initial leg position. This includes not only the type of position (e.g., fifth position) but also which foot is in front.\n\n2.  **Analyze each step:**\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:** An entrechat is a jump where the feet cross rapidly in the air. The number indicates the number of crossings. Even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) start from fifth position and land back in the *same* fifth position. Odd-numbered entrechats land on one foot. Therefore, an entrechat six starts and ends in the identical position.\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a jump from a closed position to an open one and back. The term `changé` explicitly means \"changed,\" signifying that the feet switch places upon returning to the closed position. The ending position is different from the start.\n    *   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves a jump from one foot where the legs are brought together in the air to land on two feet in fifth position. A standard `assemblé dessus` (over) or `dessous` (under) will change which foot is in front. The ending position is different.\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding, connecting step. A `glissade derrière` (gliding to the back) almost always functions as a preparatory step for another move and involves a change of feet. The ending position is different.\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative jump. It typically starts from a position on two feet (like fifth) and ends with a landing on one foot. Since the number of supporting legs changes, the position is different.\n\n3.  **Formulate the code:** I will create a Python script that encapsulates this logic. It will use a dictionary to store the properties of each step, then iterate through them to find the one that meets the criterion, printing the analysis for each step along the way.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of classical ballet steps to determine which one\n    starts and ends in the same leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        \"A.
