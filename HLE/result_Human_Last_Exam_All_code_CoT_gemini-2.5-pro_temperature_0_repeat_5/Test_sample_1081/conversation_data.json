    "To find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group:** A fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields, due to Steinberg, states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is independent of the field size $q$ and is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Weyl Group:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n\n3.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result from the classification of finite reflection groups. The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ has been computed to be 112.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code below will encapsulate this reasoning. It will state the theorem, identify the specific value for $W(E_8)$, and print the final answer in the format of an equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n\n    The solution is based on a known theorem in algebraic group theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    # This is a known mathematical constant.\n    num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n    print(\"Let G be a reductive group of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\")\n    print(\"According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G\")\n    print(\"is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, W(E_8).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis number is a known constant from the theory of reflection groups.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori = Number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) = {num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_e8_tori_problem()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
