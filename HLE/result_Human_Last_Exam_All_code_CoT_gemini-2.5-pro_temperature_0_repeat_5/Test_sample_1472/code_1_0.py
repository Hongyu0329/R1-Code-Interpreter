    # Step 1: Analyze the molecular structure
    print("\nStep 1: Deconstruct the Molecule")
    print(" - Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print(" - Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)")
    print(" - Complex: [Cu(2,5-dithiahexane)2]. Two bidentate ligands coordinate to the copper center through their sulfur atoms.")
    print(" - Coordination Number: 4 (two sulfur atoms from each of the two ligands).")

    # Step 2: Determine the geometry
    print("\nStep 2: Determine the 3D Geometry")
    print(" - A 4-coordinate complex can be either tetrahedral or square planar.")
    print(" - The ligand forms a 6-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S) which is not planar; it adopts a puckered 'chair' conformation.")
    print(" - Regardless of whether the geometry is distorted tetrahedral (common for Cu(I)) or cis-square planar (common for Cu(II)), the overall structure will feature two identical, non-planar chelate rings.")

    # Step 3: Identify the symmetry elements
    print("\nStep 3: Identify Symmetry Elements")
    print("We will now systematically check for symmetry elements:")
    print(" - Identity (E): Always present in every molecule.")
    print(" - Principal Rotation Axis (Cn): There is a C2 axis that passes through the copper atom and interchanges the two identical ligands. A 180-degree rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged. This is the highest order rotation axis.")
    print(" - Perpendicular C2 Axes: There are no C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C2 axis. The puckered nature of the rings and the positions of the methyl groups prevent this.")
    print(" - Mirror Planes (σ): There are no mirror planes. A horizontal plane (σh) is ruled out because the rings are puckered above and below the coordination plane. Vertical planes (σv) are ruled out because of the chirality of the puckered rings.")
    print(" - Center of Inversion (i): There is no center of inversion.")
    print(" - Improper Rotation Axis (Sn): There is no S4 axis collinear with the C2 axis.")

    # Step 4: Assign the point group
    print("\nStep 4: Assign the Point Group")
    print(" - The molecule possesses only two symmetry elements:")
    print("   1. The identity element (E)")
    print("   2. A single two-fold rotation axis (C2)")
    print("\n - A collection of symmetry elements consisting of only E and C2 defines the C2 point group.")
    print("\nFinal Conclusion: The point group for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is C2.")
