    "To answer your question, I will write a Python script. The script will simulate a database lookup. I will define a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of an archimandrite and their years of service at the Pskov-Caves Monastery. The script will then iterate through this list to find who was in charge during the specified period (1730-1731).\n\n```python\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery\n    for a specific period by searching through a predefined list of data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data representing some of the archimandrites and their service years.\n    # Format: (Name, Start Year, End Year)\n    monastery_leaders = [\n        ('Korniliy', 1529, 1570),\n        ('Markell', 1727, 1731),\n        ('Veniamin', 1731, 1732),\n        ('Amvrosiy', 1740, 1744),\n        ('Innokentiy', 1850, 1868)\n    ]\n\n    # The period we are interested in.\n    start_year_query = 1730\n    end_year_query = 1731\n\n    print(f\"Searching for the archimandrite who served from {start_year_query} to {end_year_query}...\")\n\n    found_leader = None\n    for name, start_year, end_year in monastery_leaders:\n        # Check if the leader's tenure covers the entire query period.\n        # A leader is a match if their service started on or before the query start\n        # and ended on or after the query end.\n        if start_year <= start_year_query and end_year >= end_year_query:\n            found_leader = name\n            print(f\"\\nFound a match: {name}\")\n            print(f\"Service period: {start_year} - {end_year}\")\n            print(f\"This period includes the queried years: {start_year_query} - {end_year_query}\")\n            break\n\n    if not found_leader:\n        print(\"\\nNo archimandrite found in the dataset for the specified period.\")\n\nfind_archimandrite()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
