    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant, denoted as `c(f)`, for a quasi-homogeneous polynomial `f` with weights `(w_1, ..., w_n)` and degree `d` is given by the formula:\n    `c(f) = Σ(w_i) - 2d`\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if every monomial term has the same weighted degree. We will calculate the weighted degree for each term in the polynomial using the provided weights `(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n    *   `z₁⁸z₃`: 8 * 22 + 1 * 49 = 176 + 49 = 225\n    *   `z₁⁴z₂³z₃`: 4 * 22 + 3 * 29 + 1 * 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224\n    *   `z₁z₂⁷`: 1 * 22 + 7 * 29 = 22 + 203 = 225\n    *   `z₁z₂z₃z₄z₅`: 1 * 22 + 1 * 29 + 1 * 49 + 1 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 225\n    *   `z₂z₃⁴`: 1 * 29 + 4 * 49 = 29 + 196 = 225\n    *   `z₄³z₅`: 3 * 50 + 1 * 75 = 150 + 75 = 225\n    *   `z₅³`: 3 * 75 = 225\n\n    There appears to be a typo in the problem statement, as the second monomial has a weighted degree of 224, while all six other monomials have a degree of 225. For a Calabi-Yau link, the defining polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous. Therefore, we will proceed with the overwhelmingly likely degree of `d = 225`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights (Σwᵢ):** We will sum the given weights of the ambient space.\n    `Σwᵢ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75`\n\n4.  **Compute the Invariant:** We will substitute the sum of weights and the degree `d` into the formula to find the invariant `c(f)`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result in the required equation format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial is defined as:\n    # f = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3\n    # For a Calabi-Yau link, the polynomial must be quasi-homogeneous.\n    # Calculating the weighted degree of each monomial shows that 6 of 7 terms have degree 225,\n    # while one term (z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3) has degree 224.\n    # We assume this is a typo and the correct quasi-homogeneous degree is 225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant is c = sum(w_i) - 2*d\n    \n    # 1. Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # 2. Calculate the invariant\n    invariant = sum_of_weights - 2 * d\n\n    # 3.
