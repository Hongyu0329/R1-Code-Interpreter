The glycan has a composition of Hex(7)HexNAc(3)Fuc(1)NeuGc(1). This is an unusual structure that does not have a standard name in the Oxford nomenclature. The structure is likely a high-mannose (Man-7) glycan that has been modified with a core fucose (likely Î±1,6-linked), an additional N-acetylglucosamine, and a terminal N-glycolylneuraminic acid.
