        "Creative Work": "This is God's immediate, direct action without using pre-existing secondary causes or natural laws. It is how God creates 'ex nihilo' (out of nothing) or introduces something entirely new into the system.",
        "Providential Work": "This is God's mediate, indirect action through the system of secondary causes that we observe and describe as the 'laws of nature'.",
        "Application to the Virgin Birth": "The virgin birth is not a work of providence (which would violate biological laws) but a 'creative' act of the Holy Spirit. God did not suspend or alter the laws of reproduction; He bypassed them with a direct, creative act, similar to the initial creation.",
        "Application to the Fall": "The state of the world after the Fall reflects a change in its fundamental operating principles. The 'curse' on creation (Genesis 3, Romans 8) can be understood as an alteration of the original laws of nature established at creation. The world now operates under a different set of 'providential' laws than it did in its original, unfallen state."
