    explanation = """
The question is: Is there a smooth divergence-free and periodic initial data u_0
such that the solution u to the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation blows up in finite-time?

The definitive answer is NO.

This is a classical result in the theory of partial differential equations, proven in the 1930s by Jean Leray. For any smooth (or even just finite energy) initial data u_0, the 2D Navier-Stokes equations are guaranteed to have a unique global smooth solution. This means the solution exists for all time t >= 0 and remains smooth, so no blow-up can occur.

The key to proving this lies in the analysis of the vorticity, ω, of the flow. In 2D, the vorticity can be treated as a scalar field defined as ω = curl(u) = ∂_1 u_2 - ∂_2 u_1.

1. The Vorticity Equation:
   Taking the curl of the Navier-Stokes momentum equation yields the vorticity transport equation:
   ∂_t ω + u ⋅ ∇ω = Δω
   This equation describes how vorticity is advected by the flow (u ⋅ ∇ω) and diffused by viscosity (Δω). The pressure term and the non-linear term simplify significantly due to the incompressibility condition (∇⋅u=0).

2. The Energy Estimate:
   The crucial step is to show that the total amount of vorticity, measured by its L2 norm (the square root of the integral of ω^2 over the domain), cannot grow in time. We multiply the vorticity equation by ω and integrate over the torus T^2:
   ∫(ω * ∂_t ω) dx + ∫(ω * (u ⋅ ∇ω)) dx = ∫(ω * Δω) dx

   This simplifies to:
   (1/2) * d/dt ||ω(t)||_L2^2 + ∫(u ⋅ (ω∇ω)) dx = -||∇ω(t)||_L2^2

   The non-linear advection term ∫(u ⋅ (ω∇ω)) dx is equal to ∫(u ⋅ ∇(ω^2/2)) dx. Using integration by parts and the incompressibility condition ∇⋅u=0, this term is exactly zero.

3. The A Priori Bound:
   We are left with the inequality:
   d/dt ||ω(t)||_L2^2 = -2 * ||∇ω(t)||_L2^2 ≤ 0

   This shows that the L2 norm of the vorticity is a non-increasing function of time. Therefore, for all t > 0:
   ||ω(t)||_L2 ≤ ||ω_0||_L2
   where ω_0 is the initial vorticity.

4. Conclusion:
   This "a priori" bound on the vorticity is sufficient in 2D to control all other properties of the solution. Using Sobolev embedding theorems, this bound on the vorticity prevents the velocity field u from becoming singular. A standard "bootstrap" argument then shows that all higher derivatives of u also remain bounded for all time, guaranteeing that the solution remains smooth.

In contrast, for the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, the vorticity equation contains an additional "vortex stretching" term (ω ⋅ ∇u) which is not guaranteed to vanish and can potentially amplify the vorticity, leaving the possibility of a finite-time blow-up an open question.
