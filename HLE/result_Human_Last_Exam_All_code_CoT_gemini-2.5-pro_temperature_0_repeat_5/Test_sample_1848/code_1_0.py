    print(f"   This is equivalent to |a ∩ b| ≤ {aleph_3}.")
    print(f"We are given the specific condition from cardinal arithmetic: 2^{omega_3} = {omega_4} (or 2^{aleph_3} = {aleph_4}).")
    print("\nLet the cardinality of the collection A be |A|. We will find the maximum possible value for |A|.")
    
    print("\n--- Step 1: Finding the Upper Bound for |A| ---")
    print(f"We will prove that |A| ≤ {aleph_4} using a proof by contradiction and the Δ-system Lemma.")
    print(f"Assume for contradiction that |A| > {aleph_4}. For example, let's assume |A| = {aleph_5}.")
    print(f"So, we have a collection A = {{a_i | i < {omega_5}}} containing {aleph_5} subsets of {omega_4}, where each subset has size {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"The cardinal {aleph_4} is a regular cardinal.")
    print(f"The Δ-system Lemma (by Erdős and Rado) states that for any collection of {aleph_5} sets, each of size at most {aleph_4},")
    print(f"there exists a sub-collection A' ⊆ A of size {aleph_5} that forms a Δ-system.")
    print("This means there is a common 'root' set R such that for any two distinct sets a, b in A', their intersection is exactly R (a ∩ b = R).")
    print(f"From the problem's condition, for any distinct a, b in A', we must have |a ∩ b| < {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"Therefore, the root must be small: |R| < {aleph_4}, which implies |R| ≤ {aleph_3}.")
    print("\nNow, let's examine the sets in A'. For any a ∈ A', we know |a| = {aleph_4}.")
    print("Consider the collection of sets A'' = {a \\ R | a ∈ A'}. These are the parts of the sets in A' outside the root.")
    print(f"The cardinality of each set in A'' is |a \\ R| = |a| - |R|. Since |a| = {aleph_4} and |R| < {aleph_4}, this is {aleph_4}.")
    print("The sets in A'' are pairwise disjoint. For distinct a, b ∈ A', (a \\ R) ∩ (b \\ R) = (a ∩ b) \\ R = R \\ R = ∅.")
    print(f"So, A'' is a collection of {aleph_5} pairwise disjoint sets, each of size {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"All these sets are subsets of the original universal set {omega_4}.")
    print(f"Their union, ⋃(A''), must also be a subset of {omega_4}. The cardinality of this union is {aleph_5} × {aleph_4} = {aleph_5}.")
    print(f"This implies that {omega_4} has a subset of cardinality {aleph_5}, which is a contradiction since a set cannot have a subset larger than itself.")
    print(f"Thus, our initial assumption was false. The cardinality of A cannot be {aleph_5}. It must be |A| ≤ {aleph_4}.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Finding the Lower Bound for |A| ---")
    print(f"We will now construct a family A with the desired properties and show that |A| ≥ {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"This construction relies on the given hypothesis: 2^{aleph_3} = {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"Let our universal set be the set of all functions from {omega_3} to {{0, 1}}. Let's call this set S.")
    print(f"The cardinality of this set is |S| = 2^{aleph_3}, which is given to be {aleph_4}. So, we can identify {omega_4} with S.")
    print("A known result in combinatorial set theory states that there exists a family F ⊆ S of size 2^{aleph_3} = {aleph_4} such that any two distinct functions f, g ∈ F differ on a set of coordinates of size {aleph_3}.")

    print(f"For any α ≠ β, the set D = {{γ < {omega_3} | f_α(γ) ≠ f_β(γ)}} has cardinality |D| = {aleph_3}.")
    print("\nNow, for each function f_α in our family F, we define a subset A_α of S:")
    print(f"A_α = {{g ∈ S | the set {{γ < {omega_3} | g(γ) ≠ f_α(γ)}} has cardinality ≤ {aleph_1}}}.")
    print("Let's check if the collection A = {A_α | α < ω₄} meets the requirements.")
    print(f"1. Cardinality of the collection A: |A| = |F| = {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"2. Cardinality of each set A_α:")
    print(f"   |A_α| is the number of functions g that are 'close' to f_α (differing on at most {aleph_1} positions).")
    print(f"   The number of ways to choose a subset of {omega_3} of size at most {aleph_1} is ({aleph_3})^{aleph_1} = {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"   For each such subset of positions, there are at most 2^{aleph_1} ways to define the values of g.")
    print(f"   So, |A_α| is roughly {aleph_4} × 2^{aleph_1}. Since 2^{aleph_1} ≤ 2^{aleph_3} = {aleph_4}, we have |A_α| = {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"3. Cardinality of the intersection A_α ∩ A_β for α ≠ β:")

    print(f"   |{{γ | h(γ) ≠ f_α(γ)}}| ≤ {aleph_1} and |{{γ | h(γ) ≠ f_β(γ)}}| ≤ {aleph_1}.")
    print(f"   By the triangle inequality on the set of differences, |{{γ | f_α(γ) ≠ f_β(γ)}}| ≤ {aleph_1} + {aleph_1} = {aleph_1}.")
    print(f"   But we chose our family F such that f_α and f_β differ on {aleph_3} positions.")
    print(f"   Since {aleph_3} > {aleph_1}, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the intersection must be empty.")
    print(f"   So, for any distinct α, β, we have |A_α ∩ A_β| = 0, which satisfies the condition |A_α ∩ A_β| < {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"We have successfully constructed a family A of size {aleph_4} meeting all conditions. Thus, |A| ≥ {aleph_4}.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print(f"We have shown that |A| ≤ {aleph_4} and |A| ≥ {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"Therefore, the largest possible cardinality for the collection A is {aleph_4}.")
    print(f"The final equation is |A| = {aleph_4}.")
