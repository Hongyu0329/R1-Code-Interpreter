    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints on the Teva 10mg and 20mg fluoxetine capsules. I will then write a Python script to isolate the numbers from each imprint. The script will compare these two sets of numbers to find which digits are not shared between them. Finally, it will print out the numbers that are different.\n\n```python\ndef find_different_imprints():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numbers on Teva brand\n    fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Imprints found on the capsules\n    imprint_10mg = \"TEVA 3107\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"TEVA 3108\"\n\n    # Extract the numerical digits from each imprint string into sets\n    numbers_10mg = {char for char in imprint_10mg if char.isdigit()}\n    numbers_20mg = {char for char in imprint_20mg if char.isdigit()}\n\n    # Find the numbers that are unique to the 10mg capsule\n    unique_to_10mg = numbers_10mg.difference(numbers_20mg)\n\n    # Find the numbers that are unique to the 20mg capsule\n    unique_to_20mg = numbers_20mg.difference(numbers_10mg)\n\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the findings clearly.\n    if unique_to_10mg:\n        num_10mg = list(unique_to_10mg)[0]\n        print(f\"The Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the number {num_10mg} that is not on the 20mg version.\")\n\n    if unique_to_20mg:\n        num_20mg = list(unique_to_20mg)[0]\n        print(f\"The Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is imprinted with the number {num_20mg} that is not on the 10mg version.\")\n\nfind_different_imprints()\n<<<7 and 8>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
