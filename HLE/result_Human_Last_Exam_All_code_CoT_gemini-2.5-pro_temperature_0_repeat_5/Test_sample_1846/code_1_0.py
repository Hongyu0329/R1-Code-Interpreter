    # Clinical Context:
    # The question asks which population group shows prolonged overall survival (OS)
    # with PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in TNBC.

    # Key Evidence from Clinical Trials (e.g., KEYNOTE-355):
    # - The addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to chemotherapy has been studied extensively.
    # - A significant improvement in overall survival is consistently observed in the
    #   subgroup of patients whose tumors express the biomarker PD-L1.
    # - In the PD-L1-negative population, this survival benefit is not seen.
    # - In the broader intention-to-treat (ITT) population (which includes both PD-L1
    #   positive and negative patients), the overall survival benefit is diluted and
    #   often does not reach statistical significance.

    # Conclusion:
    # The primary beneficiaries of this treatment, in terms of overall survival,
    # are patients in the PD-L1-positive population.
