    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), we need to analyze how the pitch changes from one mora (a unit of sound, similar to a syllable) to the next.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Identify the morae of the word 「弟」 (otouto). The word is composed of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n2.  Determine the standard pitch for each mora. In standard Tokyo Japanese, the pitch for 「弟」 is Low-High-High-High.\n    *   お (o) is Low.\n    *   と (to) is High.\n    *   う (u) is High.\n    *   と (to) is High.\n3.  Match this pitch sequence to the correct term.\n    *   **Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. It does not drop on the following particle. This matches the L-H-H-H pattern.\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae (e.g., H-L-L-L). This does not match.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls again *within* the word (e.g., L-H-L-L). This does not match.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora, but it drops on the particle that follows the word. This does not match, as 「弟が」 (otouto ga) is pronounced L-H-H-H-H.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban. The following Python code will demonstrate this lookup and provide the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates a lookup in a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"morae\": [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"],\n            \"pattern_name\": \"Heiban\",\n            \"pitch_sequence\": \"Low-High-High-High\",\n            \"answer_choice\": \"A\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    if word in accent_database:\n        info = accent_database[word]\n        print(f\"Analysis for the word: 「{word}」\")\n        print(f\"Reading: {info['reading']}\")\n        print(f\"Morae: {' - '.join(info['morae'])}\")\n        print(f\"Pitch Sequence: {info['pitch_sequence']}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        print(\"Explanation:\")\n        print(\"The pitch starts low on the first mora 'お', rises on the second mora 'と', and remains high for the rest of the word.\")\n        print(\"This pattern is known as Heiban (平板).\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        print(f\"Therefore, the correct answer choice is: {info['answer_choice']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Pitch accent information for '{word}' not found.\")\n\n# The word we are looking for is 「弟」\ntarget_word = \"弟\"\nfind_pitch_accent(target_word)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
