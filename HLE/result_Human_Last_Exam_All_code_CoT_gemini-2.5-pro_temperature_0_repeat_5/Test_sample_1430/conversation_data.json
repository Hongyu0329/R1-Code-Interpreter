    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem in algebraic geometry.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric objects**: The problem involves a genus $g=3$ Riemann surface $C$ and its 15th symmetric power, $X = C^{(15)}$. We need to find the rank of its Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X)$.\n\n2.  **Use the structure of the symmetric power**: For a curve $C$ of genus $g$, the $d$-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is closely related to the Jacobian variety $J(C)$, which is an abelian variety of dimension $g$. When the degree $d$ is large enough ($d > 2g-2$), the Abel-Jacobi map $u: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ presents $C^{(d)}$ as a projective bundle over $J(C)$.\n    *   In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition $15 > 2(3)-2 = 4$ is satisfied.\n    *   The fibers of this bundle are projective spaces of dimension $d-g = 15-3=12$. So, $X$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$.\n\n3.  **Relate the ranks of the Néron-Severi groups**: For a projective bundle $E \\to B$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group (or Picard number) of the total space $E$ is related to that of the base $B$ by the simple formula: $\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\n    *   Applying this to our situation, we get $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the range of possible ranks for $\\rho(J(C))$**: The problem now reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\n    *   **Minimum Rank**: For a *generic* curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the minimal number of algebraic cycles. Its Néron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, the minimum possible rank is $\\rho(J(C))_{\\min} = 1$.\n    *   **Maximum Rank**: The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(J(C))$. For a $g$-dimensional abelian variety, $h^{1,1} = g^2$. So, $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. This maximum value is achieved for very special curves, namely those with **Complex Multiplication (CM)**. For such curves, the Jacobian $J(C)$ is of CM type, and it is a known result that $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: Using the formula from step 3 and the extremal values from step 4, we can calculate the smallest and largest ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n    *   Smallest rank: $\\rho(X)_{\\min} = \\rho(J(C))_{\\min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest rank: $\\rho(X)_{\\max} = \\rho(J(C))_{\\max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this calculation and prints the detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of the Riemann surface C and its symmetric power X.\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(15)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 curve.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the relationship between rho(X) and rho(J(C)).\n    print(f\"Step 1: Relate the rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian J(C) of the curve C.\")\n    print(f\"The curve C has genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"The variety X is the {d}th symmetric power of C, denoted C^({d}).\")\n    \n    condition_deg = 2 * g - 2\n    print(f\"For a symmetric power of degree d > 2g - 2, the variety C^(d) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian J(C).\")\n    print(f\"In our case, d = {d} and 2g - 2 = {condition_deg}.
