    print("Problem: For a connected topological space X, a point x is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("Suppose X is a compact connected metric space. What is the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points?")
    print("\n---\n")
    print("Step-by-step derivation:")
    print("1. Let X be a compact connected metric space and D be the set of its dispersion points.")
    print("   - A space is 'totally disconnected' if its only connected components are single points.")
    print("   - X is a metric space, so it is also a Hausdorff space (any two distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods).")

    print("\n2. We will prove that the number of dispersion points, |D|, cannot be 2 or more. The proof is by contradiction.")
    print("   - Assume |D| >= 2. Let x1 and x2 be two distinct dispersion points in D.")

    print("\n3. Since X is a Hausdorff space, we can find an open neighborhood U of x1 such that its closure, cl(U), does not contain x2.")
    print("   - That is, x1 is in the open set U, and x2 is not in cl(U).")

    print("\n4. By definition, x2 is a dispersion point, so the space S = X \\ {x2} is totally disconnected.")
    print("   - S, being an open subset of a compact Hausdorff space, is a locally compact Hausdorff space.")
    print("   - A key property of such spaces is that they are 'zero-dimensional', meaning they have a basis of clopen sets (sets that are both open and closed).")

    print("\n5. The point x1 is in S. The set U is an open neighborhood of x1 in X, and since x2 is not in U, U is also an open neighborhood of x1 in S.")
    print("   - Because S is zero-dimensional, there must exist a non-empty clopen set V in S such that x1 is in V and V is a subset of U.")

    print("\n6. Now, S is partitioned into two disjoint clopen sets: V and W = S \\ V.")
    print("   - Let cl(V) and cl(W) be the closures of V and W in the original space X.")
    print("   - Since S = V U W, we have X = cl(S) = cl(V U W) = cl(V) U cl(W).")
    print("   - Because X is connected and is the union of two closed sets, cl(V) and cl(W), their intersection must be non-empty.")
    print("   - It can be shown that cl(V) intersect cl(W) must be a subset of {x2}. Therefore, cl(V) intersect cl(W) = {x2}.")

    print("\n7. This implies that x2 must be in the closure of V, i.e., x2 is in cl(V).")

    print("\n8. From step 5, we have V is a subset of U. This implies that cl(V) is a subset of cl(U).")
    print("   - So, if x2 is in cl(V), it must also be in cl(U).")

    print("\n9. This leads to a contradiction:")
    print("   - From step 3, we chose U such that x2 is NOT in cl(U).")
    print("   - From steps 7 and 8, we derived that x2 IS in cl(U).")
    print("   - This contradiction means our initial assumption (|D| >= 2) must be false.")

    print("\n10. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of dispersion points D must be less than 2. So, |D| <= 1.")

    print("\n11. We need to check if |D| = 1 and |D| = 0 are possible.")
    print("    - |D| = 0 is possible. The closed interval [0, 1] is a compact connected metric space with no dispersion points.")
    print("    - |D| = 1 is also possible. There exist compact connected metric spaces that have exactly one dispersion point (e.g., a compact version of the Knaster-Kuratowski fan).")

    print("\n---\n")
