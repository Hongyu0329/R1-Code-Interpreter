# Step 1 & 2: Theoretical simplification (as explained in the plan)
# The problem asks for the value of E_n for n = 10^15.
# n = 10^15 = (9+1)^15 = 1 (mod 3).
# So we need to calculate E_1.
# E_n = (x_n^1 - (3*r)/(2*pi)*sin(2*pi*n/3))^2 + (x_n^2)^2
# For n=1, S_1 = (3*r)/(2*pi)*sin(2*pi/3) = (3*r)/(2*pi)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi).
# The recurrence is x_{n+1} = A * x_n + b, where b = [(3*sqrt(3)*r)/(4*pi), 0]^T.
# So, x_1 = A * x_0 + b.
# E_1 = ( (A*x_0)_1 + b_1 - S_1 )^2 + ( (A*x_0)_2 + b_2 )^2
# Since b_1 = S_1 and b_2 = 0, this simplifies to:
# E_1 = ( (A*x_0)_1 )^2 + ( (A*x_0)_2 )^2 = ||A*x_0||^2
# Since A is a rotation matrix, it is orthogonal, so ||A*x_0||^2 = ||x_0||^2.
# The value to find is (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.

# Step 3 & 4: Use boundary conditions to find x_0^1 and x_0^2.
# From BC3: x_{2025}^2 = 10^20. Since 2025 is divisible by 3, x_{2025} = x_0.
# So, x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 10**20

# From the assumed corrected BC2: -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + (sqrt(3)*r)/(2*pi) = 0.
# Substituting x_1 = A*x_0 + b leads to the relation:
# -2/3*x_0^1 + 2/sqrt(3)*x_0^2 = 0
# This simplifies to x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 5: Calculate the final value.
# The value is (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
x0_1_sq = x0_1**2
x0_2_sq = x0_2**2
result = x0_1_sq + x0_2_sq

# Print the final equation with the numbers, as requested.
# We use floating point representation for clarity with the large numbers.

print(f"x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * 10^20")

print(f"({x0_1:.4e})^2 + ({x0_2:.4e})^2 = {result:.4e}")

# The exact result is 4 * 10^40.
final_value = 4 * 10**40
