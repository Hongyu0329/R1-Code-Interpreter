    "My plan is to identify the correct character from the 1972 film *Solaris* based on my knowledge of the movie's plot and dialogue. The question asks which character is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves. This specific sentiment is expressed by one of the scientists on the space station during a philosophical conversation, reflecting on their alienation from Earth. I will recall the characters and their key dialogues to pinpoint the correct one.\n\nThe character who says this is Dr. Snaut. In a moment of melancholic reflection while speaking with the main character, Kris Kelvin, Snaut talks about how they are losing their connection to humanity and Earth. He expresses a sense of shame over missing such a simple, terrestrial experience as the sound of leaves, which highlights the profound psychological isolation of the crew.\n\nI will now write a simple python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\" (1972)\n    who is ashamed of missing the sound of rustling leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Character information based on the film's dialogue.\n    character_name = \"Snaut\"\n    answer_choice = \"C\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In a philosophical and melancholic conversation with Kris Kelvin, \"\n        \"Dr. Snaut expresses his deep alienation from Earth. He confesses to being \"\n        \"ashamed of missing simple, earthly things like the sound of rustling leaves, \"\n        \"which highlights the crew's profound psychological isolation in space.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The character in question is Dr. {character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {answer_choice}.\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
