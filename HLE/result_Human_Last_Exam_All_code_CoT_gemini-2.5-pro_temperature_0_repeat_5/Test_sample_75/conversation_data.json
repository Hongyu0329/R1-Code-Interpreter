    "Here is my plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  First, I will establish the start and end years of the war based on the lore. The war began in the year 2504 with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. It concluded in the year 2508 with the epilogue of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*.\n2.  I will then calculate the total duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n3.  The problem asks to round the result up. I will use Python's `math.ceil()` function to perform this operation, even though the result is a whole number.\n4.  Finally, I will print the calculation in a clear format, showing each number used in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in 2504\n# and concluded in 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round up the result (though it's already an integer)\nrounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the final equation\nprint(f\"The Second Great War started in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The duration calculation is: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The duration in years, rounded up, is: {rounded_duration}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
