Step-by-step analysis of the answer choices:

The problem is #Sub_G(H), counting subgraphs isomorphic to H in a graph G, where G is from a 'somewhere dense' and hereditary class G, and H is from a class H. The parameter is k = |H|.

A. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for every class H.
This is false. If we take H to be the class of all cliques, the problem becomes #Clique. #Clique is the canonical #W[1]-complete problem and is not believed to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).

C. There exists a class H of graphs of degree at most 2 such that #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
This is false. Graphs with a maximum degree of at most 2 are collections of paths and cycles. Such graphs have a treewidth of at most 2. It is a well-known result that counting subgraphs H of bounded treewidth is FPT. Since all graphs in H would have treewidth at most 2, the problem is FPT, not #W[1]-complete.

E. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded vertex-cover number.
This is false. The 'if' part is true (bounded vertex cover implies bounded treewidth, which implies FPT), but the 'only if' part is false. Consider H to be the class of all paths. Counting k-paths is FPT. However, the class of paths has an unbounded vertex-cover number. This provides a counterexample.

This leaves us with B and D.

D. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded treewidth.
This statement is a famous dichotomy theorem that holds true when G is the class of all graphs. However, the question states that G belongs to *any* somewhere dense class G that is not the class of all graphs. We can construct a counterexample to show this statement is false.
Let H be the class of all grid graphs, which has unbounded treewidth. Let F be the 100x100 grid. Let G be the class of all graphs that do not contain F as a subgraph (G = Forb({F})).
1. G is hereditary and not the class of all graphs.
2. G is 'somewhere dense' because forbidding a single graph F still allows graphs to be dense enough to contain large cliques.
3. Now consider #Sub_G(H). If we are given a pattern H from H that is a grid of size 100x100 or larger, it contains F as a subgraph. Since G is F-free, the count of subgraphs is 0. If H is smaller than 100x100, it belongs to a finite set of patterns. Counting any fixed pattern is FPT. Thus, for this choice of G and H, the problem is FPT, even though H has unbounded treewidth.
This contradicts the 'only if' part of the statement, so D is false.

B. If H is the class of all cliques, then #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
This statement is true. The problem described is #Clique restricted to the class G. There is a key theorem in parameterized complexity that states: for any hereditary class of graphs G, the #Clique problem on G is #W[1]-complete if and only if G is not 'nowhere dense'.
The problem specifies that:
1. G is 'somewhere dense'. A somewhere dense class is, by definition, not nowhere dense.
2. G is closed under taking subgraphs, which means it is hereditary.
The conditions of the theorem are met. Therefore, for any class G described in the problem, counting cliques is #W[1]-complete. The counterexample that defeated statement D does not apply here, as forbidding a grid does not make counting cliques an easy problem.

Final Conclusion: Statement B is the only true statement.
