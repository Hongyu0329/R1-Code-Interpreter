    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  I will identify the key entities in your question: the city \"Bártfa\" (modern-day \"Bardejov\"), the role \"judge\", and the year \"1461\".\n2.  I will search my historical knowledge base for the name of the person who held the position of judge in Bardejov during that specific year.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear, formatted sentence to answer your question, making sure to include the year 1461 in the output.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information based on historical records for the specified year.\n    city_name_historical = \"Bártfa\"\n    city_name_modern = \"Bardejov\"\n    year = 1461\n    judge_name = \"Leonard of Uničov\"\n\n    # The final output string, constructed from the variables.\n    # The number from the query is explicitly included in the output.\n    answer = f\"In the year {year}, the judge of {city_name_historical} (now {city_name_modern}) was {judge_name}.\"\n\n    print(answer)\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nfind_judge_of_bartfa()\n```\n<<<Leonard of Uničov>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Who was the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
