    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in a 1D box between positions `x1` and `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density, `|ψn(x)|²`, over that interval.\n    *   The normalized wave function is `ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`.\n    *   The probability density is `|ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`.\n\n2.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to calculate `P = ∫ (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx` from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a` for the state `n = 2`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral:** To make the integral independent of the box length 'a', we can use a normalized coordinate `u = x/a`. The integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫ 2 * sin²(nπu) du` from `u1 = 0.495` to `u2 = 0.505`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral:** We'll use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`.\n    *   For our case, `θ = nπu`, so `2θ = 2nπu`.\n    *   The integral becomes `P = ∫ (1 - cos(2nπu)) du`.\n    *   The analytical solution is `P = [u - (1/(2nπ)) * sin(2nπu)]` evaluated from `u1` to `u2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** I will write a Python script that plugs in `n=2`, `u1=0.495`, and `u2=0.505` into the final solved equation, prints the equation with the numbers, and then calculates the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants for the problem\nn = 2\nu1 = 0.495  # Lower bound of the interval (x1/a)\nu2 = 0.505  # Upper bound of the interval (x2/a)\n\n# The analytical solution for the probability P is:\n# P = [u - (1/(2*n*pi)) * sin(2*n*pi*u)] evaluated from u1 to u2\n# P = (u2 - u1) - (1/(2*n*pi)) * (sin(2*n*pi*u2) - sin(2*n*pi*u1))\n\n# Calculate the arguments for the sine functions\narg1 = 2 * n * math.pi * u1\narg2 = 2 * n * math.pi * u2\n\n# Calculate the sine terms\nsin_term1 = math.sin(arg1)\nsin_term2 = math.sin(arg2)\n\n# Calculate the different parts of the equation\ndelta_u = u2 - u1\nprefactor = 1 / (2 * n * math.pi)\n\n# Calculate the final probability\nprobability = delta_u - prefactor * (sin_term2 - sin_term1)\n\n# Print the equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(\"The probability P is calculated from the equation:\")\nprint(f\"P = (u2 - u1) - (1/(2*n*pi)) * [sin(2*n*pi*u2) - sin(2*n*pi*u1)]\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the values:\")\nprint(f\"P = ({u2} - {u1}) - (1/(2*{n}*pi)) * [sin(2*{n}*pi*{u2}) - sin(2*{n}*pi*{u1})]\")\nprint(f\"P = {delta_u} - ({prefactor:.6f}) * [{sin_term2:.6f} - ({sin_term1:.6f})]\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"The probability is: {probability}\")\n\n```\n<<<6.57970856935223e-06>>>"
