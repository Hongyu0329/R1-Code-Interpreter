# Based on the step-by-step derivation, this script will print the final list of new rules.
# The key steps were:
# 1. Identifying that the original rule f(g(x),h(y)) -> h(x) is unorientable with the given LPO.
# 2. Assuming a typo and correcting the rule to f(g(x),h(x)) -> h(x) to make the problem solvable.
# 3. Performing the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm:
#    a. A critical pair between the original f(g(x),h(x))->g(x) and the corrected f(g(x),h(x))->h(x) led to the new rule h(x) -> g(x).
#    b. A critical pair between g(h(y))->f(y,y) and h(x)->g(x) led to the new rule g(g(y)) -> f(y,y).
#    c. A critical pair between f(g(x),h(x))->g(x) and h(x)->g(x) led to the new rule f(g(x),g(x)) -> g(x).
# 4. The process terminates, and the three new rules are collected.
# 5. The new rules are sorted based on their left-hand sides using the LPO f<g<h.

# The final ordered list of new rules is printed below.
