    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question that bridges logic, metaphysics, and physics.\n\nHere is my plan to address your query:\n1.  First, I will clarify the nature of Gödel's Ontological Proof. It is a formal argument rooted in modal logic, a branch of symbolic logic that deals with concepts like possibility and necessity. The proof's validity depends entirely on the acceptance of its initial axioms and definitions within that logical system.\n2.  Second, I will describe the domain of quantum mechanics. It is a physical theory whose mathematical framework (using Hilbert spaces, operators, etc.) is designed to model and predict the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Its validity is determined by experimental verification.\n3.  Third, I will explain that these two systems operate in fundamentally different domains. Gödel's proof is a metaphysical and logical construct, while quantum mechanics is a scientific theory about the physical world. The mathematical tools of quantum mechanics are not designed to evaluate the axioms or logical structure of Gödel's proof.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to illustrate this conclusion. The script will not perform a calculation but will serve as a structured explanation, demonstrating that the domain of quantum mechanics (which we can represent with the number `1`) is not the same as the domain of modal logic (represented by the number `2`), and therefore one cannot be used to prove the other. This will satisfy your request to include numbers in a final \"equation.\"\n\n```python\ndef explain_domains():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains why quantum mechanics cannot prove Gödel's ontological proof.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script addresses the question of whether the mathematics of quantum mechanics can prove Gödel's ontological proof.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Assign numeric identifiers to the distinct domains.\n    # 1 represents the domain of physical theories like Quantum Mechanics.\n    # 2 represents the domain of formal logic systems like Modal Logic.\n    domain_quantum_mechanics = 1\n    domain_goedels_proof = 2\n\n    print(f\"We can think of these as two separate domains of inquiry:\")\n    print(f\"Domain {domain_quantum_mechanics}: Quantum Mechanics (Physics - describes the physical universe)\")\n    print(f\"Domain {domain_goedels_proof}: Gödel's Proof (Modal Logic - explores logical consequences of axioms)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"The core issue is that these domains are not interchangeable.
