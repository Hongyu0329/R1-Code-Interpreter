    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I will identify the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The health scaling formula is linear, meaning that with a mathematically infinite number of players, the health would also approach infinity.\n4.  **Identify the Technical Limitation:** However, the game's code has a hard limit. Like many games, Terraria uses a standard 32-bit signed integer to store health values. This data type has a maximum possible value.\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Health:** This maximum integer value represents the true theoretical maximum health the boss can have in the game engine, regardless of how high the player count gets.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to explain this logic and print the final value, which is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the calculation.\n    # In Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu's base health is 3640.\n    # Health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    base_health = 3640\n    per_player_increase = 0.35\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the health scaling formula.\n    print(\"The health scaling formula for a boss in Expert Mode multiplayer is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = Base Health * (1 + Per-Player Increase * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (Number of Players - 1))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the implication of infinite players and the technical limitation.\n    print(\"As you can see, health scales linearly with the number of players.\")\n    print(\"Mathematically, with infinite players, the health would also be infinite.\")\n    print(\"However, the game's source code uses a 32-bit signed integer to store an NPC's health.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a hard-coded maximum value, which acts as the true ceiling for health in the game engine.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: State the final maximum health based on the 32-bit integer limit.\n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2^31 - 1.\n    max_int_32 = 2147483647\n\n    print(\"The final equation for the theoretical maximum health is therefore the limit of this data type.\")\n    print(f\"Maximum Health = {max_int_32}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_max_health()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
