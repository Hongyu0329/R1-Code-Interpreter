    print("1. The initial problem is a paradox: We are told 'If the dog detects an intruder (P), it will bark (Q)', which is P→Q. However, we have proof that 'The dog detected an intruder (P) AND did not bark (¬Q)'.")
    print("2. This means the original rule (P→Q) must be incomplete. There must be another condition.")
    print("3. Answer C introduces a new condition: 'The dog was asleep (R)'. It refines the rule to: 'If the dog detects an intruder (P) AND is NOT asleep (¬R), THEN it will bark (Q)'.")

    # Printing each component of the equation as requested
    print("  - Part 1: [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] - This is the new, more accurate rule.")
    print("  - Part 2: (¬Q ∧ P) - These are the facts we observed.")
    print("  - Conclusion: ∴R - This is the logical conclusion derived from the rule and the facts.")

    print("\nHow the logic works:")
    print("  - We know from the facts that the dog did not bark (¬Q) and an intruder was detected (P).")
    print("  - The rule is (P ∧ ¬R)→Q. The contrapositive of this rule is ¬Q → ¬(P ∧ ¬R), which simplifies to ¬Q → (¬P ∨ R).")
    print("  - Since we know ¬Q is true, we can conclude that (¬P ∨ R) must be true.")
    print("  - We also know from the facts that P is true.")
    print("  - If (¬P ∨ R) is true and P is true, the only possibility is that R must be true.")
    print("  - Therefore, the logical conclusion is R: 'The dog was asleep'.")

    print("\nThis conclusion resolves the paradox perfectly. The dog detected the intruder but didn't bark because it was asleep. This does not contradict the fact that the dog was 'capable of barking'.")
