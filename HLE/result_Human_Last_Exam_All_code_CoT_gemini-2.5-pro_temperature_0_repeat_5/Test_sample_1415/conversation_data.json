    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand**: The expression to integrate is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard form whose integral is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This gives `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits**:\n    *   First, I'll determine the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Then, I'll calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`.\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`.\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n    *   Since `F₃(x)` is always positive for x in [0, 1], the absolute value is not needed.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**:\n    *   The value of the integral is `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   I will write a Python script to compute this value `V`, multiply it by 10000, and round to the nearest integer.\n    *   The script will also print the final equation with the numerical values substituted.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the value of the definite integral and the final requested value.\n\n# 1. Define the function F3(x) based on the problem description.\n# F₀(x) = x\n# F₁(x) = sin(x)\n# F₂(x) = e^(sin(x))\n# F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\ndef F3(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n    return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# 2. The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n# Calculate F₃(x) at the integration limits x=1 and x=0.\nF3_at_1 = F3(1)\nF3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# 3. Calculate the value of the integral V.\nV = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n# 4. Calculate the final value as requested: 10000 * V.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\n\n# 5. Find the closest integer to the final value.\nresult = round(final_value)\n\n# 6. Print the steps of the calculation, including the final equation with numbers.\nprint(\"The integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {F3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) = {F3_at_0}\")\nprint(\"The final equation with the numerical values is:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V = {math.log(F3_at_1)} - ({math.log(F3_at_0)})\")\nprint(f\"V = {V}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final requested value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
