The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are precisely the semidirect products $G = Q \rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is any group of order $q^m$, and the non-identity element of $C_2$ acts on $Q$ via an automorphism $\alpha$ which induces the inversion map on the Frattini quotient $Q/\Phi(Q)$. This condition is equivalent to stating that for every element $u \in Q$, the product $\alpha(u)u$ must be an element of the Frattini subgroup $\Phi(Q)$ of $Q$. This class of groups includes all generalized dihedral groups $D(Q)$ where $Q$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$, as well as groups constructed from certain nonabelian groups $Q$.
