    "This is a problem in finite group theory. To identify the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$, we first need to understand the relevant definitions and leverage key theorems from the literature on this topic.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the group structure**: Analyze the structure of a group of order $2q^m$. By Sylow's theorems, such a group $G$ must have a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$. This means $G$ is a semidirect product $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$.\n2.  **Apply the theory of filled groups**: A crucial result for solvable groups (which groups of order $2q^m$ are) states that a group $G$ is filled if and only if its Frattini quotient, $G/\\Phi(G)$, is filled.\n3.  **Analyze the Frattini quotient**: The Frattini quotient $G/\\Phi(G)$ is isomorphic to $(Q/\\Phi(Q)) \\rtimes C_2$. The group $V = Q/\\Phi(Q)$ is an elementary abelian $q$-group, i.e., a vector space over the field with $q$ elements.\n4.  **Identify filled groups of the quotient's structure**: A group of the form $V \\rtimes C_2$ is filled if and only if it is not a direct product of two non-trivial subgroups of coprime orders. This condition holds if and only if the automorphism defining the semidirect product has no non-trivial fixed points in $V$. For an automorphism of order 2, this means it must be the inversion map ($v \\mapsto v^{-1}$ for all $v \\in V$).\n5.  **Translate the condition back to G**: The condition on the quotient group translates back to a condition on the automorphism defining the original group $G$. The automorphism $\\alpha$ associated with the $C_2$ action must induce the inversion map on $Q/\\Phi(Q)$. This means that for any element $u \\in Q$, $\\alpha(u)u$ must be in the Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(Q)$.\n6.  **Formulate the final answer**: The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are precisely those groups that satisfy this structural condition. This class includes well-known families like generalized dihedral groups over abelian $q$-groups, but also potentially groups built on nonabelian $q$-groups.\n7.  **Provide a concrete example**: To illustrate the result, I will provide Python code that uses the `sympy` library to construct two non-isomorphic filled groups of order $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$. These examples will correspond to the cases where the Sylow 3-subgroup $Q$ is cyclic ($C_9$) and elementary abelian ($C_3 \\times C_3$).\n\nThe following Python code constructs two examples of nonabelian filled groups of order $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.groups import PermutationGroup\n\ndef describe_group(name, G):\n    \"\"\"Prints basic properties of a given permutation group.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Group: {name} ---\")\n    print(f\"Order: {G.order()}\")\n    print(f\"Is Abelian: {G.is_abelian()}\")\n    print(f\"Generators: {G.generators}\")\n    print(\"-\" * (len(name) + 14))\n    print()\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the construction of two non-isomorphic nonabelian\n    filled groups of order 18, as examples of the general classification.\n    A group of order 18 has the form 2*q^m with q=3, m=2.\n\n    According to the theory, such groups are of the form Q x| C_2, where Q is a\n    group of order 9 and the action of C_2 induces inversion on Q/Phi(Q).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Example 1: The Dihedral Group D_18 = D(C_9)\n    # This is a filled group where Q is the cyclic group of order 9.\n    # It can be represented as a permutation group on 9 elements.\n    # r is the rotation, s is the reflection.\n    r_d18 = Permutation(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)\n    s_d18 = Permutation(1, 8)(2, 7)(3, 6)(4, 5)\n    D18 = PermutationGroup([r_d18, s_d18])\n    describe_group(\"Dihedral Group D_18\", D18)\n\n    # Example 2: The Generalized Dihedral Group D(C_3 x C_3)\n    # This is a filled group where Q is the elementary abelian group C_3 x C_3.\n    # We can represent this group as a permutation group on the 9 elements\n    # of Q = {(i,j) | i,j in {0,1,2}}.\n    # Let's label the element (i,j) as 3*i + j.\n    # (0,0)->0, (0,1)->1, (0,2)->2, (1,0)->3, ... , (2,2)->8\n    \n    # Generator 'a' corresponds to translation by (1,0) in Q.\n    # (i,j) -> (i+1, j)\n    a_perm = Permutation(0, 3, 6)(1, 4, 7)(2, 5, 8)\n    \n    # Generator 'b' corresponds to translation by (0,1) in Q.\n    # (i,j) -> (i, j+1)\n    b_perm = Permutation(0, 1, 2)(3, 4, 5)(6, 7, 8)\n    \n    # Generator 'x' corresponds to the inversion automorphism on Q.\n    # x(i,j) = (-i, -j) mod 3.\n    # x(0,0)=(0,0) -> 0->0\n    # x(0,1)=(0,2) -> 1->2\n    # x(0,2)=(0,1) -> 2->1\n    # x(1,0)=(2,0) -> 3->6\n    # x(1,1)=(2,2) -> 4->8\n    # x(1,2)=(2,1) -> 5->7\n    # x(2,0)=(1,0) -> 6->3\n    # x(2,1)=(1,2) -> 7->5\n    # x(2,2)=(1,1) -> 8->4\n    x_perm = Permutation(1, 2)(3, 6)(4, 8)(5, 7)\n    \n    D_C3xC3 = PermutationGroup([a_perm, b_perm, x_perm])\n    describe_group(\"Generalized Dihedral Group D(C_3 x C_3)\", D_C3xC3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are precisely the semidirect products $G = Q \\rtimes C_2$, where $Q$ is any group of order $q^m$, and the non-identity element of $C_2$ acts on $Q$ via an automorphism $\\alpha$ which induces the inversion map on the Frattini quotient $Q/\\Phi(Q)$.
