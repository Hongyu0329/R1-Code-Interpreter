# The problem simplifies to calculating 2 to the power of 81.
# The complex formula and the large prime p are structured in a way
# that the result is independent of p's specific value.

# The final simplified equation is f(p) = base ** exponent
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# As requested, printing each number in the final equation
print(f"Base: {base}")
print(f"Exponent: {exponent}")
print(f"The value of f(p) is 2**81, which is: {result}")
