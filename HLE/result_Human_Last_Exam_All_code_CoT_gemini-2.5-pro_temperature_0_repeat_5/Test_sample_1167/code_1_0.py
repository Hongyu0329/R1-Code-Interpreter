# Step 1: Define the exponents from the problem statement and the chosen method.
# The problem states the threshold is N^(lambda_exp)
lambda_exp = Fraction(3, 8)

# We use the L^p norm with p=6, which is the critical exponent for the restriction problem on the parabola.
p = 6

# Step 2: Determine the exponent of N in the polynomial degree.
# S(x, t) is a polynomial in t of degree N^2.
# The inequality relating L_inf and L_p norms introduces a factor of (Degree)^(p/p) = Degree.
# So, the exponent from the degree factor is 2.
degree_poly_t_exp = 2

# Step 3: Determine the exponent of N from the bound on the L^p integral.
# The decoupling theorem gives ||S||_p <= C*N^epsilon.
# So, integral(|S|^p) <= C*N^(p*epsilon). We treat epsilon as 0 for the main term.
integral_bound_exp = 0

# Step 4: Calculate the exponent alpha using the formula derived from the steps in the explanation.
# |X| * (N^lambda_exp)^p <= C * N^degree_poly_t_exp * N^integral_bound_exp
# |X| * N^(p * lambda_exp) <= C * N^(degree_poly_t_exp + integral_bound_exp)
# |X| <= C * N^(degree_poly_t_exp + integral_bound_exp - p * lambda_exp)
# alpha = degree_poly_t_exp + integral_bound_exp - p * lambda_exp

print(f"The calculation for alpha is based on the inequality: |X| <= N^(alpha)")
print(f"alpha = (degree exponent) + (integral exponent) - p * (threshold exponent)")

# Perform the calculation
alpha = degree_poly_t_exp + integral_bound_exp - p * lambda_exp

# Output the equation with numbers
print(f"alpha = {degree_poly_t_exp} + {integral_bound_exp} - {p} * {lambda_exp}")
print(f"alpha = {degree_poly_t_exp} - {p * lambda_exp}")
print(f"alpha = {Fraction(degree_poly_t_exp)} - {p * lambda_exp}")
