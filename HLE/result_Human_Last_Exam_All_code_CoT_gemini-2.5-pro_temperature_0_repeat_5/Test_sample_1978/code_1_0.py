    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system.

    # we conclude the dimension of the system is 2024.
    system_dimension = 2024

    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.
    # The boundary conditions are:
    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0                  --> Constraint on x_1
    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0                  --> Constraint on x_2
    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0              --> Linearly dependent with condition 2
    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0            --> Linearly dependent with condition 2
    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0         --> Linearly dependent with condition 2
    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0      --> Constraint on x_2024

    # Step 3: Calculate the index.
    # The index of a boundary-value problem is the number of linearly independent solutions
    # to the homogeneous problem. This corresponds to the number of free parameters in the
    # general solution that satisfy the boundary conditions.
    # Each independent boundary condition removes one degree of freedom.
    # Index = (Total dimension) - (Number of independent constraints)
