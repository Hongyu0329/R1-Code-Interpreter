    This function uses symbolic mathematics to derive the expression for theta'(t).
    
    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. Define the system of ODEs for the coordinates (u, v) of a Jacobi field
       in the given frame {f(t)V, H}:
       u' = -u * f'/f
       v' = u * f
    2. Define the polar coordinate transformation:
       u = R*cos(theta)
       v = R*sin(theta)
    3. Substitute the polar forms into the ODEs.
    4. Solve the resulting system of equations for theta'.
