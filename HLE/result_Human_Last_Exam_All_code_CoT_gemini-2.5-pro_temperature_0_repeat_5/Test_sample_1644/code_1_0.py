    This function explains the step-by-step solution to the set theory problem.
    The problem is to find the largest positive integer n such that AC(2) implies AC(n).
    AC(k) stands for "every family of k-element sets has a choice function".
    The solution is based on established theorems in Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory.

    print("We will show that n must be a power of 2.")
    print(" - Assume n has an odd factor m > 1. Then n = m * k for some integer k.")
    print(" - A theorem in ZF states that AC(n) implies AC(m).")
    print(" - Therefore, if AC(2) implies AC(n), it must also imply AC(m).")
    print(" - However, a famous result in set theory shows that AC(2) does not imply AC(m) for any odd m > 1 (e.g., AC(2) does not imply AC(3)).")
    print(" - This is a contradiction. Thus, the initial assumption is false, and n cannot have an odd factor greater than 1.")
    print(" - This means n must be a power of 2 (i.e., n = 2^k for some k >= 0).\n")

    print(" - For n = 2: The implication AC(2) => AC(2) is trivially true.")
    print(" - For n = 4: A theorem by Tarski shows that AC(2) is logically equivalent to AC(4). Therefore, AC(2) => AC(4) is true.")
    print(" - For n = 8: It is a known (though more advanced) result that AC(4) does not imply AC(8). Since AC(2) is equivalent to AC(4), it follows that AC(2) does not imply AC(8).")
    print(" - For n > 8 (and a power of 2): Since AC(n) implies AC(8) (because 8 is a factor of n), and AC(2) does not imply AC(8), it follows that AC(2) cannot imply AC(n) for these values either.\n")
