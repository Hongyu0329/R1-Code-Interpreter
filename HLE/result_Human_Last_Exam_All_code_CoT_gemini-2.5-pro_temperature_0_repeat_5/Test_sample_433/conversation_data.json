    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile preparations is governed by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>. The answer depends on the quality of the air in the environment where the ampule is opened.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer using a Python script:\n1.  Define variables for the container type (single-dose ampule) and the environment (sterile, which corresponds to ISO Class 5 or better).\n2.  According to USP <797>, a single-dose container opened in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment has a specific BUD.\n3.  The script will state this rule and print the final BUD in hours.\n4.  It will also mention the BUD for a less clean environment for completeness.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"single-dose container ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or cleaner)\"\n    \n    # According to USP Chapter <797> guidelines for sterile compounding:\n    bud_in_sterile_env_hours = 12\n    bud_in_suboptimal_env_hours = 1\n\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Puncture Environment: {environment}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Based on USP <797> guidelines:\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a {container_type} punctured in a {environment} is up to {bud_in_sterile_env_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: If opened in an environment of lower air quality (worse than ISO Class 5), the BUD is 1 hour.\")\n    print(\"Best practice for an open ampule is immediate use, with any unused portion discarded.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum BUD is {bud_in_sterile_env_hours} hours.\")\n\nget_bud_for_ampule()\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
