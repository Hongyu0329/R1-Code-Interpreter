    "Yes, if $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a Schwartz class function such that all its moments are zero, it does follow that $f$ must be the zero function.\n\n### Mathematical Explanation\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why this is true:\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform:** Let's consider the Fourier transform of the function $f(x)$, which we'll denote as $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function. The definition is:\n    $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\n2.  **Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:** A key property of Schwartz functions is that they are infinitely differentiable. We can compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ by differentiating under the integral sign. The $k$-th derivative is:\n    $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$\n\n3.  **Connecting Derivatives to Moments:** Now, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, i.e., at $\\xi = 0$:\n    $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$\n\n4.  **Using the Given Condition:** We are given that all the moments of $f$ are zero: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. Substituting this into our expression for the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin, we get:\n    $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n5.  **Taylor Series of the Fourier Transform:** Since $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, it is an analytic function. This means it is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point. The Taylor series for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$ is:\n    $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k$\n    Since we found that all derivatives $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)$ are zero, the Taylor series is identically zero:\n    $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{0}{k!} \\xi^k = 0$\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is the zero function. The Fourier transform is an invertible map on the space of Schwartz functions. Therefore, if $\\hat{f} = 0$, the original function $f$ must also be the zero function.\n\nThis property is highly dependent on the rapid decay of Schwartz functions. For functions that decay more slowly, it's possible for a non-zero function to have all its moments be zero.\n\n### Numerical Illustration\n\nThe following Python code provides a numerical example. It takes a specific non-zero Schwartz function and calculates its first few moments. As the theory predicts, we will find that not all of its moments are zero. We will use the function $f(x) = (1 - 2x^2)e^{-x^2}$, which is constructed to have its first two moments (for $k=0$ and $k=1$) be zero.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that a non-zero Schwartz function does not have all its moments equal to zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define a non-zero Schwartz class function.\n    # This function is f(x) = (1 - 2x^2) * exp(-x^2), which is constructed\n    # such that its 0th and 1st moments are zero.\n    def f(x):\n        return (1 - 2 * x**2) * np.exp(-x**2)\n\n    print(\"Calculating the first few moments for the non-zero Schwartz function f(x) = (1 - 2x^2) * exp(-x^2)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # We will calculate the moments M_k = integral from -inf to inf of x^k * f(x) dx\n    # for k from 0 to 5.\n    # The theory states that if f(x) is not the zero function, at least one M_k must be non-zero.\n    \n    # Analytically, the moments are:\n    # M_0 = 0\n    # M_1 = 0\n    # M_2 = -sqrt(pi) ≈ -1.77245\n    # M_3 = 0\n    # M_4 = -3*sqrt(pi)/2 ≈ -2.65868\n    # M_5 = 0\n    \n    max_k = 5\n    for k in range(max_k + 1):\n        # The integrand for the k-th moment is x^k * f(x)\n        integrand = lambda x: (x**k) * f(x)\n        \n        # Perform the numerical integration from -infinity to +infinity\n        moment, error = quad(integrand, -np.inf, np.inf)\n        \n        # Print the final equation for each moment calculation\n        print(f\"M_{k} = integral(x^{k} * f(x) dx) = {moment: .8f}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"\\nAs shown by the numerical calculation, while some moments are zero (or numerically close to zero),\")\n    print(\"the moments M_2 and M_4 are clearly non-zero.\")\n    print(\"This supports the conclusion that for a non-zero Schwartz function, not all moments can be zero.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
