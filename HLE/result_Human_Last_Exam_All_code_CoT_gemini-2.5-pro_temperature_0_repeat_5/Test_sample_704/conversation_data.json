    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  First, I will identify the color that results from combining yellow and blue. In the context of pigments or the light spectrum, this color is green.\n2.  Next, I will reference Isaac Newton's color circle, which maps the seven colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).\n3.  The question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" green and blue. On Newton's circle, each color occupies a sector, and each note marks the boundary between sectors.\n4.  The sector for Green begins at note F. The sector for Blue begins at note G.\n5.  Therefore, the note that represents the boundary or transition point between the Green sector and the Blue sector is G.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle about Newton's color circle and musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define Newton's mapping of colors to the starting musical notes of their sectors.\n    newton_color_to_note = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # The first color is the combination of yellow and blue, which is green.\n    color1 = \"Green\"\n    # The second color is blue.\n    color2 = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Find the notes associated with these colors.\n    # The note for Green represents the start of its sector.\n    # The note for Blue represents the start of its sector, which is also the end of the Green sector.\n    note_for_green_start = newton_color_to_note[color1]\n    note_for_blue_start = newton_color_to_note[color2]\n\n    # Step 5: The note for the \"range between\" green and blue is the boundary note, G.\n    final_note = note_for_blue_start\n\n    # Print the explanation step-by-step.\n    print(\"According to Isaac Newton's color circle:\")\n    print(\"1.
