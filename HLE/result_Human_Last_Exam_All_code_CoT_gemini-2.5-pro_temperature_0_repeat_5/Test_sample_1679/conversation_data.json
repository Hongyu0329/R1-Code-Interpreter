    "My plan is to find the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n1.  **Identify the Obelisks:** There are two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **List Best Picture Winners:** I will go through the list of winners chronologically.\n3.  **Analyze Films:** I will check the setting of each winning film to see if it is set in Paris or Luxor.\n4.  **Identify Candidates:** The main candidates will be films set in Paris, as they are more common among early Oscar winners than films featuring location shots of Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937): Set in Paris, making it a possibility.\n    *   *An American in Paris* (1951): The title and content make it a very strong candidate.\n    *   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956): Features a sequence in Paris.\n    *   *Gigi* (1958): Set and filmed in Paris.\n5.  **Determine the First:** I will compare the candidates to find the earliest one with a confirmed on-screen depiction of the obelisk. While *The Life of Emile Zola* is the earliest film set in Paris, its depiction is uncertain as it was mostly filmed on a studio backlot. *An American in Paris* contains a famous, stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk during the final ballet sequence. This is the first confirmed instance.\n\nI will now write a Python script to outline this process and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the first Academy Award Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks.\")\n    print(\"- One obelisk is at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\")\n    print(\"- The second obelisk is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze early Best Picture winners chronologically for settings in Paris or Luxor.\")\n\n    winners = {\n        1937: {\n            \"film\": \"The Life of Emile Zola\",\n            \"setting\": \"Paris, France\",\n            \"analysis\": \"Earliest winner set in Paris.
