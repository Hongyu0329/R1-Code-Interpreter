    # Case 1: The graph G is constructed from a single 2000-cycle (C_2000) and a
    # perfect matching connecting antipodal vertices. This results in one unique
    # non-isomorphic graph.

    # Case 2: The graph G is constructed from two 1000-cycles (C_1000) and a
    # perfect matching between their corresponding vertices. This results in the
    # prism graph C_1000 x K_2, which is also a single unique non-isomorphic graph.

    # These two graphs are shown to be non-isomorphic.

    # Therefore, the total number of non-isomorphic graphs is 2.
