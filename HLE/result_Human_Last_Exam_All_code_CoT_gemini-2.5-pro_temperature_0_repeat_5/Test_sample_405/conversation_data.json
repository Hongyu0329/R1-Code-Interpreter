    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Allotropes**: I will list the main, distinct allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine Colors**: For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color.\n3.  **Count Unique Colors**: I will count the number of unique colors from the list.\n4.  **Generate Code**: I will write a Python script to programmatically perform this count. The script will store the allotropes and their colors, find the unique colors, and print the result. To satisfy the request for an \"equation,\" the script will show how the final count is derived from the number of unique colors found.\n\nThe main allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus**: Waxy white (can appear yellowish).\n*   **Red Phosphorus**: Red.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus**: Violet (also known as Hittorf's phosphorus).\n*   **Black Phosphorus**: Black with a metallic luster.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus**: A more recently discovered 2D form which is blue.\n\nBased on this, there are 5 distinct colors: white, red, violet, black, and blue. The script will demonstrate this.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes,\n    counts the unique ones, and prints the result in an equation format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their observed colors.\n    # Note: Scarlet phosphorus is a form of red, and white can appear yellow,\n    # but these are the fundamental distinct colors of the pure allotropes.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\",\n        \"Blue Phosphorus\": \"blue\"\n    }\n\n    # Extract the color values and find the unique set of colors\n    unique_colors = sorted(list(set(allotrope_colors.values())))\n\n    # Count the number of unique colors\n    num_colors = len(unique_colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we sum the count for each unique color.\")\n\n    # Build and print the equation as requested\n    # Each unique color contributes 1 to the total count.\n    equation_numbers = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {equation_string} = {num_colors}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
