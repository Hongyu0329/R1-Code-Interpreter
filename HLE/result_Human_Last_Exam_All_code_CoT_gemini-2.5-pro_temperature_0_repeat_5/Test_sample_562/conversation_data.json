    "My plan is to first identify the radical (bushu) for the kanji character 謄. The character 謄 is composed of two parts, a left-side component and a right-side component. The left-side component, 言, is the radical. This radical is known as ごんべん (gonben) when it appears on the left side of a character. I will then provide the Hepburn romanization of this name.\n\nI will write a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_character = \"謄\"\n    # The radical for 謄 is 言, which is called \"gonben\" when it's on the left side.\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    print(f\"The radical for the character '{kanji_character}' is called: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
