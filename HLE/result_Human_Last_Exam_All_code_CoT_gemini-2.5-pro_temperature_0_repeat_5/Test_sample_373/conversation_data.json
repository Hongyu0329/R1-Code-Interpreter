    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:** I will calculate the degree of the two specific nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. For a node at the end of the bottleneck, its degree is the sum of its connections within its own clique (4) and the one connection across the bottleneck (1).\n3.  **Understand the Sampling Process:** In randomized uniform gossiping, a node `u` is chosen uniformly at random from all `N` nodes (with probability `1/N`). Then, one of its neighbors `v` is chosen uniformly at random (with probability `1/degree(u)`).\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is the sum of the probabilities of two events:\n    *   Picking node `u` first, then its neighbor `v`.\n    *   Picking node `v` first, then its neighbor `u`.\n    The formula is: `P(edge u,v) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/N) * (1/degree(v))`.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this calculation, showing each number used in the final equation, and prints the final probability.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the parameters of the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# A barbell graph is symmetric, so each clique has half the total nodes\nnodes_per_clique = total_nodes // 2\n\n# Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# The degree is (nodes in its clique - 1) for internal connections, plus 1 for the bottleneck edge.\ndegree_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n# The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) in uniform gossiping is:\n# P(edge) = P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)\n# This simplifies to: P(edge) = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree(u) + 1 / degree(v))\n\n# For the bottleneck edge, let the nodes be u and v.\n# degree(u) and degree(v) are both equal to degree_bottleneck_node.\nprob_bottleneck = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node + 1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n# --- Output the calculation step-by-step ---\nprint(\"To find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph:\")\nprint(f\"\\n1.

Degree of a node connected to the bottleneck: ({nodes_per_clique} - 1) + 1 = {degree_bottleneck_node}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n4.
