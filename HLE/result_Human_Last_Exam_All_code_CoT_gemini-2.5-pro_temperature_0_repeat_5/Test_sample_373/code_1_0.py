# Define the parameters of the barbell graph

# A barbell graph is symmetric, so each clique has half the total nodes
nodes_per_clique = total_nodes // 2

# Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.
# The degree is (nodes in its clique - 1) for internal connections, plus 1 for the bottleneck edge.
degree_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1

# The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) in uniform gossiping is:
# P(edge) = P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)
# This simplifies to: P(edge) = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree(u) + 1 / degree(v))

# For the bottleneck edge, let the nodes be u and v.
# degree(u) and degree(v) are both equal to degree_bottleneck_node.
prob_bottleneck = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node + 1 / degree_bottleneck_node)
