    # Part (a): If g^2 . 1_R = 1_R and x^2 . 1_R in Z(R), does this imply x^j . r is symmetric for all j >= 2?
    # The term "symmetric" is not standardly defined in this context. The given conditions apply
    # specifically to the action on the identity element 1_R. They are not sufficient to
    # guarantee a special property (like being central, or zero, or having some other symmetry)
    # for the action on an arbitrary element r from the ring R.
    # Therefore, we conclude the implication does not hold in general.

    # Part (b): State the value of x^2 a . 1_R when g . 1_R = 0 and q = -1.
    # The formula is x^j a . r = sum_{k=0 to j} C_k * (x.1_R)^(j-k) * (g^k a . r) * (x.1_R)^k
    # where C_k = (-1)^k * q^(-k(k-1)/2) * (j choose k)_{q^-1}.
    # For j=2, q=-1 (so q^-1 = -1), and r=1_R. Let w = x . 1_R.
    # The sum is from k=0 to 2.
    # k=0: C_0 = (-1)^0 * (-1)^0 * (2 choose 0)_(-1) = 1. Term: w^2 * (a . 1_R).
    # k=1: The q-binomial coefficient (2 choose 1)_(-1) is 0. Term: 0.
    # k=2: C_2 = (-1)^2 * (-1)^(-1) * (2 choose 2)_(-1) = -1. Term: -(g^2 a . 1_R) * w^2.

    # For j=3, r=1_R, and w is central.
    # Since w is central, w^(3-k) * (g^k a . 1_R) * w^k = w^3 * (g^k a . 1_R).
    # We can factor out w^3 from the sum.
    # The expression becomes w^3 * [ sum_{k=0 to 3} C_k * (g^k a . 1_R) ], where C_k are the coefficients without the w terms.
    # k=0: C_0 = 1. Term: 1 * (a . 1_R).
    # k=1: C_1 = -1 * (3 choose 1)_{q^-1} = -(1+q^-1+q^-2). Term: -(1+q^-1+q^-2)(g a . 1_R).
    # k=2: C_2 = q^-1 * (3 choose 2)_{q^-1} = q^-1(1+q^-1+q^-2). Term: q^-1(1+q^-1+q^-2)(g^2 a . 1_R).
    # k=3: C_3 = -q^-3 * (3 choose 3)_{q^-1} = -q^-3. Term: -q^-3(g^3 a . 1_R).
