    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to analyze their fundamental optical properties.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the physical requirements for SPDC:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. Its existence in a material depends on the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Relate material symmetry to SPDC:** A fundamental selection rule in nonlinear optics states that for a material to possess a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾, its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Examine the structure of boron nanosheets:** The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, have a centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n4.  **Draw a conclusion:** Because they are centrosymmetric, their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Consequently, second-order processes like SPDC are forbidden and not expected to occur in ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logical deduction.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains whether boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the key property of a typical boron nanosheet (borophene).\n    # The most stable phases (like β12, χ3) are centrosymmetric.\n    has_inversion_symmetry = True\n    \n    print(\"Analysis for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC) in Boron Nanosheets\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the crystal symmetry of the material.\")\n    print(f\"-> Property: Common boron nanosheets have a center of inversion symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"-> Value (True=1, False=0): Inversion_Symmetry = {int(has_inversion_symmetry)}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the selection rule for second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n    # A material with inversion symmetry has a zero bulk χ⁽²⁾.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the physics selection rule for second-order effects.\")\n    print(\"-> Rule: A centrosymmetric material has a second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of zero.\")\n    \n    if has_inversion_symmetry:\n        chi_2_value = 0\n    else:\n        # This case is not applicable for borophene but shown for completeness\n        chi_2_value = \"Non-zero\"\n\n    print(f\"-> Result: χ⁽²⁾ = {chi_2_value}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude whether SPDC is possible.\n    # SPDC is a second-order process and requires a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine if SPDC is expected.\")\n    print(\"-> Rule: SPDC requires a material with χ⁽²⁾ ≠ 0.\")\n\n    if chi_2_value == 0:\n        spdc_expected = False\n    else:\n        spdc_expected = True\n    \n    print(f\"-> Conclusion: SPDC is not expected in ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets.\")\n\n    # Final summary as a logical \"equation\"\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Logical Equation ---\")\n    print(f\"Inversion_Symmetry = {int(has_inversion_symmetry)}\")\n    print(f\"          implies\")\n    print(f\"          χ⁽²⁾ = {chi_2_value}\")\n    print(f\"          implies\")\n    print(f\"SPDC_Expected = {int(spdc_expected)}\")\n\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<No, because the common phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. This symmetry property makes their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) equal to zero, which forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes like spontaneous parametric downconversion.>>>"
