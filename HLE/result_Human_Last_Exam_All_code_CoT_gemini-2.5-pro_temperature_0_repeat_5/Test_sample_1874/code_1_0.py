    This script explains the reasoning to find the second smallest possible cardinal

    # Step 1: Understanding the problem
    # The problem defines a "tower" of length delta on omega_2.
    # This is a standard concept in set theory. The length delta is the size of a
    # well-ordered family of sets with specific properties. We are looking for the
    # second smallest possible cardinal value for delta.

    # Step 2: Deducing properties of the cardinal delta
    # Property 1: The length of a tower, delta, must be a regular cardinal.
    # A cardinal is regular if its cofinality equals itself. If delta were a
    # singular cardinal (i.e., cf(delta) < delta), one could construct a
    # pseudo-intersection for the tower from a shorter sequence of length cf(delta),
    # which contradicts the definition of a tower.

    # Property 2: The length of a tower on omega_2, delta, must be at least omega_2.
    # This is because omega_2 is a regular cardinal, and any sequence of the type
    # described, but with a length less than omega_2, can be shown to have a
    # pseudo-intersection. The minimal length of such a tower is known as the
    # tower number, t(omega_2), and it's a known result that t(kappa) >= cf(kappa).
    # For kappa = omega_2, we have t(omega_2) >= cf(omega_2) = omega_2.

    # Step 3: Identifying the candidate cardinals
    # From the properties above, delta must be a regular cardinal and delta >= omega_2.
    # The cardinals are ordered: 0, 1, ..., omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, ...
    # Successor cardinals (like omega_1, omega_2, omega_3) are always regular.
    # So, the list of regular cardinals starting from omega_2 is:
    # omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, ...

    # Step 4: Determining the smallest and second smallest possible values
    # The smallest possible candidate for delta is omega_2.
    # The second smallest possible candidate for delta is omega_3.

    # The word "possible" implies we should consider what is consistent with the
    # axioms of set theory (ZFC). It is known to be consistent with ZFC that the
    # minimal tower length, t(omega_2), is omega_2. It is also consistent that
    # t(omega_2) is omega_3, or even larger regular cardinals.
    # This means that both omega_2 and omega_3 are indeed possible lengths for a tower.

    # Step 5: Conclusion
    # The smallest possible cardinal delta is omega_2.
    # The second smallest possible cardinal delta is omega_3.

    print("The problem asks for the second smallest cardinal delta for a specific type of tower on omega_2.")
    print("Based on the properties of such towers in set theory, we can deduce the following:")
    print("1. The cardinal delta must be a regular cardinal.")
    print("2. The cardinal delta must be greater than or equal to omega_2.")
    print("\nThe regular cardinals greater than or equal to omega_2 are omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, and so on.")
    print("It is consistent with ZFC that towers of these lengths can exist.")
    print("\nTherefore:")
    print("The smallest possible cardinal for delta is omega_2.")
    print("The second smallest possible cardinal for delta is omega_3.")

    # Final Answer Output
    # The prompt asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    # The final answer is the cardinal omega_3.
    print("\nFinal Answer:")
    print("omega_3")
