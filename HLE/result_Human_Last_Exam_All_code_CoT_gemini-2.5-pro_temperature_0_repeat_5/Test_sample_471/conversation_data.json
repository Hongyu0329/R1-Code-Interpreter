    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will use a key result from topology and calculus called Morse Theory, which connects the number of critical points of a function on a surface to the shape (topology) of that surface.\n2.  The topology of the 2-torus ($T^2$) is captured by its Betti numbers, which count the number of \"holes\" of different dimensions. I will state these numbers.\n3.  The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of a certain type (minimum, saddle, maximum) must be at least the corresponding Betti number.\n4.  By summing these minimums, I will find the minimal total number of critical points. This result for \"nice\" functions (called Morse functions) is, in fact, the minimum for any smooth function on the torus.\n5.  I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the final calculation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_torus_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the minimal number of critical points for a smooth\n    function on a 2-torus using principles from Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R on a 2-torus.\")\n    print(\"The solution is based on Morse theory, which relates the number of critical points of a function to the topology of its domain.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the topological invariants of the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # The Betti numbers (b_k) describe the 'holes' in a topological space.\n    b_0 = 1  # Number of connected components.\n    b_1 = 2  # Number of one-dimensional 'circular' holes.\n    b_2 = 1  # Number of two-dimensional 'voids'.\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Betti numbers of the 2-torus (T^2)\")\n    print(f\"b_0 (connected components) = {b_0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 (circular holes)      = {b_1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 (voids)               = {b_2}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the Morse inequalities.\n    # For a 'nice' smooth function (a Morse function), the number of critical points\n    # of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\n    # c_0 >= b_0 (minima)\n    # c_1 >= b_1 (saddles)\n    # c_2 >= b_2 (maxima)\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying the Morse Inequalities\")\n    print(\"The Morse inequalities state that for any Morse function, the number of critical points of a certain type (c_k) must be at least the corresponding Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(f\" - Number of minima (c_0) >= b_0 = {b_0}\")\n    print(f\" - Number of saddles (c_1) >= b_1 = {b_1}\")\n    print(f\" - Number of maxima (c_2) >= b_2 = {b_2}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the minimal total number of critical points.\n    # The total number of critical points is the sum of the c_k.\n    # The minimal number is therefore the sum of the b_k.\n    min_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the minimal number of critical points\")\n    print(\"The minimal number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum of the minimal numbers for each type.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_points}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 4: Justification and Conclusion\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion\")\n    print(\"This result can be proven to be the minimum for *any* smooth function, not just Morse functions.\")\n    print(\"A function with fewer than 4 points would violate a fundamental property related to the Euler characteristic of the torus (which is 0).\")\n    print(\"An example function with exactly 4 critical points exists, confirming that 4 is achievable.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus is {min_points}.\")\n\nsolve_torus_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
