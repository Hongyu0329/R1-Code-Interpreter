    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The given equations describe a Lissajous curve. These curves are defined by `x(t) = A*sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B*sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, with parameters `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for self-intersections:** For a Lissajous curve with parametric equations `x(t) = cos(at)` and `y(t) = sin(bt)`, where `a` and `b` are integers, there is a standard formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n3.  **Check the conditions:** The formula `N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2` applies when `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). Let's check this for our parameters:\n    *   `a = 9`\n    *   `b = 5`\n    *   The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1. So, the parameters are coprime.\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** We can now apply the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the Lissajous curve\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# The formula for the number of self-intersections for a curve\n# (cos(at), sin(bt)) with coprime a and b is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\n# Calculate the intermediate values for the formula\na_minus_1 = a - 1\nb_minus_1 = b - 1\nnumerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\nnum_intersections = numerator // 2\n\n# Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"The curve is defined by the parametric equations (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)).\")\nprint(\"To find the number of self-intersections, we use the formula N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\nprint(f\"N = {num_intersections}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
