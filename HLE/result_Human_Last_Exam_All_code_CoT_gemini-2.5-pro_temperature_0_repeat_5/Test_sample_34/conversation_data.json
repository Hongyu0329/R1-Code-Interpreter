    "This problem can be solved by consulting a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening chart for a 100BB deep, 6-max No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the position: The user is asking about opening from the \"button\" (BTN), which is the most profitable position in poker.\n2.  Analyze the action: An open-raise to 2.5x is a standard size. The rake-free environment slightly encourages opening a wider range of hands than a raked game.\n3.  Consult GTO ranges: In a standard GTO button opening range, you play a very wide selection of hands, often around 45-50%. This includes all suited aces, most suited kings, queens, and jacks.\n4.  Evaluate suited Jacks (Jxs): The value of a suited hand containing a Jack is determined by its high-card strength, flush potential, and straight potential. While all suited Jacks can make flushes, their strength as a pair or a straight varies. The hands are ranked as follows: JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n5.  Determine the \"worst\" hand: The \"worst\" hand that is still considered a profitable open is the one at the very bottom of this range. According to GTO solvers, all suited Jacks are opened from the button for 2.5x. The hand with the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity is Jack-Two suited. Therefore, J2s is the worst suited Jack you should open from the button.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this logic by defining the range of suited Jacks opened from the button and identifying the weakest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game\n    based on standard GTO pre-flop charts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In GTO, all suited Jacks are opened from the button.\n    # We list them here to identify the weakest one.\n    # The format is 'J' followed by the other card's rank and 's' for suited.\n    # Card ranks are represented as: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2\n    \n    # We can map card ranks to a numerical value for comparison.\n    rank_to_value = {\n        'A': 14, 'K': 13, 'Q': 12, 'T': 10, '9': 9, '8': 8, \n        '7': 7, '6': 6, '5': 5, '4': 4, '3': 3, '2': 2\n    }\n\n    # All suited hands with a Jack are opened from the button in this scenario.\n    # The other cards in these hands are A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.\n    all_suited_jacks = [f\"J{rank}s\" for rank in rank_to_value if rank != 'J']\n\n    # The \"worst\" hand is the one with the lowest ranked second card (kicker).\n    worst_hand = \"\"\n    lowest_value = float('inf')\n\n    for hand in all_suited_jacks:\n        # The second character in the string is the kicker.\n        kicker_rank = hand[1]\n        kicker_value = rank_to_value[kicker_rank]\n        \n        if kicker_value < lowest_value:\n            lowest_value = kicker_value\n            worst_hand = hand\n            \n    print(\"Based on standard GTO pre-flop charts for a 100BB rake-free cash game:\")\n    print(\"The button opens a very wide range, including all suited Jack combinations.\")\n    print(\"The strength of these hands is primarily determined by the rank of the second card (the 'kicker').\")\n    print(f\"The weakest kicker paired with a Jack is a 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the worst suited Jack to open from the button is:\")\n    print(worst_hand)\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
