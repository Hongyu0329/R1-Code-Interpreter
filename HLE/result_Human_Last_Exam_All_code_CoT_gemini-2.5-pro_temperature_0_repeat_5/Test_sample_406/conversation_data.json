    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that is a simultaneous solution to a system of three equations involving three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. The existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically guaranteed by conditions derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, applied to an operator on the product of the spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that prints a clear, step-by-step explanation of these conditions.\n\n1.  **Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: I will start by stating the system of equations that a point `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n2.  **State the Conditions for Existence**: I will outline the three main conditions required by the theorem:\n    *   The properties of the underlying spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n    *   The contractive conditions that the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy. These conditions involve inequalities and non-negative constants.\n    *   The final condition on these constants which ensures the overall mapping is a contraction, thus guaranteeing a unique fixed point.\n3.  **Final Output**: As requested, the script will conclude by printing the defining equations of the fixed point.\n\nThe script will not perform any calculations but will use `print` statements to present the mathematical theory in a structured way.\n\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script explains the conditions for functions F, G, and H to have a tripled fixed point.\")\n    print(\"The analysis is based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a product space.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Definition of the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(\"1.
