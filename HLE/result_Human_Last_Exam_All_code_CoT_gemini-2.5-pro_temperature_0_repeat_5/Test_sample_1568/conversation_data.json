    "To solve the given infinite product, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate the product to a full infinite product:** The product starts from `n=3`. I will express it in terms of the full product starting from `n=1` by dividing out the terms for `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  **Factor the general term:** The term `1 - x^3` can be factored using the complex cube roots of unity, $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The factorization is $1 - x^3 = (1-x)(1-\\omega x)(1-\\omega^2 x)$. Applying this to our product term gives:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Use the Gamma function product representation:** The Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function is key here. A useful form is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{-\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right) e^{x/n} $$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the full infinite product:** By applying the Gamma function representation to the factored product and using the property that $1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$, the exponential convergence factors and the gamma constant terms cancel out. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the full product:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n5.  **Combine the results:** Substituting this back into the expression from step 1 gives the final answer. The terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$ are $(1 - z^3)$ and $(1 - z^3/8)$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final, simplified expression for the infinite product.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to evaluate the infinite product from n=3 to infinity of (1 - z^3/n^3).\n# The solution is derived using the product representation of the Gamma function.\n# The final expression involves the Gamma function and the complex cube roots of unity.\n# This script prints the final formula as a string.\n\n# The numbers in the final equation are derived from the starting index 3,\n# which leads to factoring out terms for n=1 and n=2.\n# 1^3 = 1\n# 2^3 = 8\n# The cube roots of unity are represented using exp(2*pi*i/3) and exp(4*pi*i/3).\n# The numbers in the final equation are 1, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nprint(\"1 / ( (1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)) )\")\n```\n<<<$1 / ( (1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*i/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*i/3)) )$>>>"
