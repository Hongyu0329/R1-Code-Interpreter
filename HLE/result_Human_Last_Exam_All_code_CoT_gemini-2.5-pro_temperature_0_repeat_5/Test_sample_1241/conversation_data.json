    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nWhen the probabilities are constant, their derivatives with respect to time are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This simplifies the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set up the system of linear equations:** By setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, we obtain a system of algebraic equations for $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n    *   $0 = -0.019 p_{0} + 0.65 p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = 0.019 p_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) p_{1} + 0.392 p_{2} + 0.008 p_{3}$\n    *   $0 = 0.4 p_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = 0.008 p_{2} - 0.008 p_{3}$\n2.  **Add the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1.\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Solve the system:** The system of equations is overdetermined (5 equations for 4 unknowns), but the sum of the first four equations is zero, meaning one of them is redundant. We can select three independent equations from the first four and combine them with the normalization condition to form a solvable system of 4 equations for 4 unknowns. This system can be written in matrix form $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will use the `numpy` library to define the matrix `A` and vector `b` and then solve for the probability vector $\\mathbf{p} = [p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3]$ using `numpy.linalg.solve`.\n5.  **Calculate the final result:** Once we have the values for $p_0$ and $p_1$, we can compute their sum. The script will print the individual probabilities and their sum in a clear format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations for the steady state (p_i' = 0).\n# We will use the following equations:\n# 1. lambda_01*p0 - lambda_10*p1 = 0\n# 2. lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 = 0\n# 3. lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 = 0\n# 4. p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# This can be written in the matrix form A*p = b.\n\n# Step 3: Define the matrix A and vector b\nA = np.array([\n    [lambda_01, -lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Step 4: Solve the system of equations for p = [p0, p1, p2, p3]\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0 = p[0]\n    p1 = p[1]\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the required sum P0(+inf) + P1(+inf)\n    result = p0 + p1\n    \n    # Print the values of each probability and the final sum as an equation\n    print(f\"The steady-state probability P0(+inf) is: {p0}\")\n    print(f\"The steady-state probability P1(+inf) is: {p1}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
