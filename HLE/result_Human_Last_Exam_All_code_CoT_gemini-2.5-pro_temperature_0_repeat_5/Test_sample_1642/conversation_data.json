    "This problem asks for the maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard without queens of the same color attacking each other.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The condition \"without attacking each other\" is best interpreted in the standard way for this type of combinatorial problem: queens of the same color do not attack each other. This means we are looking for two independent, non-attacking configurations of `m` queens that occupy different squares.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Mathematical Question:** The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum `m` for which two disjoint `m`-queens solutions exist on a 16x16 board.\n\n3.  **Determine the Upper Bound:** The maximum number of non-attacking queens of a single color on a 16x16 board is 16. Therefore, `m` cannot be greater than 16. The question then becomes whether `m = 16` is achievable.\n\n4.  **Develop a Constructive Proof via Code:** It is a known result in mathematics that for any NÃ—N board with `N >= 4`, it's possible to find at least two disjoint N-queens solutions. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this for N=16. The script will:\n    *   Use a known algorithm to construct a 16-queens solution (`P1`).\n    *   Create a second solution (`P2`) by reflecting the first one.\n    *   Verify that both `P1` and `P2` are valid non-attacking configurations.\n    *   Verify that `P1` and `P2` are disjoint (i.e., no queen from `P1` is on the same square as a queen from `P2`).\n    *   If the verifications pass, the maximum `m` is 16. The code will then print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on an N x N chessboard without same-color attacks.\n    This is demonstrated for N=16.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 16\n\n    # This problem is equivalent to finding if two disjoint N-queens solutions exist.\n    # If they do, m_max = N.
