    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, focusing on architectural or structural changes that occurred around the year 1950. I will look for a specific feature that was present before this time and was subsequently removed by the city's administration. Once I have identified this feature, I will write a Python script to present the answer clearly, as you requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_historical_feature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about a feature removed from\n    Piazza della Rotonda around 1950.\n    \"\"\"\n    year_of_removal = 1950\n    feature_name = \"The tram lines\"\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda, Rome\"\n    \n    print(f\"The unique feature removed from the {location} around the year {year_of_removal} was:\")\n    print(f\">>> {feature_name}\")\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"For the first half of the 20th century, tram lines ran directly through the piazza, \"\n        \"passing in front of the Pantheon. These lines were a significant part of the city's landscape. \"\n        \"As part of a post-war modernization plan and to reduce vibrations and pollution near the ancient monument, \"\n        \"the city administration removed the tramway from the historic center, including the tracks in the piazza.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_historical_feature()\n```\n<<<The tram lines>>>"
