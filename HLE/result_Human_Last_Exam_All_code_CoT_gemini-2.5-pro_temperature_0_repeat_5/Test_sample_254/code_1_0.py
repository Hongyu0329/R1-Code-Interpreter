Also, consistency is a consequence of the more fundamental transitivity assumption.",

It is not sufficient for NMA because the network could be perfectly homogeneous within each link, but still be invalid if the transitivity assumption is violated (e.g., A-B trials are in young patients, B-C trials are in old patients)."
