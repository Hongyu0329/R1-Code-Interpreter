    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem that can be solved by identifying the reactants and the type of reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The reaction is between butadiene (a conjugated diene, CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (an alkene/dienophile, CCl₂=CF₂). This setup is perfect for a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n2.  **Predict Product Structure:** In a Diels-Alder reaction, the four pi-electrons from the diene and the two pi-electrons from the dienophile rearrange to form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the dienophile form a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   A new double bond is formed between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original butadiene molecule.\n    *   The substituents on the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) remain attached to their respective carbons in the newly formed ring.\n3.  **Determine Product Name (IUPAC):** The resulting molecule is **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene**.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** To provide a computational solution, I will use the `rdkit` library, a powerful toolkit for cheminformatics. The script will:\n    *   Define the reactants using their SMILES strings.\n    *   Define the Diels-Alder reaction using a reaction SMARTS pattern.\n    *   Execute the reaction to generate the product.\n    *   Calculate the product's chemical formula and print the full reaction equation.\n\n```python\n# The user must have the rdkit library installed.\n# If not, run: pip install rdkit\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'rdkit' library is required to run this code.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using the command: pip install rdkit\")\n    exit()\n\n# Step 1: Define the reactants by their SMILES strings\ndiene_smiles = \"C=CC=C\"\ndiene_name = \"Butadiene\"\ndiene_mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(diene_smiles)\ndiene_formula = CalcMolFormula(diene_mol)\n\ndienophile_smiles = \"C(=C(F)F)(Cl)Cl\"\ndienophile_name = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\"\ndienophile_mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(dienophile_smiles)\ndienophile_formula = CalcMolFormula(dienophile_mol)\n\n# Step 2: Define the Diels-Alder reaction using a reaction SMARTS string\n# This template maps atoms from reactants to products: [diene].[dienophile]>>[product]\nrxn_smarts = \"[cH2:1]=[cH:2][cH:3]=[cH2:4].[c:5](F)(F)=[c:6](Cl)(Cl)>>[c:1]1[c:2]=[c:3][c:4][c:6](Cl)(Cl)[c:5]1(F)(F)\"\nrxn = AllChem.ReactionFromSmarts(rxn_smarts)\n\n# Step 3: Run the reaction with the defined reactants\nreactants = (diene_mol, dienophile_mol)\nproducts = rxn.RunReactants(reactants)\n\n# Step 4: Process and display the results\nprint(\"The reaction is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\nif products:\n    # The reaction was successful, so we extract the first product molecule\n    product_mol = products[0][0]\n    Chem.SanitizeMol(product_mol)\n\n    # Determine product information\n    product_formula = CalcMolFormula(product_mol)\n    # The IUPAC name is determined based on chemical naming conventions\n    product_name = \"3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene\"\n\n    # Print the final equation, including the stoichiometric numbers (coefficients)\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"1 {diene_name} ({diene_formula}) + 1 {dienophile_name} ({dienophile_formula}) -> 1 {product_name} ({product_formula})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not determine the product computationally.\")\n\n<<<3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
