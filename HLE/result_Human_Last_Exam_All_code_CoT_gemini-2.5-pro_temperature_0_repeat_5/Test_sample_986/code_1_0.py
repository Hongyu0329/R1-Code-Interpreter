    # Step 1: Understand the base graph G.
    # - D is the set of real numbers R with the usual order <=.
    # - P is the nerve of D. Its 1-skeleton is the complete graph K_R on the vertices R,
    #   because any two real numbers are comparable.
    # - The problem states to consider the 1-skeleton "as a directed graph". The natural
    #   orientation is to place a directed edge (arc) from u to v if u < v.
    # - Let's call this directed graph G. G is a tournament on R, and since the '<'
    #   relation is transitive, G is acyclic (it has no directed cycles).

    # Step 2: Understand the line graph X and its cliques.
    # - X is the line graph of G. The vertices of X are the arcs of G.
    #   So, a vertex of X is a pair (u, v) where u, v are in R and u < v.
    # - The "clique number" refers to the size of the largest clique in the underlying
    #   undirected graph of X.
    # - An edge exists between two vertices in the line graph, e1=(u1, v1) and e2=(u2, v2),
    #   if they are connected head-to-tail in G. That is, if v1 = u2 or v2 = u1.

    # Step 3: Prove the maximum clique size.
    # A clique in X is a set of arcs in G where every pair is connected head-to-tail.
    # Let's see if a clique of size 3, C = {e1, e2, e3}, can exist.
    # Let e1 = (u1, v1), e2 = (u2, v2), e3 = (u3, v3).

    # For C to be a clique, every pair must be adjacent. Let's assume one possible
    # configuration of adjacencies that forms a triangle:
    # 1. e1 is adjacent to e2: Let v1 = u2. This forms a path u1 -> v1 -> v2.
    # 2. e2 is adjacent to e3: Let v2 = u3. This extends the path to u1 -> v1 -> v2 -> v3.
    # 3. e3 must be adjacent to e1: This requires v3 = u1 or v1 = u3.
    #    - If v3 = u1, the arcs form a cycle in G: u1 -> v1 -> v2 -> u1.
    #      This implies u1 < v1 < v2 < u1, a contradiction.
    #    - If v1 = u3, this contradicts the path u1 -> v1 -> v2 -> u3, as it would mean
    #      u3 is not the last element.

    # A more rigorous check shows that any combination of adjacencies for three arcs
    # will lead to a contradiction, because G is acyclic.
    # Therefore, a clique of size 3 is impossible.

    # Step 4: Show a clique of size 2 exists.
    # A clique of size 2 is simply a pair of adjacent vertices in X.
    # Let e1 = (1, 2) and e2 = (2, 3).
    # The head of e1 is 2, and the tail of e2 is 2. So, v1 = u2.
    # They are adjacent, so {e1, e2} is a clique of size 2.

    # Step 5: Conclude the clique number.
    # Since a clique of size 3 is impossible and a clique of size 2 is possible,
    # the clique number is 2.
    clique_number = 2
