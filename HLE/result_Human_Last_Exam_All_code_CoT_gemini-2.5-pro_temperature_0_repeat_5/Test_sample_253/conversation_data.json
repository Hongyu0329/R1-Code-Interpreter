    "To solve this, I will simulate the 1D cellular automaton Rule 110.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent the Automaton:** I'll use a list of integers (0s and 1s) to represent the row of cells. The list will be wide enough to allow the pattern to grow for 20 steps without hitting the boundaries.\n2.  **Define Rule 110:** The rule determines the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. The 8 possible 3-cell patterns map to the new cell state as follows (from the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`):\n    *   `111` -> 0\n    *   `110` -> 1\n    *   `101` -> 1\n    *   `100` -> 0\n    *   `011` -> 1\n    *   `010` -> 1\n    *   `001` -> 1\n    *   `000` -> 0\n3.  **Initial State:** The simulation starts with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by 0s.\n4.  **Simulation Loop:** I will write a loop that runs 20 times. In each iteration, it will calculate the next generation's pattern by applying Rule 110 to every cell in the current generation. For cells at the edge of our list, their non-existent neighbors are treated as 0.\n5.  **Final Output:** After 20 iterations, the code will print the final binary pattern, trimming any excess leading or trailing zeros.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Rule 110 for 20 generations starting from a single '1' cell\n    and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    generations = 20\n    # Set a width large enough for the pattern to evolve without hitting the edges.\n    # The pattern grows by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    width = 2 * generations + 41\n\n    # Rule 110 is defined by the binary number 01101110.\n    # This dictionary maps each 3-cell neighborhood to the next state of the center cell.\n    rules = {\n        (1, 1, 1): 0,\n        (1, 1, 0): 1,\n        (1, 0, 1): 1,\n        (1, 0, 0): 0,\n        (0, 1, 1): 1,\n        (0, 1, 0): 1,\n        (0, 0, 1): 1,\n        (0, 0, 0): 0\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the automaton with a single '1' in the center.\n    cells = [0] * width\n    cells[width // 2] = 1\n\n    # Evolve the automaton for the specified number of generations.\n    for _ in range(generations):\n        next_cells = [0] * width\n        # Iterate through each cell to determine its next state.\n        # We can skip the outermost cells as they will remain 0.\n        for i in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Get the 3-cell neighborhood.\n            neighborhood = (cells[i - 1], cells[i], cells[i + 1])\n            # Apply the rule to find the new state.\n            next_cells[i] = rules[neighborhood]\n        \n        # Update the cells for the next generation.\n        cells = next_cells\n\n    # Convert the list of integers to a string.\n    final_pattern_str = \"\".join(map(str, cells))\n\n    # Trim leading and trailing zeros to get the essential pattern.\n    trimmed_pattern = final_pattern_str.strip('0')\n\n    # Print the final binary pattern.\n    print(trimmed_pattern)\n\nsolve_rule_110()\n```\n<<<11011101111001101111>>>"
