    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I'll clarify the structure of the graph \\( G \\). The problem states that \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" typically refers to the **graph join** operation (denoted by '+'). The join of graphs is created by taking the disjoint union of their vertices and adding edges connecting every vertex of one graph to every vertex of the others. So, \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** I'll use the well-known formula for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This formula extends to the sum of three graphs, meaning \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( C_n \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on its length \\( n \\):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Result:** The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize the sum \\( \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\), I need to choose the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Finally, I'll substitute the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into the equation to find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\). The code will print out this final calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Defining the graph G and the 'sum' operation.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum of three cycles of length n, which we can write as G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\")\n    print(\"The 'sum' operation in this context is the graph join.
