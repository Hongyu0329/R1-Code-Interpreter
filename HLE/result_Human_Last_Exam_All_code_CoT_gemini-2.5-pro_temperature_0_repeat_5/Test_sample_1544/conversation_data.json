    "Based on the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`, here is the step-by-step analysis to find White's best move.\n\n### Plan and Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position**:\n    *   **White's Assets**: White has a strong passed pawn on d6, which is a major strategic advantage.\n    *   **White's Problems**: White's king on g1 is far from the central action. Black's queen on c5 is extremely active, attacking the d6-pawn and controlling key squares. Black is also ahead in material value if we only count the pawns.\n    *   **Black's Strengths**: Black's king on b6 is actively placed. The queen on c5 is the most powerful piece on the board.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves**:\n    *   White's only piece that can move is the queen on f2.\n    *   **Passive Moves**: Moves like `Qe1` or `Qg2` are too slow. They allow Black to consolidate or attack. For instance, after `1. Qg2`, Black can simply play `1...Qxd6`, and White's position collapses. Any move that doesn't immediately create a threat allows Black to capture the key d6-pawn.\n    *   **Checks**: Checks like `1. Qe3+` or `1. Qf5+` are met by `1...Kc7`. If White then proceeds with `2. Qxc5+ bxc5`, the resulting pawn endgame is actually *worse* for White than the main line, because Black's king is now on c7, perfectly positioned to deal with the d6-pawn.\n    *   **The Best Move - Queen Trade**: The most forcing and effective move is `1. Qxc5+`. This move liquidates Black's most dangerous piece and transitions the game into a pawn endgame.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Resulting Pawn Endgame**:\n    *   After `1. Qxc5+`, Black is forced to recapture with `1...bxc5`.\n    *   The new position is: `8/3p4/2pP4/p1p5/P7/8/8/6K1 w - - 1 2`.\n    *   This is a pawn endgame. White's king must rush from g1 towards the center. Black's king is already well-placed on b6, and Black has a new passed pawn on c5.\n    *   With optimal play, the sequence would be: `2. Kf2 c4 3. Ke3 c3 4. Kd3`. White's king successfully stops the c-pawn. Black's king will then capture White's d-pawn (`4...Kc7 5. Kxc3 Kxd6`).\n    *   The resulting position is a known theoretical draw. White's active king can counter Black's remaining pawns, and neither side can force a win.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince all other moves for White lead to a losing position, the move that forces a drawn endgame is the best possible move. Therefore, `Qxc5+` is the correct choice.\n\n```python\n# This script determines and prints the best move for White.\n#\n# The position is 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1.\n# White is under pressure, and the only move that does not lead to a loss\n# is to trade queens, forcing a drawn pawn endgame.\n#\n# The principal variation, which can be considered the \"final equation\" of this position,\n# is 1. Qxc5+ bxc5. The numbers in this notation are 1, 5, and 5.\n# The best move for White is the first part of this sequence.\n\nbest_move = \"Qxc5+\"\nprint(best_move)\n```\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
