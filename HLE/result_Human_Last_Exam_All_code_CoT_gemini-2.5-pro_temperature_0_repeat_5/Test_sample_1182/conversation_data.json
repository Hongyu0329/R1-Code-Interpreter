    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we can use the theory of stable reduction for hyperelliptic curves. The number of double points (nodes) is related to the genus of the curve and the structure of its stable reduction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the genus of the curve.** The curve is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial. The genus $g$ is given by $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f) - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$.\n2.  **Analyze the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.** The structure of the stable reduction is determined by how the roots of $f(x)$ cluster together in the 2-adic metric. We find the 2-adic valuations of the roots using the Newton polygon of $f(x)$.\n3.  **Identify the root clusters.** Two roots belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic distance is small (i.e., $v_2(r_1 - r_2) > 0$). The number of clusters gives the number of components, $N$, in the stable reduction.\n4.  **Calculate the genus of each component.** For each cluster of roots $S$, the corresponding component in the stable reduction has a geometric genus $g_S = \\lfloor (|S| - 1) / 2 \\rfloor$.\n5.  **Apply the genus formula for reducible curves.** The arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is equal to the genus of the original curve. The formula is:\n    $g = \\sum g_S + \\delta - N + 1$\n    where $\\delta$ is the total number of double points (nodes) we want to find.\n6.  **Solve for $\\delta$.** We will substitute the known values of $g$, $\\sum g_S$, and $N$ into the formula and solve for $\\delta$.\n\nThis entire process can be implemented in a Python script. The script will perform the calculations and print out the values used in the final formula to determine the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_v2(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the 2-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    count = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef get_newton_polygon_slopes(points):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the slopes and their lengths of the lower convex hull (Newton polygon).\n    Points are given as a dictionary {i: v_i}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert dict to list of tuples and sort by x-coordinate\n    sorted_points = sorted(points.items())\n    \n    # Find the lower convex hull using Graham scan idea\n    hull = []\n    for p in sorted_points:\n        while len(hull) >= 2 and \\\n              (hull[-1][1] - hull[-2][1]) * (p[0] - hull[-1][0]) >= \\\n              (p[1] - hull[-1][1]) * (hull[-1][0] - hull[-2][0]):\n            hull.pop()\n        hull.append(p)\n        \n    slopes = []\n    for i in range(len(hull) - 1):\n        p1 = hull[i]\n        p2 = hull[i+1]\n        slope_num = p2[1] - p1[1]\n        slope_den = p2[0] - p1[0]\n        length = slope_den\n        slopes.append({'slope': slope_num / slope_den, 'length': length})\n        \n    return slopes\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the genus of the curve\n    # y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x\n    # The degree of f(x) is 5.\n    degree_f = 5\n    g = (degree_f - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze the roots of f(x)\n    # f(x) = x * (8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)\n    # One root is r_0 = 0.\n    # The other four roots are the roots of g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8\n    g_coeffs = {4: 8, 3: 4, 2: 4, 1: 1, 0: 8}\n    \n    # Get 2-adic valuations of coefficients of g(x)\n    g_valuations = {i: get_v2(c) for i, c in g_coeffs.items()}\n    \n    # Get slopes of the Newton polygon for g(x)\n    slopes_info = get_newton_polygon_slopes(g_valuations)\n    \n    # The valuations of the roots of g(x) are the negative of the slopes.\n    g_root_valuations = []\n    for s in slopes_info:\n        for _ in range(s['length']):\n            g_root_valuations.append(-s['slope'])\n            \n    # Full set of root valuations for f(x)\n    # v2(r_0) is infinite, but we treat it as a distinct root.\n    # Let's denote the roots as r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\n    # v2(r_0) = inf\n    # v2(r_1) = 3.0 (from slope -3)\n    # v2(r_2) = v2(r_3) = v2(r_4) = -1.0 (from slope 1)\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify the root clusters\n    # Two roots r_i, r_j are in the same cluster if v2(r_i - r_j) > 0.\n    # Cluster 1: {r_0, r_1}. v2(r_0 - r_1) = v2(r_1) = 3 > 0.\n    # For r_i where i > 1, v2(r_0 - r_i) = v2(r_i) = -1 <= 0.\n    # For r_i where i > 1, v2(r_1 - r_i) = min(v2(r_1), v2(r_i)) = min(3, -1) = -1 <= 0.\n    # For r_i, r_j with i,j > 1, we need to check v2(r_i - r_j).\n    # These roots have valuation -1.
