    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the antecedent part, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership grade of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, using a t-norm operation. The most commonly used t-norm for this purpose is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values to find the rule activation level, `w`.\n3.  The formula is `w = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`.\n4.  Print the formula, the values used, and the final calculated result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set\n    using a minimum t-norm operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n    # The rule activation level (w) is calculated by applying a t-norm\n    # to the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership grade.\n    # We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common choice.\n    # Formula: w = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with the result\n    print(\"The rule activation level (w) is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\n    print(f\"w = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\n    print(f\"w = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\n    print(f\"The final rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_activation_level()\n<<<0.7>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set given Phi_k(x′)=0.7 and μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9 using a t-norm operation?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
