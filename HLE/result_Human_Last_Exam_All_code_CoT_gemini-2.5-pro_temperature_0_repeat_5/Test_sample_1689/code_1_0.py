    # The patient's history (new workout clothes, sweating) and physical exam findings
    # (rash on the posterior axillary folds, sparing the vaults) strongly suggest
    # allergic contact dermatitis from textiles.
    # A topical steroid (C) is a treatment, not a diagnostic tool.
    # A skin biopsy (A) or KOH prep (B) are less specific for this presentation.
    # The gold standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis and identifying the
    # specific allergen is the patch test. The case narrative itself confirms this
    # by stating a patch test was performed and was positive.
