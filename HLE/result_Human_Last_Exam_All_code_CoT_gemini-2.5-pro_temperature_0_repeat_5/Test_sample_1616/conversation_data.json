    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will define the linguistic rule known as \"trisyllabic laxing\" (or trisyllabic shortening). This rule states that a long vowel in a base word becomes short when a suffix is added that makes the word at least three syllables long, and the vowel in question is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable.\n2.  Next, I will analyze each word from the provided list against this rule.\n    *   For each word, I will identify its base or root word and the vowel sound in that root.\n    *   I will count the syllables in the given word.\n    *   I will check if the word is three or more syllables long and if the relevant vowel has been shortened.\n3.  Words that are only two syllables long (`disyllabic`) cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing by definition.\n4.  Words that are three or more syllables long and show the long-to-short vowel change are examples of trisyllabic laxing.\n5.  The word that does not fit the pattern of vowel shortening via suffixation will be the answer. I will write a Python script to print this analysis step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\")\n    print(\"Rule: Trisyllabic laxing shortens a long vowel when it's in the third-to-last syllable of a word of 3+ syllables.\\n\")\n\n    words_analysis = [\n        {\n            \"word\": \"southern\",\n            \"root\": \"'south' (long vowel/diphthong /aʊ/)\",\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"result\": \"NOT an example.
