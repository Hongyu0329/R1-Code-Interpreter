    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of component submatrices that constitute the Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) representation of a single matrix and then account for the two matrices involved in a multiplication.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the Tree Structure:** We'll interpret a \"depth 4\" tree as having 5 levels of nodes (from level 0 at the root to level 4 at the leaves). We will calculate the total number of nodes, leaf nodes, and internal nodes in such a tree.\n2.  **Count Submatrices for One HSS Matrix:** An HSS matrix is not stored as a single large block but as a collection of smaller matrices associated with the tree nodes. We will count the number of these component matrices based on standard HSS definitions:\n    *   Dense (`D`) matrices for the leaf nodes.\n    *   Transfer (`B`) matrices for the internal nodes.\n    *   Basis (`U` and `V`) matrices for every node.\n3.  **Calculate Total for Matrix Multiplication:** A matrix multiplication `C = A * B` in the HSS format involves constructing the HSS representation of `C` by using the representations of `A` and `B`. This means we must access all the component submatrices of both `A` and `B`. The total count will be the sum of submatrices for both matrices.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and calculates the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    # In graph theory, a tree of depth 'k' has k+1 levels of nodes, from 0 to k.\n    k = 4\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the structure of an HSS tree with depth 4.\")\n    print(f\"A tree of depth k = {k} has {k+1} levels of nodes (from level 0 to {k}).\")\n\n    # Calculate the number of nodes in the tree.\n    # The number of nodes at level 'l' in a binary tree is 2^l.\n    # The total number of nodes is the sum from l=0 to k of 2^l, which is 2^(k+1) - 1.\n    total_nodes = 2**(k + 1) - 1\n    \n    # Leaf nodes are at the deepest level, k.\n    num_leaves = 2**k\n    \n    # Internal nodes are all nodes that are not leaves.\n    num_internal_nodes = total_nodes - num_leaves\n    \n    print(f\" - Number of leaf nodes (at level {k}): 2^{k} = {num_leaves}\")\n    print(f\" - Number of internal nodes (levels 0 to {k-1}): {total_nodes} - {num_leaves} = {num_internal_nodes}\")\n    print(f\" - Total nodes in the tree: {num_leaves} + {num_internal_nodes} = {total_nodes}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Counting the component submatrices for a single HSS matrix.\")\n    print(\"The HSS representation consists of several types of smaller matrices:\")\n    \n    # 'D' matrices: One dense block for each leaf node.\n    num_D_matrices = num_leaves\n    print(f\" - 'D' matrices (for leaves): {num_D_matrices}\")\n\n    # 'B' matrices: Two transfer matrices for each internal node.\n    num_B_matrices = 2 * num_internal_nodes\n    print(f\" - 'B' matrices (for internal nodes): 2 * {num_internal_nodes} = {num_B_matrices}\")\n\n    # 'U' and 'V' matrices: One of each basis matrix for every node in the tree.\n    num_U_matrices = total_nodes\n    num_V_matrices = total_nodes\n    print(f\" - 'U' basis matrices (for all nodes): {num_U_matrices}\")\n    print(f\" - 'V' basis matrices (for all nodes): {num_V_matrices}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the total number of submatrices for one HSS matrix.\n    total_submatrices_one_matrix = num_D_matrices + num_B_matrices + num_U_matrices + num_V_matrices\n    print(\"The total number of submatrices to represent one HSS matrix is the sum of these components:\")\n    print(f\"   {num_D_matrices} (D) + {num_B_matrices} (B) + {num_U_matrices} (U) + {num_V_matrices} (V) = {total_submatrices_one_matrix}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the total submatrices accessed during multiplication.\")\n    print(\"A matrix multiplication C = A * B requires the HSS representations of both A and B.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, we must access all component submatrices of both input matrices.\\n\")\n\n    # The final calculation for two matrices.\n    total_accessed_submatrices = total_submatrices_one_matrix * 2\n    \n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Accessed Submatrices = (Submatrices in A) + (Submatrices in B)\")\n    print(f\"                           = {total_submatrices_one_matrix} + {total_submatrices_one_matrix} = {total_accessed_submatrices}\")\n\nsolve_hss_multiplication()\n<<<216>>>\n```"
