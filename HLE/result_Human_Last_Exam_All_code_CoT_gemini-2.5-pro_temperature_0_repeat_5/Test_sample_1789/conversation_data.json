    "Answering this question requires concepts from number theory and combinatorics, specifically related to partially ordered sets (posets).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the Combinatorial Problem:** The problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset on the set of integers S = {1, 2, ..., N}, where N = 823564528378596.\n    *   An **antichain** in the divisor poset is a set of integers where no element divides another.\n    *   By the dual of Dilworth's Theorem (Mirsky's Theorem), a set can be partitioned into `k` antichains if and only if the longest chain in the set has length at most `k`.\n    *   A **chain** is a sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_m` where `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_m`.\n    *   The problem is equivalent to finding the largest subset of S that contains no chain of length 21.\n\n2.  **Identify the Target Set:** A known theorem by Erdös states that the largest subset of {1, ..., N} with no chain of length `k+1` is the set of integers `x <= N` with fewer than `k` prime factors, counted with multiplicity (`Ω(x) < k`).\n    *   In our case, `k=20`. We are looking for the largest set with no chain of length 21. This corresponds to the set of all integers `x <= N` such that `Ω(x) < 20`, which means `Ω(x)` can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 19.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Counting Problem:** The task is now to count the number of integers `x` in the range [1, N] such that `Ω(x) <= 19`.\n    *   This can be expressed as `sum_{k=0}^{19} π_k(N)`, where `π_k(N)` is the number of integers `x <= N` with exactly `k` prime factors (with multiplicity).\n\n4.  **Develop a Calculation Strategy:**\n    *   Calculating each `π_k(N)` and summing them up is computationally very expensive for a number as large as N.\n    *   A more direct approach is to calculate the total number of integers `x <= N` with `Ω(x) >= 20` and subtract this from N.\n    *   The number of integers with `Ω(x) >= 20` is expected to be much smaller than N, making it easier to compute.\n    *   The maximum possible value for `Ω(x)` for `x <= N` is `floor(log2(N))`, which is `floor(log2(823564528378596)) = 49`.\n    *   So, we will calculate `sum_{k=20}^{49} π_k(N)`.\n\n5.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   We will write a recursive function, `count(k, limit, p_idx)`, to count the numbers `x <= limit` with `Ω(x) = k` and all prime factors greater than or equal to `primes[p_idx]`.\n    *   This recursive approach is computationally intensive and requires memoization (caching) to be feasible. It also requires a list of primes.\n    *   The base case for the recursion will be `k=1`, which requires a prime-counting function `pi(x)`. A simple sieve-based `pi(x)` is too slow, so a more advanced algorithm like a memoized Legendre's formula is needed.\n    *   The final script will:\n        1.  Generate primes up to a certain limit using a sieve.\n        2.  Implement a memoized `pi(x)` function.\n        3.  Implement the recursive `count` function.\n        4.  Sum the counts for `k` from 20 to 49.\n        5.  Subtract this sum from N to get the final answer.\n        6.  Print the final equation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. Please be aware that this is a very demanding computation that may take several minutes to run, as it solves a difficult number-theoretic problem from scratch.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in [1, N]\n    in the divisor poset.
