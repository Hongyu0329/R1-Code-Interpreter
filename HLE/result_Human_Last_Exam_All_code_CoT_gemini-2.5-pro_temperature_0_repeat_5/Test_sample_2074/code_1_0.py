# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the problem parameters and simplify the space L.
# The problem is defined for square matrices of shape 101x101.
N = 101

# The definitions of matrices A and B involve two integrals, I1 and I2.
# Through analysis or numerical evaluation, we find that I1 = ln(2) and I2 = -ln(2).
# This leads to the conclusion that for the definition of the space L, B = -A.
# The condition AM + BM^T = 0 becomes A(M - M^T) = 0.
# Since A is invertible, this implies M = M^T, so M is a symmetric matrix.

# Step 3: Characterize the image of f.
# The function f(M) is the matrix exponential e^M.
# The exponential of any real symmetric matrix is a symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix.
# Thus, the set "Image f" is the set of all 101x101 SPD matrices.

# Step 4: Simplify the expression for l(b).
# The function l(b) is an infimum over all matrices in "Image f", i.e., all SPD matrices.
# Let S be an SPD matrix. Let the matrix B(b) be the second definition of B in the problem.
# Let X = S^T * [(B(b) * B(b)^T)^-1] * S. Since S is symmetric, X = S * [(B(b) * B(b)^T)^-1] * S.
# The eigenvalues lambda_i in the formula are the eigenvalues of (X + I).
# The inner minimization problem `min_a [N*a + sum(max(lambda_i - a, 0))]` is solved
# when 'a' is the smallest eigenvalue. The minimum value is the sum of all eigenvalues,
# which is the trace of the matrix.
# So, the expression simplifies to Tr(X + I) = Tr(X) + Tr(I) = Tr(X) + N.

# Step 5: Evaluate the infimum.
# l(b) = inf_{S in SPD} [Tr(S * [(B(b) * B(b)^T)^-1] * S) + N].
# The term Tr(S * C * S), where C is a positive definite matrix, is always non-negative.
# We can make this trace arbitrarily close to 0 by choosing S to be close to the zero matrix
# (e.g., S = epsilon * I, with epsilon -> 0).
# Therefore, the infimum of the trace term is 0.

# Step 6: Final calculation of l(b).
# This means l(b) = 0 + N.
ell_b = 0 + N

# This value is independent of b.
ell_half = ell_b
ell_neg_half = ell_b

# The final expression to compute is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2)).
factor = 6
total_ell = ell_half + ell_neg_half
result = factor * total_ell

# Print the final equation with all its components, as requested.
print(f"The value of l(b) is derived to be the matrix dimension, N = {N}.")
print(f"Therefore, l(1/2) = {ell_half} and l(-1/2) = {ell_neg_half}.")
print(f"The final calculation is:")
print(f"{factor} * ({ell_half} + {ell_neg_half}) = {result}")

# Final answer in the required format
print(f"\n<<<{result}>>>")
