def solve_raindrop_fall():
    """
    Calculates the time it takes for a raindrop accumulating mass to fall a specific height.

    The physics of the problem leads to a constant acceleration for the raindrop.
    1. Equation of Motion: F = d(mv)/dt = mg
       mg = m(dv/dt) + v(dm/dt)
    2. Mass and its derivative:
       m = rho * (4/3) * pi * r^3
       dm/dt = Rho * pi * r^2 * v
    3. From these, we can derive a relationship between the radius 'r' and distance fallen 'y':
       Rho * dy = 4 * rho * dr
    4. Substituting these into the equation of motion and assuming the drop starts from a negligible size (r_0 -> 0),
       the acceleration 'a' simplifies to a constant:
       a = g / 7
    5. The problem is now a simple kinematics problem with constant acceleration.
