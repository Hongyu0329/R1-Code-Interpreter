    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\nMy plan is to solve this problem by applying the theory of regular elements in finite Coxeter groups. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of the H3 group:** I will state the order of the group (`|W|`), its Coxeter number (`h`), and its degrees/exponents. These are fundamental parameters needed for the calculation.\n2.  **Characterize the elements of interest:** The problem asks for elements with a regular eigenvector and an eigenvalue of order `h=10`. According to the theory of regular elements, these are precisely the elements conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer coprime to `h`.\n3.  **Count the conjugacy classes:** I will determine how many distinct conjugacy classes these elements fall into. This is done by finding the orbits of the set of `k`'s (coprime to `h`) under the action of a specific multiplicative group derived from the group's exponents.\n4.  **Calculate the size of each class:** The size of each of these conjugacy classes is given by the formula `|W| / h`.\n5.  **Calculate the total number:** The final answer is the sum of the sizes of these distinct, disjoint conjugacy classes.\n\nI will implement this plan in a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out each step, including the final summation equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n), which counts the positive\n    integers up to n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if math.gcd(i, n) == 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a\n    regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define properties of the reflection group H3\n    group_name = \"H3\"\n    group_order = 120  # Order of the group H3\n    h = 10             # Coxeter number for H3\n    degrees = [2, 6, 10] # Degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3\n    exponents = [d - 1 for d in degrees]\n\n    print(f\"Solving for the reflection group of type {group_name}:\")\n    print(f\"  - Order |W|: {group_order}\")\n    print(f\"  - Coxeter number h: {h}\")\n    print(f\"  - Degrees: {degrees}\")\n    print(f\"  - Exponents m: {exponents}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the elements to be counted\n    # We are looking for elements 'w' that have a regular eigenvector with an\n    # eigenvalue of order h=10.
