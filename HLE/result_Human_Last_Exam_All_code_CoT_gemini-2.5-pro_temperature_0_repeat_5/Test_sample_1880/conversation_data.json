    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: We'll first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Eisenstein's criterion is a good candidate here.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial will tell us if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: For quartic polynomials, the resolvent cubic is a tool to distinguish between the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We will check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots.\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: Based on the properties of the discriminant and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, we can identify the specific Galois group and thus its order.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print out the steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef find_integer_roots(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds integer roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n    For a monic polynomial, any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term.\n    \"\"\"\n    constant_term = coeffs[-1]\n    if constant_term == 0:\n        return [0]\n    \n    roots = []\n    for i in range(1, abs(constant_term) + 1):\n        if constant_term % i == 0:\n            # Test positive divisor\n            if sum(c * (i ** j) for j, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs))) == 0:\n                roots.append(i)\n            \n            # Test negative divisor\n            if sum(c * ((-i) ** j) for j, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs))) == 0:\n                roots.append(-i)\n    return list(set(roots))\n\n# Define the coefficients for the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n# Our polynomial is x^4 + 8x + 14\na, b, c, d = 0, 0, 8, 14\n\nprint(f\"Computing the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + {c}x + {d}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 1: Check for irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion\np = 2\nprint(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\nprint(f\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = {p}:\")\nprint(f\"  - p ({p}) divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides {c} and {d}).\")\nprint(f\"  - p^2 ({p**2}) does not divide the constant term {d}.\")\nprint(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Δ)\n# For x^4 + cx + d, the formula is Δ = -27*c^4 + 256*d^3\ndelta = -27 * (c**4) + 256 * (d**3)\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Δ).\")\nprint(f\"Δ = -27 * c^4 + 256 * d^3\")\nprint(f\"Δ = -27 * ({c})^4 + 256 * ({d})^3\")\nprint(f\"Δ = -27 * {c**4} + 256 * {d**3}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {-27 * c**4} + {256 * d**3}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {delta}\")\n\nis_square = is_perfect_square(delta)\nif is_square:\n    print(\"Conclusion: Δ is a perfect square.
