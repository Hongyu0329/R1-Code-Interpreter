    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points** of the system. These are the points where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points** by analyzing the linearization of the system around them. We are particularly interested in identifying any saddle points.\n3.  **Identify the separatrix**. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We will look for an invariant curve that passes through the saddle point.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\n**Step 1: Find Equilibrium Points**\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nSet $u'(t) = 0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding $d$ values by setting $d'(t)=0$:\n-   If $u=0$: $2d^2 - 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n-   If $u=1$: $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify Equilibrium Points**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian at an equilibrium point determine its type.\nThe Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & 4d -3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSince the matrix is lower triangular, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$.\n\n-   At $(1,-1)$:\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = -4 - 3 + 5 = -2$\n    The eigenvalues are $1$ and $-2$. Since they are real and have opposite signs, the point $(1,-1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Separatrix**\nThe separatrix is an invariant manifold associated with the saddle point $(1,-1)$. We look for a curve $d=f(u)$ that is a trajectory of the system and passes through $(1,-1)$. Such a curve must satisfy the trajectory equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\nBy testing simple functions, we find that the parabola $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution. Let's verify this:\n-   LHS: $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n-   RHS: Substitute $d=-u^2$ into the expression:\n    $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold.\nFurthermore, at $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$, so the curve passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\nThis curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of distinct trajectory behavior.\n\nThe following Python code will print the equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes and prints the equation of the separatrix for the given system.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The separatrix of the system is an invariant manifold passing through the saddle point (1, -1).\")\n    print(\"By solving the trajectory differential equation, we find the separatrix is a parabola.\")\n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is of the form: d = a*u^2 + b*u + c\")\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial d = -u^2\n    a = -1\n    b = 0\n    c = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe coefficients of the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"a = {a}\")\n    print(f\"b = {b}\")\n    print(f\"c = {c}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSo, the final equation for the separatrix is:\")\n    print(f\"d = ({a}) * u^2 + ({b}) * u + ({c})\")\n    print(\"Which simplifies to: d = -u^2\")\n\nsolve_separatrix()\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
