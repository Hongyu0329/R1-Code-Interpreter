    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators. Their diet consists mainly of small, soft-bodied insects and other arthropods. Aphids are a very common food source for them. In addition to live prey, they have also been observed feeding on pollen and nectar, likely as an energy supplement.\n\nLet's evaluate the choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** This is a known supplemental food source for adult snakeflies.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they eat pollen, Raphidioptera are not native to New Zealand, where Māhoe is found. This is unlikely to be a specifically \"recorded\" food source in scientific literature, though they might consume it if introduced.\n*   **C. Fungus:** They are not known to be fungivores.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** They are predators, not herbivores that eat leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a primary food source. The specific host plant of the aphid (Totara) is irrelevant; snakeflies eat aphids.\n\nBased on this, both Nectar (A) and Aphids (E) are correct food sources. Therefore, the best option is F, which includes both.\n\n<<<F>>>"
