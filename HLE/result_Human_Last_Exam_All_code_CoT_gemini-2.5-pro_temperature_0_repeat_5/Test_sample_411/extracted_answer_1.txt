(a) What is the diversity order for each code?
    - Diversity order of S_a: 1
    - Diversity order of S_b: 1
    - Diversity order of S_c: 2

(b) Which code provides the maximum directivity?
Assuming 'directivity' refers to 'diversity', the code that provides the maximum
diversity is the one with the highest diversity order.
Therefore, S_c provides the maximum diversity.
