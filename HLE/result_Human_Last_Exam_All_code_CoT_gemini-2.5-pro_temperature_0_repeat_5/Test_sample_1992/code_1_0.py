    This function solves the problem of finding the number of Quantum Temporal Fixed Points (QTFPs).

    The solution follows these logical steps:
    1.  The condition for a proposition P to be a QTFP is derived. By interpreting the
        logical operators in a probabilistic framework, where p = val(P) is the probability
        of P being true, the condition simplifies to the algebraic equation: 4p^2 - 4p + 1 = 0.
        This equation, (2p - 1)^2 = 0, has a unique solution: p = 1/2.
        Therefore, a proposition is a QTFP if and only if its probability of being true is 1/2.

    2.  The problem asks for propositions that are functions of two classical propositions, A and B.
        There are four possible input combinations for (A, B): (T,T), (T,F), (F,T), (F,F).
        Assuming a uniform superposition, each of these states is equally likely, with a
        probability of 1/4.

    3.  For the total probability of a proposition P(A,B) to be 1/2, it must be true for a
        specific number of these four states. Let k be this number. Then k * (1/4) = 1/2,
        which means k = 2.

    4.  The problem is now to find the number of distinct logical functions of two variables
        that are true for exactly 2 out of the 4 possible inputs. This is a classic
        combinatorial problem of choosing k items from a set of n, calculated as C(n, k).
