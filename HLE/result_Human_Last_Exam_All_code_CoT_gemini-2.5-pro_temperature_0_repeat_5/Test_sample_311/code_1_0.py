    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # Step 1: Compound 11 is cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, which has 4 carbon atoms.
    # Step 2: Ozonolysis of the double bond in compound 11 cleaves the 4-carbon chain into two identical 2-carbon fragments, aldehyde 12.
    # Step 3: The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
    # Step 4: These 2 carbon atoms are incorporated into all subsequent intermediates (10, 7, 13, 14, 15) and are retained in the final product, compound 1.
    carbons_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # Step 1: Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms in its two hydroxy (-OH) groups.
    # Step 2: After ozonolysis, the synthesis continues with one 2-carbon fragment (aldehyde 12). This fragment contains one of the original oxygen atoms from compound 11, which is protected as a TES ether (TESO-). The other oxygen in aldehyde 12 (the aldehyde oxygen) comes from the ozonolysis reagent, not from compound 11.
    # Step 3: This TESO- group, containing the single oxygen atom from compound 11, is stable and remains in the molecule through the formation of compounds 10, 7, 13, and 14.
    oxygens_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # Step 1: The synthesis proceeds from compound 10 to compound 7 (10 + 6 -> 7). The question is phrased in reverse chronological order.
    # Step 2: Compound 10 is a nitroolefin, containing one nitrogen atom that was introduced from the MeNO2 reagent.
    # Step 3: Compound 7 is formed from compound 10. The nitrogen atom from compound 10 is conserved and is present in compound 7.
    # Step 4: Therefore, there is one nitrogen atom that is common to the structures of both 10 and 7. The question is interpreted as asking for this number.
    nitrogens_7_in_10 = 1

    # Print the final answer as 3 numbers, separated by commas.
    print(f"{carbons_11_in_1},{oxygens_11_in_14},{nitrogens_7_in_10}")
