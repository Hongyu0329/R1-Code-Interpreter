    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to understand how logical qubits are stored in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Logical Qubits in a Surface Code Patch:** For a single, planar patch of surface code (which has one outer boundary), the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes (or punctures) within it. The formula is `k = n`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits and `n` is the number of holes.\n2.  **Calculate for a Single Patch:** The problem states each patch has two holes. Therefore, for one patch, `n = 2`, which means it can encode `k = 2` logical qubits.\n3.  **Calculate for All Patches:** The problem specifies there are two such patches. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_surface_code_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given number of\n    surface code patches, each with a specific number of holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\n    qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n    print(f\"Number of surface code patches: {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Number of holes per patch: {num_holes_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits per patch = Number of holes = {qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\nSince there are two independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum from each patch.\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {qubits_per_patch} (from patch 1) + {qubits_per_patch} (from patch 2) = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_surface_code_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
