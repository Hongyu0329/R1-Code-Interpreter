    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we will perform an exhaustive search using a Python script. A direct combinatorial formula for this is not known, but we can count them by checking every possibility.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  **Represent the Set and Operations**: We'll use the set `{0, 1, 2}`. A binary operation can be represented by its Cayley table. Since we are only interested in *commutative* operations, the table is symmetric. This means we only need to define the results for the 6 pairs where the first element is less than or equal to the second: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2).\n2.  **Iterate All Commutative Operations**: For each of these 6 pairs, the result of the operation can be 0, 1, or 2. This gives a total of $3^6 = 729$ possible commutative operations. The script will generate each one of these possibilities.\n3.  **Check for Associativity**: For each of the 729 commutative operations, the script will check if it is also *associative*. An operation `*` is associative if `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all x, y, and z in the set. This condition will be tested for all $3^3 = 27$ possible combinations of x, y, and z.\n4.  **Count and Report**: A counter will track how many operations satisfy the associativity test. The script will then print the final count, along with the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of associative and commutative \n    binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    \n    print(\"This program calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of n elements.\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, the number of elements is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Part 1: Counting Commutative Operations ---\n    # For a commutative operation, we only need to define the results for pairs (i, j) where i <= j.\n    # The number of such pairs is n*(n+1)/2.\n    num_upper_triangle_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    total_commutative_ops = n**num_upper_triangle_entries\n    \n    print(\"A commutative operation is defined by the n*(n+1)/2 entries on and above the main diagonal of its Cayley table.\")\n    print(f\"Number of entries to define = {n}*({n}+1)/2 = {num_upper_triangle_entries}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of commutative operations = n^(n*(n+1)/2) = {n}^{num_upper_triangle_entries} = {total_commutative_ops}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Part 2: Checking for Associativity ---\n    print(f\"Now, we will check each of the {total_commutative_ops} commutative operations for associativity.\")\n    print(\"An operation * is associative if (x*y)*z = x*(y*z) for all x, y, z in the set.\")\n    \n    # Create a mapping from a commutative pair (i, j) with i <= j to an index.\n    # This allows us to represent an operation as a simple tuple.\n    commutative_pairs = []\n    for i in elements:\n        for j in elements:\n            if i <= j:\n                commutative_pairs.append((i, j))\n    pair_to_index = {pair: i for i, pair in enumerate(commutative_pairs)}\n\n    def apply_op(op, a, b):\n        \"\"\"Applies the binary operation 'op' to elements 'a' and 'b'.\"\"\"\n        # Due to commutativity, a*b = b*a, so we can enforce a <= b.\n        if a > b:\n            a, b = b, a\n        index = pair_to_index[(a, b)]\n        return op[index]\n\n    def is_associative(op):\n        \"\"\"Checks if the operation 'op' is associative.\"\"\"\n        for a in elements:\n            for b in elements:\n                for c in elements:\n                    left_side = apply_op(op, apply_op(op, a, b), c)\n                    right_side = apply_op(op, a, apply_op(op, b, c))\n                    if left_side != right_side:\n                        return False\n        return True\n\n    # Iterate through all possible commutative operations.\n    # Each operation 'op' is a tuple of length 6 with values from {0, 1, 2}.\n    possible_ops = itertools.product(elements, repeat=num_upper_triangle_entries)\n    \n    associative_commutative_count = 0\n    for op in possible_ops:\n        if is_associative(op):\n            associative_commutative_count += 1\n            \n    print(\"The search is complete.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # --- Part 3: Final Result ---\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of {n} elements = {associative_commutative_count}\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
