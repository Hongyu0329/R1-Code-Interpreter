# --- Analysis and Calculation ---

# Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors?
# The original C code has errors on 3 lines:
# 1. `unsigned long long ...`: The `long long` type is not supported by the XVM compiler.
# 2. `scanf("%d %d %d", ...)`: The format specifier `%d` is for a `digit`, not an `unsigned long`. It should be `%n`.
# 3. `printf("%d", ...)`: The format specifier `%d` is for a `digit`, not the result which is an `unsigned long`. It should be `%n`.
q1_answer = 3

# Question 2: What is the total memory (in D) used for variables in the most efficient version?
# The most efficient version only needs to store the three inputs n, m, and a.
# Each requires an `unsigned long` which is 12D.
# Total memory = 3 variables * 12D/variable = 36D.
q2_answer = 36

# Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
# Yes, by using integer arithmetic to calculate the ceiling of a division.
# The logic `if (n % a != 0) na++` after `na = n / a` is equivalent to ceil(n/a).
# In integer math, ceil(n/a) can be calculated as `(n + a - 1) / a`.
q3_answer = "Y"

# Question 4: What is the expected output for m = n = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1

# Calculate flagstones needed for each dimension using the ceiling formula
na = (n + a - 1) // a
ma = (m + a - 1) // a

# Calculate the total number of flagstones
total_flagstones = na * ma
q4_answer = total_flagstones
