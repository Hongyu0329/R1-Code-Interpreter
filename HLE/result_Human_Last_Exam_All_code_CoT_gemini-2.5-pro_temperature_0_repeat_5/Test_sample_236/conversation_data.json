    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Knots**: First, we list all knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\n2.  **Understand Integral Surgery on Knots**: An integral surgery on a knot `K` produces a homology 3-sphere (a 3-manifold with the same homology as the 3-sphere S³) if and only if the surgery coefficient is `p = ±1`.\n3.  **Relate to Homology Cobordism Group**: The resulting homology spheres are elements of the homology cobordism group (Θ³_H). Two homology spheres are equivalent if they co-bound a 4-manifold with the same homology as a 4-ball. A key theorem states that the homology sphere resulting from a `±1` surgery on a knot `K` represents the identity element in this group if and only if `K` is a slice knot (i.e., it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball).\n4.  **Analyze Each Knot**:\n    *   **Unknot (0_1)**: This is a slice knot. Therefore, `±1` surgery on it yields the standard 3-sphere, `S³`, which is the identity element in the group.\n    *   **Trefoil Knot (3_1)**: This knot is not slice. The `±1` surgeries on the trefoil knot produce the Poincaré homology sphere (and its mirror image), which represents a single, non-trivial element of order 2 in the group.\n    *   **Figure-Eight Knot (4_1)**: This knot is a slice knot. Like the unknot, `±1` surgery on it yields a homology sphere that is cobordant to `S³`, representing the identity element.\n5.  **Count Unique Elements**: By collecting the elements from all these knots, we find two distinct elements: the identity element (from the unknot and figure-eight knot) and one non-trivial element (from the trefoil knot).\n\nThe following Python code automates this analysis and calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains how many elements of the homology cobordism group\n    can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the knots with at most 4 crossings and their 'slice' property.\n    # A knot is 'slice' if it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball.\n    # The unknot (0_1) is the boundary of a disk, so it is slice.\n    knots = {\n        \"Unknot (0_1)\": {\"slice\": True, \"contribution\": 1},\n        \"Trefoil (3_1)\": {\"slice\": False, \"contribution\": 1},\n        \"Figure-eight (4_1)\": {\"slice\": True, \"contribution\": 1},\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Use a set to store the unique homology cobordism elements found.\n    # We use strings to represent the elements for clarity.\n    unique_elements = set()\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of elements from knots with at most four crossings:\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze each knot based on its slice property.\n    for name, properties in knots.items():\n        if properties[\"slice\"]:\n            # Integral surgery (+1 or -1) on a slice knot yields the identity element\n            # in the homology cobordism group.\n            element = \"identity_element\"\n            unique_elements.add(element)\n            print(f\"- {name}: This knot is slice.
