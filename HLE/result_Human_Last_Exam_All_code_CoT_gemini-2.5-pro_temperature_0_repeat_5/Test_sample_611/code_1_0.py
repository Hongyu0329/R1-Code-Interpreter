# Step 1: Define the numbers involved in the final logical step.
# C represents the asymptotic density of the sausage generated by the process X_t.
# Based on the analysis, the process is space-filling, so its density is 1.
C = 1

# T represents the threshold value given in the problem, which is 2/3.
T_numerator = 2
T_denominator = 3

# Step 2: Compare the density C to the threshold T.
# The problem asks for the limit of P(V_n > 2/3).
# Since V_n converges in probability to C, and C > 2/3, this limit is 1.
final_limit = 1

# Step 3: Output the numbers from the final logical step, as requested.
# The "equation" here is the logical implication: (C > T) => (Limit = 1).

print(f"The inequality C > T evaluates to {C} > {T_numerator/T_denominator}, which is True.")
