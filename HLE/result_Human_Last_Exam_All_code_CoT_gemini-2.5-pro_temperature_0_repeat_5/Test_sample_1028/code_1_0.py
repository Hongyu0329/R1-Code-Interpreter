This is because the information about extinct lineages is lost. A strategy 'helps' if it adds new information (e.g., fossils, priors) or reframes the question to focus on identifiable parameters.")

    print("\nA. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:")
    print("   This simplifies the rate functions but doesn't add new information to distinguish speciation from extinction. It does not solve the fundamental problem.")

    print("\nB. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:")
    print("   This HELPS. Priors add external information, constraining the parameters and making the model identifiable by guiding it towards a subset of possible solutions.")

    print("\nC. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:")
    print("   This does NOT HELP. It dramatically increases model complexity and flexibility without adding new data. This makes the identifiability problem worse, as there are now even more parameter combinations that can produce the same likelihood.")

    print("\nD. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny:")
    print("   This HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of extinction, the key information missing from extant-only trees, which helps to disentangle speciation and extinction rates.")

    print("\nE. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate:")
    print("   This HELPS. It changes the goal from inferring unidentifiable parameters (λ, μ) to inferring a composite parameter that is identifiable from the data.")

    print("\nF. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny:")
    print("   This HELPS. Same reason as D; fossils provide crucial missing data about extinction.")

    print("\nG. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate:")
