    "An all-or-nothing vaccine (also known as a \"leaky\" vaccine) confers complete immunity to a fraction of the vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection to the rest. The per-exposure vaccine efficacy in this context refers to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine if `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)` correctly estimates this efficacy:\n1.  **Define the model and variables:**\n    *   `VE_S`: The true vaccine efficacy, representing the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully immune.\n    *   `1 - VE_S`: The proportion of vaccinated individuals who remain fully susceptible.\n    *   `λ` (lambda): The force of infection, which is the incidence rate among the fully susceptible population.\n\n2.  **Calculate Incidence Rates:**\n    *   **Unvaccinated Group (`IR_u`):** Assuming the entire unvaccinated group is susceptible, their incidence rate is equal to the force of infection, `λ`.\n    *   **Vaccinated Group (`IR_v`):** New infections can only occur in the susceptible portion (`1 - VE_S`) of the vaccinated group. Therefore, the incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is `λ * (1 - VE_S)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Vaccine Efficacy from the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):**\n    *   The IRR is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group to the unvaccinated group: `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n    *   The estimated vaccine efficacy (`VE_est`) is calculated as `1 - IRR`.\n\n4.  **Compare `VE_est` with the true efficacy `VE_S`:** By substituting the expressions for the incidence rates, we can determine the relationship between the estimated and true efficacy.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this calculation with a numerical example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the parameters for an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model.\n# 2. Calculate the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IR_u).\n# 3. Calculate the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IR_v).\n# 4. Compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR).\n# 5. Calculate the estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) as 1 - IRR.\n# 6. Compare the estimated VE with the true VE to determine if it's an overestimate, underestimate, or correct estimate.\n\n# Step 1: Define parameters\n# True vaccine efficacy (VE_S): The proportion of vaccinated people who are fully protected.\n# Let's assume 90% efficacy.\nVE_S = 0.90\n\n# Force of infection (lambda): The rate at which susceptible individuals get infected.\n# We can use an arbitrary value, as it will cancel out in the ratio.\n# Let's say 5 cases per 100 person-years.\nlambda_force_of_infection = 0.05\n\nprint(\"--- Model Parameters ---\")\nprint(f\"True Vaccine Efficacy (VE_S, proportion protected): {VE_S:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Force of Infection (lambda): {lambda_force_of_infection}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (IR_u)\n# In the unvaccinated group, everyone is assumed to be susceptible.\n# So, the incidence rate is equal to the force of infection.\nIR_u = lambda_force_of_infection\nprint(\"--- Incidence Rate Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (IR_u) = lambda = {IR_u}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Incidence Rate in Vaccinated (IR_v)\n# In the vaccinated group, only the proportion (1 - VE_S) is susceptible.\n# The incidence rate is the force of infection acting on this susceptible proportion.\nproportion_susceptible_in_vax_group = 1 - VE_S\nIR_v = lambda_force_of_infection * proportion_susceptible_in_vax_group\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Vaccinated (IR_v) = lambda * (1 - VE_S) = {IR_v:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 4 & 5: Calculate Estimated VE from IRR\nprint(\"--- Efficacy Calculation from IRR ---\")\n# The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) is IR_v / IR_u\nIRR = IR_v / IR_u\n\n# The estimated vaccine efficacy is 1 - IRR.\nVE_estimated = 1 - IRR\n\n# Step 6: Show the final equation with numbers and conclude\nprint(\"The final equation for estimated VE is: VE_est = 1 - IRR\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"VE_est = 1 - (IR_v / IR_u)\")\n# Using sys.stdout.write to prevent the extra space from print's sep parameter\nsys.stdout.write(\"VE_est = 1 - (\")\nsys.stdout.flush()\nprint(f\"{IR_v:.4f} / {IR_u})\")\nprint(f\"VE_est = 1 - {IRR:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"VE_est = {VE_estimated:.2f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"The true vaccine efficacy (VE_S) was: {VE_S:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"The estimated vaccine efficacy (1 - IRR) is: {VE_estimated:.2f}\")\n\nif abs(VE_estimated - VE_S) < 1e-9:\n    conclusion = \"correctly estimate\"\nelif VE_estimated > VE_S:\n    conclusion = \"overestimate\"\nelse:\n    conclusion = \"underestimate\"\n\nprint(f\"\\nResult: For an all-or-nothing vaccine, 1 - IRR will {conclusion} the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
