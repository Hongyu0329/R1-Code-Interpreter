def define_safe_goal():
    """
    This function defines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    When predictive success is based on an uncomputable set, the model M
    cannot use it as a reliable goal. A safe alternative is to base its
    goal on what it can compute and verify internally.

    The model has access to its own predictors, which are partial computable
    functions. These are 'formal models'. The model can analyze their
    properties.

    The learning process should, therefore, prioritize what can be formally
    proven about these models, rather than what can be empirically measured
    externally. This is 'Provability-centric learning'.
