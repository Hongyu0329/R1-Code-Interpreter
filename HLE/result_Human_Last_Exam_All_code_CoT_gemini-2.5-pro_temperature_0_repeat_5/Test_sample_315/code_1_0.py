    print("1. Optical Activity: D-glucose is a chiral molecule, making its solution optically active. This means it rotates the plane of polarized light.")
    print("2. Wavelength Dependence (Dispersion): The amount of rotation depends on the wavelength (color) of the light. Shorter wavelengths (like blue) are rotated more than longer wavelengths (like red).")
    print("3. Scattering: An observer looking from the side sees light that has been scattered by the glucose molecules. Light scatters most intensely in the direction perpendicular to its plane of polarization.")
    print("4. The Spiral Rainbow Effect: As white light travels down the tube, the polarization plane for each color rotates at a different rate.")
    print("   - At any point along the tube, a specific color will be polarized in the perfect orientation to scatter most brightly towards the observer.")
    print("   - Because the plane of polarization for every color is continuously rotating around the tube's axis, the band of maximum brightness for each color traces a spiral path.")
    print("\nConclusion: The combination of these effects results in a rainbow that appears to spiral down the length of the tube.")
