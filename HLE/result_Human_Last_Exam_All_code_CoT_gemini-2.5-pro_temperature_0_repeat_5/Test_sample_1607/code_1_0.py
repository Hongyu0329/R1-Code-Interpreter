def solve_quantum_symmetry_statements():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the letters corresponding to the true statements
    from the provided list, based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. Generators can have continuous spectra (e.g., momentum).
    B1: True. This statement reflects the physical principle that scale invariance,
        generated by the dilation operator, corresponds to a 1/r^2 potential,
        even if the commutator condition is stated in a simplified way.
    B2: False. Direct calculation shows the scaling factors and signs are incorrect.
    C: False. The condition [τ, H] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [S, H] = 0.
    D: True. A direct consequence of [τ, H] = 0.
    E: True. This is the definition of the rotation operator in units where h-bar=1.
    F: True. This follows directly from the Ehrenfest theorem.
    G: False. The premise is always true and does not imply the conclusion.
    H: False. Unbounded operators can have discrete spectra (e.g., QHO Hamiltonian).
    I: True. A consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
    J: True. A direct consequence of [S, H] = 0.
