Here is the step-by-step derivation of the value of K:

Step 1: Understanding the constant K
The problem asks for the largest possible value of K such that the inequality mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X) holds for *every* compact subset X of the group G = SL_2(R). Here, mu is a Haar measure on G.

This means that K must be less than or equal to the ratio mu(X^3) / mu(X) for all non-empty compact subsets X. Therefore, the value we are looking for is the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of this ratio:
K = inf_{X is a non-empty compact subset of G} (mu(X^3) / mu(X))

Step 2: Establishing a lower bound for K
Let X be any non-empty compact subset of G. A key property of a Haar measure mu is its left-invariance, which means that for any element g in G and any measurable set A, we have mu(gA) = mu(A).

Since X is non-empty, we can choose two elements, let's call them y_0 and z_0, from X.
Now, consider the set S = X * y_0 * z_0 = {x * y_0 * z_0 : x in X}.
By the definition of the product set X^3 = {x*y*z : x, y, z in X}, every element of S is also an element of X^3. Thus, S is a subset of X^3.
This subset relationship implies that their measures are related: mu(S) <= mu(X^3).

Using the left-invariance of the Haar measure with g = (y_0 * z_0), we have:
mu(S) = mu(X * y_0 * z_0) = mu(X).

Combining our findings, we get: mu(X) <= mu(X^3).
For any non-empty compact set X, this means the ratio mu(X^3) / mu(X) is always greater than or equal to 1.
This establishes a lower bound for K: K >= 1.

Step 3: Establishing an upper bound for K
To find an upper bound, we need to find a specific compact set X for which the ratio mu(X^3) / mu(X) is as small as possible. A perfect candidate for this is a compact subgroup of G.

The group G = SL_2(R) has a well-known compact subgroup: the special orthogonal group SO(2), which consists of 2x2 rotation matrices. Let's choose our compact set X to be this subgroup, X = SO(2).

Since SO(2) is a group, it is closed under matrix multiplication. This means that for any three elements h1, h2, h3 in SO(2), their product h1*h2*h3 is also in SO(2).
Therefore, the product set X^3 = (SO(2))^3 is simply SO(2) itself. So, X^3 = X.

This means their measures must be equal: mu(X^3) = mu(X).
For this specific choice of X, the ratio is:
mu(X^3) / mu(X) = mu(X) / mu(X) = 1.

Since the inequality mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X) must hold for all compact sets, it must hold for X = SO(2). This gives us:
mu(SO(2)) >= K * mu(SO(2))
which implies that K <= 1.

Step 4: Conclusion
From Step 2, we found that K must be greater than or equal to 1.
From Step 3, we found that K must be less than or equal to 1.

The only value for K that satisfies both conditions is 1.

The final equation is:
K = 1
