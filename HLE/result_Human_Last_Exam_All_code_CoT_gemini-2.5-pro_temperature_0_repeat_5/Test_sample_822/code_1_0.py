    print("- Patient: 62-year-old male.")
    print("- Smoking History: 20-pack-year history, a significant risk factor for lung cancer.")
    print("- Occupational History: Worked in shipbuilding, indicating a high probability of asbestos exposure. Asbestos is a major risk factor for lung cancer and mesothelioma.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze Initial Presentation and Underlying Condition")
    print("- Symptoms: Fatigue, joint pain, confusion, bruising, and shortness of breath suggest a systemic illness.")
    print("- Chest X-ray: Multiple pulmonary nodules are highly suspicious for cancer, likely lung cancer given the risk factors.")
    print("- Conclusion for Underlying Condition: The combination of risk factors and symptoms strongly points to an underlying malignancy (lung cancer) causing paraneoplastic syndromes and a weakened state.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the Acute Terminal Illness")
    print("- Immunosuppression: The patient was immunocompromised due to his underlying cancer and the prescribed steroid treatment.")
    print("- Acute Symptoms: He developed fever, productive cough with green sputum, and cutaneous lesions.")
    print("- Interpretation: This constellation of symptoms in an immunocompromised host is characteristic of a disseminated opportunistic infection.")

    print("\nStep 4: Evaluate Treatment Response")
    print("- Failed Therapy: The prescribed Aminoglycoside therapy proved ineffective.")
    print("- Diagnostic Clue: This treatment failure is a key clue. Many common bacteria would respond, but certain opportunistic pathogens are known to be resistant. Nocardia species, for example, are not effectively treated by aminoglycosides and require drugs like sulfonamides.")

    print("\nStep 5: Synthesize and Final Diagnosis")
    print("- Synthesis: The patient's terminal illness, characterized by pulmonary and cutaneous lesions and resistance to aminoglycosides, is a classic presentation of disseminated Nocardiosis.")
    print("- Final Picture: The most complete diagnosis is a Nocardiosis infection that became fatal in a host who was severely immunocompromised by an underlying lung cancer and steroid therapy.")
