# Based on the mathematical derivation, the original expression simplifies to 1 + 10**15.
# The final equation is this sum. We will calculate its value.

# The first number in the sum.
first_number = 1

# The second number in the sum.
second_number = 10**15

# The result of the sum.
result = first_number + second_number
