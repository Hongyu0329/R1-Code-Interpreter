    "Here is the plan to solve the equation:\n1.  First, I will convert each Roman numeral in the equation `XL / CCC - MMCLXI` to its modern numerical equivalent.\n    *   `XL` is `50 - 10 = 40`.\n    *   `CCC` is `100 + 100 + 100 = 300`.\n    *   `MMCLXI` is `1000 + 1000 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 1 = 2161`.\n2.  Next, I will substitute these modern numbers back into the equation, which becomes `40 / 300 - 2161`.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script to calculate the result following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction) and print the full equation with the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the Roman numeral equation\nnum1 = 40\nnum2 = 300\nnum3 = 2161\n\n# Calculate the result of the equation\n# Following the order of operations (division then subtraction)\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers along with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-2160.8666666666666>>>"
