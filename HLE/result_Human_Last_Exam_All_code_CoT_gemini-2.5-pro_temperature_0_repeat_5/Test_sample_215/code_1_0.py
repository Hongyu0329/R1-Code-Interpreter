# This script explains the logic derived from the R code to determine the number of chemotypes.

# 1. Analyze the generation of the 'control' group data.
# The R script calls `generate_chemistry` for the control group.
# In this call, a single baseline vector is generated.
# This same baseline is subtracted from all 360 control specimens.
# Because all specimens share the same modification, they belong to one fundamental profile.
# Any differences between them are due to random variation, not a different underlying type.
control_group_chemotypes = 1

# 2. Analyze the generation of the 'water_stress' group data.
# The R script makes a second, independent call to `generate_chemistry` for the water stress group.
# A new, different baseline vector is generated for this call.
# This new baseline is subtracted from all 510 water-stressed specimens.
# Similar to the controls, all specimens in this group share the same modification.
# Thus, they also belong to a single fundamental profile.
water_stress_group_chemotypes = 1

# 3. Final Answer
# The question asks for the number of expected chemotypes for the control group and the water stressed group.
# Based on the analysis, the final equation is:
# (Number of control chemotypes, Number of water stress chemotypes) = (1, 1)

print("Based on the logic of the R script:")
print(f"Expected number of chemotypes in the control group = {control_group_chemotypes}")
print(f"Expected number of chemotypes in the water stressed group = {water_stress_group_chemotypes}")
