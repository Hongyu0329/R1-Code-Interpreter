        'A': "Tandem repeats are sequences repeated one after another. While they contribute to genome structure, they are not primarily a compensatory mechanism for deleterious mutations. They are often associated with non-coding DNA and can be prone to replication errors.",
        'B': "Chromosomal inversions are rearrangements that *suppress* recombination in heterozygotes. Therefore, they are a *cause* of limited recombination, not a compensatory mechanism for it. They can lead to the very problem of genetic deterioration (Muller's Ratchet) in the inverted region.",
        'C': "Transposable elements ('jumping genes') can create mutations and genetic novelty, but their effects are often disruptive. They are not a structured, reliable mechanism to compensate for the steady accumulation of harmful mutations.",
        'D': "Multigene families are sets of similar genes formed by duplication. This creates genetic redundancy. If one copy of a gene acquires a deleterious mutation, other copies can still produce a functional protein. This directly buffers the population against the effects of genetic deterioration and is a classic compensatory mechanism for the lack of recombination.",
        'E': "Polyploidy (having extra sets of chromosomes) also provides gene redundancy. However, multigene families are a more specific and widespread 'intrinsic architectural feature' that can evolve on a gene-by-gene basis to protect critical functions, fitting the question's phrasing more precisely than a whole-genome duplication event."
