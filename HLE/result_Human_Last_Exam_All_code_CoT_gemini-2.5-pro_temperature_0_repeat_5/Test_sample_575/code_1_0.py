    print("Analysis: A polygenic score is a predictor based on genetic data. The absolute ceiling for any genetic predictor's explanatory power is the total variance contributed by genetics, which is H².")
    print(f"Therefore, R²_PGS <= H² is always true. Since H² = {H2}, the PGS cannot explain more than 50% of the variance.")

    print("Analysis: A standard linear PGS captures additive genetic variance (Va). Its explanatory power approaches narrow-sense heritability (h² = Va / Vp).")

    print("Analysis: This statement implies that non-additive effects (Vd or Vi) must exist, making h² < H². While plausible, it's not a logical necessity. A purely additive genetic architecture is theoretically possible.")
