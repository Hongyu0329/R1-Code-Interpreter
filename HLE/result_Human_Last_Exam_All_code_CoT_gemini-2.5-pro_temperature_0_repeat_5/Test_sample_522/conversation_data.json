    "My approach to solving this puzzle is to identify the rule governing the transformation from the input grid to the output grid. The core of the puzzle seems to revolve around the movement of the digit '2'.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** In both provided examples (A and B), the digit '2' moves from its original position to a new one. The original cell of the '2' becomes '0', and the destination cell, which was originally a '0', becomes a '2'.\n2.  **Identify the Movement Rule:** The key is to determine how the destination for the '2' is chosen. I observed that the movement is not based on simple proximity or a fixed direction. Instead, it seems to depend on the local environment around the '2'.\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I hypothesize that the movement is determined by the sum of the eight neighboring digits around the '2'.\n    *   In **Input_A**, the '2' is at `(1,1)`. The sum of its 8 neighbors is `0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6`. The '2' moves by a delta of `(-1, -1)` rows and columns, from `(1,1)` to `(0,0)`.\n    *   In **Input_B**, the '2' is at `(3,6)`. The sum of its 8 neighbors is `0+0+0+0+1+1+1+1 = 4`. The '2' moves by a delta of `(-1, +1)`, from `(3,6)` to `(2,7)`.\n4.  **Establish the Rule:** Based on the examples, the rule is:\n    *   If the sum of neighbors is 6, the '2' moves by `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)`.\n    *   If the sum of neighbors is 4, the '2' moves by `(dr, dc) = (-1, +1)`.\n5.  **Solve for Input_C:** I will apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n    *   First, parse the input string for C into a grid and locate the '2'.\n    *   Then, calculate the sum of its neighbors.\n    *   Based on the sum, determine the movement delta.\n    *   Apply the delta to find the new coordinates for the '2'.\n    *   Finally, update the grid and format it back into the required output string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by finding the transformation rule from the examples\n    and applying it to the final input case.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_c = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # 1.
