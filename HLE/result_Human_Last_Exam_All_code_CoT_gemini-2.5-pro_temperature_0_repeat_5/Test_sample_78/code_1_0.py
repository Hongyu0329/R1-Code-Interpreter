# This is a mock execution of the thought process.
# The Rust code provided has a clear compile-time error.
# The error occurs in the `FeedForward::backward` method.

# Let's analyze the problematic line:
# self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);

# 1. The `set` method on a `Matrix` instance requires a mutable reference to that instance.
#    In this case, `self.w2.set(...)` requires `&mut self.w2`.

# 2. The arguments to a function must be evaluated before the function is called.
#    The third argument to `set` is an expression that starts with `self.w2.get(j, k)`.

# 3. The `get` method on a `Matrix` instance requires an immutable reference to that instance.
#    In this case, `self.w2.get(...)` requires `&self.w2`.

# 4. The Conflict: To execute this single line, the compiler needs to create an immutable
#    borrow (`&self.w2`) to calculate the argument, and a mutable borrow (`&mut self.w2`)
#    to call the `set` function itself. Rust's borrowing rules state that you cannot have
#    a mutable borrow while any other borrow (immutable or mutable) exists for the same data.
#    This is a direct violation.

# Therefore, the code will fail to compile.

# To fix this, one would need to separate the read from the write:
# let current_val = self.w2.get(j, k);
# let new_val = current_val - ...;
# self.w2.set(j, k, new_val);

# Based on this analysis, the correct choice is that the code will not compile due to an error.

# The final answer is B.
# We will print the reasoning and the final choice.
