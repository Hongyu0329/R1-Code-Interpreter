    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The goal is to find the number of self-avoiding walks of length 10 on a 2D square grid (Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path on the grid that never visits the same point more than once.\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: This is a classic combinatorial counting problem. A direct formula is not known, so I will use a computational approach. A recursive backtracking algorithm (also known as Depth-First Search) is perfect for this. It will explore all possible paths of length 10 from a starting point.\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm**:\n    *   I'll define a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited_path)`.\n    *   The function will take the current coordinates `(x, y)`, the number of `steps_left`, and a `set` of `visited_path` points as input. Using a set for the path allows for very fast checking of whether a point has been visited.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when `steps_left` is 0. This means a valid 10-step walk has been found, and the function will return 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will try to move to each of the four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   Before making a move, it will check if the neighbor is already in the `visited_path`.\n    *   If the neighbor has not been visited, the function will add it to the path and call itself recursively with the new position and one fewer step (`steps_left - 1`).\n    *   Crucially, after the recursive call returns, the function will \"backtrack\" by removing the neighbor from the path. This allows the exploration of other paths from the same point.\n    *   The function will sum the results from all valid moves.\n4.  **Execute and Output**: The main part of the script will start the process from the origin (0, 0) with 10 steps to go. The final count will be printed in the format `a(10) = result`.\n\nThis method systematically counts every possible valid walk without missing any or counting any twice. For a walk length of 10, this approach is efficient enough to run quickly.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps in the walk.\n    n_steps = 10\n\n    def count_self_avoiding_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited_path):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks using backtracking.\n\n        Args:\n            x: The current x-coordinate.\n            y: The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            visited_path: A set of (x, y) tuples for the path taken so far.\n\n        Returns:\n            The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four possible directions on a Manhattan lattice (N, S, E, W).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # Check if the next point has already been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited_path:\n                # If not visited, add the new point to the path and recurse.\n                visited_path.add((next_x, next_y))\n                count += count_self_avoiding_walks(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1, visited_path)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to allow exploration of other paths.\n                visited_path.remove((next_x, next_y))\n        \n        return count\n\n    # By convention, the walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_x, start_y = 0, 0\n    \n    # The initial path contains only the starting point.\n    initial_path = {(start_x, start_y)}\n\n    # Calculate the total number of walks.\n    total_walks = count_self_avoiding_walks(start_x, start_y, n_steps, initial_path)\n\n    # Print the final equation with all its components.\n    print(f\"a({n_steps}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n<<<44100>>>"
