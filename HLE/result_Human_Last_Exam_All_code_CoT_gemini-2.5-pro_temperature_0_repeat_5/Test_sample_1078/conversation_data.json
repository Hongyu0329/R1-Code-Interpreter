    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to count the number of ways to form a valid Coxeter-Dynkin diagram with exactly 4 nodes. A Weyl group can be irreducible (corresponding to a connected diagram) or reducible (corresponding to a disconnected diagram, which is a direct product of smaller irreducible groups). The rank of the group is the total number of nodes in its diagram.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Consider all integer partitions of 4, which represent the possible rank combinations for reducible groups (e.g., 3+1, 2+2, etc.).\n3.  For each partition, calculate the number of distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups.\n4.  Sum the counts for all partitions, including the count for the irreducible rank 4 groups.\n\nThe script below will perform this calculation and print the breakdown.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of irreducible (connected) finite Weyl groups for a given rank n.\n    # This is based on the classification of Dynkin diagrams.\n    # Rank 1: A1\n    # Rank 2: A2, B2, G2\n    # Rank 3: A3, B3 (note: D3 is isomorphic to A3)\n    # Rank 4: A4, B4, D4, F4\n    num_irreducible_types = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 3,\n        3: 2,\n        4: 4\n    }\n\n    # We find the total number by considering all partitions of the integer 4.\n\n    # Partition 1: 4 (irreducible groups of rank 4)\n    count_part_4 = num_irreducible_types[4]\n    \n    # Partition 2: 3 + 1\n    # A product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    count_part_3_1 = num_irreducible_types[3] * num_irreducible_types[1]\n\n    # Partition 3: 2 + 2\n    # A product of two rank 2 groups.
