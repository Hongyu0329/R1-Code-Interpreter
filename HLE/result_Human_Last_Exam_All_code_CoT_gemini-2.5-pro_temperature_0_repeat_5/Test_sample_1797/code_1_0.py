    Analyzes statements about attack graph analysis to find the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs where nodes are states and edges are actions.
       Standard graph algorithms like shortest path (for easiest attack) and min-cut
       (for critical vulnerabilities) are key analysis techniques.

    B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a fundamental challenge in attack graph generation.
       The number of possible system states can be exponential in the number of system variables,
       leading to a graph size that can be O(2^N).

    C. Incorrect. This statement is a common but imprecise oversimplification. The problem with
       attack graph *generation* is not typically its NP-hardness but its sheer size due to the
       state explosion problem (as correctly stated in B). The generation process itself is often
       a form of state-space exploration which can be PSPACE-complete or EXPTIME-complete, but not
       NP-hard. In contrast, many *analysis* problems performed *on* the generated attack graph,
       such as finding the minimum-cost set of countermeasures to deploy, are indeed NP-hard.
       The statement incorrectly attributes NP-hardness to the generation phase itself.

    D. Correct. Real-world networks are not static. Vulnerabilities are patched, configurations
       change, and new devices are added. This necessitates dynamic attack graphs and efficient
       incremental update algorithms to avoid costly full regenerations.

    E. Correct. Attack graphs serve as formal models of system behavior from a security perspective.
       Model checking is a formal verification technique used to check if this model (the attack graph)
       satisfies certain security properties (e.g., "an unprivileged user can never gain root access").

    Based on the analysis, statement C is the clearly incorrect one.
