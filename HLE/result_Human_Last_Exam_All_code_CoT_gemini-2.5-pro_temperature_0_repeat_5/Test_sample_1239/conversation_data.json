    "The full Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This is because the equations are invariant under a transformation to a non-inertial (arbitrarily accelerating) reference frame, which is parameterized by arbitrary functions of time.\n\nHowever, the question is typically understood to be asking for the dimension of the maximal *finite-dimensional* subgroup of symmetries. This subgroup is generated by a specific set of transformations. I will calculate the dimension of this group by identifying these transformations and summing their respective number of parameters.\n\nThe transformations and their corresponding dimensions (number of parameters) are:\n1.  **Time translation**: 1 parameter (shifting time).\n2.  **Space translations**: 3 parameters (shifting position in $\\mathbb{R}^3$).\n3.  **Spatial rotations**: 3 parameters (the rotation group SO(3)).\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: 3 parameters (transforming to a uniformly moving frame).\n5.  **Scaling**: 1 parameter (dilating space, time, velocity, and pressure).\n6.  **Pressure shift**: 1 parameter (shifting pressure by a constant).\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total dimension by summing these individual dimensions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of\n    symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The finite-dimensional group consists of the following transformations:\n\n    # 1.
