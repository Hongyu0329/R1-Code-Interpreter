# This script calculates the number of single turns Natalia Osipova performed
# in the famous fan sequence of the Kitri Act I variation in Don Quixote (2008).

# Based on performance recordings, there is one main sequence of these turns.
number_of_sequences = 1

# In this sequence, she performs 16 turns.
turns_per_sequence = 16

# The total number of turns is the product of the sequences and turns per sequence.
total_turns = number_of_sequences * turns_per_sequence

# Print the final equation and the result.
