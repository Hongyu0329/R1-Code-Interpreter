# The problem asks for the limit L = lim_{k->inf} (ln h_k) / (ln k).
# Our derivation shows that this limit is proportional to the parameter alpha.
# The final equation for the limit is L = -(32/28) * alpha.
# This simplifies to L = -(8/7) * alpha.

# The numbers in the final simplified equation are:
numerator = 8
denominator = 7

# The question asks for a single numerical value.
# This is interpreted as asking for the coefficient of alpha in the expression for the limit.
# This coefficient is C = -numerator / denominator.
coefficient = -numerator / denominator
