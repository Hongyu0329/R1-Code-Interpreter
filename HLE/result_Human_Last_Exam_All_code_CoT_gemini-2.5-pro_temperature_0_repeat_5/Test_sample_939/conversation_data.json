    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each ROMM RGB color to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if, after the conversion, any of its resulting R, G, or B values fall outside the standard range for sRGB. For calculations using normalized values (0.0 to 1.0), this means any value less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0 is \"out of gamut\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the conversion:\n1.  **Inverse Gamma Correction**: The input ROMM RGB values are first converted from their non-linear representation to a linear space. ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation (ROMM to XYZ)**: The linear ROMM RGB values are converted to the CIE XYZ color space. This requires a standard 3x3 matrix multiplication. Since ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point, the resulting XYZ values are relative to D50.\n3.  **Chromatic Adaptation**: The sRGB color space uses a D65 white point. Therefore, we must apply a chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) to the XYZ values to convert them from a D50 reference to a D65 reference.\n4.  **Color Space Transformation (XYZ to sRGB)**: The D65-adapted XYZ values are then converted to the linear sRGB color space using another 3x3 matrix multiplication.\n5.  **Gamut Check**: The resulting linear sRGB values are checked. If any component (R, G, or B) is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the original ROMM color is outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented accurately.\n\nThe following Python code implements this conversion pipeline to test each color. It uses the `numpy` library for efficient matrix calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_color_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which of the given ROMM RGB color values fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to test (as a dictionary for easy labeling).\n    colors = {\n        1: (0, 0, 1),\n        2: (0, 1, 0),\n        3: (0, 0.5, 0.6),\n        4: (0.4, 0.5, 0.6),\n        5: (1, 1, 1)\n    }\n\n    # --- Transformation Matrices ---\n\n    # Matrix to convert linear ROMM RGB (D50) to CIE XYZ (D50)\n    M_ROMM_to_XYZ = np.array([\n        [0.7976749, 0.1351917, 0.0313534],\n        [0.2880402, 0.7118741, 0.0000857],\n        [0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.8252100]\n    ])\n\n    # Bradford Chromatic Adaptation Matrix from D50 to D65\n    M_CAT_D50_to_D65 = np.array([\n        [ 0.9555766, -0.0230393, 0.0631636],\n        [-0.0282895,  1.0099416, 0.0210077],\n        [ 0.0122982, -0.0204830, 1.3299098]\n    ])\n\n    # Matrix to convert CIE XYZ (D65) to linear sRGB (D65)\n    M_XYZ_to_sRGB = np.array([\n        [ 3.2404542, -1.5371385, -0.4985314],\n        [-0.9692660,  1.8760108,  0.0415560],\n        [ 0.0556434, -0.2040259,  1.0572252]\n    ])\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    # Iterate through each color and perform the conversion and check\n    for index, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        # Step 1: Apply ROMM RGB inverse gamma correction (gamma 1.8)\n        romm_linear = np.array([c ** 1.8 if c > 0 else 0 for c in romm_rgb])\n\n        # Step 2: Convert from linear ROMM (D50) to XYZ (D50)\n        xyz_d50 = np.dot(M_ROMM_to_XYZ, romm_linear)\n\n        # Step 3: Chromatically adapt from D50 to D65 white point\n        xyz_d65 = np.dot(M_CAT_D50_to_D65, xyz_d50)\n\n        # Step 4: Convert from XYZ (D65) to linear sRGB (D65)\n        srgb_linear = np.dot(M_XYZ_to_sRGB, xyz_d65)\n        \n        r_srgb, g_srgb, b_srgb = srgb_linear\n        print(f\"Checking color {index}) ROMM RGB{romm_rgb}:\")\n        print(f\"The final numbers in the conversion equation result in linear sRGB({r_srgb:.4f}, {g_srgb:.4f}, {b_srgb:.4f})\")\n\n        # Step 5: Check if the color is within the sRGB gamut [0, 1]\n        # A small tolerance is used to account for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        tolerance = 1e-9\n        if np.any(srgb_linear < -tolerance) or np.any(srgb_linear > 1 + tolerance):\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n            print(\"Result: Cannot be represented (out of sRGB gamut).\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Result: Can be represented (in sRGB gamut).\\n\")\n\n    # Format the final answer as requested\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n\n    print(f\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {final_answer}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_color_gamut()\n```"
