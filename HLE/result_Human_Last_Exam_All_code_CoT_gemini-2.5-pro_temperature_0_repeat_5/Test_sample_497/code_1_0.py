# The problem requires finding the value of x such that the equivalent
# capacitance of the ladder circuit is independent of the number of cells N.
# This condition is met when the ladder is terminated by its own
# characteristic capacitance, Z. Therefore, x must be equal to Z.

# The characteristic capacitance Z is found by solving the quadratic equation:
# 2*Z^2 + 2*c*Z - c^2 = 0
# where c is the capacitance of the individual capacitors in each cell.

# Solving this equation for Z (and taking the positive root) yields the expression:
# Z = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2

# Since x must be equal to Z for the condition to hold, the value for x is:

print("The required value of the capacitor x is given by the expression:")
print("x = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2")
print("\nHere are the individual numbers that make up the final equation's constant factor:")

# The numbers in the expression k = (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2
number_in_sqrt = 3
number_subtracted = 1
number_in_denominator = 2

print(f"The number inside the square root is: {number_in_sqrt}")
print(f"The number subtracted from the square root is: {number_subtracted}")
print(f"The number in the denominator is: {number_in_denominator}")

# We can also calculate the numerical value of the constant factor
k = (math.sqrt(number_in_sqrt) - number_subtracted) / number_in_denominator
print(f"\nSo, x is approximately {k:.4f} * c")
