    "Of course. Here is a Python script that analyzes the text of Anton Chekov's \"The Chameleon\" to count the symbolic descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will store the full English text of the short story \"The Chameleon\" in a variable.\n2.  The key symbolic descriptions are not just mentions of the word \"coat,\" but the specific actions of Otchumyelov taking his coat off and putting it back on, which reflect his changing opinions based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner.\n3.  I will create a list of the specific phrases that describe these actions. These include the initial description, him taking the coat off, putting it on, taking it off again, putting it on again, and finally wrapping himself in it.\n4.  The script will then iterate through the text, counting the occurrences of each of these key descriptive phrases.\n5.  Finally, it will display the count for each action and then sum them up to provide the total number of times the coat's description symbolized a shift in his mentality.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov to count descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov (Constance Garnett translation)\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.\n    \"So you bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! Ah . . . ah!\"\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of yelping and the shout of \"Don't let go!\" are heard once more. Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard.\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour . . .\" says the policeman.\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his half-drunken face there is a look of triumph and of terror. And in the very centre of the crowd, trembling all over, sits on the ground the culprit of the scandal, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you here for? Why are you holding your finger up? . . . Who was it that shouted?\"\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour . . .\" Hryukin, the man with his finger up, begins, coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood with Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no rhyme or reason, bit my finger. . . . You must excuse me, I am a working man. . . . Mine is a fine sort of work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, may be. . . . It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast. . . . If everyone is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living. . . .\"\n    \"H'm, very good . . .\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. \"Very good. . . . Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson! Yeldyrin,\" cries the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad. . . . Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm. . . . Take my coat off, Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . . There's one thing I can't make out, how it came to bite you?\" Otchumyelov turns to Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know your sort! You devils!\"\n    \"He put a cigarette in her face, your honour, for a joke, and she snapped at him. . . . He is a nonsensical fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"You are lying! You did not see, so why should you lie? His honour is a wise gentleman, and he can see who is lying and who is telling the truth, as in God's sight. . . . And if I am lying, let the court decide. It's written in the law. . . . We are all equal nowadays. My own brother is in the police . . . let me tell you.\"\n    \"Don't argue!\"\n    \"No, that's not the General's dog,\" says the policeman, with profound conviction, \"the General has not got one like that. His are mostly setters.\"\n    \"Do you know that for a fact?\"\n    \"Yes, your honour.\"\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no points. . . . A wretched-looking creature. To keep a dog like that! . . . Where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a twinkling! You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop. . . . We must give them a lesson! It is high time. . . .\"\n    \"Yet it may be the General's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face. . . . I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm! . . . Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . there seems to be a wind getting up. . . . I am cold. . . . You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street. . . . It may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigarette in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal. . . . And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own stupid fault! . . .\"\n    \"Here comes the General's cook, ask him. . . . Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog. . . . Is it one of yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We have never had one like that.\"\n    \"There's no need to waste time in asking,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! There's no need to waste time talking about it. . . . Since he says it's a stray dog, a stray dog it is. . . . It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It belongs to the General's brother, who came the other day. Our master does not care for borzoys. His brother does.\"\n    \"Do you mean the General's brother is here? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" inquires Otchumyelov, and his whole face is lighted up with a smile of ecstatic tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I did not know! Has he come on a visit?\"\n    \"Yes.\"\n    \"Well, I never. . . . He couldn't stay away from his brother. . . . And there I did not know! So this is his dog? Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha. . . . Come, why are you trembling? Rrr . . . Rrr. . . . The rascal's angry . . . a nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you smart yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way across the square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phrases that signify a symbolic action with the coat\n    phrases_to_find = [\n        \"wearing a new overcoat\",\n        \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin\",\n        \"Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin\",\n        # A slight variation in the text for the second time he takes it off\n        \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin\", # This is not in the text, let's find the actual phrase.\n        # Re-reading the text, the second time he puts it on is:\n        \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin\", # This is also not quite right.\n        # Let's correct the phrases based on a careful reading.\n    ]\n\n    # Corrected and more robust search patterns based on the text.\n    # Using regex to handle minor variations and ignore case for some words.\n    # 1.
