    # The problem is about the convergence of gradient descent for an L-smooth convex function.
    # The objective function R(w) is convex and L-smooth.
    # L is the uniform smoothness constant, which is a global property of the function.
    # lambda is the smoothness at the optimal point, which is a local property.

    # For gradient descent to be guaranteed to converge for any initialization on an
    # L-smooth convex function, the learning rate gamma must satisfy the condition:
    # 0 < gamma < 2/L

    # This condition ensures that the function value decreases at each step,
    # preventing the algorithm from overshooting the minimum and diverging.

    # The question asks for the largest upper bound M such that for all gamma < M,
    # convergence is guaranteed.
    # From the inequality 0 < gamma < 2/L, the largest upper bound is 2/L.

    # Let's define the components of the final equation.
