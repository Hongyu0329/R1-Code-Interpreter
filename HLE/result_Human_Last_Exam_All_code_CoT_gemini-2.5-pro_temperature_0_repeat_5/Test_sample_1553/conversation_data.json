    "Of course. Here is a Python script that will print the name of the character you're asking about.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the name of the character that Adam Zamoyski, the protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" marries.\n2.  I will store this name in a Python variable.\n3.  I will then write a Python script to print the value of that variable.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the name of the character that the protagonist of\n# Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(\"The main character marries a character named:\")\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
