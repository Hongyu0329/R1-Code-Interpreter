    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze the synaptic connectivity data from the Witvliet et al., 2021 connectome.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Load the adult C. elegans connectome data using the `c-elegans-connectome` Python library.\n2.  Isolate all chemical synapses where the presynaptic (source) neurons are the ASJ pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  Group the target (postsynaptic) neurons by their cell type (e.g., treating PVQL and PVQR as the same type, PVQ).\n4.  Sum the number of synapses for each postsynaptic cell type to find the total input from the ASJ pair.\n5.  Identify the cell type that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ.\n6.  Display the result, including the breakdown of synapses from ASJL and ASJR and the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom celegans_connectome.connectome import Connectome\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans\n    connectome based on synapse number.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
