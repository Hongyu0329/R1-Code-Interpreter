# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, is 1.
m = 1

# The expression to calculate is m - 2^4048.
base = 2
exponent = 4048
second_term = base**exponent

# Calculate the final result.
result = m - second_term

# Print the equation with the numbers involved.
# Note: The result is a very large negative number.
