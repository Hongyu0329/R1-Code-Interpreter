# --- Plan ---
# 1. Define the LogP contribution for a single ethylene glycol (-CH2-CH2-O-) unit.
#    This is based on established fragment contribution values (e.g., Wildman-Crippen method).
#    - Contribution of a -CH2- group is approx. +0.54
#    - Contribution of an ether -O- group is approx. -1.54
#    - Therefore, a -CH2-CH2-O- unit contributes (2 * 0.54) + (-1.54) = -0.46.
#    A negative value indicates it increases water solubility.
# 2. The original probe has a diethylene glycol linker, which contains 2 of these units.
# 3. We will model the effect of replacing it with a longer, more soluble tetraethylene glycol linker (4 units).
# 4. The code will calculate and print the LogP contribution for both linkers and show the net change.

# --- Code ---

# LogP contribution for one ethylene glycol (-CH2-CH2-O-) unit
logP_contribution_per_unit = -0.46

# Number of units in the original and proposed linkers
original_units = 2
proposed_units = 4

# Calculate the LogP contribution of the original linker
original_linker_logP = original_units * logP_contribution_per_unit

# Calculate the LogP contribution of the proposed, longer linker
proposed_linker_logP = proposed_units * logP_contribution_per_unit

# --- Output ---
