# The problem asks for the value of 'a' where the only obstruction to a symplectic
# embedding is the volume constraint. This occurs when the embedding capacity c(a)
# is equal to the volume bound, sqrt(a).
#
# From the work of McDuff and Schlenk, this condition is met for a special set of
# values. The most fundamental of these is the square of the golden ratio, tau.

# Define the numbers used in the formula for the golden ratio
one = 1
five = 5
two = 2

# Calculate the golden ratio, tau
tau = (one + math.sqrt(five)) / two

# The value 'a' is the square of tau
a = tau**2

# Print the equation and the final result
print(f"The value 'a' is the square of the golden ratio, tau.")
print(f"The equation is: a = (({one} + sqrt({five})) / {two})^2")
print(f"The calculated value of 'a' is: {a}")
