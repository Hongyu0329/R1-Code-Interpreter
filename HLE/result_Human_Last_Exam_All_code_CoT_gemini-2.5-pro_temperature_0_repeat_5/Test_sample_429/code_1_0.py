# Step 1: Define constants and derived values based on the problem statement.
# The problem's numbers are slightly inconsistent. We will proceed by assuming the mass change of the plate (0.172 g)
# is the primary value, which dictates the mass of the new salt formed.
initial_salt_mass = 1.0  # 10 g * 10%
plate_mass_change = -0.172
net_mass_from_plate_to_solution = -plate_mass_change  # 0.172 g

# The mass of the new salt (ACl2) is the mass of the old salt (BCl2) plus the net mass transfer.
final_salt_mass = initial_salt_mass + net_mass_from_plate_to_solution

# Molar mass of two chlorine atoms
M_Cl2 = 2 * 35.5

# Step 2: Explain the derivation of the relationship between the molar masses.
# Let M_A and M_B be the molar masses of metals A and B.
# Let n be the moles of reaction.
# n = initial_salt_mass / (M_B + M_Cl2)  => n = 1.0 / (M_B + 71)
# n = final_salt_mass / (M_A + M_Cl2)    => n = 1.172 / (M_A + 71)
# Equating the expressions for n gives: 1.0 / (M_B + 71) = 1.172 / (M_A + 71)
# Rearranging this gives a linear relationship: M_A = 1.172 * (M_B + 71) - 71
# which simplifies to M_A = 1.172 * M_B + 12.212
