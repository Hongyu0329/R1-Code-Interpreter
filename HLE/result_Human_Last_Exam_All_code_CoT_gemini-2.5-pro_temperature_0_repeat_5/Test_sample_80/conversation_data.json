    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total number of edge squares** on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The edge consists of the top, bottom, left, and right rows/columns.\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of bishops** that can be placed on these edge squares without any bishop attacking another. The key here is that bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color. Therefore, to maximize the number of bishops, we can place them all on squares of a single color (e.g., all white or all black), as they will not be able to attack each other.\n3.  **Calculate the number of empty edge squares** by subtracting the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_side = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An n x n board has 4 sides of n squares, but the 4 corners are counted twice.\n    # So, the formula is (n * 4) - 4.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_side * 4) - 4\n    print(f\"A standard {board_side}x{board_side} board has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # Bishops on squares of the same color cannot attack each other.\n    # The edge squares are evenly split between white and black.\n    # To place the maximum number of bishops, we fill all edge squares of one color.\n    max_bishops_placed = total_edge_squares // 2\n    print(f\"To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can place them on all edge squares of a single color.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of bishops that can be placed is {max_bishops_placed}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_placed\n    print(\"\\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} (total) - {max_bishops_placed} (bishops) = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
