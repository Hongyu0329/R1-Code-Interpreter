    "This is a problem in the representation theory of partially ordered sets (posets), which is a subfield of algebra. I will determine the value of $n$ by analyzing the homological properties of the category of representations of a poset with the given characteristics.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Translate the problem:** I will rephrase the question in terms of standard algebraic and homological concepts. \"Functor\" corresponds to a representation or module, \"$n$-resolvable\" relates to projective dimension, and \"tame\" refers to the representation type of the underlying structure.\n2.  **Analyze the constraints:** I will examine the implications of the two main conditions: $J$ being an \"upper semilattice\" and the functor being \"tame\".\n3.  **Connect the constraints:** I will show how the \"upper semilattice\" property simplifies the algebraic structure of the associated incidence algebra $KJ$.\n4.  **Apply a key theorem:** I will use a major theorem from representation theory that connects the \"tame\" property of this simplified algebraic structure to its global dimension.\n5.  **Conclude the value of n:** The global dimension provides an upper bound for the projective dimension of any representation, which gives the value for $n$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value 'n' for which a tame functor on an upper\n    semilattice is n-resolvable.
