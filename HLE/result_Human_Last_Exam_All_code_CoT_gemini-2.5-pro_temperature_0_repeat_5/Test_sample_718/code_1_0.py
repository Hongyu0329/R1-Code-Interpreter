    print("\nStep 1: Translating the Problem into Algebraic Terms")
    print("----------------------------------------------------")
    print("The question can be translated into the language of module theory:")
    print(" - A functor f: J -> Vect_K is a representation of the poset J.")
    print(" - A representation of J is equivalent to a module over the incidence algebra KJ.")
    print(" - A functor being 'n-resolvable' means its corresponding module has a projective dimension of at most n.")
    print(" - A 'tame functor' is interpreted as a representation of a poset J that is of tame representation type. This is a property of the entire category of representations of J.")
    print("The problem is therefore to find the maximum possible projective dimension for any module over the incidence algebra KJ, given that J is a tame upper semilattice.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the 'Upper Semilattice' Constraint")
    print("----------------------------------------------------")
    print("An upper semilattice is a poset where any two elements have a unique least upper bound.")
    print("This structural property implies that the poset J cannot contain a subposet known as a 'crown'.")
    print("An incidence algebra KJ where the poset J does not contain a crown is called 'strongly simply connected'. This is a crucial technical property.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing the 'Tame' Constraint and Applying a Key Theorem")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("For strongly simply connected algebras, there is a powerful connection between their representation type (tame/wild) and their homological properties.")
    print("A major theorem in representation theory states that if a strongly simply connected algebra is of tame representation type, its global dimension is at most 2.")
    print("The global dimension of an algebra is the maximum projective dimension over all of its modules.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("1. Since J is an upper semilattice, its incidence algebra KJ is strongly simply connected.")
    print("2. Since we are considering a 'tame' case, the algebra KJ is of tame representation type.")
    print("3. By the theorem, the global dimension of KJ is at most 2.")
    print("4. This means the projective dimension of any representation f is less than or equal to 2.")
    print("5. Therefore, any such functor f is 2-resolvable.")
    print("The value n=2 is the best possible bound, as there are examples of tame poset algebras that have representations with a projective dimension of exactly 2.")
