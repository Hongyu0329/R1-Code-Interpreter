    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the phonetic transcription:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The request is to provide a phonetic transcription for the English borrowing of \"shock absorber\" as it would be pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish. This requires knowledge of both English phonetics and the specific phonological rules of the Puerto Rican Spanish dialect.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Borrowing Pattern:** In linguistics, when a long phrase is borrowed, it's often shortened or \"clipped\" to its most essential part. \"Shock absorber\" is a two-word technical term. In common usage in Spanish-speaking contexts, the term is almost universally clipped to just \"shock.\" The \"absorber\" part is dropped, as it's less salient and the meaning is understood from context (e.g., \"cambiar los shocks del carro\" - \"to change the car's shocks\"). Therefore, the task is to transcribe the adapted form of \"shock.\"\n\n3.  **Phonetic Breakdown of \"Shock\":** In Standard American English, \"shock\" is pronounced /ʃɑk/.\n    *   **/ʃ/:** The voiceless postalveolar fricative (the \"sh\" sound).\n    *   **/ɑ/:** The open back unrounded vowel (the vowel sound in \"cot\" or \"hot\").\n    *   **/k/:** The voiceless velar plosive (the \"ck\" sound).\n\n4.  **Apply Puerto Rican Spanish Phonological Rules:**\n    *   **Rule for /ʃ/:** The \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/) does not exist as a native phoneme in Spanish. Spanish speakers consistently adapt this sound to the closest native equivalent, which is the voiceless postalveolar affricate /tʃ/ (the \"ch\" sound, as in \"muchacho\"). So, `/ʃɑk/` starts its transformation into `/tʃɑk/`.\n    *   **Rule for /ɑ/:** The English vowel /ɑ/ also doesn't have a perfect one-to-one match in the five-vowel system of Spanish. It is typically mapped to the Spanish /a/ or /o/. In this case, because the English spelling uses an 'o', the pronunciation is overwhelmingly influenced to become the Spanish mid-back rounded vowel /o/. So, `/tʃɑk/` transforms into `/tʃok/`.\n    *   **Rule for /k/:** The final /k/ sound exists in Spanish (spelled as 'c' or 'qu') and requires no change.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Transcription:** Combining these steps, the English /ʃɑk/ is phonetically adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish as **[ˈtʃok]**. The square brackets `[]` denote a phonetic transcription, and the apostrophe `ˈ` indicates that the syllable is stressed (which is the only syllable in this case).\n\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that prints this explanation and the final result clearly, following the user's instructions.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_shock_absorber():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the phonetic transcription for the English\n    borrowing of \"shock absorber\" in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Introduction explaining the linguistic process of clipping\n    print(\"The English term 'shock absorber' is a compound noun. In Puerto Rican Spanish, as in many languages, such terms are often clipped to their most salient part when borrowed.\")\n    print(\"In this case, the borrowing is for the word 'shock', which is then adapted phonetically.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step-by-step phonetic transformation\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step phonetic adaptation from English to Puerto Rican Spanish:\")\n    print(\"1. The English word 'shock' is pronounced /ʃɑk/.\")\n    \n    # Rule 1: /ʃ/ -> /tʃ/\n    print(\"2. The English 'sh' sound, /ʃ/, does not exist in Spanish. It is adapted to the closest Spanish sound, which is 'ch', or /tʃ/.\")\n    print(\"   So, /ʃɑk/ becomes /tʃɑk/.\\n\")\n    \n    # Rule 2: /ɑ/ -> /o/\n    print(\"3. The English vowel /ɑ/ (as in 'cot') is mapped to the Spanish /o/ vowel, influenced by the English spelling.\")\n    print(\"   So, /tʃɑk/ becomes /tʃok/.\\n\")\n    \n    # Rule 3: /k/ -> /k/\n    print(\"4. The final consonant sound /k/ exists in Spanish and remains unchanged.\\n\")\n    \n    # Final Result\n    final_transcription = \"[ˈtʃok]\"\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(\"Final Phonetic Transcription:\")\n    print(\"The resulting phonetic transcription for the borrowing of 'shock absorber' is:\")\n    print(final_transcription)\n    print(\"\\nThis is commonly spelled 'chok' or Hispanized as 'choque' (plural: 'los choques').\")\n\ntranscribe_shock_absorber()\n<<<[ˈtʃok]>>>\n```"
