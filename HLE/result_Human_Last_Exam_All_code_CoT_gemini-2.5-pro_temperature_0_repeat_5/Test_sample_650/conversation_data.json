    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, I will analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of the input size, which is primarily determined by the magnitude of `n`.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** The algorithm has two main parts: an initialization step (Step 1) and a `while` loop (Step 2).\n2.  **Analyze the Initialization Cost:** Step 1 involves a few assignments and arithmetic operations (`⌊x/c⌋` and `x - qc`). These are considered elementary operations that take constant time, which is denoted as O(1).\n3.  **Analyze the Loop Cost:** The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop.\n    *   **Cost per Iteration:** Each iteration of the loop performs a fixed number of elementary operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Therefore, the cost of a single iteration is constant, O(1).\n    *   **Number of Iterations:** The complexity is determined by how many times this loop runs. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's trace the value of `q`. Initially, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`. In each iteration, the value of `q` is effectively divided by `c` again. After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n / c^(k+1)⌋`.\n4.  **Determine Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n    *   `n / c^(k+1) < 1`\n    *   `n < c^(k+1)`\n    *   Taking the logarithm base `c` of both sides gives: `log_c(n) < k+1`.\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations, `k`, is directly related to `log_c(n)`. Specifically, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity:** The total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost per iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n)).\n\nI will provide a Python script that not only states this conclusion but also demonstrates it by running the algorithm for sample inputs, counting the loop iterations, and comparing the count to the value of `log_c(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_imag_complexity(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm\n    by running it and comparing loop iterations to the theoretical value.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(c, int) and n >= 0 and c >= 2):\n        print(\"Invalid input.
