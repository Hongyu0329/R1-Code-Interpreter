    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the key formulas:** There are two fundamental topological formulas for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + L_ext`, where `n` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex (determined by the interaction term, e.g., `n=4` for a $\\phi^4$ theory), and `L_ext` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Solve for Vertices (V):** We will algebraically combine these two equations to derive a single formula for `V` in terms of `L`, `n`, and `L_ext`.\n\n3.  **Apply Problem Constraints:** The problem specifies `L=2`. To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we should consider the simplest possible diagram, which is a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines), so we set `L_ext = 0`.\n\n4.  **Minimize V:** With `L=2` and `L_ext=0`, the formula for `V` will depend only on `n`. We will test common interaction types (like `n=3` for $\\phi^3$ and `n=4` for $\\phi^4$) to find which one yields the smallest possible integer value for `V`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The code will perform the final calculation based on the derived formula and the chosen parameters to find the minimum number of vertices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop\n    Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the problem and relevant formulas ---\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) in a Feynman diagram, we use two key topological relations.\")\n    print(\"Let L be the number of loops, I be the number of internal lines, V be the number of vertices,\")\n    print(\"n be the number of lines per vertex (e.g., n=4 for phi^4 theory), and L_ext be the number of external lines.\")\n    print(\"\\nFormula 1: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"Formula 2: n * V = 2 * I + L_ext\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Derive a general expression for V ---\n    print(\"\\nWe combine these formulas to solve for V.
