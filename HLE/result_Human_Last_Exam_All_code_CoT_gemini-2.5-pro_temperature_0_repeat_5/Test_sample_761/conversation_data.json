    "No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. This applies to both general polynucleotides (like DNA and RNA) and homopolynucleotides (like poly(A) or poly(G)).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key structural differences:\n\n1.  **Monomers (Building Blocks):**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers of **monosaccharides** (simple sugars like glucose).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers of **nucleotides**. Each nucleotide is a more complex molecule made of three distinct parts: a phosphate group, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a nitrogenous base.\n\n2.  **Backbone Linkage:**\n    *   In **polysaccharides**, the monosaccharide units are linked together by **glycosidic bonds**.\n    *   In **polynucleotides**, the nucleotide units are linked by **phosphodiester bonds**, which form a characteristic sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\n3.  **Elemental Composition:**\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are carbohydrates, primarily composed of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are nucleic acids and are fundamentally different in composition. They always contain Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), **Nitrogen (N)** (in the bases), and **Phosphorus (P)** (in the phosphate backbone).\n\nWhile both are biological polymers and polynucleotides do contain a sugar component in their backbone, the presence of the phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases, along with the different type of backbone linkage, makes their overall structure fundamentally different from that of polysaccharides.\n\n<<<No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides due to fundamental differences in their monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), backbone bonds (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), and elemental composition (the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in polynucleotides).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Are polynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides? or, to be more clear: Are homopolynucleotides, structurally, polysaccharides?\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
