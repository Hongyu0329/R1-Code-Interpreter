    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the constraints on the cardinality of a MAD family A.
    # A family of subsets of omega, A, is almost disjoint (AD) if for any distinct X, Y in A,
    # their intersection is finite.
    # An AD family is maximal (MAD) if it cannot be extended with another infinite subset of omega.
    
    # Lower bound: A MAD family must be infinite. If it were finite, say A = {A_1, ..., A_n},
    # then the complement of their union, C = omega \ (A_1 U ... U A_n), would be an infinite set
    # disjoint from all elements of A, contradicting maximality.
    # Thus, the cardinality |A| must be at least omega.
    
    # Upper bound: A is a set of subsets of omega. The total number of subsets of omega is 2^omega.
    # Thus, the cardinality |A| must be at most 2^omega.
    
    # We are given the hypothesis 2^omega = omega_1.
    # So, for any MAD family A, its cardinality kappa = |A| must satisfy:
    # omega <= kappa <= omega_1
    
    print("Step 1: Determine the set X of possible cardinalities.")
    print("Let kappa be the cardinality of a maximal almost disjoint (MAD) family.")
    print("From the definitions and the given hypothesis 2^omega = omega_1, we have:")
    print("omega <= kappa <= omega_1")
    
    # Step 3: Identify the elements of X.
    # By the definition of aleph numbers, omega_1 is the first uncountable cardinal.
    # This means there are no cardinals strictly between omega (the first infinite cardinal)
    # and omega_1.
    # Therefore, the only possible values for kappa are omega and omega_1.
    
    # It is a standard result in ZFC that MAD families of cardinality omega exist.
    # It is also a standard result that if 2^omega >= omega_1, a MAD family of
    # cardinality omega_1 exists. Since we assume 2^omega = omega_1, this condition holds.
    
    # So, the set of possible cardinalities is X = {omega, omega_1}.
    # We represent this set using strings for clarity.
    X = ["omega", "omega_1"]

    print("By definition, there are no cardinals between omega and omega_1.")
    print(f"Therefore, the set of possible cardinalities is X = {{ {X[0]}, {X[1]} }}")
    
    # Step 4: Determine the order type of X.
    # The set X is ordered by the usual cardinal ordering: omega < omega_1.
    # The order type of a finite well-ordered set is its cardinality (i.e., the number of elements).
    order_type = len(X)
