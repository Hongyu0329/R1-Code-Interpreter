    "The user wants to find the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user is asking for the maximum possible value of `m`, where `m` is the number of different integers `k` for which a graph `G` on `n=128` vertices has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size `k`.\n\n2.  **Literal Interpretation:** Let `S(G)` be the set of all integers `k` such that `G` has an induced clique of size `k`. The question asks for `max_G |S(G)|`.\n    If a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`), then it also has induced cliques of all sizes `j` where `1 <= j < k`. This is because any subset of `j` vertices from the `k`-vertex clique will itself induce a `j`-vertex clique.\n    This means the set of induced clique sizes for any graph is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph.\n    The number of different sizes is therefore `k_max`.\n    The problem is then to find the maximum possible value of `k_max` for a graph on 128 vertices. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_128}`, which has `k_max = 128`. This interpretation leads to the trivial answer of 128.\n\n3.  **A More Nuanced Interpretation:** The request to use coding skills and the hint to \"output each number in the final equation\" suggest a more complex problem. A common variation of this type of problem in combinatorics involves finding the maximum number of *maximal* cliques of distinct sizes. A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. This interpretation leads to a non-trivial calculation.\n\n4.  **Adopt the Nuanced Interpretation:** I will assume the question is asking for the maximum number of *maximal* cliques of distinct sizes.\n    *   To construct a graph with `m` maximal cliques of distinct sizes `k_1, k_2, ..., k_m`, we can take the disjoint union of `m` complete graphs: `G = K_{k_1} U K_{k_2} U ... U K_{k_m}`. In this graph, each component `K_{k_i}` is a maximal clique.\n    *   The total number of vertices used is `n_used = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m`. This must be less than or equal to the total number of vertices available, `n = 128`.\n    *   To maximize `m`, the number of different clique sizes, we should choose the smallest possible distinct sizes for the cliques. The smallest distinct positive integers are `1, 2, 3, ...`.\n    *   So, we choose `k_i = i` for `i = 1, 2, ..., m`.\n    *   The problem reduces to finding the largest integer `m` such that the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m <= 128`.\n\n5.  **Plan the code:**\n    *   Initialize a running sum of vertices `total_vertices` to 0 and a counter for the number of cliques `m` to 0.\n    *   Loop, and in each iteration, try to add the next smallest clique size (`m + 1`).\n    *   If adding the next clique (`total_vertices + (m + 1)`) does not exceed 128, add its size to the sum and increment `m`.\n    *   If it exceeds 128, stop. The current value of `m` is the maximum possible.\n    *   Finally, print the explanation, the final equation with all its numbers, and the result, as requested.\n\nThis approach provides a non-trivial solution that aligns with the hints in the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem based on the interpretation that it asks for the\n    maximum number of maximal cliques of distinct sizes that can fit into a graph\n    with n=128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n    total_vertices = 0\n    num_cliques = 0\n    \n    # We find the largest 'm' such that 1 + 2 + ... + m <= n\n    while True:\n        next_clique_size = num_cliques + 1\n        if total_vertices + next_clique_size > n:\n            # Cannot add the next clique\n            break\n        \n        # Add the next clique\n        total_vertices += next_clique_size\n        num_cliques += 1\n\n    # Prepare the equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(i) for i in range(1, num_cliques + 1)]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"Assuming the problem asks for the maximum number of maximal cliques of distinct sizes within {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"To maximize this number, we choose the smallest distinct clique sizes (1, 2, 3, ...).\")\n    print(f\"We find the largest integer m such that the sum 1 + 2 + ... + m is at most {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation representing the sum of vertices for these cliques is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_vertices}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis sum ({total_vertices}) is less than or equal to {n}.\")\n    \n    next_size = num_cliques + 1\n    next_sum = total_vertices + next_size\n    print(f\"If we tried to add the next clique of size {next_size}, the sum would be {total_vertices} + {next_size} = {next_sum}, which is greater than {n}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes under this interpretation is {num_cliques}.\")\n\nsolve_clique_problem()\n<<<15>>>\n```"
