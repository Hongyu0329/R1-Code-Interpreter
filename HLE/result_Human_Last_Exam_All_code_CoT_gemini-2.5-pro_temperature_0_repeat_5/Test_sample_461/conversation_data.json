    "The creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago is a dinosaur. I will search for a polycyclic hydrocarbon that is named after a dinosaur. The most fitting answer is Pterodactyladiene, named after the Pterodactyl.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_dinosaur_chemical():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    chemical_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n    \n    # The creature it is named after\n    creature_name = \"Pterodactyl\"\n    \n    # The extinction period mentioned in the question\n    extinction_years_ago = 65\n    \n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature ({creature_name}) that has been extinct for over {extinction_years_ago} million years is called: {chemical_name}\")\n\nfind_dinosaur_chemical()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
