    # The core concept: Predictive models of genetic drift (like the Neutral Theory)
    # often use the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) as a neutral baseline
    # to measure selection on nonsynonymous substitutions (dN).

    # The problem statement: The distributions of synonymous, nonsynonymous, and
    # intron lengths are correlated. This correlation challenges the model.

    print("Analyzing the challenge to genetic drift models:")
    print("="*50)

    # Step 1: Identify the key assumption of the models.
    # The key assumption is that synonymous sites are neutral and can serve as a
    # reliable baseline for the rate of mutation and drift.
    print("Step 1: The model's key assumption is that synonymous substitution rates (dS) reflect neutral drift.")

    # Step 2: Consider how a correlation between dS and dN would affect this assumption.
    # If dS is correlated with dN for reasons other than a shared underlying mutation rate,
    # it means dS is not purely neutral. Forces like background selection or weak selection
    # on codon usage could be influencing both.
    print("Step 2: A correlation between dS and dN suggests that dS is not a purely neutral baseline.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate why this is the biggest challenge.
    # This contamination of the baseline makes it difficult to confidently interpret dN/dS ratios.
    # It fundamentally weakens the model's ability to separate the effects of drift from selection.
    # Other options describe phenomena that the models either account for or are designed to detect (like option C),
    # or are less central to the core dS/dN framework.
    print("Step 3: This issue is the most fundamental challenge because it undermines the model's core mechanism for detecting selection.")
