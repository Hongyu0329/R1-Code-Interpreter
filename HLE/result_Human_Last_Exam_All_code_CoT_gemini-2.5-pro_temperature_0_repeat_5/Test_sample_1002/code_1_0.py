# The problem asks for the value of a limit related to the function f(m).
# This is a known problem in extremal combinatorics, related to the Turan-type
# problem for matrices (also known as the Zarankiewicz problem).

# The function f(m) is the minimum guaranteed number of ones that can be kept
# from any 0/1 matrix with m ones, such that the resulting matrix has no
# k x k all-ones submatrix.

# The asymptotic behavior of f(m) is known to be f(m) = Theta(m^(1 - 1/k)).
# This result relies on deep conjectures in combinatorics, particularly that
# the densest k x k-free matrices are constructed from finite fields and that
# the worst-case matrix for cleaning is a solid square of ones.

# Based on f(m) = C * m^(1 - 1/k) for some constant C, we can compute the limit:
# lim_{m->inf} ln(f(m))/ln(m) = lim_{m->inf} (ln(C) + (1 - 1/k)*ln(m)) / ln(m)
#                            = lim_{m->inf} ln(C)/ln(m) + (1 - 1/k)
#                            = 0 + 1 - 1/k
#                            = 1 - 1/k

# The final expression for the limit is 1 - 1/k.
# The numbers in this equation are 1 and 1. k is a given parameter >= 2.
