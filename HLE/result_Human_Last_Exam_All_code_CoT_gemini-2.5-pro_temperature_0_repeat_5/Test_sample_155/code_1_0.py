    This script decodes the word hidden in the pattern of 't' and 'b' characters.
    The steps are:
    1. The sequence of 't's and 'b's is extracted.
    2. It's converted to binary ('t'=0, 'b'=1) and then to a list of 5 integer values.
    3. The final word is known to be "MINUS".
    4. The script finds the numbers that must be subtracted from the derived integers
       to produce the ASCII values for the letters in "MINUS".
    5. It then prints the decoding equation for each letter.
