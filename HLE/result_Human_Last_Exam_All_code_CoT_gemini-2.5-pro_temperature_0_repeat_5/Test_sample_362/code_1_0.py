    # - Finding the longest carbon chain with the double bond: 5 carbons -> pentene.
    # - Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest locant: pent-2-ene.
    # - Identifying and locating the substituents:
    #   - A '2-chlorophenyl' group at position 1.
    #   - Two 'methyl' groups at position 4.
