    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to identify the corresponding quadratic irrational number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Quadratic Irrational:** The generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is associated with the quadratic irrational number given by the formula:\n    \\[ \\alpha_{p/q} = \\frac{3q - \\sqrt{9q^2 - 4p^2}}{2p} \\]\n    For \\( m_{4/7} \\), we have \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\).\n\n2.  **Calculate the Value:** We will substitute \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\) into the formula to get the specific number \\( \\alpha_{4/7} \\). Let's denote this number as \\( \\alpha = \\frac{C - \\sqrt{D}}{B} \\).\n    *   \\( C = 3q = 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\)\n    *   \\( B = 2p = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\)\n    *   \\( D = 9q^2 - 4p^2 = 9(7^2) - 4(4^2) = 9(49) - 4(16) = 441 - 64 = 377 \\)\n    So, the number is \\( \\alpha = \\frac{21 - \\sqrt{377}}{8} \\).\n\n3.  **Compute the Continued Fraction:** We will use the standard algorithm to find the continued fraction of \\( \\alpha \\). Since \\( \\alpha \\) is a quadratic irrational, its continued fraction will be periodic. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    *   Initialize \\( \\xi_0 = \\alpha \\).\n    *   For each step \\( i \\), calculate the integer part \\( a_i = \\lfloor \\xi_i \\rfloor \\).\n    *   The next term is \\( \\xi_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_i - a_i} \\).\n    *   We will keep track of the intermediate terms \\( \\xi_i \\) to detect when the sequence repeats, which marks the periodic part of the fraction.\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final result will be presented as an equation showing the value of \\( \\alpha \\) and its corresponding continued fraction in the standard notation \\( [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, \\overline{a_k, \\dots, a_n}] \\). The code will print this final equation, including all the numerical components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction associated with the generalized\n    Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 4\n    q = 7\n\n    # 1.
