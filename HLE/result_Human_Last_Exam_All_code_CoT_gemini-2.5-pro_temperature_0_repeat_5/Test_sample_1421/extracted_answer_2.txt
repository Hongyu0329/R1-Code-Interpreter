The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by the path integral Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ]), where the integral is over anti-commuting Grassmann fields (ψ, ψ*) that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions ψ(β) = -ψ(0). The action S is the integral of the Lagrangian L = ψ*(τ)∂_τψ(τ) + H(ψ*, ψ) over imaginary time τ from 0 to β.
