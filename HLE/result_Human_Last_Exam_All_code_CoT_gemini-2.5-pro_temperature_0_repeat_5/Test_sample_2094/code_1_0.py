    This function determines which of the specified champions can perform a
    hook-flash, defined as hooking and then flashing in the opposite
    direction to extend the hook's range.

    The analysis is based on the game mechanics of League of Legends as of Season 14 (2024):
    - Blitzcrank, Nautilus, and Pyke throw simple projectiles. Their hook's range is fixed upon casting.
    - Thresh's hook range is dynamically tied to his position while the hook is in the air.
      Flashing backwards during the hook's travel time extends its effective range.
