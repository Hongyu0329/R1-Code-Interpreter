    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Overall Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5-trisubstituted, 2,4,6-trimethylated benzene ring. This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This means the three large arms attached to the benzene ring are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to determine the number of unique proton signals in one of these arms and add it to the number of signals from the central core.\n\n2.  **Central Core Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Groups (-CH3):** There are three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the benzene ring. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three groups are equivalent and will produce a single peak.\n        *   Signals = 1\n\n3.  **Linker Protons (-CH2-):**\n    *   There are three methylene (-CH2-) groups that link the central ring to the large indazole substituents. These three groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   However, each -CH2- group is attached to a chiral center (the entire rigid, chiral indazole unit). This makes the two protons within each -CH2- group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent. They will have different chemical shifts and will appear as two distinct signals (likely a pair of doublets, known as an AB quartet).\n        *   Signals = 2\n\n4.  **Protons on one Indazole Substituent:** Now we analyze one of the identical `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` units. This is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system derived from camphor. The lack of internal symmetry and the presence of chiral centers mean most protons are in unique environments.\n    *   **H-3 (pyrazole ring proton):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring. It is in a unique electronic environment. -> **1 signal**.\n    *   **H-4 (bridgehead proton):** This is a single proton at a bridgehead carbon. -> **1 signal**.\n    *   **H-5 and H-6 (methylene protons):** There are two -CH2- groups in the saturated six-membered ring (positions 5 and 6). In each -CH2- group, the two protons (endo and exo) are diastereotopic due to the rigid, asymmetric structure. Each CH2 group will therefore give rise to two signals.\n        *   H-5 protons -> **2 signals**.\n        *   H-6 protons -> **2 signals**.\n    *   **Methyl Protons:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor-derived skeleton.\n        *   **C7-Methyl:** One methyl group is on the C7 bridgehead. -> **1 signal**.\n        *   **C8-gem-dimethyl:** Two methyl groups are on the C8 bridge carbon. These two groups are diastereotopic because one is closer to the pyrazole ring than the other in the rigid structure. They are chemically non-equivalent. -> **2 signals**.\n    *   Total signals from one indazole unit = 1 (H-3) + 1 (H-4) + 2 (H-5) + 2 (H-6) + 1 (C7-Me) + 2 (C8-diMe) = **9 signals**.\n\n5.  **Total Number of Peaks:** We sum the signals from all the unique parts.\n    *   Total Signals = (Central Methyls) + (Linker CH2) + (Indazole Unit)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the number of signals from the central trimethylbenzene core.\n# The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\ncentral_methyl_signals = 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the number of signals from the three linker methylene (-CH2-) groups.\n# The three -CH2- groups are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\n# However, each CH2 is attached to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic.\n# This results in two distinct signals for the methylene protons.\nlinker_methylene_signals = 2\n\n# Step 3: Define the number of signals from one of the indazole substituent units.\n# This unit is rigid and chiral, leading to many non-equivalent protons.\n# H-3 proton on the pyrazole ring\nh3_signals = 1\n# H-4 bridgehead proton\nh4_signals = 1\n# H-5 methylene protons (diastereotopic)\nh5_signals = 2\n# H-6 methylene protons (diastereotopic)\nh6_signals = 2\n# C7-methyl group\nc7_methyl_signals = 1\n# C8-gem-dimethyl groups (diastereotopic)\nc8_dimethyl_signals = 2\n\n# Sum the signals from the single substituent unit\nsubstituent_signals = h3_signals + h4_signals + h5_signals + h6_signals + c7_methyl_signals + c8_dimethyl_signals\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total number of signals by summing the signals from all parts.\ntotal_signals = central_methyl_signals + linker_methylene_signals + substituent_signals\n\n# Step 5: Print the breakdown and the final result.\nprint(\"Calculation of 1H NMR Peaks:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from central core methyl groups: {central_methyl_signals}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from linker methylene (-CH2-) groups: {linker_methylene_signals}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one indazole unit: {h3_signals} (H-3) + {h4_signals} (H-4) + {h5_signals} (H-5) + {h6_signals} (H-6) + {c7_methyl_signals} (C7-Me) + {c8_dimethyl_signals} (C8-diMe) = {substituent_signals}\")\nprint(\"---\")\nprint(f\"Total expected peaks = {central_methyl_signals} + {linker_methylene_signals} + {substituent_signals} = {total_signals}\")\n\n```\n<<<H>>>"
