    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use methods of asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the dominant contribution:** For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ (where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$) becomes very large near the point where $g(x)$ is zero. In the integration interval $[0, 15]$, this occurs only at $x=0$. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from a small region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integrand:** Near $x=0$, the term $9x^5$ is the dominant part of the polynomial $g(x)$ because it's the term with the lowest power of $x$. We can thus approximate the integral as:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n3.  **Use a scaling substitution:** To evaluate this simplified integral and find its dependence on $\\epsilon$, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} u$. This gives $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} du$. The new limits of integration are from $u=0$ to $u=15 \\cdot (9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the upper limit approaches infinity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the transformed integral:** Substituting into the approximate integral, we get:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + 9((\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u)^5} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5}$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du = 9^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^5} du$\n\n5.  **Calculate the constant:** The definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du$ is a standard result, equal to $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5$, this is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Assemble the final formula:** Combining these parts, we get the final analytical approximation:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9^{-1/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5} = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the numerical values for the coefficient and the exponent in this formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon)\n    for the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From the analysis, the integral I(epsilon) is approximated by C * epsilon^p.\n    \n    # The exponent 'p' is derived from the dominant term's power 'n'.\n    # g(x) is dominated by 9x^5, so n=5.\n    n = 5.0\n    p = (1.0 / n) - 1.0\n    \n    # The coefficient 'C' depends on the coefficient of the dominant term 'a' and 'n'.\n    # The dominant term is a*x^n = 9*x^5.\n    a = 9.0\n    \n    # The coefficient C = a^(-1/n) * integral from 0 to inf of 1/(1+u^n) du\n    # The integral is known to be (pi/n) / sin(pi/n)\n    integral_value = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n    C = (a**(-1.0/n)) * integral_value\n    \n    # Output the results, including each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for the integral is of the form: I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^p\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Derivation of the components ---\")\n    \n    # Exponent p\n    print(f\"The exponent p is calculated as 1/n - 1, where n is the lowest power of x (n=5.0).\")\n    print(f\"p = 1.0/{n} - 1.0 = {p}\")\n    \n    # Coefficient C\n    print(\"\\nThe coefficient C is calculated as a^(-1/n) * [pi / (n * sin(pi/n))], where a=9.0 and n=5.0.\")\n    a_inv_n = a**(-1.0/n)\n    pi_over_n_sin = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n    print(f\"a^(-1/n) = {a}^(-1.0/{n}) = {a_inv_n}\")\n    print(f\"[pi / (n * sin(pi/n))] = [pi / ({n} * sin(pi/{n}))] = {pi_over_n_sin}\")\n    print(f\"C = {a_inv_n} * {pi_over_n_sin} = {C}\")\n    \n    # Final formula\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Approximate Formula ---\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx {C} * epsilon^({p})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) approx (pi / (5 * 9^(1/5) * sin(pi/5))) * epsilon^(-4/5)>>>"
