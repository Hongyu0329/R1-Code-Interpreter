    This function identifies two key characteristics of Disneyfication as discussed by Alan Bryman.
    
    Alan Bryman's four dimensions of Disneyization are:
    1. Theming: Applying a narrative to a location or institution.
    2. Hybrid Consumption: The blurring of lines between different forms of consumption.
    3. Merchandising: The sale of goods related to the theme or brand.
    4. Performative Labor: Employees acting out a role as part of their job.
    
    We need to find the answer choice that lists two of these four dimensions.
    
    Let's analyze the choices:
    A. hybrid consumption and merchandising - Both are correct dimensions.
    B. performative labor and sanitization - 'Sanitization' is not one of the four main dimensions.
    C. trivialization and theming - 'Trivialization' is a critique, not a core dimension.
    D. sanitization and trivialization - Neither are core dimensions.
    E. Disneyfication and Disneyization - These are the names of the concepts.
    F. McDonaldization and Disneyization - These are two separate theories.
    G. theming and performative labor - Both are correct dimensions.
    
    Both A and G contain two correct dimensions. However, 'theming' and 'performative labor' are often considered the most foundational aspects of the theory, describing the transformation of space and labor. 'Hybrid consumption' and 'merchandising' are more focused on the commercial aspects. Therefore, G is the most representative answer.

    # The two characteristics from the best answer choice
    characteristic_1 = "theming"
    characteristic_2 = "performative labor"
    
    # The chosen answer letter
    final_answer = "G"
    
    print(f"Alan Bryman discusses several characteristics of Disneyization. Among the choices, the two that are core dimensions of his theory are '{characteristic_1}' and '{characteristic_2}'.")
