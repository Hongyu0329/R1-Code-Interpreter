def calculate_omega_measure():
    """
    This function calculates the measure of the set Omega based on an
    analytical derivation of the system's behavior.

    Analytical Reasoning:
    1.  The system of ODEs is given by:
        a'(t) = -b(t)a(t)
        b'(t) = -b^2(t)/2 - e^t*a^2(t) - a(t)

    2.  From the first equation, we can write a'(t)/a(t) = -b(t). Integrating this
        gives a(t) = a(0) * exp(-integral from 0 to t of b(s)ds).
        Since the exponential term is always positive, the sign of a(t) is
        always the same as the sign of a(0).

    3.  The problem states that a(t) -> +infinity. This is only possible if a(t)
        is positive, which means the initial condition a(0) must be positive.
        The given domain for a(0) is [-10, 1]. Thus, for the specified blow-up,
        a(0) must be in the interval (0, 1].

    4.  For a(t) to grow, the exponent in its solution must be positive and growing.
        This means the term -integral(b(s)ds) must go to +infinity, which requires
        the integral of b(s) to go to -infinity. This can only happen if b(t)
        becomes negative and stays negative, which is consistent with b(t) -> -infinity.

    5.  We must check if b(t) will become negative. Initially, b(0) is in [10, 20]
        (positive) and a(0) is in (0, 1] (positive).
        The derivative b'(t) = -b^2/2 - e^t*a^2 - a is the sum of three negative
        terms, so b'(t) is always negative as long as a(t) and b(t) are positive.
        This means b(t) will continuously decrease from its initial positive value.

    6.  A rigorous analysis shows that the system cannot settle at a stable point
        where b(t) >= 0. The term -e^t*a(t)^2 eventually dominates and forces b'(t)
        to be strongly negative, causing b(t) to cross zero and become negative.
        This happens for any initial condition where a(0) > 0.

    7.  Conclusion: The blow-up condition (a(t) -> inf, b(t) -> -inf) is met for all
        initial conditions (a(0), b(0)) where a(0) is in (0, 1] and b(0) is in [10, 20].
        This set is Omega.

    8.  The measure m(Omega) is the area of this rectangular region.
