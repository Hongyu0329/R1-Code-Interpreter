def get_product_iupac_name():
    """
    Determines and returns the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of
    methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide.

    The reaction proceeds via a Pummerer rearrangement:
    1.  Activation: The sulfoxide (Ph-S(O)-Me) is activated by triflic anhydride (Tf2O)
        to form a sulfonium ion intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+.
    2.  Deprotonation & Elimination: A proton is lost from the methyl group, and the
        triflate group (OTf) is eliminated to form a thionium ion, [Ph-S=CH2]+.
    3.  Nucleophilic Attack: The cyanide ion (from TMSCN) attacks the electrophilic
        methylene carbon of the thionium ion.

    This yields the final product with the structure: Ph-S-CH2-CN.

    To name this structure using IUPAC rules:
    - The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).
    - The parent chain including the nitrile carbon has two carbons, so the base name is "ethanenitrile".
    - The nitrile carbon is C1, and the adjacent methylene (-CH2-) carbon is C2.
    - A "phenylthio" group (Ph-S-) is attached at position 2.

    Combining these parts gives the final name. The number '2' is part of this name.
