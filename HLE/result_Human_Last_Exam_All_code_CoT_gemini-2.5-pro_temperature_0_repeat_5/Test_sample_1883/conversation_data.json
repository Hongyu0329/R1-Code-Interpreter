    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a polyene with 8 π-electrons.\n2.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory:** According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, a system with 8 (which is a 4n number, where n=2) π-electrons will undergo a **conrotatory** ring closure.\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome:**\n    *   We will first analyze the stereochemical outcome for the given reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. In the reactive conformation, the substituents at the termini (C2 and C9) are arranged such that a conrotatory closure leads exclusively to the **_trans_-isomer (B)**. The transition state for this process involves a significant steric clash between an inward-rotating methyl group and an inward-rotating hydrogen atom.\n    *   Since the problem states that two isomers are formed, the **_cis_-isomer (A)** must arise from a different starting material. Under thermal conditions, the C8=C9 double bond can isomerize from E to Z, creating \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. Conrotatory closure of this Z-isomer leads to the **_cis_-isomer (A)**. The most favorable transition state for this process involves a much smaller steric clash between two inward-rotating hydrogen atoms.\n4.  **Predict the Ratio using the Curtin-Hammett Principle:** The ratio of the products A and B is not determined by the stability of the starting isomers but by the difference in the free energy of their respective transition states (ΔΔG‡).\n    *   **TS for A (cis):** Lower energy, due to a minor H-H steric interaction.\n    *   **TS for B (trans):** Higher energy, due to a more significant Me-H steric interaction.\n5.  **Quantify the Energy Difference:** The energy difference (ΔΔG‡) between these two transition states can be approximated by the steric strain of a methyl group, which is known as its A-value, roughly **1.7 kcal/mol**.\n6.  **Calculate the Ratio:** The ratio of the products can be calculated using the following equation, which relates the rate constants to the activation energy difference:\n    Ratio (A/B) = exp(ΔΔG‡ / RT)\n    We will assume a standard temperature of 298 K (25 °C).\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_isomer_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of cis (A) and trans (B) products from the thermal\n    electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene based on FMO theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define constants for the calculation.\n    # The energy difference (ΔΔG‡) between the transition states leading to the\n    # trans and cis products.
