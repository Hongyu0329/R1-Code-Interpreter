# Based on the reduction of the SKI expression, the church integer n
# is equivalent to 16^16.
# This is derived from the structure ((c2 c2) c2) ((c2 c2) c2),
# where c2 is the Church numeral for 2.

# Let's represent the operations on the numbers.
# c2 c2 -> 2^2
c4_val = 2**2
# (c4) c2 -> 2^4
c16_val = c4_val**2 # This is (2^2)^2 = 2^4 = 16. A small correction in logic here.
# Let's re-evaluate c4 c2. It's 2^4, not 4^2.
# c_a c_b -> b^a. So c4 c2 -> 2^4 = 16.
c16_val = 2**c4_val

# The final expression is c16 c16, which is 16^16.
n_base = c16_val
n_exponent = c16_val
n = n_base ** n_exponent

# The final task is to calculate log_2(n).
log_base = 2
result = math.log2(n)

# Print the final equation as requested.
# The equation is log_2(16^16) = 64.
