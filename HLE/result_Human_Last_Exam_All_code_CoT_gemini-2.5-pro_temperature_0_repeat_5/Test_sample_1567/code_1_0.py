# This problem is theoretical and cannot be solved by a direct computation.
# The reasoning is explained above. The final answer is derived from this reasoning.
# The logic is as follows:
# 1. For a given dimension d >= 3, the answer is d-1.
# 2. The question asks for a single value of k that works for ALL d >= 3.
# 3. This means we need to find the maximum k such that k <= d-1 for all d >= 3.
# 4. This is equivalent to k <= min(d-1) for d in {3, 4, 5, ...}.
# 5. The minimum of (d-1) for d>=3 is at d=3, which gives 3-1=2.
# 6. Therefore, the maximal k is 2.
