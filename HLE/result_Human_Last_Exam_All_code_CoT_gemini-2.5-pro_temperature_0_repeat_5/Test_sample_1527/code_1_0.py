    # From the geometric analysis, we derive a relationship between the radius r
    # and the distance between the centers of the two circles.
    #
    # 1. The angle bisectors of y=x+1 and y=-x+5 are x=2 and y=3.
    # 2. Assume center C is on x=2, C=(2, cy), and center D is on y=3, D=(dx, 3).
    # 3. For circle C (radius r): (cy - 3)^2 = 2*r^2
    # 4. For circle D (radius 2): (dx - 2)^2 = 8
    # 5. Squared distance between centers: dist_sq = (2-dx)^2 + (cy-3)^2 = 8 + 2*r^2
    # 6. Tangency condition (external): dist = r + 2, so dist_sq = (r+2)^2
    #
    # This leads to the equation: 8 + 2*r^2 = (r + 2)^2
    # Expanding and simplifying gives:
    # 8 + 2*r**2 = r**2 + 4*r + 4
    # r**2 - 4*r + 4 = 0
    
    # This is the final quadratic equation for r.

    a = 1
    b = -4
    c = 4
    
    print(f"The final equation for the radius r is derived from the geometric constraints:")
    print(f"({a})*r**2 + ({b})*r + {c} = 0")

    # We also check the internal tangency case: dist = |r-2|, so dist_sq = (r-2)^2
    # 8 + 2*r^2 = (r-2)^2 => r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0 => (r+2)^2 = 0
    # This gives r = -2, which is not a valid radius.
    # Therefore, we only consider the external tangency case.

    # Solve the valid equation
