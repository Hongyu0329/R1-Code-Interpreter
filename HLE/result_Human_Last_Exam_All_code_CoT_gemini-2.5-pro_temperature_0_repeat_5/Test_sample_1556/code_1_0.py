# The problem reduces to solving the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 1 = 0 for the value of |α|²,
# where x = |α|².

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
a = 1
b = 1
c = -1

# We use the quadratic formula to solve for x: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
# Since |α|² is a probability, it must be non-negative, so we take the positive root.
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
alpha_sq = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)

# The final equation for |α|² is derived from the properties of the circuit.
# We need to output each number in this final equation.

num_2 = 1
