    # Step 1 & 2: Define the problem and the environment.
    # The statement to evaluate is S = Box(P) in world w1.
    # P = forall x, y, z (T(x, y, z) -> Box(T(x, y, z)))
    # The worlds {w1, w2, w3} form an equivalence class where R is reflexive,
    # symmetric, and transitive.

    # Step 3: Prove a key lemma.
    # Lemma: If T(x,y,z) is true in a world w_k, it is also true in any world w_j
    # accessible from w_k (i.e., where R(w_k, w_j) holds).
    #
    # Proof of Lemma:
    # a. Assume T(x,y,z) is true in w_k.
    # b. The 'Axiom Truth Value' is: T(x,y,z) -> Box(forall w (R(z,w) -> T(x,y,w))).
    #    Since this axiom is true in w_k and its antecedent is true in w_k, its
    #    consequent must be true in w_k.
    # c. So, Box(forall w (R(z,w) -> T(x,y,w))) is true in w_k.
    # d. By definition of Box, for any world w_j where R(w_k, w_j), the statement
    #    Q = forall w (R(z,w) -> T(x,y,w)) must be true in w_j.
    # e. The relation R is reflexive, so R(z,z) is always true.
    # f. Since Q is true in w_j, we can instantiate the universal quantifier 'forall w'
    #    with z itself. The condition R(z,z) is met.
    # g. Therefore, we conclude that T(x,y,z) is true in w_j. This proves the lemma.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the inner formula P.
    # P = forall x, y, z (T(x, y, z) -> Box(T(x, y, z)))
    # We need to show P is true in any arbitrary world w_k.
    # This requires showing the implication I = (T(x,y,z) -> Box(T(x,y,z))) is always true.
    #
    # Proof:
    # a. Assume the antecedent T(x,y,z) is true in w_k.
    # b. We must show the consequent Box(T(x,y,z)) is also true in w_k.
    # c. Box(T(x,y,z)) is true in w_k if T(x,y,z) is true in all worlds w_j
    #    accessible from w_k.
    # d. Our lemma (from Step 3) shows exactly this: if T(x,y,z) is true in w_k,
    #    it is true in all accessible worlds w_j.
    # e. Therefore, the consequent Box(T(x,y,z)) is true.
    # f. The implication I holds. Since this is true for any x,y,z, the formula P is
    #    a theorem and its truth value is 1 in all worlds.
    
    # Step 5: Determine the final truth value of S = Box(P) in w1.
    # The truth value of Box(P) in w1 is 1 if P is true in all worlds accessible from w1.
    # The accessible worlds are w1, w2, w3.
    
    value_of_P_in_w1 = 1  # Proven to be a theorem
    value_of_P_in_w2 = 1  # Proven to be a theorem
    value_of_P_in_w3 = 1  # Proven to be a theorem

    # Since P is true in all worlds accessible from w1, Box(P) is true in w1.
    final_truth_value = 1

    # Output the final result as requested.
