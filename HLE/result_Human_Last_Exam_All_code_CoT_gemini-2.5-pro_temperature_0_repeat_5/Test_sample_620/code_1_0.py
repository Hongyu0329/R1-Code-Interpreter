    print("\n[A] Increase temperature:")
    print("   - Low temperature is the most likely cause for a slow, non-linear reaction rate.")
    print("   - Increasing temperature will increase kinetic energy, boosting the reaction rate.")
    print("   - It may also promote the formation of the active enzyme dimer.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This is a very strong candidate for a solution.")

    # Option B
    print("\n[B] Decrease temperature:")
    print("   - The assay is already very cold. Making it colder would slow the reaction even more.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This would make the problem worse.")

    # Option C
    print("\n[C] Increase Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - This would make the reaction faster, but it doesn't address the root cause (low temperature).")
    print("   - If the non-linearity is due to rapid substrate depletion, this would worsen it.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Not the best initial step.")

    # Option D
    print("\n[D] Decrease Enzyme Concentration:")
    print("   - This is the correct action if the reaction is too fast and depleting the substrate.")
    print("   - Given the cold temperature, a 'too fast' reaction is highly unlikely.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This is likely incorrect.")

    print("\nFinal Recommendation:")
    print("The most significant deviation from a standard protocol is the low temperature. Correcting this by increasing the temperature is the most logical first step to troubleshoot the assay.")
