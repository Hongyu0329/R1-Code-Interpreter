    "Based on paleontological analysis of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022), the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess can be determined. I will write a simple Python script to state this fact.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The information is derived from scientific papers describing the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  I will store the number of depressions reported in the literature in a variable.\n3.  The script will then print a sentence that answers the user's question, clearly stating the number.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the question based on established paleontological data.\n\n# According to the scientific description of the Irritator challengeri skull,\n# the lacrimal recess contains a specific number of depressions (accessory openings).\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The following line prints the final answer in a complete sentence.\n# The \"equation\" is the statement of this value.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
