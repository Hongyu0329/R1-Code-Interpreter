    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem asks for the symmetry factor of a specific Feynman diagram. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** First, I need to understand the topology of the Feynman diagram from the description: \"two vertices and four field contractions.\" In the context of a common theory like $\\lambda\\phi^4$, this describes a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines). The simplest and most direct topology fitting this description is one where two vertices are connected to each other by four identical lines (propagators). This is sometimes called a \"melon\" diagram.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, `S`, is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when calculating the value of a diagram. It is equal to the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be interchanged without changing the diagram's overall structure (i.e., the order of its automorphism group).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the symmetry factors for each set of identical components:\n    *   **Vertex Symmetry:** The diagram has two vertices that come from the same interaction term in the theory (e.g., from a $\\lambda^2$ expansion). Therefore, these vertices are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. The number of permutations of these 2 vertices is $2!$.\n    *   **Propagator Symmetry:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are also identical. They can be interchanged in any way without altering the diagram. The number of permutations for these 4 lines is $4!$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the vertex symmetry and the propagator symmetry: $S = 2! \\times 4!$. I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the steps clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four identical propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be permuted\n    num_vertices = 2\n    \n    # Number of identical propagators (lines) connecting the two vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # The symmetry from permuting identical vertices is n!\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # The symmetry from permuting identical propagators is k!\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"Assuming the diagram has 2 vertices connected by 4 identical propagators ('melon' diagram):\")\n    print(\"\\nThe symmetry factor S is the product of the symmetries of its components:\")\n    print(f\"1.
