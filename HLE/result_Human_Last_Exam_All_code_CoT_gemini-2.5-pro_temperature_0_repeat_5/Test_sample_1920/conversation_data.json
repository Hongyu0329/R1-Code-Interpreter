    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow a structured approach.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we determine the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Structure of Primitive Characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n3.  **Order of a Character**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are looking for characters where this order is exactly 6.\n4.  **Counting using Inclusion-Exclusion**: To find the number of characters with order exactly 6, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let $A_m$ be the set of primitive characters whose order divides $m$. The number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by:\n    $|A_6| - |A_3| - |A_2| + |A_1|$.\n5.  **Calculating $|A_m|$**: The order of a component character $\\chi_i$ (modulo $p_i$) must divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i-1$. The number of non-trivial characters modulo $p_i$ whose order divides $m$ is $\\gcd(m, p_i-1) - 1$. Therefore, the total number of primitive characters with order dividing $m$ is the product over all prime factors:\n    $|A_m| = \\prod_{i=1}^k (\\gcd(m, p_i-1) - 1)$.\n\nThe Python script below implements this plan. It will:\n-   Factorize $d=53599$.\n-   Calculate the values of $|A_m|$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n-   Apply the inclusion-exclusion formula to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of d\n    primes = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is: {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if its components are non-trivial.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate p-1 for each prime factor\n    p_minus_1 = [p - 1 for p in primes]\n    print(\"Step 2: For each prime factor p, calculate p-1:\")\n    for i in range(len(primes)):\n        print(f\"  For p = {primes[i]}, p-1 = {p_minus_1[i]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Use inclusion-exclusion principle\n    print(\"Step 3: Use inclusion-exclusion to find characters of order exactly 6.\")\n    print(\"The number is N = |A_6| - |A_3| - |A_2| + |A_1|, where |A_k| is the\")\n    print(\"number of primitive characters with order dividing k.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate |A_k| for divisors of g=6\n    divisors_of_g = [1, 2, 3, 6]\n    A = {}\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate |A_k| for each divisor k of 6:\")\n    for k in sorted(divisors_of_g):\n        terms = []\n        prod = 1\n        print(f\"\\nCalculating |A_{k}| = PRODUCT(gcd(k, p-1) - 1):\")\n        for i in range(len(primes)):\n            p = primes[i]\n            pm1 = p_minus_1[i]\n            val = gcd(k, pm1) - 1\n            terms.append(val)\n            prod *= val\n            print(f\"  p={p:<2}: gcd({k}, {pm1}) - 1 = {val}\")\n        A[k] = prod\n        print(f\"Result: |A_{k}| = {' * '.join(map(str, terms))} = {prod}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final result\n    print(\"Step 5: Apply the inclusion-exclusion formula:\")\n    result = A[6] - A[3] - A[2] + A[1]\n    \n    print(f\"Number of characters of order 6 = |A_6| - |A_3| - |A_2| + |A_1|\")\n    print(f\"                               = {A[6]} - {A[3]} - {A[2]} + {A[1]}\")\n    print(f\"                               = {result}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The final number of primitive Dirichlet characters is {result}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<608>>>"
