# The riddle points to a type of coffee drink, as hinted by "Cafi...",
# which is phonetically similar to "Caffè".
# The preference for a "peculiar shape" suggests a drink that is not uniform.
# "Macchiato" means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian, describing an espresso
# marked with a small amount of milk foam.
# This fits the description of a "peculiar" coffee.
