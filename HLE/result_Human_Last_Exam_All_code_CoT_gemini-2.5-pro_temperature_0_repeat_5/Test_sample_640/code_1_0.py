def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The analysis is based on the principle that the coupling nature of the potential V(r),
    the Jost matrix F(E), and the S-matrix S(E) are equivalent. If one can be
    diagonalized by a constant transformation matrix U, so can the others. "Nontrivially
    coupled" means such a constant U does not exist.

    - Statement 1: Correct. If S(E) is nontrivially coupled, the underlying potential V(r) must also be.
    - Statement 2: Correct. If S(E) is diagonal (uncoupled), the potential V(r) must also be diagonal.
    - Statement 3: Correct. If V(r) is nontrivially coupled, this coupling must be reflected in F(E).
    - Statement 4: Correct. S(E) is derived directly from F(E), so if F(E) is nontrivially coupled, S(E) must be too.
    - Statement 5: False. A diagonal F(E) implies a diagonal V(r), which is not nontrivially coupled.
