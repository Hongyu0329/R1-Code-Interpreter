# X is the building number of the former "BelExpo" exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly st.
x = 27

# Y is the number of the iconic tram route that passed through Kastryčnickaja st.
y = 7

# Calculate X to the power of Y
result = math.pow(x, y)

# Print the final equation and the result
# The result is printed as an integer as it's a whole number.
print(f"{x} ^ {y} = {int(result)}")
