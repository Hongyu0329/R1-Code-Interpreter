# Define the parameters from the problem.
# The group is G = (Z/p^2 Z)^n where p=7 and n=2024.
p = 7
n = 2024

# The number of cyclic subgroups of order p is equal to the number of
# 1-dimensional subspaces in an n-dimensional vector space over F_p.
# The formula is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).
# We use integer division // as the result is guaranteed to be an integer.
num_subgroups_of_order_p = (p**n - 1) // (p - 1)

# The smallest set A must contain one element for each of these subgroups,
# plus one element for the trivial subgroup {0}.
result = num_subgroups_of_order_p + 1

# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.
# The equation is (|A'|) + 1, where |A'| is the number of subgroups of order 7.
