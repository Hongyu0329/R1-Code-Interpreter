The set of all stabilizing controllers H_2(s) is given by:
H_2(s) = ((s**2 - 1))*K(s) + s) / (-s*K(s) + -1)

Where K(s) is a parameter function.

For the closed-loop system to be stable, K(s) must be a stable and proper rational function.
For the controller H_2(s) itself to be proper, K(s) must satisfy additional constraints (e.g., be strictly proper with specific leading coefficients).
