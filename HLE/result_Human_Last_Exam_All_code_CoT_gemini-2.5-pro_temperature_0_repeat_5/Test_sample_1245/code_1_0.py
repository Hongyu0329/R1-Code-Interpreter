# Step 1: Identify all fluorescent components in the experiment.

print("  - eGFP: Genetically encoded in neutrophils (from the Lyz:HaloTag-eGFP transgene).")
print("  - DsRed: Genetically encoded in macrophages (from the mpeg1:SNAPtag-DsRed transgene).")
print("  - A chemical probe: This probe is a far-red dye that binds to the HaloTag protein, also in neutrophils.")

# Step 2: Match each component to its required excitation wavelength from the list.

print(f"  - DsRed is optimally excited by light around {excitation_DsRed} nm.")
print(f"  - The far-red chemical probe is excited by light in the far-red spectrum, corresponding to {excitation_probe} nm.")

# Step 3: Determine the meaning of "first" in the context of a microscopy experiment.
print("\nStep 3: Determining the order of imaging.")
print("The question asks which wavelength will be used 'first'.")
print("In live-cell multi-color fluorescence microscopy, a standard best practice is to image from the longest wavelength to the shortest.")
print("This is done to minimize phototoxicity and to prevent the higher-energy light (for shorter wavelengths) from bleaching the other fluorophores.")
print(f"The wavelengths used are {excitation_probe} nm, {excitation_DsRed} nm, and {excitation_eGFP} nm.")
print(f"Therefore, the logical and standard imaging sequence would be: {excitation_probe} nm -> {excitation_DsRed} nm -> {excitation_eGFP} nm.")

# Step 4: Conclude the answer.
print("\n### Conclusion ###")
print(f"Based on the standard imaging protocol, the first excitation wavelength that will be used to get a signal is {excitation_probe} nm.")
