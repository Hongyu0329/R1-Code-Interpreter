    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the properties of any function `f` that satisfies the given equation. The equation is `f(f(x)) = exp(x)`.\n2.  Since `f` is given to be continuous and can be shown to be injective, it must be strictly monotonic. This leads to two cases: `f` is strictly increasing or `f` is strictly decreasing.\n3.  **Case 1: `f` is strictly increasing.** I will show that this case is possible and leads to a large family of solutions. I will outline a method for constructing these solutions. The construction will depend on choosing an arbitrary continuous increasing function on a specific small interval, which can then be extended to the entire real line. The number of ways to define this initial function will determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.\n4.  **Case 2: `f` is strictly decreasing.** I will show that this case leads to a logical contradiction. Therefore, no such decreasing functions exist.\n5.  **Conclusion.** Based on the analysis of the two cases, the cardinality of the set of solutions is the cardinality of the set of increasing solutions found in step 3. I will calculate this cardinality.\n\nThe final answer will be presented in a Python code block that programmatically prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final conclusion, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step solution to find the cardinality\n    of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The equation is f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    # Let S be the set of such continuous functions f. We want to find |S|.\n\n    # Step 1: Basic properties of f\n    # 1. f must be injective: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)),\n    #    so exp(x1) = exp(x2). Since exp(x) is injective, this implies x1 = x2.\n    # 2. f is continuous (given).\n    # 3. A continuous and injective function defined on R must be strictly monotonic.\n    #    Therefore, f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n    # Step 2: Case 1: f is strictly increasing.\n    # If f is increasing, then f(f(x)) is also increasing. Since exp(x) is strictly\n    # increasing, this case is possible.\n    #\n    # Does f have a fixed point? If f(x0) = x0, then f(f(x0)) = f(x0) = x0.\n    # This would mean exp(x0) = x0. However, the equation exp(x) = x has no real\n    # solutions (as exp(x) > x for all real x). So, f has no fixed points.\n    #\n    # Since f is continuous and has no fixed points, we must have either f(x) > x for\n    # all x, or f(x) < x for all x.\n    # If we assume f(x) < x for all x, then f(f(x)) < f(x) < x.\n    # But f(f(x)) = exp(x), and exp(x) > x. This is a contradiction.\n    # Thus, we must have f(x) > x for all x.\n    #\n    # We can construct these functions. A particular solution f is determined by its\n    # behavior on a starting interval. For example, let c = f(0).\n    # From f(x) > x, we have c > 0.\n    # Applying f again, we get f(c) = f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1.\n    # Since f is increasing and c > 0, we have f(c) > f(0), which means 1 > c.\n    # So, for any solution f, f(0) must be some number c in the interval (0, 1).\n    #\n    # The function f maps the interval [0, c] to [f(0), f(c)] = [c, 1]. This restricted\n    # function is a strictly increasing continuous function (a homeomorphism).\n    #\n    # It can be shown that any choice of c in (0, 1) and any homeomorphism\n    # h: [0, c] -> [c, 1] can be uniquely extended to a full solution f over R.\n    # The number of choices for c is |(0, 1)|, which is the cardinality of the\n    # continuum, denoted as c.\n    # For each choice of c, the number of homeomorphisms from [0, c] to [c, 1] is\n    # also c.\n    # Therefore, the total number of increasing solutions is c * c = c.\n\n    # Step 3: Case 2: f is strictly decreasing.\n    # If f is decreasing, f(f(x)) is increasing. This is consistent with exp(x).\n    # As before, f has no fixed points, so either f(x) > x or f(x) < x for all x.\n    #\n    # Case 2a: Assume f(x) > x for all x.\n    # Since f is strictly decreasing, f(x) > x implies f(f(x)) < f(x).\n    # This means exp(x) < f(x) for all x.\n    # This inequality implies that as x -> infinity, f(x) >= exp(x), so f(x) -> infinity.\n    # However, a strictly decreasing function f: R -> R cannot approach +infinity as\n    # x -> infinity. This is a contradiction.\n    #\n    # Case 2b: Assume f(x) < x for all x.\n    # Let M = lim_{x->-infinity} f(x). Since f is decreasing, M is the supremum of the range of f.\n    # The condition f(x) < x for all x implies that M = lim_{x->-infinity} f(x) <= lim_{x->-infinity} x = -infinity.\n    # So, M must be -infinity.\n    # The range of a decreasing function is an interval of the form (L, M), where L is the infimum.\n    # For the range to be a non-empty interval, we must have L < M.\n    # But M = -infinity, so no such L exists. This is a contradiction.\n    #\n    # Both subcases for a decreasing f lead to a contradiction. Thus, no such functions exist.\n\n    # Step 4: Conclusion\n    # The set of solutions consists only of the strictly increasing functions.\n    # The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R\")\n    print(\"that satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation f(f(x)) = exp(x) are implicitly 1 (from the coefficient of x) and e.\")\n    print(f\"The base of the natural logarithm, e, is approximately {math.e}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis Summary ---\")\n    print(\"1.
