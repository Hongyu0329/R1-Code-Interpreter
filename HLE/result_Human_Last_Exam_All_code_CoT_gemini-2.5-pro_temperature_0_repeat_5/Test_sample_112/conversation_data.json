    "My plan is to first identify the specific version of \"Sir Launfal\" in question, as there are multiple works with this title. The most famous one preserved in a manuscript is the 15th-century romance by Thomas Chestre. Then, I will identify the manuscript it is part of, which is the Percy Folio. Finally, I will identify the \"book of manners\" contained within the same manuscript and create a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem \"Sir Launfal\" in the Percy Folio manuscript.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 15th-century romance \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre is preserved in the Percy Folio.\n    # This manuscript is a collection of various ballads and poems.\n    manuscript = \"Percy Folio\"\n    \n    # Within the same manuscript, there is a well-known medieval \"book of manners\".\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\" # This translates to \"The Book of Courtesy\".\n    \n    print(f\"The poem 'Sir Launfal' was preserved in the {manuscript} alongside the book of manners called '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
