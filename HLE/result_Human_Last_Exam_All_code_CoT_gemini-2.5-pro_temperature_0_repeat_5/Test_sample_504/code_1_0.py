    # Let N be the dimension of the complex vector space V.
    N = 6

    # We start with a set of N mutually orthogonal vectors, which form an orthonormal basis.
    # Let's denote them as e_1, e_2, ..., e_6.
    # This set has 6 vectors, and the angle between any pair is pi/2.
    # This satisfies the conditions. So the number is at least 6.
    num_basis_vectors = N
    
    # Now, let's see if we can add more vectors.
    # Any new vector v must be a linear combination of the basis vectors.
    # v = c_1*e_1 + c_2*e_2 + ... + c_6*e_6
    # For v to be a unit vector, sum(|c_i|^2) = 1.
    # The angle condition means |(v, e_i)| must be 0 or 1/2.
    # |(v, e_i)| = |c_i|. So, |c_i| is 0 or 1/2.
    # This means |c_i|^2 is 0 or 1/4.
    # To satisfy sum(|c_i|^2) = 1, exactly 4 of the |c_i|^2 must be 1/4, and 2 must be 0.
    num_nonzero_coeffs = int(1 / (1/4))
    
    # So, any additional vector must be a combination of 4 basis vectors,
    # with coefficients of magnitude 1/2.
    # Let's consider the simplest case where the coefficients are real (1/2).
    # v_I = (1/2) * sum_{i in I} e_i, where I is a set of 4 indices.
    
    # Let v_I and v_J be two such vectors. The inner product is:
    # (v_I, v_J) = (1/4) * |I intersect J|.
    # For the angle to be pi/2 or pi/3, |(v_I, v_J)| must be 0 or 1/2.
    # This means |I intersect J| must be 0 or 2.
    
    # The problem is now to find the max number of 4-element subsets of a 6-element set {1,2,3,4,5,6},
    # such that any two subsets intersect in 0 or 2 elements.
    
    # Let's partition the 6-element set into 3 pairs: P1={1,2}, P2={3,4}, P3={5,6}.
    # We can form 4-element sets by taking the union of two pairs.
    # I_1 = P1 U P2 = {1,2,3,4}
    # I_2 = P1 U P3 = {1,2,5,6}
    # I_3 = P2 U P3 = {3,4,5,6}
    # Let's check intersections:
    # |I_1 intersect I_2| = |P1| = 2
    # |I_1 intersect I_3| = |P2| = 2
    # |I_2 intersect I_3| = |P3| = 2
    # This works. We have found 3 such sets.
    num_additional_vectors = 3
    
    # Can we find a fourth set, I_4?
    # Let x_j = |I_4 intersect P_j|. Then x_1+x_2+x_3 = 4.
    # The intersection conditions are:
    # x_1 + x_2 must be 0 or 2.
    # x_1 + x_3 must be 0 or 2.
    # x_2 + x_3 must be 0 or 2.
    # Summing these gives 2*(x_1+x_2+x_3) = 2*4 = 8.
    # The sum of the right-hand sides can be at most 2+2+2=6.
    # 8 cannot equal a number that is at most 6. This is a contradiction.
    # So, no fourth set exists.
    
    # The maximum number of additional vectors is 3.
