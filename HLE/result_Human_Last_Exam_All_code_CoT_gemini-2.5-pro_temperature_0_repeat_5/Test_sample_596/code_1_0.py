# The problem asks for the number of "higher dimensional rooted forests" (F,R)
# on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band (K) that fail to have the
# property that F simplicially collapses onto R.

# Step 1: Interpretation of terms.
# - A "higher dimensional forest" F is an acyclic subcomplex of K.
# - A "root" R is a set of vertices, one for each connected component of F.
# - The standard triangulation of the Möbius band is a 2-complex embeddable in R^3.

# Step 2: The core of the argument relies on a theorem from topology.
# Theorem: Any contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex that can be
# embedded in 3-dimensional space (R^3) is simplicially collapsible.

# Step 3: Applying the theorem to the problem.
# - Let F be any acyclic subcomplex of the Möbius band triangulation.
# - F consists of one or more connected components, F_1, F_2, ...
# - Since F is acyclic, each component F_i is contractible.
# - Since the Möbius band is embeddable in R^3, each F_i is also embeddable in R^3.
# - By the theorem, each component F_i is collapsible to a point (a vertex).
# - A root set R = {r_1, r_2, ...} contains one vertex from each component.
# - Since each F_i collapses to a point, it can collapse to its root r_i.
# - If every component F_i collapses to its root r_i, the entire forest F
#   collapses to the entire root set R.

# Step 4: Conclusion.
# The argument shows that *every* higher dimensional rooted forest on the
# Möbius band must collapse to its root set.
# Therefore, the number of forests that *fail* this property is zero.

# Step 5: Final Calculation.
# Let N_total be the total number of such forests.
# Let N_collapsible be the number of forests that do collapse.
# Our argument shows N_total = N_collapsible.
# The number we want is N_non_collapsible = N_total - N_collapsible.
# This leads to the final equation.

number_of_non_collapsible_forests = 0

# The final equation is: Number of non-collapsible forests = 0.
# We print the number from this equation.
print("The number of higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to collapse is given by the equation:")
print(f"Number = {number_of_non_collapsible_forests}")
