# --- Analytical Calculation of Tr(Cov(v)) ---

# The user wants to calculate the trace of the covariance matrix of a random variable v.
# The calculation can be simplified analytically, avoiding the need for Monte Carlo simulation.

# As derived in the plan, the trace of the covariance matrix is given by:
# Tr(Cov(v)) = E[||d||^2] - ||E[d]||^2
# where E[||d||^2] = 1 and ||E[d]||^2 = (E[(a-b)/(a+b)])^2.

# Given parameters from the problem description
alpha = 3.0
beta = 2.0

# Step 1: E[||d||^2] is analytically determined to be 1.
expected_d_norm_sq = 1.0

# Step 2: Calculate E[d_1] = E[(a-b)/(a+b)].
# This is derived from properties of Gamma and Beta distributions.
# E[d_1] = 2 * (alpha / (alpha + beta)) - 1
expected_d1 = 2 * (alpha / (alpha + beta)) - 1

# Step 3: Calculate ||E[d]||^2.
# Since other components of E[d] are zero, this is just (E[d_1])^2.
norm_sq_of_expected_d = expected_d1**2

# Step 4: Calculate the final trace.
# Tr(Cov(v)) = E[||d||^2] - ||E[d]||^2
trace_cov = expected_d_norm_sq - norm_sq_of_expected_d

# --- Output the result ---
