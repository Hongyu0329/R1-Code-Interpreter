    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the properties of fermions are captured by using anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, is mathematically expressed by the property that the square of any Grassmann variable `η` is zero: `η² = 0`.\n\nIntegration over these variables, known as Berezin integration, is defined by a set of formal rules rather than the typical calculus definition. These rules are specifically designed to be consistent with the anti-commuting nature of the variables. For a single Grassmann variable `η`, the integration is defined by two fundamental axioms:\n\n1.  `∫ dη = 0`\n2.  `∫ dη η = 1`\n\nThe user's question asks for the \"value of the measure\". This can be interpreted as asking for the fundamental normalization constant that defines the integration process. The second rule, `∫ dη η = 1`, provides this normalization. It is the cornerstone that allows for the calculation of fermionic path integrals and ensures consistency with the Pauli exclusion principle. The value of this defining integral is 1.\n\nThe following Python code will state this fundamental rule and print its value.\n\n```python\ndef grassmann_integral_normalization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the fundamental normalization rule for Grassmann variable integration,\n    which is essential for maintaining the Pauli exclusion principle in fermionic path integrals.\n\n    The Pauli principle is encoded in the property η² = 0 for any Grassmann variable η.\n    The integration over such variables is defined by the rules:\n    1. ∫ dη = 0\n    2. ∫ dη η = 1\n\n    This second rule provides the normalization for the measure 'dη'. We will print this\n    defining equation and its value.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The value of the normalized integral of a Grassmann variable is 1 by definition.\n    integral_value = 1\n    \n    # We represent the equation symbolically.\n    # integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    # measure = \"dη\"\n    # variable = \"η\"\n    \n    print(\"The fundamental normalization equation for the Grassmann integral measure is:\")\n    # The final equation is ∫ dη η = 1\n    print(f\"∫ dη η = {integral_value}\")\n\ngrassmann_integral_normalization()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
