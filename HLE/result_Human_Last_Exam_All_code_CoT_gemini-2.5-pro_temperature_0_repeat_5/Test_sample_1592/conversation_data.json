    "I will determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, by calculating the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest points of its neighboring provinces and territories (Ontario and Nunavut).\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: I will use the geographical coordinates for Waskaganish, a point on the Ontario border at James Bay, and the southernmost point of Akimiski Island in Nunavut.\n    *   Waskaganish, QC: (51.48° N, 78.76° W)\n    *   Ontario Border Point: (51.48° N, 79.53° W)\n    *   Nunavut (Akimiski Island): (52.9° N, 81.3° W)\n2.  **Calculate Distances**: I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance in kilometers between Waskaganish and the points in Ontario and Nunavut.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude**: By comparing the calculated distances, I will identify which province or territory is closer and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees) using the Haversine formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1-a))\n    # Radius of earth in kilometers.
