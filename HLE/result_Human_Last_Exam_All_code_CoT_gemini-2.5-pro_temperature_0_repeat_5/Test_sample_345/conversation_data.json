    "My plan is to first identify the key entities in your question: the painting (\"The Radionist\"), the artist (Kurt Günther), the creation year (1927), and the acquisition year (1967). I will then use this information to find the name of the museum that acquired the painting. Since this is a factual lookup, I will embed the answer directly into a Python script. The script will store these details in variables and then print a formatted string that answers your question, making sure to include the numbers 1927 and 1967 in the final output.\n\n```python\ndef find_museum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the acquisition\n    of the painting \"The Radionist\".\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_name = \"The Radionist\"\n    artist_name = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    creation_year = 1927\n    acquisition_year = 1967\n    acquiring_museum = \"Lindenau-Museum Altenburg\"\n\n    print(f\"The museum that acquired the {creation_year} tempera painting '{painting_name}' by Kurt Günther in {acquisition_year} is the {acquiring_museum}.\")\n\nfind_museum()\n```\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"
