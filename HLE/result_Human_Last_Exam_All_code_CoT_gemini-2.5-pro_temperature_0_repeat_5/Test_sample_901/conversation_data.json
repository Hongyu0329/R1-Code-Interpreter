    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Substrate, Reagent, and Reaction Type**:\n    *   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   **Reaction Type**: The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement for E2**:\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a β-proton) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in **axial** positions, oriented in opposite directions (trans-diaxial).\n\n3.  **Draw the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**:\n    *   As a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A (more stable)**: The bulky bromine and methyl groups occupy the more stable **equatorial** positions. In this conformation, the Br is equatorial. Since an axial Br is required for the E2 reaction, **no reaction can occur from this conformation**.\n    *   **Conformation B (less stable)**: Through a ring-flip, the molecule can adopt a conformation where both the bromine and methyl groups are in **axial** positions. Although this conformation is less stable and present in a smaller amount at equilibrium, it is the only one that can undergo the E2 reaction.\n\n4.  **Identify Available β-Protons in the Reactive Conformation**:\n    *   In Conformation B, the **bromine on C1 is axial**. We now look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is in the **axial** position. Therefore, the proton on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **not possible**. This would have formed the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The **axial proton at C6** is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The base (potassium tert-butoxide) can only abstract the axial proton from C6.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product**:\n    *   The elimination is forced to occur between C1 and C6, forming a double bond. This reaction is highly stereoselective.\n    *   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the E2 elimination of\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n    The reaction is stereoselective. The E2 mechanism requires a trans-diaxial\n    arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.\n\n    1. The substrate must be in its trans-diaxial conformation (Br axial, CH3 axial).\n    2. The beta-proton on C2 is equatorial (since CH3 is axial), so elimination\n       cannot occur toward C2 to form the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    3. The beta-proton on C6 has an axial proton available for elimination.\n    4. Therefore, elimination occurs toward C6 to form the Hofmann-like product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The product name contains the number '3' and the name 'methylcyclohexene'.\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the product of the reaction is: {product_name}\")\n\nidentify_product()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
