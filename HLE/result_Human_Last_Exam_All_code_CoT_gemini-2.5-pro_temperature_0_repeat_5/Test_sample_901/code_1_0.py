def identify_product():
    """
    This function identifies the product of the E2 elimination of
    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.

    The reaction is stereoselective. The E2 mechanism requires a trans-diaxial
    arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.

    1. The substrate must be in its trans-diaxial conformation (Br axial, CH3 axial).
    2. The beta-proton on C2 is equatorial (since CH3 is axial), so elimination
       cannot occur toward C2 to form the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).
    3. The beta-proton on C6 has an axial proton available for elimination.
    4. Therefore, elimination occurs toward C6 to form the Hofmann-like product.
