# The degree of the homology group.
k = 31

# According to the formula b_k = 2^(k+1) - 1, the exponent is k+1.
exponent = k + 1

# Calculate the first term of the equation, 2^32.
term1 = 2**exponent

# Calculate the final dimension.
dimension = term1 - 1

# Print the steps of the calculation as requested.
