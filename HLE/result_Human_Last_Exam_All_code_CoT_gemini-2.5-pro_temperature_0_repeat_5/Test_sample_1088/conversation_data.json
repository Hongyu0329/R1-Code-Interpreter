    "Of course. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atom. The notation `6-311G**` tells us how to calculate this number for any given atom.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   **`6-`**: The core electrons are described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a sum of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **`-311`**: The valence electrons are described by three contracted functions (a \"triple-zeta\" basis set). The first is a sum of **3** primitives, the second is **1** primitive, and the third is **1** primitive.\n    *   **`**` (double star): These are polarization functions that improve the description of chemical bonding.\n        *   The first `*` adds a set of **d-type** functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set has **6** primitive d-functions.\n        *   The second `*` adds a set of **p-type** functions to hydrogen atoms. This set has **3** primitive p-functions (px, py, pz).\n\n2.  **Calculate for Atom Types:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** It has no core electrons. Its single 1s electron is a valence electron. We apply the `-311` rule for the s-orbital and add the p-type polarization functions from the second `*`.\n    *   **Heavy Atoms (e.g., Carbon, C):** We will use Carbon as a representative for second-row heavy atoms (Li-Ne). It has a 1s core orbital and 2s/2p valence orbitals. We apply the `6-` rule to the core, the `-311` rule to the valence orbitals, and add the d-type polarization functions from the first `*`.\n\n3.  **Provide a Concrete Example:**\n    *   To provide a single numerical answer, I will calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for a simple molecule, methane (CHâ‚„), by combining the results for Carbon and Hydrogen.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print a step-by-step breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_basis_set_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G**\n    basis set for Hydrogen, a representative heavy atom (Carbon), and Methane (CH4).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom.\")\n    print(\"Let's calculate it for Hydrogen and a representative heavy atom, Carbon.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculation for Hydrogen (H) ---\n    print(\"--- For a Hydrogen (H) atom ---\")\n    # The 1s orbital is valence, described by the '311' part.\n    h_s_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n    # The second '*' adds p-polarization functions (px, py, pz).\n    h_p_pol_primitives = 3\n    h_total = h_s_primitives + h_p_pol_primitives\n    print(\"Valence 1s orbital primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5\")\n    print(\"Polarization p-function primitives = 3\")\n    print(f\"Total primitives for H = {h_s_primitives} + {h_p_pol_primitives} = {h_total}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # --- Calculation for a Heavy Atom (Carbon, C) ---\n    print(\"\\n--- For a second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon, C) ---\")\n    # The '6' describes the 1s core orbital.\n    c_core_s_primitives = 6\n    # The '311' describes the valence 2s and 2p orbitals.\n    c_valence_s_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n    # There are three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    c_valence_p_primitives = 3 * (3 + 1 + 1)\n    # The first '*' adds d-polarization functions (6 Cartesian d-functions).\n    c_d_pol_primitives = 6\n    c_total = c_core_s_primitives + c_valence_s_primitives + c_valence_p_primitives + c_d_pol_primitives\n    print(f\"Core 1s orbital primitives = {c_core_s_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2s orbital primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = {c_valence_s_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2p orbitals primitives = 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = {c_valence_p_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization d-function primitives = {c_d_pol_primitives}\")\n    print(f\"Total primitives for C = {c_core_s_primitives} + {c_valence_s_primitives} + {c_valence_p_primitives} + {c_d_pol_primitives} = {c_total}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # --- Example for Methane (CH4) ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Example: Total for Methane (CH4) ---\")\n    num_c = 1\n    num_h = 4\n    total_methane = (num_c * c_total) + (num_h * h_total)\n    print(f\"Methane has {num_c} Carbon atom and {num_h} Hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Total primitives = ({num_c} * primitives for C) + ({num_h} * primitives for H)\")\n    print(f\"Total for CH4 = ({num_c} * {c_total}) + ({num_h} * {h_total}) = {total_methane}\")\n\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_basis_set_primitives()\n```\n<<<64>>>"
