def solve_cake_cutting_bound():
    """
    This function determines and prints the most realistic upper bound for a connected
    epsilon-envy-free cake-cutting allocation for four agents.

    The problem asks for the upper bound 'O' on the query complexity. Based on the
    latest research in the field (Goldberg, Hollender, and Suksompong, 2020), the
    tightest known upper bound for finding a connected epsilon-envy-free allocation
    for four agents is O(1/epsilon^2).

    The question's request for a single number 'O' is interpreted as asking for the
    exponent in this complexity expression.
