    # Analysis of the correct option
    # A "True Avalanche" repeats a pattern of syllables. Here, we look for a repetition
    # of the syllables in "computer" (com-pu-ter).
    #
    # Let's analyze option B: Computer: "Come poo, tern!"
    # 1. Syllable Repetition: The phrase "Come poo, tern!" phonetically mirrors "com-pu-ter".
    #    - "com" sounds like "Come"
    #    - "pu" sounds like "poo"
    #    - "ter" sounds like "tern"
    #    This creates a valid avalanche structure.
    #
    # 2. Meaning: The sentence depicts a "computer" (the software) giving a command
    #    ("Come poo") to a "tern" (a type of bird). This perfectly matches the
    #    description: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
    #
    # Other options fail because they either don't repeat the syllables correctly (C, E)
    # or their meaning doesn't fit the description (A, D).
