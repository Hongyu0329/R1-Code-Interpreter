    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses
    in two different scenarios and finding the difference.

    # Number of individuals
    n = 9

    # Each hat has two independent properties:
    # 1. Black or Yellow (2 options)
    # 2. Blue or White (2 options)
    # Total number of unique hat types (k) is 2 * 2 = 4.
    k = 4

    # --- Scenario 1: Simultaneous Guessing (Finding N) ---
    # In this scenario, no information can be exchanged during the guessing phase.
    # The optimal strategy involves the group agreeing on a mathematical rule beforehand.
    # Let's represent the 4 hat types by numbers {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    # A common strategy is for each person 'i' (indexed 1 to 9) to guess their hat
    # color such that the sum of all 9 hat numbers (including their own guess)
    # plus their own index 'i' results in 0 when divided by k.
    # Person 'i' is correct if and only if the actual sum of all hats (S) satisfies (S + i) % k == 0.
    # For any given distribution of hats, S is fixed. The number of correct people is the
    # number of indices 'i' (from 1 to 9) that satisfy the condition.
    # The worst-case (guaranteed) number of correct guesses is the minimum number of
    # people who would be correct, regardless of the hat distribution. This corresponds
    # to the size of the smallest possible group of people who satisfy the condition,
    # which is floor(n / k).
    N = n // k

    # --- Scenario 2: One Person Guesses First (Finding M) ---
    # In this scenario, the first person (P1) can convey information to the others.
    # P1 sees the hats of the other 8 people. P1 can calculate the sum of the hat
    # values of these 8 people, let's call it S_others.
    # P1's strategy is to announce a guess that equals S_others % k.
    # This guess sacrifices P1's own chance of being correct (it's a 1 in k chance),
    # but it provides crucial information to the other 8 people.
    # Each of the other 8 people hears P1's guess (which is S_others % k).
    # They can also see the hats of the other 7 people in their group.
    # By subtracting the sum of the 7 hats they see from S_others, they can
    # perfectly deduce their own hat color.
    # This means all 8 people other than P1 are guaranteed to be correct.
    M = n - 1

    # --- Final Calculation (M - N) ---
    # The difference represents how many more people will definitely guess correctly.
    difference = M - N
