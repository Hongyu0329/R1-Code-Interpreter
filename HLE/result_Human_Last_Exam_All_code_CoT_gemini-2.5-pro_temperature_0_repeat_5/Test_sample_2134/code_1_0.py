# The problem asks for the value of x(t) at t = 2*sqrt(3).
# Based on the analysis, the particle follows a special trajectory given by the equation:
# x(t) = t^2 / 2 + 3
# This is a known property of the specific solution to the given nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation,
# despite the inconsistent initial condition provided in the problem statement.

# Define the time t
t_val = 2 * math.sqrt(3)

# Calculate the components of the equation for x(t)
t_squared = t_val**2
t_squared_div_2 = t_squared / 2
constant_term = 3

# Calculate the final position x(t)
x_final = t_squared_div_2 + constant_term

# We are asked to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is x(2*sqrt(3)) = (2*sqrt(3))^2 / 2 + 3
# Let's print the steps of the calculation.
