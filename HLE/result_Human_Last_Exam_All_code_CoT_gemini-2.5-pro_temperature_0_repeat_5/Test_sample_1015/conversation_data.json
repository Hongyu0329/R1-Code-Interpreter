    "My plan is to first explain the key technical differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. The primary distinction lies in the alignment of the hips and the resulting aesthetic line. I will detail how the Vaganova method emphasizes a stable, square pelvis, while the Balanchine method allows for a more dynamic use of the hip to achieve a deeper backbend. Based on this explanation, I will select the most accurate answer from the provided choices.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to print this explanation and the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef explain_cambre_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nIn a cambré derrière (a bend backwards), the core difference between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and alignment of the hips.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method emphasizes strict academic correctness and stability. During a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep their hips perfectly square and level. The bend originates from the upper back (the thoracic spine), and the pelvis acts as a stable base. This creates a pure, controlled arc of the upper body.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** This neoclassical style prioritizes speed, dynamism, and a more extreme aesthetic. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is often encouraged to lift the hip of the working leg. This \"breaks\" the square alignment of the pelvis, which in turn allows for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend. This technique creates a visually striking, sweeping line but sacrifices the classical stability emphasized by Vaganova.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and defining difference is the placement of the hip.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"The correct answer is B: Placement of hip.\")\n\nexplain_cambre_difference()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
