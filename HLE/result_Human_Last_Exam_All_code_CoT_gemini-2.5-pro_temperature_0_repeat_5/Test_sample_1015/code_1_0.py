    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.

    explanation = """
In a cambré derrière (a bend backwards), the core difference between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and alignment of the hips.

1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method emphasizes strict academic correctness and stability. During a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep their hips perfectly square and level. The bend originates from the upper back (the thoracic spine), and the pelvis acts as a stable base. This creates a pure, controlled arc of the upper body.

2.  **Balanchine Method:** This neoclassical style prioritizes speed, dynamism, and a more extreme aesthetic. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is often encouraged to lift the hip of the working leg. This "breaks" the square alignment of the pelvis, which in turn allows for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend. This technique creates a visually striking, sweeping line but sacrifices the classical stability emphasized by Vaganova.

Therefore, the most fundamental and defining difference is the placement of the hip.
