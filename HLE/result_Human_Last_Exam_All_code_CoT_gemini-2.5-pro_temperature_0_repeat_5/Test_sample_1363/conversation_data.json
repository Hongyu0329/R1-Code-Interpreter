    "Of the choices provided, the European Tango is unique. Its technique is fundamentally different from the four \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the core technique of the \"swing\" dances:** The English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all swing dances. They are characterized by momentum, body swing, and rise & fall (except for Foxtrot's \"no foot rise\" on certain steps). In these dances, a Reverse Turn can be overturned (turned more than the textbook amount) by using more body swing and momentum. While this might be a technical deviation, it is a common adjustment for floorcraft and does not violate the fundamental physics of how movement is generated in these dances.\n2.  **Analyze the core technique of the European Tango:** Tango has no body swing and no rise & fall. It is a \"staccato\" dance where movement is sharp and clipped. Turns, including the Reverse Turn, are executed with precise foot swivels and placements, not by swinging the body.\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** To overturn a Reverse Turn in Tango would require introducing swing or a pivot, which fundamentally contradicts the core technical principles of the dance. It would change the character of the figure entirely. Therefore, it is in the European Tango that overturning a Reverse Turn is impossible without disregarding the essential technique.\n\nI will now write a Python script to model this logic by assigning a \"technical violation score\" to each dance, where the highest score represents the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technical constraints of a Reverse Turn\n    in various ballroom dances to determine where overturning the figure\n    is impossible without violating the core technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dances listed in the multiple-choice question.\n    dances = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # We can model this problem by assigning a \"technical violation score\"\n    # for overturning a Reverse Turn. A higher score indicates a more\n    # fundamental break from the dance's technique.\n    # In swing dances, overturning is a modification. In Tango, it's a violation.\n    violation_scores = {\n        'Viennese Waltz': 4,\n        'English Waltz': 5,\n        'European Tango': 10,  # A score of 10 represents \"impossible without disregarding technique\"\n        'Slow Foxtrott': 6,\n        'Quickstep': 5\n    }\n\n    # The \"equation\" is to find the maximum violation score among the dances.\n    # max_violation_score = max(violation_scores.values())\n    correct_dance_name = max(violation_scores, key=violation_scores.get)\n\n    correct_option = ''\n    for option, name in dances.items():\n        if name == correct_dance_name:\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    print(\"This script models the technical difficulty of overturning a Reverse Turn in different dances.\")\n    print(\"A higher score means it's more against the core technique.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe 'Equation' to solve is finding the maximum score in the following set:\")\n    print(f\"Violation Score({dances['A']}) = {violation_scores[dances['A']]}\")\n    print(f\"Violation Score({dances['B']}) = {violation_scores[dances['B']]}\")\n    print(f\"Violation Score({dances['C']}) = {violation_scores[dances['C']]}\")\n    print(f\"Violation Score({dances['D']}) = {violation_scores[dances['D']]}\")\n    print(f\"Violation Score({dances['E']}) = {violation_scores[dances['E']]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The dance with the highest violation score is '{correct_dance_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_option}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_technique_question()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
