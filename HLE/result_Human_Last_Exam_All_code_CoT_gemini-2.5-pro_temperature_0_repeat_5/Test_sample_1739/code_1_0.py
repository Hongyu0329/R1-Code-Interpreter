def calculate_nonlinear_frequency_correction_term():
    """
    This function calculates the third term of the nonlinear frequency correction
    for the Rayleigh-Plesset equation based on a derived formula.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the polytropic index 'gamma' as a symbolic variable.
    2. Use the derived formula for the normalized nonlinear frequency correction
       coefficient, C2. This coefficient is a result of a second-order
       perturbation analysis (e.g., using multiple scales).
       The formula is: C2 = -(6*gamma**2 - 3*gamma - 2) / 16.
    3. The full nonlinear frequency correction is delta_omega = omega_0 * C2 * a^2,
       where omega_0 is the linear frequency and 'a' is the oscillation amplitude.
    4. Expand C2 into a polynomial in 'gamma' to identify its constituent terms.
       The expanded form is C2 = (-3/8)*gamma**2 + (3/16)*gamma + (1/8).
    5. The problem asks for the "3rd term", which we interpret as the third term
       in this polynomial expansion (the constant term).
    6. Extract this term and print the numbers in the resulting fraction.
