def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T1|, |T2|].
    
    The problem defines two trees, T1 and T2, with the following properties:
    - Height: omega_2 (meaning levels are indexed by ordinals alpha < omega_2)
    - Level Cardinality: |Lev_alpha(T_i)| = aleph_0 for all alpha < omega_2.
    
    The notation |T_i| refers to the cardinality of the tree T_i, which is the
    cardinality of its set of nodes. The cardinality of a tree is the sum of the
    cardinalities of its levels.
    
    The information about the number of branches is used to characterize the trees
    T1 and T2, but it does not change the cardinality of the trees themselves.
