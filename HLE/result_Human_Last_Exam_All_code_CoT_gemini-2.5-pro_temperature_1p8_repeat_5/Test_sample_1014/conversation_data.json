    "My plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 is to use a method called trial division. I will write a Python script that systematically attempts to divide the number by potential prime factors.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `N = 8139881`.\n2.  I'll keep a list of prime factors found.\n3.  First, I'll check for the smallest prime factor, 2. I'll repeatedly divide `N` by 2 until it's no longer evenly divisible, adding 2 to my list of factors each time.\n4.  Next, I'll move to odd numbers, starting with `d = 3`. I'll iterate upwards (`d = 3, 5, 7, ...`) as long as `d*d` is not greater than the current value of `N`.\n5.  For each `d`, I will repeatedly divide `N` by `d` as long as it's a factor, adding `d` to the list of factors each time. This process reduces `N` at each step, making subsequent checks faster.\n6.  After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `N` is greater than 1, this remaining value must be a prime number itself, and it is the last prime factor. I'll add it to the list.\n7.  Finally, I'll print the complete prime factorization in the form of an equation and then identify and print the largest number from my list of prime factors. If the number is prime, the list will contain only the number itself.\n\nThis approach is efficient and guarantees that we find all prime factors and, consequently, the largest one.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of a number, prints the factorization equation,\n    and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        print(f\"{n} does not have prime divisors.\")\n        return\n\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n        i = i + 2\n\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2 at the end\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the results\n    if len(factors) == 1:\n        print(f\"{original_n} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = original_n\n    else:\n        # Construct the equation string\n        equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_n} is: {original_n} = {equation_str}\")\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    return largest_prime\n\n# The number given in the problem\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
