    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will create a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish the known dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans based on entomological knowledge. They are known to be predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods and also to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n2.  I will represent the answer choices provided by the user.\n3.  The script will then evaluate each choice against the known facts. It will check if snakeflies are predatory (for aphids), if they consume nectar, and if they are herbivorous (leaf-eaters) or fungivorous.\n4.  By identifying which individual food sources are correct, the script will then evaluate the composite options (like F and G) to find the most comprehensive and accurate answer.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the step-by-step evaluation and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidiopteran_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts for adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Fact 1: They consume nectar/pollen.\n    # Fact 2: They are predators of small, soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n    # Fact 3: They are not herbivores (do not eat leaf tissue).\n    # Fact 4: They are not primarily fungivores.\n    known_diet = {\n        'Nectar': True,\n        'Aphids': True,\n        'Leaf tissue': False,\n        'Fungus': False,\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define what each answer choice represents.\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen', # A type of pollen\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue', # A type of leaf tissue\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids', # A type of aphid\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Evaluating potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate primary food types from the choices.\n    eats_nectar = known_diet['Nectar']\n    print(f\"Is Nectar (related to Option A) a known food source? {eats_nectar}\")\n    \n    eats_aphids = known_diet['Aphids']\n    print(f\"Are Aphids (related to Option E) a known food source? {eats_aphids}\")\n\n    eats_leaf_tissue = known_diet['Leaf tissue']\n    print(f\"Is Leaf Tissue (related to Option D) a known food source? {eats_leaf_tissue}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Combine the findings to evaluate the composite options.\n    # Option F is A (Nectar) AND E (Aphids).\n    # Option G is D (Leaf tissue) AND E (Aphids).\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Analyzing combined options:\")\n    \n    # Equation for Option F: Is (A is True) AND (E is True)?\n    option_f_valid = eats_nectar and eats_aphids\n    print(f\"Evaluation for Option F (A and E):\")\n    print(f\"   Eats Nectar ({eats_nectar}) + Eats Aphids ({eats_aphids}) => Is F valid? {option_f_valid}\")\n\n    # Equation for Option G: Is (D is True) AND (E is True)?\n    option_g_valid = eats_leaf_tissue and eats_aphids\n    print(f\"Evaluation for Option G (D and E):\")\n    print(f\"   Eats Leaf Tissue ({eats_leaf_tissue}) + Eats Aphids ({eats_aphids}) => Is G valid? {option_g_valid}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Conclusion: Both Nectar and Aphids are consumed by adult Raphidiopterans.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the most complete answer is the option that includes both.\")\n\nsolve_raphidiopteran_diet()\n<<<F>>>"
