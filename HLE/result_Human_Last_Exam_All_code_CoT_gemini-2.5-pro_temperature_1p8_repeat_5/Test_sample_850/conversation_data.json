    "The user's question contains a fundamental contradiction based on the principles of crystallography and optics. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal, the necessary and sufficient condition for optical activity is that its point group symmetry must be **chiral**.\n    *   **Chiral:** A crystal class is chiral if its structure cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. This means it must lack all rotoinversion symmetry elements, which include mirror planes (m) and a center of inversion (ī).\n    *   **Achiral:** The opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class *must* possess at least one rotoinversion symmetry element (like a mirror plane or inversion center).\n    *   **Non-Polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique directional axis that leads to properties like pyroelectricity. All centrosymmetric (having a center of inversion) classes are non-polar. Several non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar.\n\n2.  **Identify the Contradiction:**\n    *   The request asks for crystal classes that are **achiral**.\n    *   It also asks for classes that have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**, which means they must be **chiral**.\n    *   By definition, a crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral simultaneously. They are mutually exclusive categories.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Because of this direct contradiction, no crystal class can satisfy all the requested conditions. The set of such classes is empty.\n\n4.  **Demonstration:**\n    *   I will provide a Python script that defines the sets of all 32 crystal classes based on their properties (chiral, achiral, non-polar).\n    *   The script will then attempt to find the intersection of the \"achiral\", \"non-polar\", and \"optically active\" (i.e., chiral) sets.\n    *   The script's output will show that this intersection is empty and will explain why, printing the final count of matching classes, which is 0.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystallographic point groups to find those that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity, explaining the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral classes are the ones that exhibit optical activity.\n    # They lack any rotoinversion axes (including mirror planes and inversion centers).\n    optically_active_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # The 21 achiral classes are all other point groups.\n    # They MUST contain at least one rotoinversion axis.\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n    achiral_classes = all_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # The 22 non-polar classes.
