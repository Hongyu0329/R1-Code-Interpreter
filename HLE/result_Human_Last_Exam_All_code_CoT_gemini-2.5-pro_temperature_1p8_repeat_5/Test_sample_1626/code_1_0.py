    In the context of toroidal grid generation, this function identifies the
    mathematical function that governs grid spacing to ensure resolution consistency.

    The hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) is commonly used for this purpose.
    Its sigmoidal shape allows for the smooth clustering of grid points near
    boundaries (like the plasma edge and magnetic axis in a tokamak),
    which is crucial for accurately resolving physical phenomena in those regions.
    While trigonometric functions define the geometry, tanh controls the
    local grid density or spacing along a coordinate axis (e.g., the radial direction).
