    # The problem states there is a correlated distribution of:
    # 1. Synonymous substitution rates (dS)
    # 2. Nonsynonymous substitution rates (dN)
    # 3. Intron lengths

    # The question is: What most challenges predictive models of genetic drift?

    # Step 1: Understand the basis of genetic drift models.
    # Genetic drift is the change in allele frequencies due to random chance.
    # Predictive models of drift often use the synonymous substitution rate (dS)
    # as a proxy for the neutral mutation rate, assuming it is not under selection.
    print("Analyzing the challenge to genetic drift models...")
    print("="*40)
    print("Premise: Models of genetic drift often assume a baseline neutral mutation rate to distinguish random effects from selection.")
    
    # Step 2: Identify the core conflict.
    # A correlation between the synonymous rate (dS, the 'neutral' proxy) and the
    # nonsynonymous rate (dN, the 'selected' measure) undermines the core assumption.
    # It suggests that the mutation rate itself is not uniform and may be linked to
    # factors that also influence selection. This makes it hard to isolate and predict
    # the effects of drift alone.
    print("\nConflict: The prompt states that synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) rates are correlated.")
    print("This correlation directly challenges the assumption that dS represents a simple, neutral background rate.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options.
    # Option B, "The correlation between synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates independent of intron length,"
    # directly addresses this fundamental conflict. The other options describe other valid but less central
    # issues related to genome architecture. The correlation between dS and dN is the most direct challenge
    # to the methodology of separating drift from selection.
    print("\nConclusion: The correlation between substitution rates is the most fundamental challenge listed.")
    print("This points to a complex interplay of mutation bias and selection that simple drift models struggle to accommodate.")

    # The final answer is therefore B.
