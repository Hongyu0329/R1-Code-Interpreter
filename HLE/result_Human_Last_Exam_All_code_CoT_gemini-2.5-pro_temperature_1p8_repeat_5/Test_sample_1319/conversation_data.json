    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's Iliad is Mount Athos.\n\nHere is a Python script that determines this. My plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a dictionary of the key historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus, and their respective elevations in meters.\n2.  Use Python's `max()` function with a lambda key to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n3.  Sort the mountains by elevation in descending order to provide a clear comparison for the user.\n4.  Print the name of the tallest mountain and its height.\n5.  Print the full comparison of all the mountains listed, showing the \"equation\" as requested.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_tallest_iliad_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad,\n    excluding Mount Olympus, and prints the result and comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus) and their elevations in meters\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace (Greece)\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos (Greece)\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion (Greece)\": 1624\n    }\n\n    # Find the tallest mountain\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    print(f\"After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name} at {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a comparison of the mountain elevations:\")\n\n    # Sort the mountains by height in descending order for the comparison \"equation\"\n    sorted_mountains = sorted(mountains.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n    \n    # Build and print the comparison string, showing each name and number\n    comparison_equation = []\n    for name, height in sorted_mountains:\n        comparison_equation.append(f\"{name} ({height}m)\")\n\n    print(\" > \".join(comparison_equation))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_iliad_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
