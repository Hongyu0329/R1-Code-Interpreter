    Analyzes the options for implementing an online book selling system's domain model.

    A. Describe all the order processing logic in the Controller.
    This is inappropriate. It leads to a "Fat Controller" and an "Anemic Domain Model", where domain objects are just data containers. Business logic should be in the domain layer.

    B. Put all the order processing logic in the Order class.
    This is inappropriate. It creates a "God Object" that violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Logic like discount calculation belongs to the Customer, and inventory checking belongs to the Book/Inventory.

    C. Put the discount rate calculation logic in the Customer class, the inventory check logic in the Book class, and the order confirmation logic in the Order class.
    This is a proper implementation of a "Rich Domain Model", where logic is encapsulated with the data it operates on.

    D. Describe the order processing logic in a domain service such as OrderService.
    This is inappropriate. If it means *all* logic is in the service, it results in an "Anemic Domain Model" where the service becomes a procedural script and domain objects are just data bags.

    E. Order processing logic is divided and described in the Order class and domain services such as OrderService.
    This is a proper implementation. It uses a balanced approach where entities contain their own intrinsic logic, and services coordinate operations across multiple entities.

    The inappropriate options are A, B, and D.
