    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the physical system in question: the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. These equations describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.\n2.  Next, I will determine the symmetry group of these equations. A symmetry of a system of differential equations is a transformation of the independent and dependent variables that leaves the equations' form unchanged. These symmetries form a Lie group.\n3.  The dimension of this Lie group is what we need to find. This dimension is equal to the number of independent infinitesimal generators that constitute the basis of the corresponding Lie algebra.\n4.  I will list each type of symmetry transformation and count the number of generators associated with it. The standard analysis (assuming no external forces) reveals the following transformations:\n    *   Time translation (shifting the time origin).\n    *   Spatial translations (shifting the spatial origin).\n    *   Spatial rotations (rotating the coordinate system).\n    *   Galilean boosts (switching to a constantly moving reference frame).\n    *   Scaling or dilation transformations.\n    *   Shifts in the pressure field.\n5.  It's important to note that the full symmetry group contains an infinite-dimensional part due to the pressure being defined only up to a gradient, allowing for an arbitrary function of time to be added. However, the standard question about the \"dimension\" refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* subalgebra. This is obtained by restricting the arbitrary pressure function to be a constant.\n6.  Finally, I will sum up the number of generators for each of these finite-dimensional transformations to get the total dimension. I will present this calculation in a Python script that clearly explains each component of the sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\")\n    print(\"is the number of independent transformations that leave the equations invariant.\")\n    print(\"This refers to the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group.\\n\")\n    print(\"We can find this dimension by summing the number of generators for each type of symmetry:\\n\")\n\n    # Number of generators for each symmetry type\n    time_translation = 1\n    spatial_translations = 3\n    spatial_rotations = 3\n    galilean_boosts = 3\n    scaling_transformation = 1\n    pressure_shift = 1\n\n    print(f\"1.
