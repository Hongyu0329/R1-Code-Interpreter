    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe user has asked a movie trivia question but requested the answer be delivered via a code script.\n1.  I will first identify the film and the specific scene based on the details provided: an Oscar-nominated film where a character says \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which seals their fate.\n2.  The film is 'Carlito's Way' (1993), for which Sean Penn was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. The character is Lalin (played by Viggo Mortensen), who reveals to the protagonist, Carlito, that he's wearing a wire.\n3.  I will then write a simple Python script that uses the `print()` function to state this answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's movie trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Carlito's Way\"\n    scene_description = (\n        \"In the Oscar-nominated film '{title}', the character Lalin reveals he is a \"\n        \"government informant by saying 'Thank you' into his hidden microphone as he \"\n        \"boards a bus. This act seals his fate in the eyes of the protagonist, Carlito Brigante.\"\n    ).format(title=movie_title)\n    \n    print(scene_description)\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<'Carlito's Way'>>>"
