        "4. The final acute illness presented as a multi-system infection involving the lungs (pneumonia), skin (cutaneous lesions), and central nervous system (confusion).",
        "5. The prescribed Aminoglycoside therapy proved ineffective. This is a critical clue, as this class of antibiotics is not effective against certain organisms, such as the filamentous bacteria Nocardia.",
        "6. Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection that classically affects immunocompromised hosts. It typically causes the exact triad of symptoms seen in the patient (pulmonary, cutaneous, and CNS).",
        "Conclusion: While the patient's underlying disease was likely lung cancer, the direct cause of his death was a superimposed infection. The specific constellation of symptoms and the failure of aminoglycoside treatment make Disseminated Nocardiosis the most precise diagnosis for the terminal illness."
