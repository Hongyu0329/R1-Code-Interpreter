    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The given integral is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx. This is a standard integral form. If we let u = F₃(x), then du = F₃'(x) dx. The integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du, whose antiderivative is ln|u|. Therefore, the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is given by `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This results in the expression `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Evaluate F₃(1) and F₃(0):** We need to calculate the values of F₃(x) at the bounds of the integration.\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   At x = 1: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   At x = 0: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Check the Sign of F₃(x):** For x in the interval [0, 1], `sin(x)` is non-negative. This means `e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 1. Consequently, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 2, and `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive. We can therefore drop the absolute value signs.\n5.  **Calculate the Value (V):** The value of the integral is V = `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n6.  **Numerical Computation:** A Python script will be used to compute the numerical value of V, then calculate `10000 * V`, and finally round the result to the nearest integer as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the function F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\ndef F3(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of F3(x).\"\"\"\n    return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# Evaluate F3 at the bounds of the integral\nF3_at_1 = F3(1)\nF3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 equals ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n# Calculate the final value to report\nvalue_to_report = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(value_to_report)\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed numbers\nprint(f\"The integral evaluates to the expression: ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(1) is: {F3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(0) is: {F3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"So, the value of the integral V is: ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"We need to find the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = {value_to_report}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n<<<5490>>>\n```"
