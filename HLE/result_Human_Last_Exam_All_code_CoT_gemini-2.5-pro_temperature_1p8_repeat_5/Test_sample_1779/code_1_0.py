# We will run the decider on a few example strings.

# Example 1: A string with length 9 (a perfect square)
decider_for_L("python_is_fun") # Length is 13... oops, let's fix that.
decider_for_L("123456789")

# Example 2: A string with length 12 (not a perfect square)
decider_for_L("hello world!")

# Example 3: An empty string with length 0 (a perfect square, 0*0=0)
decider_for_L("")

# Example 4: A string with length 1 (a perfect square, 1*1=1)
