# Based on the mathematical derivation, the first term of the expression simplifies to 1.
# The expression is: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# We found ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# Substituting this into the expression:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# which simplifies to 1 + 10^15.

# The first number in the final equation
term1 = 1

# The second number in the final equation
term2 = 10**15

# The final result is the sum of these two numbers.
result = term1 + term2

# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
print(f"{term1} + {term2} = {result}")
