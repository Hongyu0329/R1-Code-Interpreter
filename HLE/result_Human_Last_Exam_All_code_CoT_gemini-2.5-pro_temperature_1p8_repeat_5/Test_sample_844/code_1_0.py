    print("Logic: The text states CA 'did well on' the raffinose-rich diet and MA 'did well on' the sucrose-rich diet. This supports the idea of preference/adaptation. Conclusion: TRUE.")

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("\nStatement C: " + statements["C"])
    print("Logic: CA moves from high-raffinose (watermelon) to low-raffinose (cotton). Enzyme activity (galactosidase) typically decreases when its substrate (raffinose) is removed. Conclusion: TRUE.")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("\nStatement D: " + statements["D"])
    print("Logic: CA moves to cotton (sucrose/glucose-rich). High glucose can cause catabolite repression, which also decreases galactosidase activity. This is a plausible biological mechanism. Conclusion: PLAUSIBLE/LIKELY TRUE.")
    
    # Statement E Analysis
    print("\nStatement E: " + statements["E"])
    print("Logic: MA is not adapted to raffinose. It is unlikely to possess the ability to efficiently increase galactosidase activity when moved to a raffinose-rich environment. The premise indicates a specialization that makes this sudden adaptation improbable. Conclusion: NOT TRUE.")
