    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, correct for spectral overlap, and accurately define the populations to be sorted. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Unstained Control:** This is the baseline control for autofluorescence.\n2.  **Identify Compensation Controls:** These are necessary to correct for spectral overlap between the five different fluorophores. There must be one for each channel.\n3.  **Identify Gating Controls (FMOs):** For a multi-color sorting experiment, Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls are essential for setting accurate sort gates. There will be one for each channel being gated.\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** Sum the number of controls from each category to get the final count.\n\nThe Python script below will detail each control type, calculate the total number, and display the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-channel\n    flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # --- 1. Unstained Control ---\n    # This is the fundamental baseline control.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    print(\"--- Essential Controls Breakdown ---\\n\")\n    print(f\"1.

Single-Stain Compensation Controls ---\n    # A single-stain control is required for each fluorophore in the panel.\n    compensation_controls = num_channels\n    print(f\"2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {compensation_controls}\")\n    print(f\"   - One sample for each of the {num_channels} fluorophores used ({', '.join(fluorophores)}).\")\n    print(\"   - Purpose: To allow the flow cytometer software to calculate and correct for spectral overlap (spillover) where one dye's signal is detected in another's channel.\\n\")\n\n    # --- 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls ---\n    # FMO controls are critical for accurate gating, especially for sorting applications.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n    print(f\"3.
