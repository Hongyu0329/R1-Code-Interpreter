    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its primary amino acid sequence in the context of the heptad repeat, which is a repeating pattern of seven amino acids labeled `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions, which form the core of the structure through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat Register:** We will analyze the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to find the most likely `abcdefg` pattern. The correct register is the one that consistently places hydrophobic amino acids (like L, I, A, V, W) at the `a` and `d` core positions.\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** Once the register is identified, we will list the amino acids found at all `a` positions and all `d` positions.\n3.  **Apply Packing Principles:** The specific combination of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the most efficient packing arrangement and, therefore, the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices):** Often have smaller residues at `a` (like Ala) and larger ones at `d` (like Leu), or a combination of Leu, Ile, and Val.\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices):** Typically require bulkier residues (like Ile or Leu) at the `a` position to fill the larger hydrophobic core efficiently.\n    *   **Tetramers (4 helices):** Have their own preferred packing, often `a=L` and `d=I`.\n4.  **Determine Oligomeric State:** Based on the identified core residues and these packing rules, we will deduce the most probable oligomeric state.\n\nThe following Python code will automate this analysis and provide the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a protein sequence to determine its likely coiled-coil oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Find the best heptad repeat register\n    hydrophobic_residues = ['A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W']\n    best_register = -1\n    max_score = -1\n    register_data = {}\n\n    for start_index in range(7):\n        a_pos_residues = []\n        d_pos_residues = []\n        current_score = 0\n        \n        # 'a' positions are at index i where (i - start_index) % 7 == 0\n        # 'd' positions are at index i where (i - start_index) % 7 == 3\n        \n        for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n            if (i - start_index) % 7 == 0:\n                a_pos_residues.append(residue)\n                if residue in hydrophobic_residues:\n                    current_score += 1\n            elif (i - start_index) % 7 == 3:\n                d_pos_residues.append(residue)\n                if residue in hydrophobic_residues:\n                    current_score += 1\n\n        register_data[start_index] = {\n            'score': current_score,\n            'a': a_pos_residues,\n            'd': d_pos_residues\n        }\n        \n        if current_score > max_score:\n            max_score = current_score\n            best_register = start_index\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1 & 2: Identify Register and Extract Core Residues ---\")\n    print(f\"The most likely heptad repeat starts at position {best_register + 1} of the sequence.\")\n    \n    a_residues = register_data[best_register]['a']\n    d_residues = register_data[best_register]['d']\n    \n    print(f\"Residues at the 'a' positions: {a_residues}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at the 'd' positions: {d_residues}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Apply Packing Principles and Conclude\n    print(\"--- Step 3 & 4: Apply Packing Principles to Determine Oligomeric State ---\")\n    \n    a_counts = collections.Counter(a_residues)\n    d_counts = collections.Counter(d_residues)\n\n    # Simplified rule-based deduction for common patterns\n    conclusion = \"\"\n    oligomeric_state = \"Unknown\"\n\n    # Check for the pattern a=Ala, d=Leu\n    is_a_Ala = all(res == 'A' for res in a_residues)\n    is_d_Leu = all(res == 'L' for res in d_residues)\n\n    if is_a_Ala and is_d_Leu:\n        oligomeric_state = 2\n        conclusion = (\n            \"The hydrophobic core is composed of Alanine (A) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions.\\n\"\n            \"This 'a=A, d=L' pattern is a classic hallmark of a dimeric coiled-coil.\\n\"\n            \"Reasoning (Knobs-into-Holes): The small side chain of Alanine at the 'a' position ('knob') packs efficiently into the 'hole' of a two-helix bundle (dimer).\\n\"\n            \"In a trimer or tetramer, the central core would be too large, and the small Alanine side chains would lead to poor, unstable packing.\"\n        )\n    else:\n        conclusion = \"The residue pattern does not match a simple, canonical coiled-coil rule.
