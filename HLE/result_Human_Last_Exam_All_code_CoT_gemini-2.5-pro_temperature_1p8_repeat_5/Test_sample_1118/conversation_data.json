    "My plan is to first research the specific self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933, focusing on the period after his arrest and escape from the Gestapo. I will identify the object he depicted himself holding and its historical significance as a political symbol at that time. Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this answer in a variable and then prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence to fulfill the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef solve_art_history_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the question about\n    Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In 1933, after being arrested by the Gestapo, German painter Curt Querner\n    # of the New Objectivity movement painted \"Selbstbildnis mit roter Nelke\"\n    # (Self-Portrait with a Red Carnation).\n    symbol_of_resistance = \"a red carnation\"\n\n    # The red carnation was a symbol of the social democratic and labor movements,\n    # which were in opposition to the Nazi Party. Holding it was an act of defiance.\n    print(\"In the 1933 self-portrait painted after his escape from the Gestapo, the object Curt Querner holds as a symbol of resistance is:\")\n    print(symbol_of_resistance)\n\nsolve_art_history_question()\n```\n<<<a red carnation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
