    "Answering this question requires methods from category theory and combinatorics. I will break down the problem by enumerating all possible structures a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms can have, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify Objects and Morphisms:** Let the two objects be $A$ and $B$. Any category must have identity morphisms for each object. So, two of the four morphisms must be $id_A$ and $id_B$. This leaves 2 additional morphisms to distribute.\n\n2.  **Distribute Morphisms:** The morphisms can be endomorphisms (starting and ending at the same object) or morphisms between $A$ and $B$. Let $n_{XY}$ be the number of morphisms from object $X$ to object $Y$. The four sets of morphisms are $Hom(A, A)$, $Hom(A, B)$, $Hom(B, A)$, and $Hom(B, B)$. We know $n_{AA} \\ge 1$ and $n_{BB} \\ge 1$ (for the identities). The total number of morphisms is 4:\n    $n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$.\n    We need to find all non-negative integer solutions to this equation, subject to the constraints. These solutions represent different distributions of morphisms.\n\n3.  **Group by Isomorphism:** Two categories are isomorphic if there is a bijective functor between them. Swapping the object labels ($A \\leftrightarrow B$) is one such isomorphism. This maps a distribution $(n_{AA}, n_{BB}, n_{AB}, n_{BA})$ to $(n_{BB}, n_{AA}, n_{BA}, n_{AB})$. We will group distributions that are equivalent under this swap.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Case:** For each unique distribution, we will determine the number of non-isomorphic categories. This involves defining the composition rules for the morphisms. The structure of the category is determined by the composition table, which must satisfy associativity and the identity laws.\n    *   For disconnected components (e.g., $n_{AB}=0$ and $n_{BA}=0$), the category is a disjoint union of two smaller categories, each with one object. A one-object category is equivalent to a monoid. So, we'll need to count the number of non-isomorphic monoids of a given size.\n    *   For connected components, we must also define how morphisms compose across different objects and check for associativity.\n\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each non-isomorphic distribution case.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this step-by-step analysis and calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Problem setup\")\n    print(\"Let the two objects be A and B.\")\n    print(\"Total morphisms = 4.
