# The degree of the homology group
degree = 31

# Based on the identification of the group G with Thompson's group F,
# and the known and conjectured pattern of its Betti numbers, the dimension
# of the homology group for an odd degree k >= 3 is 1.
dimension = 1

# Print the final result in a sentence as an equation.
# This fulfills the requirement to output each number in the final equation.
