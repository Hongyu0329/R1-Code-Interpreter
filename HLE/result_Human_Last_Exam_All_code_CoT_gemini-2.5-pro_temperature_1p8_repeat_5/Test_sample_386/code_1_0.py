# The correct procedure involves preparing a culture medium with specific supplements.
# The key numerical values from the correct option are the percentages of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and antibiotics.

fbs_percentage = 10
antibiotic_percentage = 1

# Calculate the total percentage of these key supplements in the medium.
total_supplement_percentage = fbs_percentage + antibiotic_percentage

# Display the components and the final equation.
