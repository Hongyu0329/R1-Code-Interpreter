    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a knowledge-based task that requires locating specific information within a well-known Islamic poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the verses of the poem that are dedicated to listing the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\n2.  The section begins immediately after the introductory verse that mentions the number of prophets (twenty-five).\n3.  The first prophet mentioned is Adam (آدَمٌ), which will mark the starting *bayt* (verse).\n4.  The last prophet mentioned is Muhammad (referred to as طه - Taha), which will mark the ending *bayt*.\n5.  I will write a Python script that stores these specific verses and programmatically identifies the start and end numbers.\n6.  The script will then print the starting bayt number and the ending bayt number as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses_in_aqeedah():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the range of verses (bayts) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping the bayt number to the verse text (in Arabic).\n    # We only need the relevant section of the poem.\n    poem_verses = {\n        15: \"تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ... كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\",\n        16: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n        17: \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ... يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n        18: \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ... ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n        19: \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُsُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n        20: \"عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ... وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\"\n    }\n\n    start_bayt = 0\n    end_bayt = 0\n    \n    # The first prophet's name mentioned is \"Adam\" (آدَمٌ).\n    # The last prophet's name mentioned is \"Taha\" (طه), a name for Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.\n    first_prophet_name = \"آدَمٌ\"\n    last_prophet_name = \"طَهَ\"\n\n    # Find the starting and ending bayt numbers\n    for bayt_number, verse_text in poem_verses.items():\n        if first_prophet_name in verse_text:\n            start_bayt = bayt_number\n        if last_prophet_name in verse_text:\n            end_bayt = bayt_number\n\n    if start_bayt and end_bayt:\n        print(\"The names of the prophets in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from one bayt to another.\")\n        print(\"\\nThe final equation representing the range is:\")\n        print(f\"Start Bayt: {start_bayt}\")\n        print(f\"End Bayt: {end_bayt}\")\n        print(f\"\\nThis means the verses are from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n        \n        # As requested, printing each number in the final equation\n        print(\"\\nThe numbers are:\")\n        print(start_bayt)\n        print(end_bayt)\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find the specified verses in the provided text.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result\nfind_prophets_verses_in_aqeedah()\n\n<<<Bayt 16 to Bayt 19>>>\n```"
