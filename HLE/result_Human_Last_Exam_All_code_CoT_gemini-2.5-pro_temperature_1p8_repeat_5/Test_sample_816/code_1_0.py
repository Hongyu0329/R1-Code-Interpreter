    print("Step 1: Consider the Marangoni Force.")
    print("The Marangoni force is a shear stress caused by a gradient in surface tension (γ) along the weld pool surface.")
    print("The direction of flow depends on how surface tension changes with temperature (dγ/dT).\n")
    
    print("Step 2: Apply to the specific material.")
    print(f"For alloys like {material}, trace amounts of surface-active elements (e.g., sulfur) cause the temperature coefficient of surface tension (dγ/dT) to be positive.")
    print("A positive dγ/dT means that the hotter center of the pool has a higher surface tension than the cooler edges.\n")

    print("Step 3: Determine the resulting flow pattern.")
    print("Fluid on a surface is always pulled towards the region of higher surface tension.")
    print("Therefore, the liquid metal on the surface flows from the outer, cooler edges (lower tension) to the hotter center (higher tension).")
    print("This creates an INWARD flow pattern on the surface, which matches the observation exactly.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate other forces.")
    print("- Arc Drag Force: Pushes fluid outwards.")
    print("- Arc Pressure Force: Pushes fluid downwards and outwards.")
    print("- Buoyancy Force: Weak and tends to cause outward flow at the surface.")
    print("- Lorentz Force: A body force that drives inward and downward flow, but the Marangoni force is the dominant mechanism for the *surface flow* described.\n")
