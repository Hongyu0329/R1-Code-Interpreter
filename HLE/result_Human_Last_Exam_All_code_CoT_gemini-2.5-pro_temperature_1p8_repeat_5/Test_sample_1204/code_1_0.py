    This function analyzes the clinical vignette and determines the three most immediate priorities.

    Reasoning:
    1.  I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis: This is a top priority. The patient's heavy daily cannabis use is a major confounding factor that is likely causing or worsening his primary complaints of anxiety and insomnia. Addressing active substance use is a critical first step.
    2.  III. Order a urine drug test: This is also a top priority. It provides essential objective data to confirm the patient's reported use and screen for other undeclared substances, which is crucial given his complex substance use history. This information is vital for accurate diagnosis and safe prescribing.
    3.  IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia: The patient's insomnia is a significant source of distress ("struggling mightily"). While cannabis cessation is the long-term solution, offering a low-risk, non-addictive supportive treatment like melatonin addresses his immediate suffering. It shows the clinician is responding to his acute complaint while working on the underlying causes.
    4.  Why other options are lower priority:
        - II (Hospital detox of all meds) is too drastic for an initial outpatient step without acute safety risks.
        - V (Changing AUD meds) is unnecessary as the AUD is in remission.
        - VI (Start atomoxetine) is not a priority for a "questionable" diagnosis confounded by substance use, and the vignette states he is already on it, making the option illogical.

    The combination of counseling on the primary issue (I), gathering objective data (III), and providing a safe, supportive measure for a major symptom (IV) forms the most sound immediate plan.
