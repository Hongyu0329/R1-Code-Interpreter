    # --- Step 1: Define the experimental goal and components ---
    # The primary goal is to show that free GalNAc specifically inhibits the
    # binding of an anti-MUC1-TN antibody to MUC1 on the cell surface.
    inhibitor_concentration = 500  # mM, as given in the problem

    print("The experiment aims to prove that an antibody's binding is dependent on a TN antigen.")

    print("Step 2: Identify potential sources of error (confounders).")
    print("A major potential confounder is that a high concentration of an external substance like 500 mM GalNAc could have off-target effects on the cells.")
    print("Specifically, it could cause stress, leading the cells to internalize or shed surface proteins, including the MUC1-FLAG construct.\n")

    print("Step 3: Propose a control to rule out the confounder.")
    print("If the MUC1 protein level on the surface decreases, the antibody signal will drop, leading to a false conclusion (i.e., concluding specific inhibition when it was actually loss of target).")
    print("We need a control to measure the MUC1 protein level on the surface, independent of the sugar.")
    print("An anti-FLAG antibody is ideal because it binds to the protein tag (FLAG), not the sugar (TN antigen).\n")

    print("Step 4: Determine the correct step to add the control reagent.")
    print("The anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the MUC1-FLAG protein. In an immunoassay, antibodies that bind directly to the target antigen are called 'primary antibodies'.")
    print("Therefore, it must be added during the primary antibody incubation step, along with the main experimental antibody (the anti-MUC1-TN).\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclude by matching the logic to the answer choices.")
    print("Conclusion: The anti-FLAG antibody should be added with the primary antibodies to verify that the GalNAc treatment has not altered the surface expression of MUC1.")
    print("This logic directly matches Answer Choice C.\n")
