    This script analyzes whether an ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-0 hydrogens
    would exhibit quantum tunneling. It prints the reasoning step-by-step.
    """

    print("Plan: To answer this, we will apply the Pauli exclusion principle to an ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-0 hydrogen nuclei (which are bosons) and see if the energy levels required for tunneling are still allowed.")

    print("\nStep 1: Understanding Ammonia Tunneling")
    print("In an ordinary ammonia molecule (NH3), the nitrogen atom is on one side of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms, giving the molecule a pyramid shape.")
    print("Quantum tunneling is the phenomenon where the nitrogen atom can pass through the hydrogen plane to the other side, inverting the pyramid.")
    print("This physical possibility leads to a splitting of the ground vibrational state into two distinct energy levels: a symmetric state (lower energy) and an antisymmetric state (higher energy). Tunneling is the oscillation between these states.")

    print("\nStep 2: The Pauli Exclusion Principle")
    print("This principle governs the symmetry of the total wavefunction of a system of identical particles.")
    print(" - For identical fermions (like normal hydrogen nuclei/protons, which have spin 1/2), the total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC when you exchange two of them.")
    print(" - For identical bosons (like the exotic hydrogen nuclei, which have spin 0), the total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC when you exchange two of them.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing 'Exotic' Ammonia (with Bosonic Hydrogens)")
    print("The total wavefunction can be broken down: Ψ_total = Ψ_electronic * Ψ_vibrational * Ψ_rotational * Ψ_nuclear_spin")
    print("For our exotic ammonia:")
    print(" - The hydrogen nuclei are bosons, so Ψ_total must be SYMMETRIC under their exchange.")
    print(" - Since the nuclei have spin 0, the nuclear spin wavefunction (Ψ_nuclear_spin) is inherently and unchangeably SYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - The ground electronic wavefunction (Ψ_electronic) is also SYMMETRIC.")
    print(" - Therefore, for Ψ_total to be symmetric, the product (Ψ_vibrational * Ψ_rotational) must be SYMMETRIC under the exchange of the hydrogen nuclei.")

    print("\nStep 4: Checking if Both Tunneling Levels are Allowed")
    print("The question of whether tunneling occurs comes down to this: Are both the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational energy levels permitted by the Pauli principle?")
    print("  - To occupy the symmetric vibrational state, it must be paired with a rotational state that is also symmetric, so their product is symmetric.")
    print("  - To occupy the antisymmetric vibrational state, it must be paired with a rotational state that is also antisymmetric, so their product is symmetric.")
    print("\nCrucially, molecules like ammonia have a rich spectrum of rotational energy levels, and these levels possess different symmetries. Both symmetric and antisymmetric rotational states exist and are populated at normal temperatures.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclusion")
    print("Because we can find appropriate rotational states to combine with BOTH the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states, both energy levels of the tunneling doublet are allowed states for the molecule.")
    print("Since both energy levels exist, the energy splitting exists, and transitions between them can occur.")
    print("Therefore, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.")
