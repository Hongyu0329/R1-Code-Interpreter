    "The modern English word \"sister\" originates from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was adopted into English due to the influence of Viking invasions between the 7th and 12th centuries.\n\nIf this cultural exchange had not happened, the original Old English word, \"sweostor,\" would have likely followed a natural evolutionary path similar to other native words. The most probable development would have been to the word \"suster,\" a form that actually existed in Middle English but was eventually displaced by the Norse version.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this linguistic transformation to find the hypothetical modern word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the modern English word for 'sister'\n    without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. The original Old English word for sister.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"The original Old English word was: {old_english_word}\")\n\n    # 2. In Middle English, this word evolved. The 'w' was often dropped after an\n    # initial 's', and the 'eo' vowel sound simplified to 'u'.\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    print(f\"It would have evolved into the Middle English form: {middle_english_word}\")\n\n    # 3. This Middle English form, \"suster\", would likely have been retained\n    # into Modern English, as the short 'u' sound is stable.\n    # The Norse word \"systir\" (sister) replaced it in our timeline.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = middle_english_word\n    print(f\"Without Norse influence, the likely Modern English word would be: {hypothetical_modern_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
