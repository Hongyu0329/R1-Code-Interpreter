# Step 1: Define the given values for n and m.
n = 23
m = 37

# Step 2: The number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m] in the simplex category
# is given by the binomial coefficient C(m+n, n). This is derived from counting
# the number of order-preserving maps L: [n] -> [m] such that L(0) = 0.

# The parameters for the binomial coefficient C(k, r) are:
k = m + n
r = n

# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient using math.comb.
# This function is efficient and handles large integers.
result = math.comb(k, r)

# Step 4: Print the result in the requested format, showing all the numbers
# involved in the final equation.
