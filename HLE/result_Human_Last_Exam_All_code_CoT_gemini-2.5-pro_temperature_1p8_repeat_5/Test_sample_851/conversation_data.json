    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity, we need to apply a set of criteria based on the definitions of these properties in crystallography.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the necessary conditions for each property:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active (i.e., rotate the plane of polarized light), it must be **non-centrosymmetric**. This means its point group cannot contain a center of inversion (`-1`). Note that while strictly, \"optical activity\" is associated with chiral classes, some achiral classes can show optical rotation along specific directions. The question refers to this broader possibility.\n    *   **Achiral:** An object is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In crystallography, this means the point group must possess an improper axis of rotation. This includes mirror planes (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`) and rotoinversion axes (`-1`, `-3`, `-4`, `-6`). This condition explicitly excludes the 11 chiral point groups.\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if its point group is not one of the 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes, which are `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`.\n\n2.  **Systematically check all 32 crystallographic point groups:** Create a Python script to filter the 32 point groups based on these three conditions:\n    *   Condition 1: Must be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   Condition 2: Must be **achiral**.\n    *   Condition 3: Must be **non-polar**.\n\n3.  **Compare the resulting list with the given answer choices** to find the correct option. The script will identify all classes that fit the criteria, and from there we can evaluate the choices.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of the 32 crystallographic point groups and their properties.\n    # Format: { 'Hermann-Mauguin symbol': [is_centrosymmetric, is_achiral, is_polar] }\n    # is_achiral is True if it's NOT in the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes.\n    point_groups = {\n        # Triclinic\n        \"1\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"-1\":   [True,  True,  False],\n        # Monoclinic\n        \"2\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"m\":    [False, True,  True],\n        \"2/m\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        # Orthorhombic\n        \"222\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"mm2\":  [False, True,  True],\n        \"mmm\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        # Tetragonal\n        \"4\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"-4\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"4/m\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        \"422\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"4mm\":  [False, True,  True],\n        \"-42m\": [False, True,  False],\n        \"4/mmm\":[True,  True,  False],\n        # Trigonal\n        \"3\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"-3\":   [True,  True,  False],\n        \"32\":   [False, False, False],\n        \"3m\":   [False, True,  True],\n        \"-3m\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        # Hexagonal\n        \"6\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"-6\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"6/m\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        \"622\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"6mm\":  [False, True,  True],\n        \"-62m\": [False, True,  False],\n        \"6/mmm\":[True,  True,  False],\n        # Cubic\n        \"23\":   [False, False, False],\n        \"m-3\":  [True,  True,  False],\n        \"432\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"-43m\": [False, True,  False],\n        \"m-3m\": [True,  True,  False]\n    }\n\n    # Criteria for filtering:\n    # 1.
