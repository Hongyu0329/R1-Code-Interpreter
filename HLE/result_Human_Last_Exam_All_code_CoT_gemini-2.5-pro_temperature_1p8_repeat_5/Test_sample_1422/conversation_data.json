    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of vertices required to construct a two-loop Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory. The number of vertices will depend on the type of interaction. Let's analyze the case for the common $\\phi^4$ (phi-four) theory, which is known to produce the minimal vertex count for many configurations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the relevant formulas:** There are two key relationships for Feynman diagrams:\n    *   A topological formula relating the number of loops (`L`), internal lines (`I`), and vertices (`V`): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   A formula specific to the theory's interaction. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex connects four lines. This gives a relationship between vertices (`V`), internal lines (`I`), and external lines (`E`): `4V = 2I + E`.\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** We will algebraically combine these two equations to get a single formula that relates the number of vertices (`V`) to the number of loops (`L`) and external lines (`E`).\n\n3.  **Minimize the number of vertices:** The problem specifies `L=2` (two loops). To find the minimum possible number of vertices (`V`), we will use the minimal possible number of external lines (`E`). The simplest non-trivial diagram represents a correction to a particle's propagator (a self-energy diagram), which has two external lines (`E=2`).\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Plug `L=2` and `E=2` into the derived formula to calculate the minimum number of vertices. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in a scalar phi-4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of loops specified in the problem\n    num_loops = 2\n\n    # Explain the context and formulas\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices, we analyze an interacting scalar field theory.\")\n    print(\"The phi-4 interaction (4 lines per vertex) typically provides the minimum vertex count.\")\n    print(\"We use two key formulas:\")\n    print(\"1.
