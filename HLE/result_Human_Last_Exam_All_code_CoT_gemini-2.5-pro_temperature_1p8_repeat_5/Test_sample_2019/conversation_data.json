    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Toroidal Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard is a grid where the edges wrap around. This affects how queens attack. A queen at `(r, c)` attacks another queen at `(r2, c2)` if they are in the same:\n    *   **Row:** `r == r2`\n    *   **Column:** `c == c2`\n    *   **Main Diagonal:** `(r - c) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    *   **Anti-Diagonal:** `(r + c) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n\n2.  **Brute-Force Approach:** Since the board (25 squares) and the number of queens (4) are small, we can check every possible placement of 4 queens. The total number of ways to choose 4 squares out of 25 is given by the combination formula C(25, 4), which is 12,650. This number is small enough for a computer to check quickly.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   Generate all unique combinations of 4 squares from the 25 available squares on the board.\n    *   For each combination, represent the 4 chosen squares by their `(row, col)` coordinates.\n    *   Check all pairs of queens within that combination to see if they attack each other using the toroidal rules described above.\n    *   If no two queens in a combination attack each other, it is a valid placement.\n    *   Count the total number of valid placements.\n\nThis approach will systematically check all possibilities and guarantee the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on an N x N toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # Size of the chessboard\n    K = 4  # Number of queens to place\n\n    board_squares = N * N\n    count = 0\n\n    # Generate all combinations of K squares out of the total board squares\n    # The combination `(0, 1, 2, 3)` represents placing queens on the first 4 squares of the first row\n    for placement_indices in itertools.combinations(range(board_squares), K):\n        \n        # Convert the 1D indices to 2D (row, col) coordinates for the queens\n        queens = []\n        for index in placement_indices:\n            row = index // N\n            col = index % N\n            queens.append((row, col))\n            \n        # Check if the current placement is valid (no queens attack each other)\n        is_valid = True\n        \n        # Iterate over all unique pairs of queens in the current placement\n        for i in range(K):\n            for j in range(i + 1, K):\n                r1, c1 = queens[i]\n                r2, c2 = queens[j]\n                \n                # Check for an attack based on toroidal board rules\n                # 1. Row or Column attack\n                if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                    is_valid = False\n                    break\n                # 2. Main diagonal attack (wrapped)\n                if (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N:\n                    is_valid = False\n                    break\n                # 3. Anti-diagonal attack (wrapped)\n                if (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N:\n                    is_valid = False\n                    break\n            \n            # If an attack was found, we can stop checking this placement\n            if not is_valid:\n                break\n                \n        # If after checking all pairs, no attacks were found, increment the count\n        if is_valid:\n            count += 1\n            \n    # There is no single equation. The final result is the total count found.\n    # The \"equation\" is the sum of all valid placements found through iteration.\n    # The following print statement fulfills the request to output the result of the calculation.\n    print(count)\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<250>>>"
