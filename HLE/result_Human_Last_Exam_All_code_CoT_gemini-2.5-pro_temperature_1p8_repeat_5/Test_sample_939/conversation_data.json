    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and check if the resulting values fall within the sRGB gamut.\n\nA color is considered \"in-gamut\" if all of its component values (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented.\n\nThe conversion process is as follows:\n1.  **Start with ROMM RGB values.** These are assumed to be linear (no gamma curve applied). ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point.\n2.  **Convert ROMM RGB to CIE XYZ color space.** This is done using a standard matrix multiplication. The resulting XYZ values are relative to the D50 white point.\n3.  **Perform chromatic adaptation.** Because sRGB uses a D65 white point, we must convert the XYZ D50 values to XYZ D65 values. This is another matrix multiplication step.\n4.  **Convert from XYZ D65 to linear sRGB.** A final matrix multiplication converts the XYZ values into linear sRGB values.\n5.  **Check the gamut.** The resulting linear sRGB `(R, G, B)` values are checked. If `0 <= R,G,B <= 1`, the color is in the sRGB gamut. Otherwise, it is not.\n\nThe following Python script automates this process. It combines the three matrix transformations into a single matrix for efficiency and then applies it to each of the given colors to check their representability in sRGB.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_color_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    A color is outside the sRGB gamut if, after conversion, any of its\n    linear R, G, or B components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # This combined matrix converts linear ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65).\n    # It is derived by multiplying three standard conversion matrices:\n    # 1.
