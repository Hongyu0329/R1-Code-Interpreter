    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the use of the hips to achieve the backbend.\n\n*   **Vaganova Method:** In the Vaganova technique, the cambré derrière is executed with the hips held stable and square, directly over the supporting legs. The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), creating an elegant curve while maintaining core stability and protecting the lower back. The emphasis is on spinal articulation without displacing the pelvis.\n\n*   **Balanchine Method:** The Balanchine style often encourages a more extreme and dynamic line. In a cambré derrière, the dancer pushes the hips forward, away from the supporting legs. This allows for a deeper and more dramatic backbend that involves the entire spine. This forward thrust of the hip is a signature element that differentiates it from the more contained Vaganova approach.\n\nTherefore, the placement of the hip is the most fundamental difference.\n\n<<<B>>>"
