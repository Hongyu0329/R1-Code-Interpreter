    "Answering this question requires synthesizing information from scientific literature on catalysis. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is a balance to maximize the synergistic effects between the active nickel (Ni) catalyst and the ceria (CeO₂) support.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Explain the roles of Ni and Ceria in the catalytic reactions (WGS and WS).\n2.  Discuss why an optimal ratio is crucial, avoiding the extremes of too little or too much Nickel.\n3.  State the general consensus from research literature, which often points to an optimal composition for a Ni-Ce solid solution, commonly represented as NiₓCe₁-ₓO₂.\n4.  Use a Python script to calculate the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio based on the optimal value of 'x' found in scientific studies. The script will print the explanation, the formula, the numbers used in the calculation, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio for catalysis\n    based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Explanation ---\n    print(\"Finding the Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Catalysis\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"For Ni-Ceria catalysts used in the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions, the performance is highly dependent on the ratio of Nickel (Ni) to Cerium (Ce).\")\n    print(\"\\nScientific Background:\")\n    print(\"1.
