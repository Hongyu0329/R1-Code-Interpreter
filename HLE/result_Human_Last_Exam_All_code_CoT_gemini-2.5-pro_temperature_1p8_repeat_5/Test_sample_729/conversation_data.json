    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, is part of a family of groups $Q_{2^m}$. For size 128, we have $m=7$.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup of a group G is any subgroup H that can be expressed as $H = G^n = \\{g^n | g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $n$.\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on the exponent n**: I will analyze the structure of the resulting subgroup $G^n$ by considering two separate cases for the integer exponent $n$:\n    *   When $n$ is an odd number.\n    *   When $n$ is an even number.\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**: I will count the number of unique subgroups that arise from each case and sum them up to get the total number.\n5.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that formalizes this logic, calculates the result, and prints the reasoning, including the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_of_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the size of the group\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # The generalized quaternion group Q_N has size N = 2^m.\n    # We need to find m.\n    # m = log2(128) = 7\n    m = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size {group_size}.\")\n    print(f\"This group is denoted Q_{group_size}, which is Q_(2^m) for m = {m}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Let G be the group Q_128.
