    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we need to identify the equilibrium points of the system. These are the points $(u, d)$ where both $u'(t)$ and $d'(t)$ are zero.\n2.  Next, we will analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system around them (i.e., by using the Jacobian matrix). A separatrix is typically an invariant manifold (stable or unstable) associated with a saddle point.\n3.  Once we identify the saddle point, we will look for an invariant curve that passes through it. An invariant curve is a function $d = f(u)$ such that any trajectory starting on this curve remains on it.\n4.  We will hypothesize a polynomial form for the invariant curve, such as $d = au^2 + bu + c$, and substitute it into the system's phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$ to solve for the coefficients $a, b, c$.\n5.  The resulting equation that passes through the saddle point will be the separatrix.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the final equation of the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to find the separatrix for the given system of ODEs\n    and prints the final equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the variables\n    u, d = sympy.symbols('u d')\n    \n    # Define the system of ODEs\n    du_dt = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    dd_dt = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1 & 2: Finding and Classifying Equilibrium Points\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Find equilibrium points by setting derivatives to zero\n    # From du/dt = u^2(u-1) = 0, we get u = 0 or u = 1.\n    \n    # Case u=0\n    # dd_dt = 2*d^2 = 0  => d = 0\n    eq1 = (0, 0)\n    \n    # Case u=1\n    # dd_dt = 2*d^2 + 2*d = 2d(d+1) = 0 => d = 0 or d = -1\n    eq2 = (1, 0)\n    eq3 = (1, -1)\n    \n    print(f\"The equilibrium points are: E1={eq1}, E2={eq2}, E3={eq3}\")\n    \n    # Find the Jacobian matrix to classify the points\n    F = du_dt\n    G = dd_dt\n    \n    J = sympy.Matrix([[F.diff(u), F.diff(d)], [G.diff(u), G.diff(d)]])\n    \n    # Eigenvalues at E2 = (1, 0)\n    J_E2 = J.subs({u: 1, d: 0})\n    eigenvals_E2 = list(J_E2.eigenvals().keys())\n    print(f\"The Jacobian at E2={eq2} has eigenvalues {eigenvals_E2}, so it is an unstable node.\")\n\n    # Eigenvalues at E3 = (1, -1)\n    J_E3 = J.subs({u: 1, d: -1})\n    eigenvals_E3 = list(J_E3.eigenvals().keys())\n    print(f\"The Jacobian at E3={eq3} has eigenvalues {eigenvals_E3}, so it is a saddle point.\")\n    print(\"The separatrix is the invariant manifold passing through this saddle point.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3 & 4: Finding the Invariant Curve\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We hypothesize an invariant curve of the form d = a*u^2 + b*u + c.\")\n    print(\"By substituting this into the equation dd/du = (dd/dt) / (du/dt) and solving for the coefficients, we find two possible curves.\")\n    \n    # As derived in the thought process, the two invariant curves are:\n    curve1 = \"-u**2\"\n    curve2 = \"u*(1-u)\"\n    print(f\"The two invariant polynomial curves are: d = {curve1} and d = {curve2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Identifying the Separatrix\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The separatrix must pass through the saddle point E3 = (1, -1).\")\n    \n    # Check which curve passes through (1, -1)\n    u_saddle, d_saddle = 1, -1\n    \n    # Check curve 1: d = -u^2\n    d_check1 = -u_saddle**2\n    print(f\"For the curve d = -u^2, at u={u_saddle}, d = {d_check1}.
