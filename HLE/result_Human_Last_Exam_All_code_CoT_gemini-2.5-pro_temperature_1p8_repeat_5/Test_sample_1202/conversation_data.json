    "Gene duplication is a primary source of new genetic material and evolutionary innovation. After a gene is duplicated, it has several possible fates. The question asks for the mechanism most likely responsible for both the *retention* (keeping the duplicate copy instead of losing it) and its subsequent *divergence* (the two copies becoming different over time).\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n1.  **Analyze the options:** I will evaluate each choice based on its definition in evolutionary genetics.\n2.  **Eliminate incorrect options:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes gene copies more similar, not divergent. It is the opposite of divergence.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a common fate, but it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention* and functional divergence.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern (macroevolution) where a lineage diversifies rapidly. Gene duplication can fuel this process, but adaptive radiation is not a mechanism for retaining genes at the molecular level. It operates on the wrong biological scale.\n3.  **Compare the plausible options:** This leaves Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) as the two main contenders. Both are widely accepted scientific models that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** One copy keeps the original function, while the other evolves a completely new function. This clearly explains both retention (the new function is beneficial) and divergence.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, these functions are partitioned between the two copies. For example, one copy might specialize in one tissue, and the second copy in another. Now, both copies are required to perform the job of the single ancestral gene, which ensures their retention. They diverge as they specialize in their partitioned roles.\n4.  **Select the \"most likely\" mechanism:** Both C and D are correct models. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" one. The initial retention of a redundant gene copy is a major hurdle, as it is likely to be lost to pseudogenization. The subfunctionalization model provides a powerful, passive mechanism for overcoming this hurdle: the division of labor makes both copies essential for the organism's fitness, ensuring their retention. Because this mechanism relies on common degenerative mutations (loss of a sub-function) rather than rare beneficial ones (gain of a new function), many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common mode for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. Therefore, it can be considered the most likely mechanism for the widespread retention and divergence we see in genomes.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this analysis and prints the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_models():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    and identifies the most likely one from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect.
