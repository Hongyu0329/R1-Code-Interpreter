    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $g$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor and order**: We are given the conductor $d = 53599$ and the order $g = 6$. First, we find the prime factorization of $d$. A quick check shows $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct odd primes, this simplifies the problem. Let $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, where $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n2.  **Character Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n    - For $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, each component character $\\chi_i$ must be primitive modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p_i$ is primitive if and only if it's not the trivial character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n    - The **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_1), \\text{order}(\\chi_2), \\text{order}(\\chi_3), \\text{order}(\\chi_4))$. We require this to be 6.\n\n3.  **Conditions on Component Character Orders**: Let $o_i = \\text{order}(\\chi_i)$.\n    - For $\\chi_i$ to exist, its order $o_i$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $p_i-1$.\n    - From the lcm condition, each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    - Since each $\\chi_i$ must be primitive, its order $o_i$ must be greater than 1.\n    So, for each $i$, $o_i$ must be a divisor of $\\gcd(p_i-1, 6)$ and $o_i > 1$.\n    - For $p_1=7$: $p_1-1=6$. Possible orders are divisors of $\\gcd(6,6)=6$ greater than 1, so $o_1 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    - For $p_2=13$: $p_2-1=12$. Possible orders are divisors of $\\gcd(12,6)=6$ greater than 1, so $o_2 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    - For $p_3=19$: $p_3-1=18$. Possible orders are divisors of $\\gcd(18,6)=6$ greater than 1, so $o_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    - For $p_4=31$: $p_4-1=30$. Possible orders are divisors of $\\gcd(30,6)=6$ greater than 1, so $o_4 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n4.  **Counting Characters**: The number of characters modulo a prime $p$ of a given order $k$ (where $k | p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    For each prime factor $p_i$, the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We need to count the tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each $\\chi_i$ has an order from $\\{2,3,6\\}$, and their combined lcm is exactly 6.\n    - The total number of tuples where each $\\chi_i$ has an order dividing 6 (and $>1$) is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. These are the characters whose order is 2, 3, or 6.\n    - We must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6. This happens if the order is 2 or 3.\n        - The combined order is 2 if and only if all component orders $o_i$ are 2. The number of such characters is $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\n        - The combined order is 3 if and only if all component orders $o_i$ are 3. The number of such characters is $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\n    - The number of characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those with order 2 or 3.\n      Number = (Total combinations) - (Number of order 2) - (Number of order 3)\n      Number = $5^4 - 1^4 - 2^4 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nThe following python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n    # Prime factorization of d = 53599 is 7 * 13 * 19 * 31\n    primes = [7, 13, 19, 31]\n    num_primes = len(primes)\n    \n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d}, and its prime factorization is {primes}.\")\n    print(f\"We are looking for primitive characters of order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # The possible orders for component characters are divisors of g, excluding 1.\n    divisors_of_g = [k for k in range(2, g + 1) if g % k == 0]\n    \n    # For each prime p_i, the order of a component character must divide gcd(p_i-1, g).\n    # In this case, for all p in {7,13,19,31}, gcd(p-1, 6)=6.\n    # So possible orders are divisors of 6 > 1, i.e., {2, 3, 6}.\n    possible_orders = divisors_of_g\n    print(f\"For a character to be primitive of conductor {d}, its component characters must have orders from {possible_orders}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Number of characters of each possible order\n    phi_values = {k: phi(k) for k in possible_orders}\n    print(\"The number of characters for each possible order k is phi(k):\")\n    for k, v in phi_values.items():\n        print(f\"  phi({k}) = {v}\")\n    print()\n    \n    # Number of primitive characters for each prime factor whose order divides 6\n    num_chars_per_prime = sum(phi_values.values())\n    print(f\"For each prime factor, the number of primitive characters with an order dividing {g} is:\")\n    print(f\"  phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {num_chars_per_prime}\\n\")\n    \n    # Total combinations of characters whose orders divide 6\n    total_combinations = num_chars_per_prime ** num_primes\n    print(f\"The total number of primitive character combinations where each component's order divides {g} is:\")\n    print(f\"  {num_chars_per_prime}^{num_primes} = {total_combinations}\\n\")\n    \n    # We subtract combinations where the lcm order is not 6.\n    # Case 1: Order is 2.
