    "This sequence is a logic puzzle based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\n### Plan\n1.  First, let's analyze the given sequence: `ZXXCVYBN`.\n2.  We can observe that most of these letters (`Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`) appear on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n3.  The sequence is best understood as two separate, interleaved sequences.\n    *   Sequence 1 (occupying the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th positions): `Z, X, V, B, _`\n    *   Sequence 2 (occupying the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th positions): `X, C, Y, N`\n4.  The next letter is the next term in Sequence 1.\n5.  Let's find the pattern in Sequence 1 by looking at the positions of its letters on the keyboard's bottom row (`Z`=1, `X`=2, `C`=3, `V`=4, `B`=5, `N`=6, `M`=7).\n    *   `Z` is at position 1.\n    *   `X` is at position 2.\n    *   `V` is at position 4.\n    *   `B` is at position 5.\n6.  The pattern of positions is `1, 2, 4, 5`. The steps between them are `+1`, `+2`, `+1`.\n7.  This suggests a repeating pattern of adding 1, then adding 2. The next step is to add 2 to the last position.\n8.  The last position is 5. Adding 2 gives us 7.\n9.  The 7th letter on the bottom row of the keyboard is `M`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this logic and find the next letter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle ZXXCVYBN_ by analyzing interleaved\n    sequences based on the QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The bottom letter row of a standard QWERTY keyboard\n    bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n\n    # The original sequence is ZXXCVYBN\n    # We identify two interleaved sequences:\n    # S1: Z, X, V, B, ?\n    # S2: X, C, Y, N\n    # The next letter belongs to Sequence 1.\n    s1 = ['Z', 'X', 'V', 'B']\n    \n    # Get the 1-based positions of the letters in s1 from the keyboard row\n    positions = [bottom_row.find(c) + 1 for c in s1]\n    \n    print(f\"The sequence is analyzed by looking at every other letter, starting with the first.\")\n    print(f\"This gives the subsequence: {s1}\")\n    print(f\"The keyboard's bottom row is: {bottom_row}\")\n    print(f\"The positions of these letters on the bottom row are: {positions}\")\n    \n    # The pattern of steps between positions is +1, +2, +1...\n    # The next step should be +2.\n    last_position = positions[-1]\n    step = 2\n    next_position = last_position + step\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe pattern of steps between positions is [add 1, add 2, add 1, ...].\")\n    print(\"The next step in the pattern is to add 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal equation to find the next position:\")\n    # We must output each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"{last_position} + {step} = {next_position}\")\n\n    # The letter at the resulting position\n    next_letter = bottom_row[next_position - 1]\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe letter at position {next_position} on the keyboard's bottom row is '{next_letter}'.\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<M>>>"
