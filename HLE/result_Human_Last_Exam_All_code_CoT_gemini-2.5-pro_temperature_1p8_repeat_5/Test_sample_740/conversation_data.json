    "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of the parameter $λ$ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. It can be expanded as a finite sum:\n    $K(x, y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-i} y^i$.\n\n2.  **Convert to a System of Linear Equations**: By substituting the expanded kernel into the integral equation, we can see that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's express $u(x)$ in terms of some unknown coefficients. A convenient way is to define constants $c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) \\, dy$ for $j = 0, \\dots, n-1$. The integral equation can then be transformed into a system of $n$ linear algebraic equations for these constants $c_j$. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$\n    where $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$, $I$ is the identity matrix, and $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix whose elements are $A_{ji} = \\frac{1}{n+j-i}$ (with $j$ for rows and $i$ for columns, both indexed from 0 to $n-1$). The vector $\\mathbf{b}$ on the right-hand side has components $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this system (and thus the original integral equation) has no solution if the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular (i.e., its determinant is zero) and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - \\lambda A)$.\n    The condition $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$ is equivalent to saying that $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$. Let $\\mu$ be an eigenvalue of $A$. Then for $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, the system may have no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n    The theorem further specifies that for such a $\\lambda$, a solution exists if and only if the right-hand side $f(x)=1$ is orthogonal to all the eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation. Since the kernel is symmetric ($K(x, y) = K(y,x)$), the adjoint eigenfunctions are the same as the eigenfunctions of the original homogeneous equation. An eigenfunction $u(x)$ corresponds to a non-zero solution $\\mathbf{c}$ to the system $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = 0$.\n    The condition for having a solution is $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u(x) dx = 0$. In our formulation, this integral is precisely $c_0$, the first component of the vector $\\mathbf{c}$.\n    Therefore, the equation has **no solution** if we find a value $\\lambda=1/\\mu$ where $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of A, and the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}$ has its first component $c_0 \\neq 0$.\n\n4.  **Implementation with Python**: I will write a Python script that takes an integer `n` as input, constructs the matrix `A`, computes its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then identifies the values of $\\lambda$ for which the no-solution condition ($c_0 \\neq 0$) is met. For demonstration, I will use `n=3`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solutions,\n    for a given integer n.\n    \n    The equation is: u(x) = 1 + lambda * integral from 0 to 1 of K(x,y)u(y) dy\n    with K(x,y) = (x^n - y^n) / (x - y).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # 1.
