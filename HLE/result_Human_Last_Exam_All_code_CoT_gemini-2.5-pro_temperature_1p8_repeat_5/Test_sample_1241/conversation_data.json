    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stationary probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $P_i$. These represent the probabilities of the system being in each state $i$ after a long time has passed ($t \\to +\\infty$).\n\nThe stationary distribution is found by assuming the system reaches an equilibrium where the probabilities no longer change. This means we can set the time derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This transforms the system of differential equations into a more straightforward system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nA necessary condition for a system describing probabilities is that the sum of probabilities is always one: $P_0(t) + P_1(t) + P_2(t) + P_3(t) = 1$. This implies that the sum of their derivatives must be zero. Checking the provided equations, we find that the sum of derivatives is not zero, which suggests a typo in the problem statement (specifically in the sign of the $\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ term in the second equation). I will proceed by using the standard form for these systems, which involves correcting that sign. This allows for a consistent, non-trivial solution.\n\nMy plan, implemented in the Python script below, is as follows:\n1.  Use the corrected steady-state equations ($P_i' = 0$) to establish relationships between the probabilities.\n2.  Express the probabilities $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ all in terms of $P_1$.\n3.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation ($P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$).\n4.  Solve this equation to find the numerical value of $P_1$.\n5.  Use the value of $P_1$ to find the numerical value of $P_0$.\n6.  Finally, calculate the desired sum $P_0 + P_1$.\n\nThe code will print out each step of this calculation, including the final equation with the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# It seems there is a typo in the original equation P1', since sum of P'i should be 0. We'll use the corrected one\n# P1'(t) = lambda_01*P0(t) - (lambda_10+lambda_12)*P1(t) + lambda_21*P2(t) + lambda_31*P3(t)\n\ndef solve_markov_chain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the stationary distribution of the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system\n    and calculates P0(inf) + P1(inf).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the system parameters.\")\n    print(f\"lambda_01 = {lambda_01}\")\n    print(f\"lambda_10 = {lambda_10}\")\n    print(f\"lambda_12 = {lambda_12}\")\n    print(f\"lambda_21 = {lambda_21}\")\n    print(f\"lambda_23 = {lambda_23}\")\n    print(f\"lambda_31 = {lambda_31}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Set up the steady-state equations (P_i' = 0).\")\n    print(\"Based on the standard form of the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, we have:\")\n    print(\"0 = -lambda_01*P0 + lambda_10*P1\")\n    print(\"0 = - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*P2 + lambda_12*P1\")\n    print(\"0 = -lambda_31*P3 + lambda_23*P2\")\n    print(\"And the normalization condition: P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solve for P0, P2, and P3 in terms of P1.\")\n    # From the first equation: P0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * P1\n    p0_coeff = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n    print(f\"From the first equation, P0 = ({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) * P1 = {p0_coeff:.4f} * P1\")\n    \n    # From the third equation: P2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * P1\n    p2_coeff = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n    print(f\"From the third equation, P2 = ({lambda_12} / ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})) * P1 = {p2_coeff:.4f} * P1\")\n    \n    # From the fourth equation: P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * P2\n    p3_coeff_vs_p2 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\n    p3_coeff = p3_coeff_vs_p2 * p2_coeff\n    print(f\"From the fourth equation, P3 = ({lambda_23} / {lambda_31}) * P2 = {p3_coeff_vs_p2:.4f} * P2 = {p3_coeff:.4f} * P1\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Substitute into the normalization equation to find P1.\")\n    # P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1  => p0_coeff*P1 + P1 + p2_coeff*P1 + p3_coeff*P1 = 1\n    total_coeff = p0_coeff + 1 + p2_coeff + p3_coeff\n    print(f\"({p0_coeff:.4f} + 1 + {p2_coeff:.4f} + {p3_coeff:.4f}) * P1 = 1\")\n    print(f\"{total_coeff:.4f} * P1 = 1\")\n    \n    p1 = 1 / total_coeff\n    print(f\"P1 = {p1}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Calculate P0 using the value of P1.\")\n    p0 = p0_coeff * p1\n    print(f\"P0 = {p0_coeff:.4f} * P1 = {p0}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 6: Calculate the final sum P0 + P1.\")\n    result = p0 + p1\n    # This print statement fulfills the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n    print(f\"The value of P0(+infinity) + P1(+infinity) is:\")\n    print(f\"{p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_markov_chain()\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339464>>>"
