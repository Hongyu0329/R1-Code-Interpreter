    print("\nStep 1: Understand the structure of a Type-1 Fuzzy Set.")
    print("A Type-1 Fuzzy Set has a membership function (MF) that is a two-dimensional (2D) curve. It maps each element 'x' from the universe of discourse to a single, crisp membership grade 'Î¼' between 0 and 1.")

    print("\nStep 2: Understand the structural transition to a Type-2 Fuzzy Set.")
    print("A Type-2 Fuzzy Set introduces uncertainty about the membership grade. This is represented by making the membership grade itself a fuzzy set.")
    print("This adds a third dimension to the MF, making it a 3D structure. The uncertainty itself is represented by a 2D area called the 'Footprint of Uncertainty' (FOU).")
    print("So, the T1 -> T2 transition introduces a 3D representation.")

    print("\nStep 3: Understand the structural transition from Type-2 to Type-3.")
    print("A Type-3 Fuzzy Set extends this by introducing uncertainty about the secondary membership grades of the Type-2 set. The primary consequence of this is that the 'model of uncertainty' changes.")
    print("The 2D 'Footprint of Uncertainty' (FOU) from the Type-2 set, which is a crisp planar region, becomes a fuzzy volumetric region in a Type-3 set. This new structure is essentially a three-dimensional (3D) model of the uncertainty.")

    print("\nStep 4: Evaluate the options based on the structural change from Type-2 to Type-3.")
    print("The question asks for the fundamental difference between Type-2 and Type-3 in terms of dimensional structure.")
    print("As established in Step 3, the key change is that the model used to represent the uncertainty transitions from a 2D entity (FOU) to a 3D entity.")
    print("Therefore, we are adding a 'three-dimensional uncertainty model'.")

    print("\nStep 5: Select the most accurate answer.")
    print("Let's analyze the provided answer choices:")
    print(" - A, D, J: These describe the purpose or benefits (e.g., 'vagueness', 'complexity', 'refinement'), not the structural change itself.")
    print(" - B, F, I: These describe the mathematical components (tertiary layers, functions, variables) that enable the new structure. They are correct but describe the 'how' rather than the resulting dimensional structure.")
    print(" - H: 'multi-level MF structure' applies to both Type-2 and Type-3 relative to Type-1.")
    print(" - E: 'Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling added'. This directly and accurately describes the new geometric nature of the uncertainty representation in Type-3 sets compared to Type-2 sets.")
