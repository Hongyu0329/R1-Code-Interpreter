    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$, we can follow a structured approach based on the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is unique up to isomorphism and is the so-called split Chevalley group. This is because the Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which prevents the existence of twisted forms that arise in other group types.\n\n2.  **Count via Group Action:** The set of all $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ forms a single orbit under the conjugation action of the group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. This is a fundamental result in the theory.\n\n3.  **Apply Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:** According to the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of this orbit (which is the total number of such tori) is the size of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ divided by the size of the stabilizer of a point in the orbit. We can choose any $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus as our reference point. The most convenient choice is a split maximal torus, let's call it $T_0$.\n\n4.  **Determine Stabilizer Size:** The stabilizer of $T_0$ under conjugation is its normalizer, $N_G(T_0)$. Therefore, the number of rational maximal tori is given by the ratio:\n    $$ \\text{Number of tori} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n5.  **Use Standard Formulas:** We employ the standard formulas for the orders of these groups for type $E_8$:\n    *   The order of the group of rational points is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $r$ is the rank of the group, $N$ is the number of positive roots, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group. For $E_8$, we have:\n        *   Rank $r = 8$.\n        *   Number of positive roots $N = 120$.\n        *   Degrees of invariants $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n    *   The order of the normalizer of the split torus is $|N_G(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |W(E_8)| \\cdot |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n        *   $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^r = (q-1)^8$.\n        *   The order of the Weyl group $|W(E_8)|$ is the product of its degrees, $|W(E_8)| = \\prod_{i=1}^8 d_i = 696,729,600$.\n\n6.  **Construct Final Expression:** The Python code below computes the numerical constants and assembles these pieces into the final formula for the number of tori as an expression in $q$. It then prints this formula, displaying all the calculated numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_tori_number_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and presents the formula for the exact number of\n    Fq-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
