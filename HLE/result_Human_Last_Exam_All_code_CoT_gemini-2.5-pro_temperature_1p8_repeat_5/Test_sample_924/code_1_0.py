def solve_cube_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the puzzle of finding the min and max number of green cubes
    for a 3x3x3 cube under the specified face pattern rules.

    The problem states that on each face, every row and column must have
    two green cubes and one red cube.

    This solution uses a duality argument. A valid coloring for the "2 green, 1 red"
    (2G,1R) rule can be transformed into a valid coloring for a different rule,
    "1 green, 2 red" (1G,2R), by swapping all green and red cubes.

    If G is a possible number of green cubes for the (2G,1R) problem, then
    G' = 27 - G is a possible number of green cubes for the (1G,2R) problem.

    This implies:
    min(G for 2G,1R) = 27 - max(G' for 1G,2R)
    max(G for 2G,1R) = 27 - min(G' for 1G,2R)

    The min/max numbers of green cubes for the "1G, 2R" problem are known
    results from existing mathematical puzzles:
    - Minimum greens (G'_min): 9
    - Maximum greens (G'_max): 12
