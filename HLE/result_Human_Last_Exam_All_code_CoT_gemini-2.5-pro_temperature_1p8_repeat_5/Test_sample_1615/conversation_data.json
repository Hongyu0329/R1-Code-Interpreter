    "This problem asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the constraint that $G$ is not a complete graph. This quantity is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number.** A well-known theorem in graph theory states that any graph with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number $\\chi(G) \\le n$. Equality holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$. Since the problem specifies that our graph $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n2.  **Show that this upper bound is achievable.** To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to construct an example of a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Consider a graph $G^*$ formed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and adding one more vertex that is isolated (not connected to any other vertex).\n    *   This graph $G^*$ has a total of $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other vertices.\n    *   A proper coloring of the $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with any of these colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of $G^*$ is $\\chi(G^*) = n-1$.\n\n3.  **Conclude the maximum value.** Since we have shown that for any graph $G$ under the given conditions, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$, and we have found a specific graph $G^*$ for which $\\chi(G^*) = n-1$, we can conclude that the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer.** With $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph with n vertices,\n    given that the graph is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    n = 12345\n\n    # The problem is to find the maximum chromatic number chi(G) for a graph G with\n    # n vertices, given that G is not the complete graph K_n.\n\n    # 1. Finding an upper bound:\n    # A standard result in graph theory is that for any graph G with n vertices,\n    # its chromatic number chi(G) is less than or equal to n.\n    # The equality chi(G) = n holds if and only if G is the complete graph K_n.\n    # Since we are given that G is *not* a complete graph, its chromatic number must\n    # be strictly less than n. Therefore, chi(G) <= n - 1.\n\n    # 2. Showing the upper bound is achievable:\n    # To show that n-1 is the maximum possible value, we need to find an example\n    # of a graph that is not complete and requires n-1 colors.\n    # Consider a graph G* constructed from a complete graph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1})\n    # and a single additional vertex that is isolated.\n    # - The total number of vertices in G* is (n-1) + 1 = n.\n    # - G* is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to others.\n    # - To color the K_{n-1} part of G*, we need n-1 distinct colors. The isolated\n    #   vertex can take any of these colors. So, the chromatic number of G* is n-1.\n\n    # Conclusion:\n    # Since chi(G) <= n-1 for any such graph and there exists a graph that achieves\n    # this bound, the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colours for a proper vertex colouring of a graph G with n vertices, where G is not the complete graph, is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
