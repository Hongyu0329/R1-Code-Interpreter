    print("Step 1: Understanding the parental cross and the unexpected offspring.")
    print("  - Mother: Typically white-eyed (XwXw) in Bridges' key experiment.")
    print("  - Father: Red-eyed (XRY).")
    print("  - Unexpected Male Offspring: Red-eyed with an X0 chromosomal makeup.")
    print("\nStep 2: Tracing the chromosomes of the unexpected male.")
    print("  - The male is red-eyed, so he must have the XR chromosome from the father.")
    print("  - His chromosomal makeup is X0, meaning he received only that one X from his father.")
    print("  - This means the egg from the mother must have contained NO sex chromosome (it was a 'nullo-X' or '0' egg).")
    print("\nStep 3: Identifying the cause of the nullo-X egg.")
    print("  - A nullo-X egg is created by a meiotic error called non-disjunction in the mother.")
    print("  - This eliminates options related to male non-disjunction, autosomal non-disjunction, or simple mutation.")
    print("\nStep 4: Distinguishing between Meiosis I and Meiosis II non-disjunction.")
    print("  - Non-disjunction in female Meiosis I: The homologous pair of X chromosomes fails to separate. This single event produces two types of eggs: eggs with two X's (XwXw) and eggs with no X (nullo-X).")
    print("  - This event perfectly explains not only the nullo-X egg (leading to XRY0 red-eyed males) but also the XwXw egg (leading to XwXwY white-eyed females), which Bridges also observed.")
    print("\nConclusion: The specific event that explains the formation of the required nullo-X gamete is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in the female.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: This event is non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I.")
