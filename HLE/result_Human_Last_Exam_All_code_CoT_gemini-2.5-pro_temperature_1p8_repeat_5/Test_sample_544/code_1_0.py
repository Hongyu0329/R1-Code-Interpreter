    The reaction is a Pummerer-type reaction between:
    1. Methyl phenyl sulfoxide
    2. Triflic anhydride (activating agent)
    3. Trimethylsilyl cyanide (nucleophile source)
    
    The reaction proceeds via a thionium ion intermediate ([Ph-S=CH2]+), which is
    then attacked by the cyanide nucleophile.
    
    The final product's structure corresponds to the SMILES string 'c1ccccc1SCC#N'.
