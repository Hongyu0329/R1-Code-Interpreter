    "Of course. Here is the Python code to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Connect Theory**: The problem asks to use large deviation theorems (Sanov, Cramer-Chernoff) to find equilibrium values. The standard method to find these values in statistical mechanics is the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. This principle is fundamentally justified by Sanov's theorem, which states that the probability of observing a macroscopic state is exponentially related to its entropy. Therefore, the most probable state (i.e., the equilibrium state) is the one that maximizes entropy subject to physical constraints.\n\n2.  **Define the System**: We consider a system of light quanta (bosons) in a single energy mode. The energy levels are quantized: `0, ε, 2ε, 3ε, ...`. Let `p_k` be the probability of finding `k` quanta in the mode.\n\n3.  **Apply Maximum Entropy**: We will maximize the Shannon entropy `S = -k_B * Σ p_k * log(p_k)` subject to two constraints:\n    *   Normalization: `Σ p_k = 1`\n    *   Fixed Mean Energy: `Σ p_k * kε = U`\n\n4.  **Solve and Derive**: Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, this maximization problem yields the functional forms for the equilibrium mean energy `U` (the Planck distribution) and the corresponding entropy `S` for bosons.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: The Python script will:\n    *   Present the final derived equations for `U` and `S`.\n    *   Provide a numerical example with chosen values for the physical constants (`ε`, `k_B`, `T`).\n    *   Show the step-by-step calculation for the numerical example, printing each number used in the equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium equations for entropy and mean energy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta, justified by large deviation theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction and Theoretical Justification ---\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Relations for Light Quanta (Bose-Einstein Statistics) ---\")\n    print(\"\"\"\nThe equilibrium state of a physical system is its most probable macroscopic state.\nLarge deviation theorems, like Sanov's theorem, provide a formal justification\nfor the Principle of Maximum Entropy, which states that the equilibrium distribution\nis the one that maximizes entropy (S) subject to physical constraints (e.g., mean energy U).\n\nFor bosons like light quanta, this procedure yields the following key relationships:\n    \"\"\")\n    print(\"Let:\")\n    print(\"  U       = Equilibrium Mean Energy of a single mode\")\n    print(\"  S       = Equilibrium Entropy of a single mode\")\n    print(\"  epsilon = Energy of a single quantum\")\n    print(\"  k_B     = Boltzmann constant\")\n    print(\"  T       = Temperature\")\n    print(\"  beta    = 1 / (k_B * T) is the inverse temperature\\n\")\n\n    # --- Present the Derived Equations ---\n    u_equation_str = \"U = epsilon / (exp(beta * epsilon) - 1)\"\n    print(\"1.
