    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The problem asks for a scaling exponent using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This is a technique from the renormalization group theory used to study critical phenomena.\n2.  **Define Key Parameters:**\n    *   The spatial dimension `d` is given as 3.\n    *   The epsilon expansion works by perturbing around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the class of models that includes ferromagnets (like the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`.\n    *   The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Select the Model:** The scaling exponents depend on the universality class, which is determined by symmetries of the order parameter. The question doesn't specify a model, so I will use the most common one: the Ising model. In the language of n-vector models, the Ising model corresponds to `n=1` (a scalar order parameter).\n4.  **Find the Formula:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` in the `n`-vector model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to substitute `d=3`, `d_c=4`, and `n=1` into this formula to calculate `ϵ` and then `α`. The script will print out the calculation steps, including the final equation with all numbers substituted, and the final numerical value.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# --- Parameters ---\n# The user specified spatial dimension.\nd = 3\n# The upper critical dimension for the O(n) universality class (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg models).\nd_c = 4\n# The number of components of the order parameter.\n# We assume the Ising model, which is the most common case where n=1.\nn = 1\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# 1. Calculate the epsilon parameter.\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# 2. Calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula for alpha.\n# The formula to first order in epsilon is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n# 3. Calculate alpha.\nalpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"Finding the specific heat scaling exponent α for a system in d={d} dimensions.\")\nprint(\"This calculation uses the first-order epsilon (ϵ) expansion near the upper critical dimension.\")\nprint(f\"Assuming the Ising model universality class (n={n}), the upper critical dimension is d_c={d_c}.\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate ϵ:\")\nprint(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values n=1 and ϵ=1:\")\n# The user requested to see each number in the final equation.\n# The sys.stdout.write and flush commands are used for staged printing to be clear.\nsys.stdout.write(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\\n\")\nsys.stdout.flush()\nsys.stdout.write(f\"α = {numerator} / (2 * {n+8}) * {epsilon}\\n\")\nsys.stdout.flush()\nsys.stdout.write(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\\n\")\nsys.stdout.flush()\n\n# Represent as a fraction for precision\nalpha_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\nprint(f\"α = {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The final calculated value for α is approximately: {alpha}\")\n\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>\n```"
