    "My plan is to first identify the theologian and the specific terminology they developed to explain how events like the virgin birth could occur without being a \"violation\" of nature. Then, I will construct a Python script to print the name of the theologian and a brief explanation of their relevant concept.\n\nThe theologian who fits this description is **Augustine of Hippo**. He developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, or \"seminal reasons.\" Augustine argued that God, at the moment of creation, embedded all the potentials for future developments into the world.\n\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, the virgin birth was not a violation of the laws of nature. Instead, it was the actualization of a potential that God had woven into creation from the very beginning. It was contrary to the *usual course* of nature, but not to the deeper, created nature itself which contained this possibility.\n*   **Application to the Fall:** Similarly, changes in the world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death, decay, thorns and thistles) could be understood as an alteration in how these pre-existing seminal reasons unfold, introducing a corrupting principle that changed the expression of the natural order.\n\nThis framework provides a sophisticated vocabulary for discussing alterations in what we perceive as natural law.\n\n```python\ndef print_theologian_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the name of the theologian and the terminology they developed\n    to describe changes in the laws of nature.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    terminology = \"rationes seminales (or 'seminal reasons')\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"Augustine proposed that God embedded all future possibilities into creation from the beginning. \"\n        \"Therefore, a miracle like the virgin birth was not a violation of nature, but the unfolding of a latent potential that was always present. \"\n        \"Likewise, alterations to the natural world at the Fall could be seen as a change in how these 'seminal reasons' express themselves.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Theologian: {theologian}\")\n    print(f\"Specialized Terminology: {terminology}\")\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nprint_theologian_info()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which Christian theologian first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
