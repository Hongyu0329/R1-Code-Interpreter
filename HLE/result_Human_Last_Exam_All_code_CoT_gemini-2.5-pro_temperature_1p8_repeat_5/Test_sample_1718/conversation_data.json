    "To find the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to count the number of independent real parameters that define the tensor at a point, taking into account all of its symmetries.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will start from the known symmetries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold. Let the manifold have complex dimension $m$ (and real dimension $n=2m$).\n2.  The key insight is that due to the compatibility of the metric with the complex structure, the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor (in a complex basis) are of the form $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$, where the Greek indices run from $1$ to $m$.\n3.  I will explain how the remaining symmetries show that these components can be understood as defining a **Hermitian form** on a related vector space. This space is the symmetric square of the holomorphic tangent space, denoted as $W = S^2(T^{1,0}M)$.\n4.  The core of the calculation is then to find the dimension of this space $W$. The complex dimension of the holomorphic tangent space $T^{1,0}M$ is $m$. The complex dimension of the space of symmetric 2-tensors on it, which I will call $N$, is given by the formula $N = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n5.  The number of independent *real* parameters required to define a Hermitian form on an $N$-dimensional complex vector space is $N^2$. This corresponds to specifying an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix, which has $N$ real diagonal entries and $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ independent complex off-diagonal entries. The total number of real parameters is $N + 2 \\times \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} = N^2$.\n6.  Thus, the final formula for the number of independent components is $\\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$.\n7.  Since the question does not specify a dimension, I will write a Python script that implements this formula. I will choose the representative complex dimension $m=3$ (a common case for important manifolds like Calabi-Yau threefolds) to demonstrate the calculation and provide a concrete final answer. The script will print out each step of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_riemann_components_kahler(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m.\n\n    The real dimension of the manifold is n = 2*m.\n\n    Args:\n      m: The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: The components of the Riemann tensor define a Hermitian form on the\n    # space of symmetric (2,0)-tensors.
