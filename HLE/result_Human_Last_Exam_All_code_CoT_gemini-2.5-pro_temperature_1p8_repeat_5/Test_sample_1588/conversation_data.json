    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Core**: The problem asks for the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. Each term in this expansion corresponds to a unique, linearly independent nested commutator of the generators (let's call them `X` and `Y`). The set of all such commutators of a given order forms a basis for a vector space. The number of these basis elements is what we need to find.\n2.  **Use Witt's Formula**: This problem is equivalent to finding the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n=10` of the free Lie algebra on `k=2` generators. This dimension is given by Witt's formula:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (μ(d) * k^(n/d))`\n    Where:\n    *   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10.\n    *   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (`X` and `Y`).\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n    *   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n3.  **Implement the Calculation in Python**:\n    *   First, I will write helper functions to find all divisors of `n` and to calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n    *   The main script will then iterate through the divisors `d` of 10.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, it will calculate the term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`.\n    *   It will sum up these terms.\n    *   Finally, it will divide the sum by `n=10` to get the result.\n    *   As requested, the code will print the full final equation with all the numbers involved in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their exponents.\n    Example: get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(1) = 1\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_nonzero_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-zero coefficients for a given order in the BCH expansion.\n    This is determined by applying Witt's formula for a free Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The order of the term in the BCH expansion\n    n = 10\n    # The number of generators (typically X and Y)\n    k = 2\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of non-zero coefficients of order n={n}.\")\n    print(\"This is calculated using Witt's formula for k=2 generators:\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * Sum over d|n [ mu(d) * k^(n/d) ]\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    equation_terms = []\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the summation\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_term = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * k_power_term\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        # Store components for the final equation printout\n        equation_terms.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{power})\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    # As requested, printing the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"The full calculation using these values is:\")\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms).replace('+ (-', '- ')\n    \n    # Calculate numeric values for the final display\n    numeric_terms = []\n    current_sum = 0\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_term = k ** power\n        term = mu_d * k_power_term\n        numeric_terms.append(str(term))\n        current_sum += term\n\n    sum_numeric_str = \" + \".join(numeric_terms).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    \n    print(f\"Number = (1/{n}) * [ {sum_numeric_str} ]\")\n    print(f\"Number = (1/{n}) * [ {current_sum} ]\")\n    print(f\"Number = {result}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is:\")\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_bch_nonzero_coefficients()\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
