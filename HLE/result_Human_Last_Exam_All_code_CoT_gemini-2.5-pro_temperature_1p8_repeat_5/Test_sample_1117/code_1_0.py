    # Explanation of the chemical process
    # The reagent adds to the outer surface of the fullerene cage.
    # This functionalization breaks the symmetry of the C80 cage.
    # The breaking of symmetry creates a new electrostatic potential inside the cage.
    # The internal cerium atoms, which were previously in random motion,
    # now move to fixed positions at the new energy minima.
    # For this system, these minima lie along the axis defined by the external addition.

    # Final Result
