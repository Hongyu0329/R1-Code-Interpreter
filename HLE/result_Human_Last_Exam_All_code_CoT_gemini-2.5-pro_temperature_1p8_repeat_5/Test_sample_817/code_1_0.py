    # Step 1: Identify HR4
    # Research indicates that in Arabidopsis, HR4 (HYPERSENSITIVE RESPONSE 4) is the same protein
    # as RPW8.2, a key component of the RPW8 (RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8) locus.

    # Step 2 & 3: Evaluate each option based on scientific literature about HR4/RPW8.2.

    # Option A: It is an interactor of the actin assembly factor ADF3.
    # Analysis: There is no widely-cited evidence in major publications showing a direct interaction
    # between HR4/RPW8.2 and ADF3. This statement is likely false.
    analysis_A = "A. Incorrect. No primary evidence supports a direct interaction between HR4 and ADF3."

    # Option B: It contributes to the defense against the broad spectrum of powdery mildew pathogens.
    # Analysis: The RPW8 locus, which includes HR4/RPW8.2, is famous for conferring 'broad-spectrum resistance'
    # to various powdery mildew species and isolates. This statement is factually correct.
    analysis_B = "B. Correct. The RPW8 locus, containing HR4, is well-documented to provide broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew."

    # Option C: It is targeted to the Extrahaustorial membrane during infection by the powdery mildew pathogen.
    # Analysis: A defining feature of HR4/RPW8.2 function is its specific recruitment to the
    # Extrahaustorial Membrane (EHM), the interface between the plant cell and the fungal feeding structure (haustorium).
    # This localization is critical for its defensive function. This statement is also factually correct.
    analysis_C = "C. Correct. The specific targeting of HR4/RPW8.2 to the Extrahaustorial Membrane (EHM) is a key mechanism of its function."

    # Option D & E: It regulates or interacts with the defense modulator PAD4.
    # Analysis: Studies have shown that RPW8-mediated resistance is independent of the PAD4/SA signaling pathway.
    # This means HR4's function does not rely on or regulate PAD4. These statements are false.
    analysis_DE = "D & E. Incorrect. RPW8/HR4-mediated resistance functions independently of the PAD4 signaling pathway."

    # Step 4: Compare the correct options (B and C).
    # Both B and C are true statements. However, C describes the specific cellular and molecular mechanism (protein localization)
    # that leads to the outcome described in B (broad-spectrum resistance). In molecular biology questions,
    # the description of the specific mechanism is often considered the most precise and fundamental answer.
    # The EHM targeting is a hallmark of the RPW8 protein family's unique mode of action.
    conclusion = textwrap.dedent("""\
        Based on the analysis, both statements B and C are factually correct. However, statement C describes the specific molecular mechanism (localization to the Extrahaustorial Membrane) which is the direct function of the protein and the cause for the biological outcome described in statement B (broad-spectrum resistance). Therefore, C is the most precise and fundamental description of HR4's role during powdery mildew infection.""")
