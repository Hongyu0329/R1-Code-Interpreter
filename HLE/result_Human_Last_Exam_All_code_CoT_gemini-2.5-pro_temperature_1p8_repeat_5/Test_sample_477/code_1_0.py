    # --- Role of the Gene of Interest ---
    gene = "LIG1 (DNA Ligase 1)"
    gene_function = "An essential enzyme that seals single-strand breaks ('nicks') in DNA during replication and repair, particularly Base Excision Repair (BER)."

    # --- The Mechanism of Instability ---

        "Somatic expansion is largely driven by DNA repair processes on the CTG repeat tract. "
