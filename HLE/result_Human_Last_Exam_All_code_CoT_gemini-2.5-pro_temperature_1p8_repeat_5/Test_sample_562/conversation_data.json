    "The task is to identify the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character 謄 and provide its Hepburn-transcribed name.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the structure of the character 謄. The character can be broken down into two parts, a left component and a right component.\n1.  **Left component:** 言. This character means \"word\" or \"to say\".\n2.  **Right component:** 朕. This is an archaic pronoun for \"I\", used by emperors.\n\nIn characters with this left-right structure (known as hen-tsukuri), the left part is very often the radical, indicating the semantic category of the character. The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to make a transcript,\" which is directly related to words and documents. Therefore, the radical is 言.\n\nNext, I need to find the specific name for the 言 radical when it appears on the left side of a character. This form is known as a \"hen\" (偏), and its specific name is ごんべん (gonben).\n\nFinally, I will transcribe ごんべん into Hepburn romanization.\n-   ご (go)\n-   ん (n)\n-   べ (be)\n-   ん (n)\nThe result is \"Gonben\".\n\nThe Python code below will simply print this final answer.\n\n```python\n# The character is 謄.\n# Its radical is the left-side component, 言 (word).\n# The name for the 言 radical when it's on the left is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n# This script prints the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\nradical_name_in_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\nprint(radical_name_in_hepburn)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
