    # Step 1: Analyze the initial symptoms
    # Symptoms: agitation, difficulty sleeping, increased sexual activities, careless spending.
    # These are characteristic symptoms of a manic episode, part of Bipolar Disorder.
    print("Patient's initial symptoms suggest a manic episode (Bipolar Disorder).")

    # Step 2: Identify the likely treatment
    # A medication was prescribed for these symptoms. A first-line treatment for Bipolar Disorder is Lithium.
    print("The standard treatment for this condition is a mood stabilizer, most commonly Lithium.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the new symptom that appeared after treatment
    # New symptom: Decreased interest in having sex (sexual dysfunction).
    print("The patient later developed sexual dysfunction after starting the medication.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the options to connect the treatment to the new symptom
    # We need a mechanism that links the likely medication (Lithium) to sexual dysfunction.
    # Option A: Lithium induced hypothyroidism.
    # It is a well-documented fact that Lithium can cause hypothyroidism.
    # It is also well-documented that a key symptom of hypothyroidism is decreased libido/sexual dysfunction.
    print("A common side effect of Lithium is hypothyroidism.")
    print("A key symptom of hypothyroidism is decreased libido (sexual dysfunction).")

    # Conclusion: The sequence of events strongly supports this diagnosis.
    # Bipolar Disorder -> Prescribed Lithium -> Developed Hypothyroidism -> Experienced Sexual Dysfunction
    print("\nConclusion: The most logical cause connecting all events is Lithium induced hypothyroidism.")
