    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of colors in phosphorus allotropes.\n\n1.  **Identify the Allotropes:** First, I will identify the main, well-established pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **List Their Colors:** For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color.\n3.  **Count the Colors:** I will count the number of unique colors found.\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to present this information. The script will:\n    *   Store the allotropes and their colors in a dictionary.\n    *   Print each allotrope and its color.\n    *   Construct and print an addition equation to sum the number of colors, showing how the final count is reached.\n\n```python\ndef solve_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of pure phosphorus allotropes and calculates the total number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary storing the major allotropes of phosphorus and their colors.\n    # Yellow phosphorus is often considered an impure or light-degraded form of white phosphorus,\n    # so we will count white as the primary color for that form.\n    allotropes_info = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for allotrope, color in allotropes_info.items():\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()} (from {allotrope})\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of unique colors.\n    num_colors = len(allotropes_info)\n\n    # Step 4: Create and display the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we sum one for each distinct color:\")\n\n    # Create a list like [\"1 (white)\", \"1 (red)\", ...]\n    equation_components = [f\"1 ({color})\" for color in allotropes_info.values()]\n\n    # Join the components with \" + \" to form the equation string\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_components)\n\n    # Print the full equation showing each number\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {num_colors}\")\n\nsolve_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
