# This script calculates the firm's profit or loss based on the provided economic scenario.

# Step 1: Define representative numerical values that satisfy the problem's conditions.
# The condition is P = MC < AVC < ATC at an output level q1.
# Let's choose some values for demonstration.
q1 = 10  # Output level
P = 30   # Market Price
AVC = 35 # Average Variable Cost at q1
ATC = 45 # Average Total Cost at q1

# For these values, the condition P < AVC < ATC is met (30 < 35 < 45).
# We assume MC=P=30, although the MC value is not needed for the profit calculation itself.

# Step 2: Calculate the areas S and H as defined in the problem.
# S represents Total Revenue (TR).
# H represents Total Cost (TC).
S = P * q1
H = ATC * q1

# Step 3: Calculate the profit or loss.
# Profit = Total Revenue (S) - Total Cost (H).
profit_value = S - H

# The magnitude of the loss is the area representing the difference
# between the Total Cost rectangle and Total Revenue rectangle.
loss_area = H - S

# Step 4: Print the analysis and results.
