    "The value computed between heartbeats to track Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the time duration between two successive heartbeats. This is most commonly known as the R-R interval, which refers to the time between the peaks of the 'R' wave in an ECG signal. When measured with PPG, it is technically the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or Beat-to-Beat Interval (BBI), but \"R-R interval\" is often used interchangeably. I will provide a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the term used for the value computed between heartbeats for HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # HRV is the measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats.\n    # This specific time value measured between beats is most commonly called the R-R interval.\n    # Even when using PPG, where it is technically the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI),\n    # the term R-R interval is widely used.\n    \n    answer = \"The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis is called the R-R interval (or Inter-Beat Interval - IBI).\"\n    print(answer)\n\nget_hrv_term()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
