    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, classical commuting numbers are replaced by anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. This is done to correctly incorporate the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Pauli Principle and Grassmann Variables:** The Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids two identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state, is encoded in the algebraic properties of Grassmann variables (e.g., `ψ`). The key property is that they anticommute (`ψ₁ψ₂ = -ψ₂ψ₁`), which implies that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (`ψ² = 0`).\n\n2.  **Grassmann Integration (Berezin Integral):** To perform path integrals with these variables, a special set of integration rules, known as Berezin integration, is required. The integration measure (e.g., `dψ`) is not a value itself but is defined by its behavior when applied to functions of Grassmann variables. Since `ψ² = 0`, any well-behaved function `f(ψ)` can be written simply as `f(ψ) = a + bψ`.\n\n3.  **The Defining Rules:** The entire framework is built on two fundamental rules that define the integral and ensure consistency with the Pauli principle:\n    *   The integral of a constant is zero: `∫ dψ * 1 = 0`\n    *   The integral of the variable itself is one (by normalization convention): `∫ dψ * ψ = 1`\n\n4.  **Demonstration with Code:** I will write a Python script that first defines a function to simulate this integration. The function will take the coefficients `[a, b]` of a function `f(ψ) = a + bψ` and return the result of its integral. Then, I will use this function to explicitly demonstrate the two fundamental rules, printing the equations and their results. The \"value\" referred to in the question is best understood as the result of these defining integrals, which are 0 and 1. The normalization to 1 is the most crucial choice.\n\n```python\ndef berezin_integral(coefficients):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the Berezin integral for a function of a single Grassmann variable.\n    A function f(psi) is represented by its Taylor expansion f(psi) = a + b*psi.\n    Since psi*psi = 0, there are no higher order terms.\n    The coefficients are provided as a list [a, b].\n\n    According to Berezin integration rules:\n    ∫ d(psi) f(psi) = ∫ d(psi) (a + b*psi) = a*∫d(psi) + b*∫d(psi)*psi = a*0 + b*1 = b.\n    The integral simply returns the coefficient of the linear term.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(coefficients, list) or len(coefficients) != 2:\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of two coefficients [a, b].\")\n    \n    # The result of the integral is the coefficient 'b'.\n    a, b = coefficients\n    return b\n\ndef demonstrate_rules():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the fundamental rules of Berezin integration using the simulator.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In fermionic path integrals, the Pauli exclusion principle is enforced using Grassmann variables (e.g., ψ), where ψ²=0.\")\n    print(\"The integral over such variables is defined by the following rules:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Rule 1: Integral of a constant (f(ψ) = 1, so a=1, b=0)\n    constant_func_coeffs = [1, 0]\n    result_1 = berezin_integral(constant_func_coeffs)\n    print(\"1.
