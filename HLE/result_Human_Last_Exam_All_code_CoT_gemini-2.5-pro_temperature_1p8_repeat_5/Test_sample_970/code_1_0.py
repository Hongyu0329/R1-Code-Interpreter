    This function determines the necessary assumption for Bayesian information gain convergence
    and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The analysis shows that for the sum of expected information gains to be bounded,
    the entropy of the prior distribution must be finite. A finite sum of non-negative
    terms implies that the terms must approach zero. Therefore, a finite entropy prior
    is the necessary assumption among the choices.
