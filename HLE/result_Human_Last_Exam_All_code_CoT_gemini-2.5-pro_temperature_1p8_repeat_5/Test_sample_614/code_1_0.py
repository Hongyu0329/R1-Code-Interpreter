# This code prints the sequence of numbers derived from the riddle.

# The riddle's solution is a specific sequence of five numbers.
# I will define each number in the sequence based on the step-by-step logical deduction.
num_1st = 2
num_2nd = 4
num_3rd = 1
num_4th = 3
num_5th = 0

# The puzzle asks to "output each number in the final equation!"
# Since it's a sequence, not an equation, I will print the numbers in their correct order.
print(f"The numbers in the correct order are:")
print(f"{num_1st}, {num_2nd}, {num_3rd}, {num_4th}, {num_5th}")
