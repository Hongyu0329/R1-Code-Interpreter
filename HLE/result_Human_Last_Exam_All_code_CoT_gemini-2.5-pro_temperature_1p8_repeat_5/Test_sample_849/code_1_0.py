def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the AI model M.

    The model cannot a priori prove that its predictors will be successful, as the set of
    successful predictor indices is uncomputable. A safe goal, therefore, cannot be
    "predictive success." Instead, the model should adopt a goal that is both
    computable and acknowledges its inherent limitations.

    The model learns from its internal set of possible predictors, which are its "hypotheses".
    The safe learning strategy is to generate proposals based on these hypotheses and
    then learn to generate proposals that an external entity (like a human) approves of.
    This process is known as "Approval-directed learning".

    Therefore, the safe goal is defined by completing the template.
