    "For a single patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes it contains. When you have multiple separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each individual patch.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the number of patches and the number of holes per patch.\n2.  Calculate the number of logical qubits for one patch (which is equal to the number of holes).\n3.  Calculate the total number of logical qubits by adding the contributions from each patch.\n4.  Print the final calculation and result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the number of patches and holes\nnum_patches = 2\nholes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a single patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n# The total number of logical qubits for multiple separate patches is the sum of the qubits in each patch.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\n# Using a stream object to prevent reordering of print statements\noutput = sys.stdout\noutput.write(\"A single surface code patch with g holes can encode g logical qubits.\\n\")\noutput.write(f\"For each of the {num_patches} patches with {holes_per_patch} holes, we have {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\\n\")\noutput.write(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum across all patches.\\n\")\noutput.write(\"Final Equation:\\n\")\noutput.write(f\"{num_patches} * {holes_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\\n\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
