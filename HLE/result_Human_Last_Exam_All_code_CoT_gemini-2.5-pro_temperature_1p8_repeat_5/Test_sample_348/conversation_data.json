    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n2.  **Market Equilibrium:** First, we need to find the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. This is where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`) and the price is the same for both functions (`P_S = P_D = P_e`).\n    *   Set the supply and demand equations equal to each other: `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n    *   This equation cannot be solved algebraically, so we will use a numerical method (like `fsolve` from Python's SciPy library) to find the equilibrium quantity `Q_e`.\n    *   Once `Q_e` is found, we can substitute it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price `P_e`.\n3.  **Total Welfare Calculation:**\n    *   Total welfare is the total area between the demand curve and the supply curve, up to the equilibrium quantity.\n    *   Mathematically, `Total Welfare = (Area under Demand Curve) - (Area under Supply Curve)`.\n    *   The area under the demand curve is the integral of the demand function `P_D(Q)` from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_e`.\n    *   The area under the supply curve is the integral of the supply function `P_S(Q)` over its economically relevant domain. The supply price `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is positive only when `ln(Q³ - 2) > 0`, which means `Q³ - 2 > 1`, or `Q > 3^(1/3)`. Therefore, we integrate the supply function from `Q = 3^(1/3)` to `Q=Q_e`.\n    *   The formula becomes:\n        `Total Welfare = ∫[0 to Q_e] P_D(Q) dQ - ∫[3^(1/3) to Q_e] P_S(Q) dQ`.\n    *   These integrals will also be calculated numerically using Python's `quad` function from the SciPy library.\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will first calculate and print the equilibrium quantity and price. Then, it will calculate the values of the two integrals and subtract them to find the total welfare, printing each step of the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n#\n# Given functions:\n# Supply: P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)\n# Demand: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions ---\n\ndef demand_P(Q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the price from the demand function for a given quantity Q.\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\ndef supply_P(Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the price from the supply function for a given quantity Q.\n    This function is only valid for Q > 2^(1/3).\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\n# --- Step 2: Find the market equilibrium (Q_e, P_e) ---\n\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines the equation to solve for equilibrium.\n    Equilibrium occurs when supply_P(Q) = demand_P(Q).\n    The root of this function is the equilibrium quantity.\n    \"\"\"\n    return supply_P(Q) - demand_P(Q)\n\n# We need an initial guess to find the root.
