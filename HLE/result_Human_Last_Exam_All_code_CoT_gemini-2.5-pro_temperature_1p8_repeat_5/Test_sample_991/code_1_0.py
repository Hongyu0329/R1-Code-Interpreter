# This script deciphers a Chinese character riddle.

# 1. "A wooden stick"
# This clue points to the Chinese radical for "wood" or "tree".
wooden_stick = "木"

# 2. "hanging a square box"
# This describes a component that looks like a box on top of the tree.
# In the character '果', the component '田' (field) sits on top of '木'.
# Pictographically, this represents a fruit on a tree.
square_box_component = "田"

# 3. "a ladder placed in the center"
# This describes the inner structure of the '田' component.
# '田' is made of a square '囗' and a cross '十'.
# The cross '十' in the middle can be seen as a simple ladder.
ladder_in_center = "The '十' inside '田'"

# Assembling the character:
# The component '田' (square box with a ladder) is placed on top of '木' (wooden stick).
# This forms the character '果'.
final_character = "果"
