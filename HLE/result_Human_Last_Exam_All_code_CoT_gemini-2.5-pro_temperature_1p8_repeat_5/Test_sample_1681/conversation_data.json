    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the equilibrium point of the quantum prisoner's dilemma:\n\n1.  **Understand the Framework**: The problem will be analyzed using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol for quantum games. This protocol involves sharing a maximally entangled quantum state between the two players. The players' classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), are mapped to quantum operations (unitary transformations) they apply to their part of the entangled state.\n2.  **Game Transformation**: A key result of the EWL protocol with maximal entanglement is that it transforms the original classical game into a new, equivalent classical game with a different payoff structure. This transformation affects the off-diagonal payoffs (when players choose different strategies).\n3.  **Calculate New Payoffs**:\n    *   The original payoff matrix is given as `[[(R,R), (S,T)], [(T,S), (P,P)]]`, where R=5 (mutual cooperation), S=0 (cooperating while the other defects), T=7 (defecting while the other cooperates), and P=1 (mutual defection).\n    *   The transformation rules for the new game are:\n        *   `R_new = R`\n        *   `P_new = P`\n        *   `S_new = (S + T) / 2`\n        *   `T_new = (T + S) / 2`\n    *   We will calculate these new values.\n4.  **Analyze the New Game**:\n    *   We will construct the new payoff matrix using the calculated values.\n    *   We will analyze this new matrix to find the Nash Equilibrium. This involves checking for dominant strategies for each player. A dominant strategy is one that yields a better outcome regardless of what the other player does.\n5.  **Identify Equilibrium**: The dominant strategy for both players in the new game will determine the equilibrium point. The associated payoff will represent the outcome of the quantum game.\n\nThe Python code below will implement steps 3 and 4, printing out all the calculations and the logical reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and analyzes the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the classical payoff matrix values\n    # (Player1_payoff, Player2_payoff)\n    # R: (Cooperate, Cooperate)\n    # S: (Cooperate, Defect) for player 1\n    # T: (Defect, Cooperate) for player 1\n    # P: (Defect, Defect)\n    R = 5\n    S = 0\n    T = 7\n    P = 1\n\n    print(\"Original Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):\")\n    print(f\"           Player 2 Cooperate    Player 2 Defect\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 Cooperate: ({R}, {R})             ({S}, {T})\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 Defect:   ({T}, {S})             ({P}, {P})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Under the EWL quantum game protocol with maximal entanglement,\n    # the game is equivalent to a classical game with transformed payoffs.\n    print(\"Calculating payoffs for the equivalent game under the EWL quantum protocol...\")\n\n    R_q = R\n    P_q = P\n    S_q = (S + T) / 2\n    T_q = (T + S) / 2 # Note: S_q will equal T_q\n\n    print(f\"The 'Cooperate, Cooperate' payoff R' remains R: {R_q}\")\n    print(f\"The 'Defect, Defect' payoff P' remains P: {P_q}\")\n    print(f\"The 'Cooperate, Defect' payoff S' becomes (S + T) / 2: ({S} + {T}) / 2 = {S_q}\")\n    print(f\"The 'Defect, Cooperate' payoff T' becomes (T + S) / 2: ({T} + {S}) / 2 = {T_q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Construct and print the new game matrix\n    print(\"New Equivalent Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):\")\n    print(f\"           Player 2 Cooperate    Player 2 Defect\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 Cooperate: ({R_q}, {R_q})           ({S_q}, {T_q})\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 Defect:   ({T_q}, {S_q})           ({P_q}, {P_q})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the new game for dominant strategies\n    print(\"Analyzing Player 1's strategy:\")\n    # Case 1: Player 2 Cooperates\n    print(\"If Player 2 Cooperates, Player 1's payoffs are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Cooperate: {R_q}\")\n    print(f\"  - Defect: {T_q}\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 should Cooperate because {R_q} > {T_q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    # Case 2: Player 2 Defects\n    print(\"If Player 2 Defects, Player 1's payoffs are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Cooperate: {S_q}\")\n    print(f\"  - Defect: {P_q}\")\n    print(f\"Player 1 should Cooperate because {S_q} > {P_q}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: 'Cooperate' is the dominant strategy for Player 1.\")\n    print(\"Due to the symmetry of the game, 'Cooperate' is also the dominant strategy for Player 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 5: State the equilibrium\n    print(f\"The unique Nash Equilibrium is (Cooperate, Cooperate).\")\n    print(f\"The payoff at this equilibrium is ({R_q}, {R_q}).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe dilemma is resolved: the mutually beneficial outcome is now a stable equilibrium.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_quantum_dilemma()\n```\n<<<(Cooperate, Cooperate)>>>"
