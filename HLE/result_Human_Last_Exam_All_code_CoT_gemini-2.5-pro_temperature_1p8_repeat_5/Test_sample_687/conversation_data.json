    "To solve this problem, we will use a well-known result from knot theory that relates the HOMFLY polynomial of a knot to its number of Seifert circles. This result is the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** The Morton-Franks-Williams inequality states that for any diagram D of a knot K, the span of its HOMFLY polynomial, $P_K(v, z)$, with respect to the variable $v$, is bounded by the number of Seifert circles, $s(D)$, of that diagram:\n    $\\text{span}_v(P_K) \\le 2(s(D) - 1)$\n\n2.  **Derive the lower bound formula:** By rearranging the inequality, we can establish a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles, $s_{min}(K)$, over all possible diagrams of the knot K:\n    $s_{min}(K) \\ge \\frac{\\text{span}_v(P_K)}{2} + 1$\n\n3.  **Execute the calculation plan:** I will write a Python script that:\n    a. Uses the `spherogram` library to find the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$.\n    b. Calculates the span of this polynomial by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of the variable $v$.\n    c. Plugs the span into the formula to compute the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n    d. Prints out the steps of the calculation and the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    of the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
