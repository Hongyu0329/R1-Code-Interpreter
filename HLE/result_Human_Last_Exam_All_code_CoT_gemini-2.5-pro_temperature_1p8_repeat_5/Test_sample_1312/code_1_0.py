            'term': 'Chromosomal inversions',

            'explanation': 'These groups of similar genes, arising from duplication, provide functional redundancy. More importantly, they facilitate gene conversion, a process where a healthy gene copy can be used as a template to repair a mutated copy. This directly counteracts the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller\'s Ratchet) in low-recombination environments.'
