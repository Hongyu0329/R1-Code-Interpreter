    "This is a problem in category theory, which can be solved by applying principles from abstract algebra.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the Problem:** A category with one object is called a monoid. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, and the category's composition rule is the monoid's binary operation. Therefore, the question is equivalent to: \"How many monoids of order 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"\n\n2.  **Setup:** Let the three morphisms (monoid elements) be `id`, `g`, and `h`. By definition, `id` is the identity element, so any composition involving `id` is fixed (e.g., `id o g = g`, `h o id = h`, etc.).\n\n3.  **Brute-Force Search:** We need to determine the outcomes of the four remaining compositions:\n    *   `g o g`\n    *   `g o h`\n    *   `h o g`\n    *   `h o h`\n    Each of these compositions must result in one of `id`, `g`, or `h`. This gives `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^4 = 81` possible composition tables.\n\n4.  **Check Associativity:** We will programmatically generate all 81 possible tables and check each one to see if it satisfies the associativity law: `(a o b) o c = a o (b o c)` for all `a, b, c` in `{id, g, h}`.\n\n5.  **Account for Isomorphism:** Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means checking if a valid composition table is identical to another one after swapping the roles of `g` and `h`. We will count the number of unique tables after this grouping.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will perform this exhaustive search and filtering process, printing the logic and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We represent the morphisms as numbers: 0 for identity, 1 for 'g', 2 for 'h'\n    morphisms = [0, 1, 2]\n    num_non_identity = 2\n\n    # The 4 compositions we need to define are g*g, g*h, h*g, h*h\n    # In terms of numbers: 1*1, 1*2, 2*1, 2*2\n    num_choices_per_comp = len(morphisms)\n    total_possibilities = num_choices_per_comp ** (num_non_identity ** 2)\n\n    # 1.
