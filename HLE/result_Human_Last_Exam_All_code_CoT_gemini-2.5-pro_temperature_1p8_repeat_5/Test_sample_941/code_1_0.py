    # Analysis of training methods:
    # Most traditional ballet methodologies (Vaganova, Russian, Cecchetti, Royal Ballet) emphasize
    # warming up and performing barre exercises in soft ballet slippers. This allows for full
    # articulation of the foot and ankle to build strength before moving to pointe work in the center.
    #
    # The School of American Ballet (SAB), founded by George Balanchine, is famous for the
    # Balanchine technique. A distinctive feature of this technique for advanced female dancers
    # is the practice of wearing pointe shoes for the entire duration of the class,
    # including the initial barre work. This is intended to build exceptional strength and
    # fully integrate pointe work into the dancer's fundamental technique.
