    # According to the analysis:
    # 1. For any aposyndetic continuum X, the set of non-block points is the entire space X.
    #    This is based on a fundamental theorem by F. B. Jones, which states that a continuum X
    #    is aposyndetic if and only if for every point p in X, the set X \ {p} is continuum-connected.
    #    A set that is continuum-connected is a dense, continuum-connected subset of itself.
    #    Thus, every point p in an aposyndetic continuum is a non-block point.
    
    # 2. The problem is therefore reduced to finding the smallest possible cardinality of an
    #    aposyndetic continuum.

    # 3. We must find the smallest possible size for a space that is compact, connected,
    #    Hausdorff, and aposyndetic.
    
    # 4. A single-point space, X = {p}, is a continuum:
    #    - Compact: Yes (it is finite).
    #    - Connected: Yes.
    #    - Hausdorff: Yes (vacuously true).

    # 5. A single-point space is also aposyndetic. The condition for aposyndesis is
    #    "for every two distinct points...", which is vacuously true as no two distinct points exist.
    
    # 6. The cardinality of this space is 1. Since a continuum must be non-empty, the cardinality
    #    cannot be smaller than 1.
