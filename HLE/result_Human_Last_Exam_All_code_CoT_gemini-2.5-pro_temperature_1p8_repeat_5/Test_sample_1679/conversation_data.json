    "To find the first Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Objects**: The \"Luxor Obelisks\" are a specific pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks. One is located at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Egypt, and the other is at the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **Create a Candidate List**: I will go through the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture chronologically, starting from the first award in 1928.\n3.  **Analyze Candidates**: For each film, I'll determine its setting. I will pay special attention to films set in or featuring scenes in Paris or Luxor.\n4.  **Verify On-Screen Depiction**: For the most likely candidates, I will verify if the obelisk in either Paris or Luxor is actually shown on-screen. The first film on the chronological list that meets this criterion is the answer.\n\n*   A review of early Best Picture winners shows many are set in the US or in war settings not specific to Paris or Luxor (e.g., *Wings*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *Gone with the Wind*).\n*   The film *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris, but a definitive on-screen depiction of the Place de la Concorde obelisk isn't a prominent feature of the film.\n*   The film ***An American in Paris*** **(1951)** is a very strong candidate. The film is a musical tribute to the city of Paris. During its famous 17-minute closing ballet sequence, it features lavish, stylized sets of various Parisian locations, including a clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde with its obelisk.\n*   Other later films set in Paris, like *Gigi* (1958), or films that travel through Egypt, like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956), also exist. However, since *An American in Paris* was released in 1951 and won the award for that year, it predates them.\n\nBased on this analysis, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk. The code below will print this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function encapsulates the research and finding for the film query.\n\n    The process involves:\n    1. Identifying the two Luxor Obelisks (one in Luxor, Egypt; one in Paris, France).\n    2. Chronologically reviewing the list of Best Picture Oscar winners.\n    3. Cross-referencing the films' settings and scenes with the obelisk locations.\n    4. Concluding that 'An American in Paris' (winner for 1951) is the first film\n       on the list to feature a depiction of the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_film_winner = \"An American in Paris\"\n    print(first_film_winner)\n\nfind_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
