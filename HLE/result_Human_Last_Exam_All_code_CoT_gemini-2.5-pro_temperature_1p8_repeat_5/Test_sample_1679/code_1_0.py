    This function encapsulates the research and finding for the film query.

    The process involves:
    1. Identifying the two Luxor Obelisks (one in Luxor, Egypt; one in Paris, France).
    2. Chronologically reviewing the list of Best Picture Oscar winners.
    3. Cross-referencing the films' settings and scenes with the obelisk locations.
    4. Concluding that 'An American in Paris' (winner for 1951) is the first film
       on the list to feature a depiction of the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.
