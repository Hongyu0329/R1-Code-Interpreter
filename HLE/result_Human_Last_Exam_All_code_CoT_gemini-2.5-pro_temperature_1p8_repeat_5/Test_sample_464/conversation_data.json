    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function. Here is a step-by-step explanation of why this is true, followed by a Python code that illustrates a related concept.\n\n### My plan\n\n1.  **State the Conclusion**: Directly answer the question with a \"Yes\".\n2.  **Theoretical Explanation**: I will walk through the mathematical proof.\n    *   I will introduce the Fourier transform of the function $f$, which we'll call $\\hat{f}$. Because $f$ is a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n    *   I will show that the moments of $f$ are directly related to the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin. Specifically, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) \\propto \\int x^k f(x) dx$.\n    *   Using the given condition that all moments are zero, I'll conclude that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are also zero.\n    *   I will then use a key property of Schwartz functions: if a Schwartz function and all its derivatives are zero at a single point, the function must be identically zero everywhere.\n    *   This implies that $\\hat{f}$ must be the zero function.\n    *   Finally, because the Fourier transform is invertible, if $\\hat{f}=0$, then the original function $f$ must also be zero.\n3.  **Code Illustration**: I will provide a Python script to demonstrate a related idea. Since we can't computationally \"prove\" the theorem, I will show that we can construct non-zero Schwartz functions that have any *finite* number of moments equal to zero. This helps build intuition for why having *all* moments equal to zero is such a strong and restrictive condition.\n    *   The code will use Hermite polynomials $H_n(x)$ to construct Schwartz functions $f_n(x) = H_n(x) e^{-x^2}$.\n    *   It is a known property that for this function $f_n(x)$, its moments $\\int x^k f_n(x) dx$ are zero for all non-negative integers $k < n$, but non-zero for $k=n$.\n    *   The script will choose a specific $n$ (e.g., $n=4$) and numerically compute its first few moments to verify this property.\n\n### Python Code for the Task\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nfrom scipy.special import hermite\n\ndef illustrate_moments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function illustrates that we can construct non-zero Schwartz functions\n    for which any finite number of moments are zero. This highlights how\n    strong the condition of *all* moments being zero is.\n\n    We use functions of the form f_n(x) = H_n(x) * exp(-x^2), where H_n(x)\n    is the n-th Hermite polynomial. These are Schwartz functions.\n\n    A known property of these functions is that the k-th moment,\n    integral(x^k * f_n(x) dx), is zero for all integers 0 <= k < n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let's choose n=4.
