    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant using the provided formula and data.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Weights (`w_i`)**: The weights of the ambient space are given as `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n2.  **Determine Degree (`d`)**: The degree of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface is determined by the weighted degree of the defining polynomial. A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. We will calculate the degree for each term of the polynomial `0 = z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3`:\n    *   `deg(z_1^8z_3) = 8*22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4*22 + 3*29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2^7) = 1*22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_2z_3^4) = 29 + 4*49 = 29 + 196 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_4^3z_5) = 3*50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225`\n    *   `deg(z_5^3) = 3*75 = 225`\n    Most terms have a degree of 225. The condition for the hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau is that the degree `d` equals the sum of the weights (`d = Σw_i`). Let's check the sum of weights: `22+29+49+50+75 = 225`. This matches the degree of most terms. It is highly likely that the second term contains a typo and the correct degree of the polynomial is `d = 225`.\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(X)` is given by the formula:\n    `cn(X) = (d² - Σw_i²) / (3d - Σw_i)`\n4.  **Calculate Components**:\n    *   `d = 225`\n    *   `Σw_i = 225`\n    *   `d² = 225² = 50625`\n    *   `Σw_i² = 22² + 29² + 49² + 50² + 75² = 484 + 841 + 2401 + 2500 + 5625 = 11851`\n5.  **Compute the Invariant**: We will substitute these values into the formula to find the final result.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the resulting equation and value.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # The degree of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial\n    # Based on the analysis, d = sum(weights) = 225\n    d = 225\n    \n    # Calculate d^2\n    d_sq = d**2\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of weights\n    sum_w = sum(weights)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the weights\n    sum_w_sq = sum(w**2 for w in weights)\n    \n    # Calculate the numerator and denominator of the invariant formula\n    numerator = d_sq - sum_w_sq\n    denominator = 3 * d - sum_w\n    \n    # The final invariant value\n    invariant = numerator / denominator\n\n    # --- Outputting the results as an equation ---\n    \n    # Create strings for the equation parts\n    weights_sq_str = \" + \".join([f\"{w}^2\" for w in weights])\n    weights_sq_val_str = \" + \".join([str(w**2) for w in weights])\n    weights_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n\n    print(f\"Crawley-Nordström Invariant Formula: cn(X) = (d^2 - \\u03A3w_i^2) / (3d - \\u03A3w_i)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Given values:\")\n    print(f\"d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"w = {weights}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the terms for the numerator\")\n    print(f\"d^2 = {d}^2 = {d_sq}\")\n    print(f\"\\u03A3w_i^2 = {weights_sq_str}\")\n    print(f\"      = {weights_sq_val_str}\")\n    print(f\"      = {sum_w_sq}\")\n    print(f\"Numerator = {d_sq} - {sum_w_sq} = {numerator}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the terms for the denominator\")\n    print(f\"3d = 3 * {d} = {3 * d}\")\n    print(f\"\\u03A3w_i = {weights_sum_str} = {sum_w}\")\n    print(f\"Denominator = {3 * d} - {sum_w} = {denominator}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Form the final equation and compute the result\")\n    # Using integer components for the final display\n    print(f\"cn(X) = ({d_sq} - {sum_w_sq}) / ({3 * d} - {sum_w})\")\n    print(f\"      = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"      \\u2248 {invariant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The final Crawley-Nordström invariant is {numerator}/{denominator}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom()\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = 38774 / 450\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
