    Solves the topology problem regarding the number of homeomorphism classes.

    The problem describes a compact topological space X with the following properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    These two properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-ÄŒech compactification
    of the long ray, denoted as beta R.

    In the context of topology and functional analysis, it is standard to assume
    that a "compact space" is also a "Hausdorff space". Under this assumption, the
    properties uniquely identify X up to homeomorphism.

    The argument is as follows:
    - The given properties mean that the algebra of continuous functions on X, C(X),
      is isomorphic to the algebra of bounded continuous functions on R, C_b(R).
    - By definition, C_b(R) is isomorphic to C(beta R).
    - Therefore, C(X) is isomorphic to C(beta R).
    - The Gelfand-Naimark theorem states that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic
      if and only if their algebras of continuous functions are isomorphic.
    - Since X and beta R are both compact Hausdorff spaces with isomorphic function algebras,
      they must be homeomorphic.

    Thus, any space X satisfying the given conditions is homeomorphic to beta R.
    This means all such spaces fall into a single homeomorphism class.
