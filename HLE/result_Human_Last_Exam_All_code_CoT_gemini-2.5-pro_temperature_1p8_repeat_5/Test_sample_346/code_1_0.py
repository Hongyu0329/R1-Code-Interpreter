    # Step 1: Analyze the fundamental combinators and what they represent.
    # The combinator S(S(K(S))(K)) is a form of the B combinator. For Church
    # numerals, the B combinator is the multiplication operator. For numerals
    # m and n, B(m)(n) results in the numeral for m*n.
    # Let's define this operation in Python.
    def mult(m, n):
        return m * n

    # The I combinator represents the Church numeral for 1.
    c1 = 1
    # The S(I)(I) combinator represents the Church numeral for 2.
    c2 = 2

    # Step 2: Analyze the operators derived from the expression.
    # The expression contains `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`, which translates to B(c1) or B(1).
    # This is a function that multiplies its argument by 1.
    mult_by_1 = lambda k: mult(c1, k)

    # The expression also contains `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`, which is B(c2).

    # Step 3: Understand the structure and evaluate the integer n.
    # The full expression S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B) where A is B(1) and B is B(2)
    # reduces to a composition of these multiplication operators. The structure
    # represents applying the mult_by_2 operator three times, starting with the
    # mult_by_1 operator.
    # The result is an operator that multiplies a given number by 2*2*2*1 = 8.
    
    # The problem states the expression *is* a Church integer n. This means
    # this final operator is applied to a default Church numeral, which is C‚ÇÅ = 1.
