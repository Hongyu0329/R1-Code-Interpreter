    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: I will break down the complex SKI expression into its fundamental components. This involves identifying well-known combinators and their roles.\n    *   The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a representation of the `B` combinator. In the context of Church numerals, the `B` combinator acts as the multiplication operator.\n    *   The `I` combinator represents the Church numeral for 1 (`C₁`).\n    *   The `S(I)(I)` combinator represents the Church numeral for 2 (`C₂`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure**: I will analyze the overall structure of the expression, which is of the form `S(I)(A)(B)`. By applying the reduction rules of SKI calculus (`S f g x => f x (g x)`), I will determine how these components interact. The expression defines a nested application of operators.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Operations**: The structure reveals a series of composed operations. Specifically, it composes the \"multiply by 2\" operator on itself three times, using the \"multiply by 1\" operator as a starting point. This results in a new operator which effectively multiplies a given Church numeral by 8.\n\n4.  **Determine the Integer `n`**: The problem states that the entire expression *is* a Church integer `n`. This implies that the resulting operator (`multiply by 8`) must be applied to a base numeral to yield the final value. In Church encoding, the default base numeral is `C₁` (the number 1). Therefore, `n` is the result of this operator applied to 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: After finding the value of `n`, I will calculate `log₂(n)` as requested.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps, showing the calculation of `n` and then computing its base-2 logarithm. The script will also print the final equation used to calculate `n`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_church_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for log_2(n) where n is the given SKI expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the fundamental combinators and what they represent.\n    # The combinator S(S(K(S))(K)) is a form of the B combinator.
