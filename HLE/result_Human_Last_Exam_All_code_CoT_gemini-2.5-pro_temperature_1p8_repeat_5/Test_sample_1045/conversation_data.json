    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule using the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom type:** We need to understand what the 6-31G notation means for each atom.\n    *   **For Carbon (C)**, a second-row heavy atom: The orbitals are the core 1s and valence 2s and 2p.\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split into two parts (a \"split-valence\" basis set). The '3' represents the inner valence and the '1' represents the outer valence.\n        *   The inner valence (2s', 2p') is described by one s-type function and a set of p-type functions (px, py, pz), totaling 1+3 = 4 functions.\n        *   The outer valence (2s'', 2p'') is also described by one s-type function and a set of p-type functions, totaling 1+3 = 4 functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H)**: It only has a 1s valence orbital and no core electrons.\n        *   The 1s orbital is split into two parts, described by the '3' and '1'.\n        *   The inner part is 1 contracted s-function.\n        *   The outer part is 1 contracted s-function.\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = **2 contracted functions**.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For a second-row atom like Carbon: 1 core function + 2 sets of valence (s+p) functions = 1 + (1+3) + (1+3) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For a Hydrogen atom: 2 sets of valence (s) functions = 1 + 1 = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_funcs_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\ntotal_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final breakdown and the equation\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms})\")\nprint(\"Basis Set: 6-31G\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom: {funcs_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom: {funcs_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} funcs/atom) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} funcs/atom) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"So, the final equation is: {total_funcs_carbon} + {total_funcs_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
