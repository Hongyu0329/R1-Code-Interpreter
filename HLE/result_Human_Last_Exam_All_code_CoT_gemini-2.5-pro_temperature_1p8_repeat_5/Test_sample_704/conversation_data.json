    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The core task is to identify the musical note(s) associated with a specific range of colors on Isaac Newton's color circle.\n2.  **Identify the Colors:**\n    *   The first color is described as \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue.\" In subtractive color mixing (like with pigments), combining yellow and blue produces **Green**.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as **Blue**.\n3.  **Define Newton's Color-Music Analogy:** I will research or recall Isaac Newton's mapping of the seven spectral colors to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. The standard mapping is:\n    *   Red → C (Do)\n    *   Orange → D (Re)\n    *   Yellow → E (Mi)\n    *   Green → F (Fa)\n    *   Blue → G (Sol)\n    *   Indigo → A (La)\n    *   Violet → B (Si)\n4.  **Find the Corresponding Notes:** Based on the mapping, I will find the notes that correspond to the identified colors:\n    *   Green corresponds to the musical note **F**.\n    *   Blue corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores Newton's color-to-note mapping in a dictionary.\n    *   Identifies the two colors from the problem.\n    *   Retrieves the corresponding notes from the dictionary.\n    *   Prints a clear explanation of the process and the resulting notes.\n\n```python\ndef find_newton_notes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the musical notes corresponding to a color range on Newton's circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of the seven spectral colors\n    # to the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale.\n    newton_color_music_map = {\n        'Red': 'C',\n        'Orange': 'D',\n        'Yellow': 'E',\n        'Green': 'F',\n        'Blue': 'G',\n        'Indigo': 'A',\n        'Violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the problem description.\n    # The first color is the result of combining yellow and blue.\n    color1 = \"Green\"\n    # The second color is blue.\n    color2 = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes for these colors.\n    note1 = newton_color_music_map[color1]\n    note2 = newton_color_music_map[color2]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final result.\n    print(\"This solution is based on Isaac Newton's color circle, which maps the colors of the spectrum to musical notes.\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we identify the colors in the specified range:\")\n    print(f\"1. The color from combining yellow and blue is: {color1}\")\n    print(f\"2.
