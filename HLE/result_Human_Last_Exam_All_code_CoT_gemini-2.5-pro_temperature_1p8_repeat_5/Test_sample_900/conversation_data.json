    "As an AI, I am unable to watch a video and count the dance moves. This task requires visual analysis of the specific performance, which is beyond my current capabilities. Furthermore, \"pas de Balanchine\" refers to a characteristic style of movement developed by choreographer George Balanchine, rather than a single, discrete, and countable step. Therefore, it's not possible to programmatically provide an exact count.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that represents this situation. The script will set the count to 0, acknowledging that no instances can be verified programmatically, and then display this result in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\ndef count_dance_moves_in_video(move_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a video to count specific dance moves.\n\n    This is a placeholder function. As an AI, I cannot access external websites,\n    watch videos, or perform visual analysis. The choreography for this piece\n    is not available as a data source I can parse.\n\n    Furthermore, 'pas de Balanchine' is a stylistic quality, not a standard,\n    countable dance step, making a numerical count subjective and likely impossible.\n\n    Therefore, the verifiable count is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Attempting to analyze video for instances of '{move_name}'...\")\n    print(\"Error: Visual analysis of video content is not possible.\")\n    \n    # The number of moves that can be verified programmatically is 0.\n    verified_count = 0\n    return verified_count\n\n# The user is asking to count 'pas de Balanchines'\ndance_move_to_count = \"pas de Balanchines\"\nsvetlana_gileva_performance_count = count_dance_moves_in_video(dance_move_to_count)\n\n# The user requested the result be shown as an equation.\n# Since we could not verify any instances, the equation is 0 = 0.\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"Total count = {svetlana_gileva_performance_count}\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{svetlana_gileva_performance_count} = {svetlana_gileva_performance_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
