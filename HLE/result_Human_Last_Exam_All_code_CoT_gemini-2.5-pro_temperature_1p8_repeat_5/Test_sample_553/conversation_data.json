    "This is a great music theory question! To solve this, I need to correctly interpret the phrase \"minor fifth chord\" and then recall or search for Beatles songs with distinctive opening chord progressions.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The \"tonic\" is the root chord of the song's key, often represented by the Roman numeral 'I'. A \"minor fifth chord\" means a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, represented by 'v' (a lowercase Roman numeral signifies a minor chord). So, if a song is in the key of C major, the tonic (I) is C major, and the minor fifth chord (v) would be G minor.\n2.  **Identify the Song:** I will look for a Beatles song that starts with this I -> v progression. The song that famously uses this exact change in its opening is \"From Me to You\".\n3.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will formally state the answer, including the song, its key, the chords in the progression, and the Roman numeral analysis (I -> v), which fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song that starts with a jump\n    from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"From Me to You\"\n    artist = \"The Beatles\"\n    key = \"C Major\"\n    \n    # The chord progression analysis\n    tonic_chord_numeral = \"I\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"C Major\"\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord_numeral = \"v7\" # The 'v' is the 'number' for the fifth degree, lowercase for minor. The 7th is often included.\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"G minor 7th\"\n\n    print(f\"The song you're looking for is '{song_title}' by {artist}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(\"The opening chord progression is a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown of that progression:\")\n    print(f\"Tonic Chord ({tonic_chord_numeral}): {tonic_chord_name}\")\n    print(f\"Minor Fifth Chord ({minor_fifth_chord_numeral}): {minor_fifth_chord_name}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation (Harmonic Analysis):\")\n    print(f\"{tonic_chord_numeral} -> {minor_fifth_chord_numeral}\")\n    print(f\"{tonic_chord_name} -> {minor_fifth_chord_name}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n\n```\n<<<From Me to You>>>"
