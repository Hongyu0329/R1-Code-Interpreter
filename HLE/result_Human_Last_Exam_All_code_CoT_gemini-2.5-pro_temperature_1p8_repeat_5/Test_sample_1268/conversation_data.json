    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying principles from the geometry of numbers, specifically focusing on real quadratic number fields, which are directly related to squarefree natural numbers.\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Context**: The problem involves squarefree natural numbers $(N)$, a covolume $(V)$, and a \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$. This setup points towards the study of lattices derived from the rings of integers of real quadratic fields, i.e., fields of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n2.  **Define the Terms**:\n    *   For a field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, we can embed its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ into the real plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. An element $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ is mapped to a point $(\\alpha, \\sigma(\\alpha))$, where $\\sigma$ is the conjugation map. This set of points forms a lattice.\n    *   The **covolume ($V$)** is the area of the fundamental domain of this lattice. It is known to be equal to $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field.\n    *   The **maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)** can be interpreted as the infinity norm of an embedded element, i.e., $\\max(|\\alpha|, |\\sigma(\\alpha)|)$. The question asks for an upper bound on the smallest possible non-zero value of this norm in the lattice.\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem**: Minkowski's convex body theorem is the perfect tool for this. It states that for a lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and a symmetric convex body $C$, if the volume of $C$ is large enough, it must contain a non-zero lattice point. In our case, $n=2$.\n4.  **Derive the Bound**: I will choose a square centered at the origin, $C_t = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |x| \\le t, |y| \\le t\\}$, as our convex body. Its area is $(2t)^2 = 4t^2$.\n    *   Minkowski's theorem guarantees a non-zero lattice point in $C_t$ if its area is at least $2^2 \\cdot V = 4V$.\n    *   Setting $4t^2 = 4V$ gives $t = \\sqrt{V}$.\n    *   This means there exists a non-zero integer $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ such that its embedding $(\\alpha, \\sigma(\\alpha))$ lies within the square $C_{\\sqrt{V}}$. This implies $|\\alpha| \\le \\sqrt{V}$ and $|\\sigma(\\alpha)| \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum norm for this element is bounded: $\\max(|\\alpha|, |\\sigma(\\alpha)|) \\le \\sqrt{V}$. This provides the upper bound relationship: $k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n5.  **Construct Python Code**: The code will define the numerical constants of this inequality and use them to print the final formula, explicitly showing all numbers as requested.\n\n```python\n# The upper bound for the maximum norm (k_k,∞) in relation to the covolume (V)\n# for lattices associated with squarefree natural numbers is derived from\n# Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies.\n# The relationship is given by the inequality: k_{k,∞} ≤ √V.\n\n# The code below will print this equation, showing each numerical component.\n\n# Numerical components of the equation: 1 * k_{k,∞} <= 1 * V**0.5\ncoeff_k = 1\ncoeff_v = 1\nexp_v = 0.5\n\n# Symbols for the terms in the equation. Using unicode for the infinity symbol.\nk_term = \"k_{k,∞}\"\nv_term = \"V\"\nrelation = \"<=\"\n\n# Print the equation with all numerical components visible.\n# This satisfies the requirement to output each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The derived inequality is:\")\nprint(f\"{coeff_k} * {k_term} {relation} {coeff_v} * {v_term}**{exp_v}\")\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
