    "To determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, we need to consult a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening range for a 100BB cash game. Here is the step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Positional Advantage:** The button is the most profitable position in poker. You act last on all post-flop streets, which gives you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n2.  **Rake-Free Environment:** The absence of rake slightly increases the profitability of all hands, especially marginal ones. This encourages opening an even wider range than in a standard raked game.\n3.  **GTO Ranges:** Modern GTO solvers have calculated equilibrium strategies for these scenarios. For a 100BB cash game, a button opening range is typically 45-50% of all hands.\n4.  **Suited Jacks (Jxs):** This category of hands (JTs, J9s, J8s...J2s) has good playability. They can make strong flushes, and the connected ones can make straights. They also carry high-card value. Because of these factors, GTO strategy dictates opening all of them from the button.\n5.  **Identifying the \"Worst\":** The \"worst\" hand in a profitable range is the one with the lowest expected value (EV). When ranking suited Jacks, the strength generally decreases as the kicker gets lower. JTs is the strongest, and J2s is the weakest due to its low kicker and minimal connectivity. Although J2s has the lowest EV of all suited Jacks, it is still a profitable open-raise from the button in this game format.\n\nThe following Python code identifies and prints the worst suited jack from the standard GTO opening range.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    In a 100BB rake-free cash game, Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy advises\n    opening a very wide range of hands from the button due to the positional advantage.\n    \n    This range includes all suited Jacks, which are ranked as follows from best to worst:\n    JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    \n    The \"worst\" hand in this category is the one with the lowest kicker that is still\n    considered a standard, profitable open.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of all suited Jacks that are a profitable open from the button.\n    suited_jacks_range = ['JTs', 'J9s', 'J8s', 'J7s', 'J6s', 'J5s', 'J4s', 'J3s', 'J2s']\n    \n    # The last hand in the ranked list is the one with the lowest equity.\n    worst_suited_jack = suited_jacks_range[-1]\n    \n    print(worst_suited_jack)\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
