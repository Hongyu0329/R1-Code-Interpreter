def solve_photochemical_synthesis_query():
    """
    Analyzes a list of taxa to identify those that perform photochemical synthesis.

    Photochemical synthesis is the use of light energy to synthesize a compound.
    This includes:
    - Oxygenic photosynthesis (plants, algae, cyanobacteria)
    - Anoxygenic photosynthesis (e.g., purple/green sulfur bacteria)
    - Other light-driven synthesis (e.g., Vitamin D synthesis, bacteriorhodopsin proton pumps)

    The analysis ignores symbiotic relationships as per the prompt.
