    "Here is my plan to answer the user's question.\n1.  First, I need to identify the specific 1905 paper being referenced. This is Einstein's paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n2.  Next, I will research the citations and influences of this paper. While Einstein famously developed much of his work independently, his work in statistical mechanics was built upon the foundations laid by others.\n3.  My research indicates that the theoretical framework for the paper comes from the principles of statistical mechanics, which were largely developed by Ludwig Boltzmann.\n4.  Specifically, Einstein's understanding and application of these principles were heavily influenced by Boltzmann's published work, including his \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\").\n5.  I will now write a simple Python script to print the name of the scientist whose lectures were the key influence.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose lectures\n    were a foundational influence on Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    print(f\"Albert Einstein's work on statistical mechanics, which was the basis for his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, was heavily influenced by the work and published lectures of: {scientist_name}\")\n\nfind_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
