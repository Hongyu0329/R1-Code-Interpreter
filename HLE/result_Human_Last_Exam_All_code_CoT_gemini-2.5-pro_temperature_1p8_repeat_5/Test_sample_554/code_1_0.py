# 1. Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a representative nanocar.
# We choose a well-known structure: a C30H20 chassis with four C60 fullerene wheels.
hydrogens_in_chassis = 20
hydrogens_in_wheels = 0 # C60 fullerene wheels are pure carbon and have no hydrogen atoms.

# 2. Calculate the total number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule.
# This total will be equal to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.
total_fluorine_atoms = hydrogens_in_chassis + hydrogens_in_wheels

# 3. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.
# The term "perfluoro" means all hydrogens are replaced by fluorines.
