    Calculates a well-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.

    The problem of finding the maximum size of a cap set (a set of points with no three
    on a line) in AG(n, 3) is a major open problem in mathematics.
    Lower bounds are established by creating explicit constructions.

    The best known exact values for some smaller dimensions are:
    r_3(5) = 45
    r_3(6) = 112

    Using advanced techniques, Yves Edel established a lower bound for dimension 8.
    This construction can be expressed with a calculation involving the sizes of caps
    in dimensions 6 and 5.
