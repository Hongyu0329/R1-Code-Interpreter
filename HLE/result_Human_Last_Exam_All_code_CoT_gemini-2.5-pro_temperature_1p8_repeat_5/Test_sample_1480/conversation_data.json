    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we apply a t-norm operation to the firing level of the rule's antecedent and the membership grade of the consequent. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` as 0.7.\n2.  Define the consequent membership grade `μG_k_j(y_j)` as 0.9.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm, which calculates the minimum of these two values.\n4.  The result will be the rule activation level.\n5.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values for the fuzzy set parameters\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a fuzzy logic operator for intersection (AND).\n# The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum function.\n# We calculate the rule activation level by taking the minimum\n# of the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership grade.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm operation.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j})\")\nprint(f\"Result = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
