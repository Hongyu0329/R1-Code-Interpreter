    "My approach to solving this problem involves a systematic analysis of the provided molecular formula and spectroscopic data.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C7H14):** I will first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to determine if the compound contains rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   I will examine the chemical shifts (e.g., 145 ppm, 112 ppm) to identify the types of carbon environments, specifically looking for signals in the alkene region.\n    *   I will use the multiplicity data (s, t, d, q) provided for each signal to determine the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon (s = C, t = CH₂, d = CH, q = CH₃).\n    *   I will compare the number of signals (6) to the number of carbons in the formula (7) to deduce if any carbons are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n3.  **Identify and Assemble Structural Fragments:** Based on the analysis, I will identify key structural pieces (like a terminal alkene, an ethyl group, an isopropyl group). Then, I will assemble these fragments into a coherent structure that is consistent with all the data.\n4.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Finally, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to the deduced structure to find its official name. This involves finding the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (the double bond) and naming the substituents correctly.\n\nThis step-by-step process ensures all pieces of information are used to logically arrive at the correct structure and name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a hydrocarbon from its molecular formula and 13C NMR spectrum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Provided Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's (singlet, quaternary C)',\n        112: 't (triplet, CH2)',\n        48: 't (triplet, CH2)',\n        27: 'd (doublet, CH)',\n        22: 'q (quartet, CH3)',\n        21: 'q (quartet, CH3)'\n    }\n\n    print(\"### Step-by-Step Analysis ###\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n    print(\"1.
