    Calculates and explains the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry from K_L decay.

    The charge asymmetry in the semileptonic decay of the long-lived neutral kaon (K_L)
    is a well-measured phenomenon that demonstrates CP violation. It is defined by
    the parameter delta_L.

    delta_L = [Gamma(K_L -> l+ nu) - Gamma(K_L -> l- anti-nu)]
              -------------------------------------------------
              [Gamma(K_L -> l+ nu) + Gamma(K_L -> l- anti-nu)]

    where 'l+' is a positron (e+) or positive muon (mu+), and 'nu' is the corresponding
    neutrino. The first process produces matter (neutrinos), while the second
    produces antimatter (antineutrinos).

    A non-zero delta_L means the rates are different, which generates an asymmetry.

    # to the rate that produces antineutrinos (rate_antinu).
