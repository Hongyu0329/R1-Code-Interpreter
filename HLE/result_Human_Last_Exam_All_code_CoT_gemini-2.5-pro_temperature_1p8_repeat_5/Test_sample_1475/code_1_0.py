    # The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of G, where G is a
    # countable intersection of open dense subsets of a specific space P(X).
    # G = O_1 \cap O_2 \cap O_3 \cap ... where O_n are open and dense in P(X).

    # Step 1: Analyze the space P(X).
    # X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point (e.g., [0,1]).
    # 2^X is the space of non-empty closed subsets of X with the Hausdorff metric.
    # P(X) is the subspace of 2^X consisting of sets of the form {x_1, x_2, ...} U {x},
    # where the sequence x_n converges non-trivially to x.

    # Step 2: Establish the topological properties of P(X).
    # Property A: P(X) is a completely metrizable space.
    # The space 2^X is a complete metric space. The properties defining elements of
    # P(X) (specifically, having exactly one limit point and being infinite) define
    # a G_delta subset of 2^X. A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is
    # completely metrizable. A completely metrizable space is a Baire space, meaning
    # the Baire Category Theorem applies.

    # Property B: P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points).
    # Given any set A = {x_n} U {x} in P(X), one can always construct another
    # set B in P(X) arbitrarily close to A. This is possible because X is
    # connected and not a single point, allowing for small perturbations of the points
    # in A to form a new convergent sequence.

    # Step 3: Apply Baire Category Theorem.
    # Since P(X) is a Baire space, the intersection G is a dense subset of P(X).
    # Because G is a countable intersection of open sets, G is also a G_delta set.

    # Step 4: Determine the cardinality of G.
    # We have established that G is a dense G_delta subset of P(X), and P(X) is a
    # non-empty, perfect, completely metrizable space.
    # A classical theorem of topology states that any such set (a dense G_delta
    # subset of a non-empty perfect Polish space) must have the cardinality of the
    # continuum.

    # The cardinality of the continuum is denoted by 'c' or 2^{\aleph_0}.
    cardinality_symbol = "2^{\aleph_0}"
    
    # This result holds for any space X meeting the criteria, so the cardinality
    # is always the same. Thus, the "smallest possible" cardinality is this value.

    print("The smallest possible cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print(f"The mathematical expression for this cardinality is {cardinality_symbol}.")

    # The prompt requests that any number in the final equation be printed.
    # The final equation for the cardinality is C = 2^{\aleph_0}.
    # The number in this equation is 2.
    final_equation_number = 2
    print("\nThe number present in the final expression for the cardinality is:")
