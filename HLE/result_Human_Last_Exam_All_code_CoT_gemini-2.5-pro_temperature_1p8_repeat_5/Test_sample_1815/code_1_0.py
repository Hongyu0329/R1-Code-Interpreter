# The problem is a mathematical deduction about the properties of topological groups.
# Based on the logical steps above, we can determine the number of such topologies.

# Let N_H be the number of Hausdorff topologies that fit the criteria.
# Our reasoning showed that the only Hausdorff topology with no nontrivial convergent
# sequences is the discrete topology, which is not totally bounded.
N_H = 0

# Let N_NH be the number of non-Hausdorff topologies that fit the criteria.
# Our reasoning showed that all such topologies are totally bounded, but they all
# possess nontrivial convergent sequences.
N_NH = 0

# The total number of such topologies is the sum of the two cases.
total = N_H + N_NH

# Final Answer Calculation
print(f"Number of Hausdorff solutions: {N_H}")
print(f"Number of non-Hausdorff solutions: {N_NH}")
print(f"Total number of solutions: {N_H} + {N_NH} = {total}")

# The final answer is the total number.
print("\nThe final answer is:")
print(total)
