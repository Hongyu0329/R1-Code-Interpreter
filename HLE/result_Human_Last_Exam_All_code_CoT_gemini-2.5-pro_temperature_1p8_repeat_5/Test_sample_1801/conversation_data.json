    "This is a historical trivia question. My plan is to identify the two Nobel laureates from historical records of the Enron \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign from the year 2000. I will then present their names using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_enron_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    who were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the\n    tagline \"Ask Why\".\n    \"\"\"\n    laureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"  # Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2008\n    laureate_2 = \"Merton Miller\" # Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 1990\n\n    print(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate_2}\")\n\nfind_enron_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
