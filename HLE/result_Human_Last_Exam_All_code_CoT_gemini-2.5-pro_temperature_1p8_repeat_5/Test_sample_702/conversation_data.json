    "To determine the connectivity of the map, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map.** The spaces are the suspended smash product of two loop spaces, `Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`, and the loop space of a smash product, `Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. We simplify `S⁴ ∧ S⁶` to its homotopy equivalent form, `S¹⁰`. The map `f: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → ΩS¹⁰` is identified as the adjoint of the canonical commutator map.\n2.  **Relate the connectivity of the map to its adjoint.** The connectivity of a map `f = adj(c)` is `1 + conn(c)`. Thus, our goal shifts to finding the connectivity of the adjoint map `c: ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶ → ΩS¹⁰`.\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain of `c`.** We will use standard results about the connectivity of loop spaces and smash products.\n4.  **Apply the definition of map connectivity.** A map `g: A → B` is `k`-connected if `πᵢ(g)` is an isomorphism for `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`. We will check this condition for `c` for increasing values of `i`.\n5.  **Calculate the final connectivity.** Using the result for `c`, we'll find the connectivity of the original map `f`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the map \n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    The steps are explained through print statements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map.\")\n    print(\"The map is f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    print(\"The smash product of spheres S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^{4+6} = S^{10}.\")\n    print(\"So, the target space Omega(S^4 wedge S^6) is homotopy equivalent to Omega S^{10}.\")\n    print(\"The map f can be identified as the adjoint of the commutator map c.\")\n    print(\"So, f = adj(c), where c: (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega S^{10}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Relate the connectivity of f and c.\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of a map and its adjoint are related by conn(f) = conn(adj(c)) = conn(c) + 1.\")\n    print(\"Our task is to find the connectivity of the map c.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Define connectivity and analyze the spaces for the map c: A -> B.\")\n    print(\"Let A = Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6 and B = Omega S^{10}.\")\n    print(\"A map is k-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups pi_i for i < k and a surjection for i = k.\")\n    \n    # Connectivity of A\n    conn_omega_s4 = 4 - 2\n    print(f\"\\nThe connectivity of Omega S^n is n-2.
