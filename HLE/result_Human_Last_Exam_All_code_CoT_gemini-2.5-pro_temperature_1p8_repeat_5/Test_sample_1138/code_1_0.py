    Statement A says: For ECDSA, an adversary can create a new signature 'sig'' with no more than negligible probability.

    This statement is false. Due to ECDSA's malleability, an adversary given a valid signature (sig) can create a new, different signature (sig') for the same message with a probability of 1 (which is non-negligible). This is a known property and a form of existential forgery.

    Statement B says: For ECDSA, an adversary can recover the secret key 'sk' with no more than negligible probability.

    This statement is true. The entire security of ECDSA relies on the computational difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). If an adversary could recover the secret key from public information, the scheme would be completely broken. A scheme can have a weakness like malleability without its fundamental key security being compromised.

    Statement C says: For some existentially forgeable schemes, an adversary given only 'm' and 'pk' can generate a valid signature.

    This statement is true. It describes a 'universal forgery' attack. A scheme vulnerable to this is, by definition, existentially forgeable. We only need one example. Consider textbook RSA (without proper padding): a signature 's' for a message 'm' is s = m^d mod N. For the message m=1, the signature is always s=1, since 1^d = 1. An adversary can produce the valid pair (m=1, sig=1) knowing only the public key. Thus, such a scheme exists.

    Statement D says: For ALL existentially forgeable schemes, an adversary cannot figure out 'm' from 'sig' and 'pk'.

    This statement is false. The purpose of a signature is authentication, not confidentiality. In many schemes ('signature with appendix' like ECDSA), the message is required for verification and is sent separately. Furthermore, we can easily find a counterexample. A trivial scheme where the signature is the message itself (sig = m) is existentially forgeable, but message recovery is also trivial. The 'For all' claim makes this statement false.
