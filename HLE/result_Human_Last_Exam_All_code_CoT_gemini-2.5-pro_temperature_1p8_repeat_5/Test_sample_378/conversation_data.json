    "This question is based on a misunderstanding of the former Nigerian President's name. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan did not publicly identify himself as \"Azikiwe\" in a specific year; \"Azikiwe\" has been his third given name since birth. He is commonly known as Goodluck Jonathan, but his full name has always included Azikiwe.\n\nTherefore, there is no specific year to find. The following Python code prints a clear explanation of this fact.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_fact():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the factual basis of Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The question of which year Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' \"\n        \"is based on a false premise.\\n\"\n        \"'Azikiwe' has been part of his full name since birth. \"\n        \"There was no specific event or year where he began to publicly identify with it separately.\\n\"\n        \"It is his third given name, not a name he adopted later in life.\"\n    )\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_fact()\n```\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan has always had \"Azikiwe\" as part of his full name since birth; there was no specific year he started to publicly identify with it.>>>"
