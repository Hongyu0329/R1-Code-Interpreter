# The user wants to identify which strategy does not help mitigate the identifiability issue
# of time-varying birth-death models on phylogenies of extant species.

# Let's review the options:
# A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This simplifies the model (regularization), which is a valid strategy to make an ill-posed problem more stable. It helps.
# B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: This adds external information, which is a key way to solve identifiability. It helps.
# C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This makes the model extremely complex and flexible. Increasing complexity for an already unidentifiable model makes the problem worse, not better. It is the opposite of regularization. It does NOT help.
# D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors: Fossils provide direct data on extinction, which is the information missing from extant-only trees. This is a very effective way to break non-identifiability. It helps.
# E. Reparametrizing to infer the pulled diversification rate: The pulled diversification rate (net diversification, λ-μ) is itself non-identifiable from extant timetrees (Louca & Pennell, 2020). So this strategy is futile. It does NOT help.
# F. Incorporating fossils tips: As with D, adding fossil data helps.
# G. Reparametrizing to infer the pulled speciation rate: The pulled speciation rate (λp) is identifiable from extant timetrees (Louca & Pennell, 2020). This is a correct mitigation strategy. It helps.

# Comparing C and E: Both do not help. However, E is a futile strategy (trying to estimate a non-identifiable quantity). C is an actively harmful strategy (making an unidentifiable model even more complex and harder to fit). Making a model more complex is the opposite of what one should do to mitigate identifiability. It is arguably the strategy that is most "not helpful". In the face of non-identifiability, one should simplify/regularize, add data, or add prior information, not increase the model's complexity. Therefore, C is the best answer.
