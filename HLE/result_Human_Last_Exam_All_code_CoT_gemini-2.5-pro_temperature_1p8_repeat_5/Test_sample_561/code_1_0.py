# Step 1: Define the parameters of the fractal based on the problem description.

# N is the number of self-similar copies.
# The structure is replicated on each of the 5 black keys in an octave.
N = 5

# s_x is the scaling factor in the x-direction (width).
# The original keyboard's width (3 units) is scaled down to the width of a black key (3/14 units).
s_x_num = 3
s_x_den = 14
s_x_keyboard_width = 3
s_x = (s_x_num / s_x_den) / s_x_keyboard_width

# s_y is the scaling factor in the y-direction (height).
# The original keyboard's height (1 unit) is scaled down to the height of a black key (9/14 units).
s_y_num = 9
s_y_den = 14
s_y_keyboard_height = 1
s_y = (s_y_num / s_y_den) / s_y_keyboard_height


# Step 2: Use the formula for the dimension of a self-affine fractal.
# The formula is D = log(N) / log(1/s_eff), where s_eff is the effective scaling factor.
# s_eff is the geometric mean of s_x and s_y: s_eff = sqrt(s_x * s_y).
# The reciprocal of s_eff, 1/s_eff, is what we use in the denominator.
# 1/s_eff = 1 / sqrt((1/14) * (9/14)) = 1 / sqrt(9/196) = 1 / (3/14) = 14/3.

s_eff_inv_num = 14
s_eff_inv_den = 3
s_eff_inv = s_eff_inv_num / s_eff_inv_den

# Step 3: Calculate the dimension.
dimension = math.log(N) / math.log(s_eff_inv)


# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.
