# The reasoning for the solution is as follows:
# The equation F = U_{d in D} (F+d)/4 defines a self-similar set.
# The set F is a closed subset of the unit square, hence it is compact.
# The operator T(S) = U_{d in D} (S+d)/4 is a contraction mapping on the space of compact subsets.
# There are two possible sets F that satisfy the equation F = T(F):
# 1. The empty set F = {}.
#    For the empty set, the number of components of any type is 0.
#
# 2. The unique non-empty attractor A of the IFS.
#    This attractor can be shown to be the set A = C x [0,1], where C is a Cantor set.
#    The connected components of A are vertical lines {c} x [0,1] for each point c in the Cantor set C.
#    Each of these components is a line segment, which is non-degenerate and locally connected.
#    The number of points in a Cantor set is uncountably infinite.
#    So, for F=A, there is an infinite number of such components.
#
# The question asks for the "smallest possible number". We must choose the minimum of the counts from the possible sets F.
# Comparing the two cases, min(0, infinity) = 0.
# Therefore, the smallest possible number of such components is 0.
