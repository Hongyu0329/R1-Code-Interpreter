    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). This is a strong, sterically bulky base.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly indicates an **E2 (elimination, bimolecular) reaction**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Requirements for E2 Reaction in Cyclohexanes:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry called *anti-periplanar*.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group (the bromine atom) and the proton being removed must be on adjacent carbons and in a **trans-diaxial** orientation (both must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate's Conformation:**\n    *   The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S, 2R) configuration means the bromo and methyl groups are *trans* to each other.\n    *   There are two possible chair conformations for a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane: one where both groups are axial (ax, ax) and one where both are equatorial (eq, eq). However, we must consider the specific (1S, 2R) stereoisomer.\n    *   Drawing the chair conformation reveals that for the (1S, 2R) isomer, the most stable conformation has the **bromine atom in the axial position** and the **methyl group in the equatorial position**.\n    *   This is perfect for an E2 reaction, as the leaving group (Br) is already in the required axial position in the molecule's most stable state.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways:**\n    *   Since the Br on Carbon-1 (C1) is axial, the base must remove an axial proton from an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   **Pathway A (Zaitsev elimination):** Look at Carbon-2 (C2). It has an equatorial methyl group, which means its hydrogen is **axial**. Removing this axial proton from C2 would form a double bond between C1 and C2. The product would be **1-methylcyclohexene**, which is a tri-substituted (more stable) alkene. This is the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Pathway B (Hofmann elimination):** Look at Carbon-6 (C6). It has two hydrogens, one of which is **axial**. Removing this axial proton from C6 would form a double bond between C1 and C6. The product would be **3-methylcyclohexene**, which is a di-substituted (less stable) alkene. This is the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product is determined by the steric bulk of the base.\n    *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a very **bulky base**.\n    *   The axial proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the nearby equatorial methyl group.\n    *   The axial proton on C6 is much more sterically accessible.\n    *   The bulky base will preferentially attack the less hindered proton on C6.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The major product of the reaction is the Hofmann product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium\n    tert-butoxide and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the reaction type.\")\n    print(\"The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.\")\n    print(\"This indicates an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Considering the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction.\")\n    print(\"E2 reactions on cyclohexane rings require the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted proton (H) to be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) arrangement.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the substrate conformation.\")\n    print(\"The most stable conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane has the bromine atom in an axial position and the methyl group in an equatorial position.\")\n    print(\"This conformation already satisfies the requirement for the leaving group to be axial.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Identifying possible elimination pathways and products.\")\n    print(\"With an axial Br on C1, the base can remove an axial proton from two adjacent carbons:\")\n    print(\"  a) From C2: Removing the axial H on C2 leads to the Zaitsev product: 1-methylcyclohexene (a more substituted alkene).\")\n    print(\"  b) From C6: Removing the axial H on C6 leads to the Hofmann product: 3-methylcyclohexene (a less substituted alkene).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Determining the major product based on the reagent.\")\n    print(\"Potassium tert-butoxide is a sterically bulky base.\")\n    print(\"It preferentially attacks the less sterically hindered proton.
