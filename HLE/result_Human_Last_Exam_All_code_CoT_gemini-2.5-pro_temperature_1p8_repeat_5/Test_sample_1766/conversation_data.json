    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** A p-electron is characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1` and the spin quantum number `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Add Angular Momenta:** The total angular momentum is given by `J = L + S`. The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Eigenstates:** The common eigenstates of the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ are denoted by `|j, m_j>`, where `m_j` is the total magnetic quantum number. For a given `j`, `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues for these states are:\n    *   For $J^2$:  `j(j + 1)ħ²`\n    *   For $J_z$:  `m_jħ`\n5.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Calculates the possible `j` values.\n    *   For each `j`, it will find the corresponding `m_j` values.\n    *   For each pair of `(j, m_j)`, it will compute and print the eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$. I'll use Python's `fractions` module to keep the half-integer arithmetic exact and clear.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)  # spin angular momentum quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, the quantum numbers are l = {l} and s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum J is the sum of orbital L and spin S.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find the eigenvalues of J^2 and Jz, which are given by j(j+1)ħ² and m_jħ respectively.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    j_values = []\n    current_j = j_min\n    while current_j <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(current_j)\n        current_j += 1\n        \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, find m_j values and calculate the eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"\\n--- For the state with j = {j} ---\")\n        \n        # Print the equation and result for the J^2 eigenvalue\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ².\")\n        # Output each number in the final equation\n        print(f\"Equation: J^2 |{j}, m_j> = {j}({j} + 1)ħ² |{j}, m_j> = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ² |{j}, m_j>\")\n        \n        # Determine and iterate through m_j values for the current j\n        mj_values = []\n        current_mj = -j\n        while current_mj <= j:\n            mj_values.append(current_mj)\n            current_mj += 1\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor j = {j}, the possible m_j values are: {', '.join(map(str, mj_values))}\")\n        print(\"The common eigenvalues for each state |j, m_j> are:\")\n\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The eigenvalue of Jz is mj*hbar\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            print(\n                f\"  State |j={j}, m_j={mj}>:  Eigenvalue of J^2 = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ², \"\n                f\"Eigenvalue of Jz = {jz_eigenvalue}ħ\"\n            )\n            \n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<j = 3/2, 1/2>>>"
