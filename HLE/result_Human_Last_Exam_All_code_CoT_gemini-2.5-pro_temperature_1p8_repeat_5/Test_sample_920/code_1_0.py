    The adult male Micromalthid is a rare, short-lived individual. Crucially, it has vestigial (underdeveloped and non-functional) mouthparts. Its sole biological purpose is to find a female and mate. Because it cannot eat, it relies on the energy reserves it accumulated during its larval stage. It dies shortly after emerging, without ever having fed as an adult.
