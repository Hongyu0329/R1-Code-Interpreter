    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecule's Symmetry:** I will start by examining the overall structure of the molecule, 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. The key is to identify any symmetry elements, as symmetry reduces the number of unique proton environments. The molecule has a central benzene ring substituted at all six positions. The substitution pattern (three identical large groups at 1,3,5 and three identical methyl groups at 2,4,6) results in C3 rotational symmetry.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups attached to the benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent. They will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from one Substituent Arm:** Again, due to the C3 symmetry, the three large substituents are identical. Therefore, I only need to analyze one of these arms to determine how many signals it contributes. Each arm consists of a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker and a complex indazole moiety.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Methylene Linker:** The methylene linker (`-CH2-`) is attached to the indazole moiety, which is specified as chiral (with (4S,7R) stereochemistry). When a `-CH2-` group is attached to a chiral center, its two protons are no longer equivalent; they are diastereotopic. This means they will appear as two separate signals.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Indazole Moiety:** I will break down the `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol` part. This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. Due to its chirality and lack of internal symmetry, nearly all of its protons will be in unique chemical environments. I will count them systematically:\n    *   The single proton on the pyrazole ring.\n    *   The protons of the three methyl groups. In a chiral environment, these are all non-equivalent.\n    *   The single methine (`CH`) proton at a bridgehead position.\n    *   The four protons of the two methylene (`CH2`) groups in the saturated bicyclic part. All four are expected to be non-equivalent.\n\n6.  **Sum the Signals:** Finally, I will add up the number of signals from the central methyl groups, the linker methylene protons, and the indazole moiety protons to get the total number of expected peaks. I will then write a Python script that codifies this counting logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of\n    1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n    The calculation is based on molecular symmetry and the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the molecular symmetry.\n    # The molecule has C3 rotational symmetry around the center of the benzene ring.\n    # This makes the three -CH3 groups on the ring equivalent, and the three large substituent arms equivalent.\n\n    # Step 2: Count peaks from the central core.\n    # The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent.\n    peaks_central_methyls = 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Count peaks from one of the three identical substituent arms.\n    # Each arm is -CH2-R where R is the chiral indazole moiety.\n    \n    # a) The -CH2- linker group.\n    # Since the attached indazole group (R) is chiral, the two protons of the -CH2- linker are diastereotopic\n    # and thus chemically non-equivalent.\n    peaks_linker_ch2 = 2\n    \n    # b) The indazole moiety.
