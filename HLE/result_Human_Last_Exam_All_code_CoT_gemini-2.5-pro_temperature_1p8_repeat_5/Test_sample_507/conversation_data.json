    "Of course. Finding languages with no direct contact but with similar core vocabulary is a fascinating linguistic challenge. The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across unrelated languages due to being among the first, simple sounds babies learn to make (a phenomenon called \"Lallwörter\"). The real challenge is finding a matching word for a common object like \"broom,\" where the similarity is likely pure coincidence.\n\nHere is my plan to find such a language pair:\n1.  **Select Candidate Language Families:** I will choose two language families in Asia that are genetically unrelated and geographically distant to ensure \"no direct contact.\" Good candidates are the Turkic family (West/Central Asia) and the Austronesian family (Maritime Southeast Asia).\n2.  **Compare \"Mom\" and \"Dad\":** I will check the words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" in languages from these families, looking for the well-known \"mama/papa\" or \"baba/ana\" patterns.\n3.  **Find a Coincidental Match for \"Broom\":** This is the key step. I will search for words for \"broom\" in the selected languages, looking for a phonetic similarity that is not due to borrowing. I'll research the etymology of the words to confirm they arose independently.\n4.  **Construct the Python Script:** I will write a Python script to present the final answer. The script will name the two languages and then, for each of the three words, display the term from each language and explain the nature of the similarity (nursery word or coincidence).\n\nHere is the Python script that prints the answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nlanguage1 = \"Turkish\"\nlanguage2 = \"Malay\"\n\nintro_text = f\"\"\"\nTwo languages from different Asian cultures with no direct linguistic link, yet sharing remarkably similar words for \"mom,\" \"dad,\" and \"broom,\" are {language1} and {language2}.\n\n{language1} is part of the Turkic language family, primarily spoken in Western Asia. {language2} belongs to the Austronesian family, spoken in Maritime Southeast Asia. Their similarities are a mix of universal linguistic patterns and pure coincidence.\n\"\"\"\nprint(intro_text)\nprint(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# --- Word Data & Comparison ---\ncomparisons = [\n    {\n        \"word\": \"DAD\",\n        \"lang1_word\": \"baba\",\n        \"lang2_word\": \"bapak\",\n        \"analysis\": \"These words are nearly identical.
