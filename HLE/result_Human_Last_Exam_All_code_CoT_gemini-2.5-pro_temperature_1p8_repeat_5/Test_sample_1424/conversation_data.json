    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function can be understood as the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action. For a non-interacting system (which the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes), the action in energy-momentum space is described by an operator that is diagonal in the single-particle energy eigenbasis.\n\nThe key result is that in frequency (or energy, $\\omega$) space, the bare Green's function for a particle in a state 'k' has a pole at the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$. The functional form is an inverse relationship.\n\nSpecifically, the bare Green's function $G_0$ for a particle with momentum **k** and energy $\\omega$ is given by:\n\n$G_0(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the energy variable.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for state **k**.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, which sets the zero point for particle/hole excitations.\n*   $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that ensures causality by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis.\n*   $\\text{sgn}$ is the sign function.\n\nThis equation shows that the Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the energy difference $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by calculating the value of the Green's function for a given set of parameters and printing out each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_green_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and calculates the bare Green's function G_0.\n\n    The bare Green's function G_0(k, omega) describes the propagation of a\n    non-interacting particle.
