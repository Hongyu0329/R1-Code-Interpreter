    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the specified graph and the mechanics of the gossiping process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is constructed by taking two separate complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each and connecting them with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck.\"\n2.  **Model the Gossiping Process:** \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" is a node-centric process. In each step:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes. The probability of picking any single node is `1 / |V|`, where `|V|` is the total number of nodes.\n    b. The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `v` from node `u` is `1 / deg(u)`, where `deg(u)` is the degree (number of neighbors) of node `u`.\n3.  **Identify the Bottleneck Edge:** Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` from the first clique and node `v` from the second.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** We need to find the degrees of nodes `u` and `v`. A node in a 5-node complete graph has `5 - 1 = 4` connections within its clique. The bottleneck edge adds one more connection, so the total degree for both `u` and `v` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge is \"sampled\" if either node `u` chooses to contact `v`, or node `v` chooses to contact `u`. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n    `P(sample) = P(u is picked) * P(u contacts v) + P(v is picked) * P(v contacts u)`\n    `P(sample) = (1/|V|) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/|V|) * (1/deg(v))`\n6.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to substitute the values (`|V| = 10`, `deg(u) = 5`, `deg(v) = 5`) into the formula and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define the graph parameters\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# A 10-node barbell graph has two cliques.\nnodes_in_clique = total_nodes // 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck.\n# The degree of a node within a K_5 clique is 5-1 = 4.\ndegree_within_clique = nodes_in_clique - 1\n# The bottleneck edge adds one more connection to these nodes.\ndegree_bottleneck_node = degree_within_clique + 1\n\n# Step 4: Define the components of the probability formula.\n# In uniform gossiping, any node is picked with probability 1/|V|.\nprob_pick_node = Fraction(1, total_nodes)\n# The selected node then picks a neighbor with probability 1/degree.\nprob_contact_neighbor = Fraction(1, degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final probability.\n# The bottleneck edge (u,v) is sampled if u picks v OR v picks u.\n# P = P(pick u)*P(u->v) + P(pick v)*P(v->u)\nprob_u_picks_v = prob_pick_node * prob_contact_neighbor\nprob_v_picks_u = prob_pick_node * prob_contact_neighbor\ntotal_prob = prob_u_picks_v + prob_v_picks_u\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(f\"For a barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes, the structure is two {nodes_in_clique}-node complete graphs connected by one bottleneck edge.\")\nprint(f\"Let the bottleneck edge connect node 'u' and node 'v'.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of nodes |V| = {total_nodes}.\")\nprint(f\"The degree of the nodes 'u' and 'v' connected by the bottleneck is {degree_bottleneck_node}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in one step of uniform gossiping is calculated as:\")\nprint(\"P = (Probabilty of picking u) * (Probability of u contacting v) + (Probabilty of picking v) * (Probability of v contacting u)\")\nprint(\"P = (1/|V|) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/|V|) * (1/deg(v))\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"P = (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_bottleneck_node}) + (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_bottleneck_node})\")\nprint(f\"P = {prob_u_picks_v} + {prob_v_picks_u}\")\nprint(f\"P = {total_prob}\")\nprint(f\"The final probability is {float(total_prob)}.\")\n\n# Suppress final answer line in notebook environments\nif 'ipykernel' not in sys.modules:\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{float(total_prob)}>>>\")\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
