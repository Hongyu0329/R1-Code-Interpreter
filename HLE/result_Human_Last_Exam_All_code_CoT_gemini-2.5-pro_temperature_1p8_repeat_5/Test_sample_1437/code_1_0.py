    Determines the numerical value of the Lindhard polarization function at q=0, ω=0.

    In the framework of linear response theory for a homogeneous 3D electron gas at T=0,
    the Lindhard polarization function Π(q, ω) in the static (ω→0) and
    long-wavelength (q→0) limit is given by a fundamental relation.

    # Step 1: State the fundamental relationship from many-body theory.
    # The Lindhard function Π(0, 0) is equal to the negative of the total
    # density of states at the Fermi energy, D(ε_F), including spin degeneracy.
    print("Step 1: State the theoretical result.")

    # Step 2: Explain why a dimensionless quantity is calculated.
    # The density of states, D(ε_F), depends on the electron density 'n' of the gas
    # (via the Fermi wavevector k_F), so Π(0, 0) is not a universal constant.
    # To provide a single numerical value, we calculate the dimensionless ratio
    # obtained by normalizing Π(0, 0) with D(ε_F).

    # The equation is: [-1 * D(ε_F)] / [1 * D(ε_F)]
