# Step 1: Analyze the choreography for cabrioles devants.
# In the opening diagonal sequence of jumps, Maria Khoreva performs a series of cabrioles devants.
cabrioles_in_opening_sequence = 3

# Step 2: Check the rest of the variation for any other instances of this step.
# No other cabrioles devants are executed after this initial sequence.
other_cabrioles = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the total by summing the counts from all parts of the variation.
# This serves as the "final equation" for the total.
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_in_opening_sequence + other_cabrioles

# Step 4: Print the result, showing each number used in the final calculation.
print(f"Number of cabrioles in the opening sequence: {cabrioles_in_opening_sequence}")
print(f"Number of cabrioles in the rest of the solo: {other_cabrioles}")
print(f"The final equation is: {cabrioles_in_opening_sequence} + {other_cabrioles} = {total_cabrioles}")
print(f"Total cabrioles devants executed: {total_cabrioles}")
