Step 1: Understand the definitions.
- A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.
- A continuum is decomposable if it is the union of two of its proper subcontinua.
- A subcontinuum S is regular if S is the closure of its interior (S = cl(int(S))).

Step 2: The Goal.
We are looking for the smallest possible number of regular proper subcontinua for any nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

Step 3: Construct a candidate continuum.
Let's build a space that limits the number of possible regular subcontinua. We can do this using indecomposable continua. An indecomposable continuum has the property that any of its proper subcontinua has an empty interior.
1. Take two indecomposable continua, let's call them A and B (the pseudo-arc is a standard example).
2. Let them intersect at a single point, p. Let our space be X = A U B.

Step 4: Analyze the constructed space X.
- X is a decomposable continuum, as X = A U B, and A and B are proper subcontinua.
- Let's find the regular proper subcontinua of X. A subcontinuum S is regular only if its interior is non-empty.
- Any non-empty open subset of X must contain points from A or B away from the intersection point p.
- If a subcontinuum S contains an open set from A, because A is indecomposable, S must contain all of A. Similarly for B.
- If S is a proper subcontinuum, it cannot contain both A and B.
- So, the only possible candidates for regular proper subcontinua are A and B themselves.
- We can verify that A and B are indeed regular. The interior of A in X is A \\ {p}, and its closure is A. So, cl(int(A)) = A. The same holds for B.
- Therefore, for this constructed space X, the set of regular proper subcontinua is exactly {A, B}. The size of this set is 2.

Step 5: Conclude the answer.
We have found an example of a decomposable continuum that has exactly 2 regular proper subcontinua. It is a known (but non-trivial) theorem in continuum theory that any decomposable continuum has at least two regular proper subcontinua.
Thus, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
