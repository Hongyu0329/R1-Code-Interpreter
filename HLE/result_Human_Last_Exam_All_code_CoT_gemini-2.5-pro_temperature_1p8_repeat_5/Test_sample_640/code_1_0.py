    Analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    The key logical relationships are:
    1. A potential V(r) is nontrivially coupled (nTC) if and only if its Jost matrix F(E) is nTC.
       nTC(V) <==> nTC(F)
    2. A nTC S-matrix S(E) implies a nTC Jost matrix F(E).
       nTC(S) ==> nTC(F)
    3. The converse is not true: nTC(F) does NOT imply nTC(S).

    From this, we have the chain: nTC(S) ==> nTC(F) <==> nTC(V).
    This implies that nTC(S) ==> nTC(V).

    We evaluate each statement:
    1. nTC(S) ==> nTC(V): Correct.
    2. S is diagonal ==> V is diagonal: Incorrect. S being diagonal means S is not nTC, which
       implies V is not nTC. But not nTC (diagonalizable by a constant matrix) is not
       the same as being diagonal.
    3. nTC(V) ==> nTC(F): Correct. This is part of the V-F equivalence.
    4. nTC(F) ==> nTC(S): Incorrect. This implication is known to be false.
    5. Exists nTC(V) with diagonal F: Incorrect. F being diagonal means F is not nTC.
       This would imply V is not nTC, a contradiction.

    Therefore, the correct statements are 1 and 3.
