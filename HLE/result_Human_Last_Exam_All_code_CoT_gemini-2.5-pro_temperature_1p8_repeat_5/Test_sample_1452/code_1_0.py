# The user wants to find the famous equation associated with Max Born.
# Max Born is known for the Born rule in quantum mechanics.
# The rule provides the probability density of finding a particle at a given point.
# This probability density, P(x), is equal to the squared magnitude of the wave function, |ψ(x)|².

name = "Max Born"
# Representing the equation P(x) = |ψ(x)|²
# The numbers in the equation are the exponent '2'.
# Following the instruction: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# I will construct the string and ensure the number 2 is present.
equation_string = f"P(x) = |ψ(x)|^{2}"
