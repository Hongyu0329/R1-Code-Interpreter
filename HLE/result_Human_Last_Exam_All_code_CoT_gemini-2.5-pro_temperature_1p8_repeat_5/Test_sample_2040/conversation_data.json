    "My plan is to answer your question by breaking down the underlying physics and material properties.\n\n1.  **Define Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** I'll start by explaining what SPDC is. It's a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy photon splits into two lower-energy photons. This process fundamentally depends on a material property called the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\n2.  **Relate SPDC to Material Symmetry:** I'll explain that for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion symmetry (it must be non-centrosymmetric). Materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric) have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero, and therefore cannot exhibit SPDC in their bulk form.\n\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** I'll examine the known structures of free-standing boron nanosheets. Research has shown that the common and most stable phases of borophene (like the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are centrosymmetric.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** By combining these points, I will conclude that since boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Consequently, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. I will present this final explanation within a Python code block using the `print()` function as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected\n    to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Analysis of Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in Boron Nanosheets\"\n    line = \"=\" * len(title)\n\n    explanation = [\n        \"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\",\n        \"It involves a high-energy pump photon spontaneously splitting into a pair of lower-energy photons (signal and idler) within a nonlinear material.\",\n        \"\\nA fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate a second-order process like SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as chi(2).\",\n        \"\\nA material's chi(2) is non-zero only if its crystal lattice structure lacks a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).
