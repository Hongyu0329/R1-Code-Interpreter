    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group Parameters:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. The general form of a semidihedral group is $SD_{2^n}$, with a size of $2^n$. For a size of 512, we have $512 = 2^9$, so we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$, which means $n=9$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ for $G=SD_{2^9}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on the exponent `k`:**\n    *   **Case 1: `k` is odd.** For any odd integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers, $G^k$, is equal to the group $G$ itself. This is because the mapping $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$. This case contributes exactly one distinct power subgroup, which is $G$.\n    *   **Case 2: `k` is even.** For any even integer $k$, the power set $G^k$ is a cyclic subgroup contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup of $G$ (denoted $\\langle r \\rangle$). Specifically, the distinct power subgroups generated by even powers are the subgroups $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\ldots, \\langle r^{2^{n-1}} \\rangle$. The last subgroup, $\\langle r^{2^{n-1}} \\rangle$, is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element. This gives a total of $n-1$ distinct subgroups.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases: $1$ (from odd powers) + $(n-1)$ (from even powers) = $n$.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a Python script that takes the group size (512), calculates $n=9$, and applies the formula to find the total count, printing the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups_semidihedral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in a semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group SD_{2^n} has a size of 2^n.\n    # We first need to find the value of n.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (with n >= 3), the number of distinct\n    # power subgroups is exactly n.\n    # This total is derived from two cases based on the power k:\n    # 1. When k is odd, the power subgroup G^k is always G itself. This gives 1 subgroup.\n    # 2. When k is even, G^k forms one of n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n    \n    num_from_odd_powers = 1\n    num_from_even_powers = n - 1\n    total_power_subgroups = num_from_odd_powers + num_from_even_powers\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{2^{n}}}, so n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups is n.\")\n    print(\"This is the sum of:\")\n    print(f\"- {num_from_odd_powers} subgroup from odd powers (the group itself)\")\n    print(f\"- {num_from_even_powers} subgroups from even powers (cyclic subgroups of orders 2^{n-2}, 2^{n-3},..., 1)\")\n    \n    # Output the final equation with all numbers, as requested.\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_from_odd_powers} + {num_from_even_powers} = {total_power_subgroups}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer.\nsolve_power_subgroups_semidihedral()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
