    This script analyzes several statements about Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

    print("Analysis of statements regarding Support Vector Machines:\n")

    # Statement A
    print("Statement A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("Evaluation: True.")
    print("Reason: This follows from the KKT condition `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`. If all support vectors (where alpha_i > 0) were from one class (e.g., y_i = 1), the sum would be positive and not zero. Therefore, support vectors must come from both classes.\n")

    # Statement B
    print("Statement B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("Evaluation: True.")
    print("Reason: By using different penalty parameters (C) for each class, SVMs can create asymmetric margins to handle class imbalance effectively.\n")

    # Statement C
    print("Statement C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("Evaluation: True.")
    print("Reason: The kernel trick, particularly with kernels like the RBF kernel, allows for computations in an implicit, infinite-dimensional feature space without ever creating the feature vectors, making it tractable.\n")

    # Statement D
    print("Statement D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("Evaluation: True.")
    print("Reason: The decision boundary is defined only by support vectors. Interior points have zero weight in the SVM solution, so modifying them (as long as they remain interior) does not affect the boundary.\n")

    # Statement E
    print("Statement E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("Evaluation: False.")
    print("Reason: This statement is mathematically false. A strictly convex function has at most one minimizer, but its existence is not guaranteed. For example, f(x) = e^x is strictly convex but has no global minimum on the set of real numbers.\n")

    print("---------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: The single statement that is not true is E.")
