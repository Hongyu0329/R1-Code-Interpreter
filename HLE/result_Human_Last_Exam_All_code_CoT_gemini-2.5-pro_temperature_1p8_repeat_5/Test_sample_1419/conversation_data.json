    "My plan is to solve for the fixed point coupling `u*` by using the renormalization group (RG) framework for the `ϕ^4` theory.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** The RG flow of the dimensionless coupling `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions is described by the beta function, `β(u)`. I will start with the well-known one-loop beta function for this theory.\n2.  **Apply the Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point `u*` is a value of the coupling where the RG flow halts, which mathematically means `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** I will set the beta function to zero and solve the resulting equation for `u`. This equation will have a trivial solution (`u* = 0`) and a non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic algebra. The script will define the symbols, set up the equation `β(u) = 0`, solve for `u`, and then print the final expression for the non-trivial fixed point `u*`, explicitly mentioning the numbers in the final expression as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher \n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables used in the calculation.\n    # u represents the dimensionless coupling constant.\n    # epsilon represents the small parameter d = 4 - epsilon.\n    # pi is the mathematical constant.\n    u, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u epsilon pi')\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The one-loop beta function for the coupling 'u' in phi^4 theory is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ϵ*u + (3*u^2) / (16*π^2)\")\n    print(\"The -ϵ*u term arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling in d=4-ϵ dimensions.\")\n    print(\"The second term arises from the one-loop quantum corrections.\\n\")\n\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + 3 * u**2 / (16 * pi**2)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: A fixed point u* occurs when the beta function is zero.\")\n    print(\"We set β(u) = 0 and solve for u:\\n\")\n    fixed_point_equation = sympy.Eq(beta_function, 0)\n    \n    print(\"The equation to solve is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(fixed_point_equation)\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solving the equation for u.\")\n    solutions = sympy.solve(fixed_point_equation, u)\n\n    # The solutions are u=0 (Gaussian fixed point) and the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n    u_star = solutions[1]\n\n    print(\"The equation has two solutions:\")\n    print(f\"1.
