# The riddle presents two clues.
# Clue 1: Kurt Vonnegut described a man as looking "like a porcupine in a wind tunnel".
# A quick search of Vonnegut's work, specifically his book "A Man Without a Country",
# reveals he was talking about Albert Einstein.

# Clue 2: The man's name must consist of two words that start with the same letter.
# The name "Albert Einstein" does not fit this rule (A and E are different).

# This structure suggests a trick question. The Vonnegut quote is a clue to the
# physical appearance (wild, spiky hair), but the answer must be a different person
# who fits the alliterative name rule.

# We need to find a famous person known for a "porcupine-like" hairstyle
# whose name is an alliteration. A famous musician from the 1960s fits both
# of these descriptions perfectly.

first_name = "Bob"
last_name = "Dylan"
