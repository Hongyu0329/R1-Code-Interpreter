The question asks which pair of ballet institutions uses a pirouette preparation from fourth position with bent knees and arms in an 'allongé' (elongated) position.

Here is a breakdown of the characteristic styles:

1.  **Paris Opera Ballet School (French Style):** Known for its elegance and emphasis on beautiful lines. The use of open, elongated (allongé) arms in pirouette preparations is a hallmark of this style.

2.  **School of American Ballet (Balanchine Style):** Famous for speed and dynamic movement. The Balanchine preparation for pirouettes from fourth position characteristically uses a deep plié with open, 'allongé' arms to generate power and momentum for the turn.

3.  **The Royal Ballet School (English Style) & Vaganova Academy (Russian Style):** Both of these schools teach methods that emphasize control and stability. Their standard pirouette preparations from fourth position typically involve more contained, rounded arm positions to maintain a strong core, rather than a stretched, 'allongé' shape.

Conclusion:
The Paris Opera Ballet School and the School of American Ballet are the two institutions whose techniques most closely match the description of using allongé arms for pirouette preparation from fourth position.
