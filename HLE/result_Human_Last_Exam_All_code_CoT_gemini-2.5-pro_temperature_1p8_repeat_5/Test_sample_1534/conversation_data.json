    "My plan is to first identify the relevant anatomical structures in the dwarf cuttlefish brain. I will use my knowledge of comparative neuroanatomy, specifically focusing on cephalopods, to determine which brain lobes are located posterior (to the rear) of the palliovisceral lobe. Since the question asks for a script, I will then create a Python script that prints this information as a clear, formatted text output.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located\n    posteriorly adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    The neuroanatomy is generally conserved across cuttlefish species.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    # The brain regions situated directly posterior to it are involved in\n    # escape responses and body patterning control.\n    \n    region1 = \"Magnocellular lobe\"\n    region2 = \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\"\n    \n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    print(f\"- {region1}\")\n    print(f\"- {region2}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the magnocellular lobe and the posterior chromatophore lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
