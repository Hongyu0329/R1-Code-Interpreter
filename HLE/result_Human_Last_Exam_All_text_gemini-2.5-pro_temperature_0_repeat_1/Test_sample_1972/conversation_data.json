    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key pieces of information.**\nThe question provides two distinct clues, both attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A description of a novel: It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nThe goal is to identify the specific novel that fits both of these descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the clue about the author.**\nThe phrase \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a very specific literary critique. William Faulkner was a massive influence on 20th-century Latin American writers, a group often associated with the \"Latin American Boom.\" Borges, a key figure in this literary world, was also a translator and admirer of Faulkner. His opinion on who successfully continued Faulkner's legacy would be significant. The addition of \"(and simplifier)\" suggests an author who took Faulkner's themes (like the creation of a mythical, self-contained region, complex timelines, and psychological depth) but rendered them in a more concise, less baroque style. This points strongly toward the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the clue about the novel.**\nThe quote \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is a powerful and memorable metaphor.\n*   \"The intensity of a tiger\" suggests something primal, visceral, fierce, and direct.\n*   \"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests something highly structured, intellectual, strategic, and complex in its limited set of moves.\nThis combination describes a work that is both emotionally raw and intellectually intricate. This specific quote is famously used by Borges to describe Juan Rulfo's seminal novel.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the clues and identify the source.**\nBoth clues point directly to Juan Rulfo and his novel **Pedro Páramo**. The source for these statements is the prologue that Jorge Luis Borges wrote for the 1974 Italian edition of *Pedro Páramo*. In this text, Borges explicitly praises Rulfo's work, situating him as a successor to Faulkner but with a more austere and potent style, and he uses the tiger and chess metaphor to capture the novel's unique blend of raw power and sophisticated, fragmented structure.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe author described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is Juan Rulfo. The novel Borges described with the \"intensity of a tiger\" and the complexity of a \"chess duel\" is Rulfo's masterpiece, *Pedro Páramo*. Therefore, the novel in question is *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
