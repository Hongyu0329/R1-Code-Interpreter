    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and calculate the differences between consecutive terms.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's denote the sequence as `a_n`.\n`a_1 = 2`\n`a_2 = 11`\n`a_3 = 23`\n`a_4 = 51`\n`a_5 = 119`\n\nNow, let's find the first-order differences (the difference between each term and the one before it). Let's call this new sequence `b_n`.\n`b_1 = a_2 - a_1 = 11 - 2 = 9`\n`b_2 = a_3 - a_2 = 23 - 11 = 12`\n`b_3 = a_4 - a_3 = 51 - 23 = 28`\n`b_4 = a_5 - a_4 = 119 - 51 = 68`\nThe sequence of differences is: 9, 12, 28, 68.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the sequence of differences to find a pattern.**\nThe sequence of differences, `b_n`, is 9, 12, 28, 68.\nThis sequence is not a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Let's look for a more complex relationship, such as a recurrence relation. A common form is `b_n = k * b_{n-1} + c_n`. Let's test `k=2`.\n- For `b_3` and `b_2`: `b_3 = 28`, `b_2 = 12`. `2 * b_2 = 2 * 12 = 24`. The difference is `28 - 24 = 4`. So, `b_3 = 2 * b_2 + 4`.\n- For `b_4` and `b_3`: `b_4 = 68`, `b_3 = 28`. `2 * b_3 = 2 * 28 = 56`. The difference is `68 - 56 = 12`. So, `b_4 = 2 * b_3 + 12`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the pattern in the terms added in the recurrence relation.**\nWe have found a pattern for the sequence of differences `b_n` starting from `b_3`:\n`b_3 = 2 * b_2 + 4`\n`b_4 = 2 * b_3 + 12`\nThe terms being added are 4 and 12. We can observe that 12 is 3 times 4. This suggests a geometric progression for these added terms.\nLet's assume the pattern continues. The next added term should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n**Step 4: Use the discovered pattern to calculate the next term in the difference sequence (`b_5`).**\nThe rule is `b_n = 2 * b_{n-1} + (added_term)`.\nTo find `b_5`, we use `b_4` and the next added term (36).\n`b_5 = 2 * b_4 + 36`\n`b_5 = 2 * 68 + 36`\n`b_5 = 136 + 36`\n`b_5 = 172`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence (`a_6`).**\nThe missing term, `a_6`, is the sum of the previous term, `a_5`, and the difference we just calculated, `b_5`.\n`a_6 = a_5 + b_5`\n`a_6 = 119 + 172`\n`a_6 = 291`\n\n**Step 6: Compare the result with the given options.**\nThe calculated value is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The initial analysis of first-order differences did not reveal a simple pattern, which prompted looking for a more complex, second-level pattern.\n*   The pattern in the sequence of differences (`b_n`) did not apply to the very first term (`b_1=9` and `b_2=12`), but it was consistent for the subsequent terms. This is common in more difficult sequence problems.\n*   It is crucial to verify the discovered pattern against all available data points before using it to extrapolate. In this case, the rule `b_n = 2 * b_{n-1} + 4*3^(n-3)` works for `n=3` and `n=4`.\n*   All arithmetic calculations must be performed carefully to avoid errors.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n- Sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n- Differences: 9, 12, 28, 68\n- Pattern in differences: `b_n = 2*b_{n-1} + d_n` where `d_3=4`, `d_4=12`. `d_n` is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n- Next `d` term: `d_5 = 12 * 3 = 36`.\n- Next difference: `b_5 = 2 * 68 + 36 = 136 + 36 = 172`.\n- Next term in original sequence: `a_6 = 119 + 172 = 291`.\n\n<<<A>>>"
