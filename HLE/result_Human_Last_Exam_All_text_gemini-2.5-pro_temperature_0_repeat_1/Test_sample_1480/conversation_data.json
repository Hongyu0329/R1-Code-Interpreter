    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the \"rule activation level\" for a rule within an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Fuzzy Inference Process:** A fuzzy rule generally has the form: `IF <antecedent> THEN <consequent>`. The process of getting an output from an input involves several stages:\n    *   **Fuzzification:** Convert crisp inputs into fuzzy sets.\n    *   **Rule Evaluation (Antecedent Evaluation):** For each rule, determine the degree to which its antecedent part is satisfied by the inputs. This degree is called the **rule activation level**, firing strength, or firing level. This step typically involves using a t-norm (like AND, implemented as `min` or `product`) to combine the membership values of all conditions in the antecedent.\n    *   **Implication:** Apply the calculated activation level to the consequent part of the rule to generate an output fuzzy set for that rule.\n    *   **Aggregation:** Combine the output fuzzy sets from all rules into a single fuzzy set.\n    *   **Defuzzification:** Convert the aggregated fuzzy set back into a crisp output value.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: In the context of fuzzy logic systems, the notation `Phi_k(x′)` (or similar notations like `w^k` or `τ^k`) represents the final computed firing strength or **activation level** of the antecedent of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. It is the result of evaluating the \"IF\" part of the rule.\n    *   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This notation represents the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`. This value is used during the **implication** step, which occurs *after* the rule activation level has been determined. Therefore, this information is not needed to find the activation level itself.\n    *   **`t-norm operation`**: This confirms the method used to combine the membership values of the inputs in the antecedent to arrive at the final activation level. The value `Phi_k(x′)` is the result of this t-norm operation.\n    *   **`Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set`**: While the underlying fuzzy sets are complex (IT3 FS), the fundamental structure of the inference process remains the same. The rule activation level is still the value representing the degree of truth of the antecedent. The complexity of IT3 FS would affect *how* `Phi_k(x′)` is calculated from the base inputs, but here we are already *given* the final calculated value of `Phi_k(x′)`.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The question asks for the rule activation level. By definition, `Phi_k(x′)` is the variable that represents this exact quantity. The problem provides its value directly. The information about the consequent (`μG_k_j(y_j)`) is extraneous to this specific question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Antecedent and Consequent:** The rule activation level is determined exclusively by the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule. The consequent (the \"THEN\" part) does not influence it.\n*   **Identifying Extraneous Information:** It is crucial to recognize that `μG_k_j(y_j)` is related to the consequent and is not part of the activation level calculation. It is included to test the understanding of the fuzzy inference process.\n*   **Understanding Notation:** Recognizing that `Phi_k(x′)` is a standard symbol for the rule activation level is key to solving the problem directly.\n*   **Problem Complexity:** The mention of \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" makes the problem sound more complex than it is. The question does not require a deep calculation involving IT3 FSs but rather a conceptual understanding of the role of the activation level in any fuzzy system.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe rule activation level is the degree to which the antecedent of the rule is satisfied. The variable `Phi_k(x′)` represents this value. The question explicitly states that `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. Therefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
