    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\n\nThe problem asks us to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is a specific form that relates to the derivative of a logarithmic function. Specifically, we know that the derivative of `ln(f(x))` is `f'(x)/f(x)`. Therefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral by finding the difference of the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Define the Function F₃(x)**\n\nWe need to find the explicit form of `F₃(x)` by following the given definitions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate F₃(x) at the Limits x=0 and x=1**\n\nNow, we calculate the value of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration.\n\n*   **At x = 0:**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n    Since `sin(0) = 0` and `e^0 = 1`, we have:\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n*   **At x = 1:**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    Here, `sin(1)` refers to the sine of 1 radian.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Values into the Integral Expression**\n\nBefore substituting, let's consider the absolute value `|F₃(x)|`.\nFor `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is always non-negative (`0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1)`).\nThis means `e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to `e^0 = 1`.\nTherefore, `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to 2.\nThe natural logarithm of a number greater than or equal to 2 is always positive. So, `F₃(x) > 0` for `x` in `[0, 1]`.\nThis allows us to drop the absolute value signs.\n\nThe expression for `V` becomes:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can also write this as:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 6: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value of `V`. We must use a calculator set to radian mode.\n\n1.  `sin(1)` ≈ 0.841471\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.841471` ≈ 2.319775\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 1 + 2.319775 = 3.319775\n4.  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(3.319775)` ≈ 1.199998\n5.  `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.693147\n\nNow, we calculate `V`:\n`V ≈ ln(1.199998) - ln(0.693147)`\n`V ≈ 0.182320 - (-0.366513)`\n`V ≈ 0.548833`\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548833 = 5488.33`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.33 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
