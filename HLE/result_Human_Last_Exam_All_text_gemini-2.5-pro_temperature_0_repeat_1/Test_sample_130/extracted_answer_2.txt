The edges of the image become progressively smoother. Sharp corners are rounded, and any features on the edges smaller than the filter size $\delta$ (such as thin protrusions or small inlets) are eliminated. The iterative process erodes convex (outward-pointing) parts of a shape and fills in concave (inward-pointing) parts. This continues until the image converges to a state where the boundaries of all shapes are simplified and their local curvature is limited, with a minimum radius of curvature on the order of $\delta$.
