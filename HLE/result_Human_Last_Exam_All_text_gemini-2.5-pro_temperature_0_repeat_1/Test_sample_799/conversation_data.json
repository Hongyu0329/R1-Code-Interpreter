    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if for any four elements $x, y, z, w \\in S$, the equation $x+y = z+w$ implies that the pair $\\{x, y\\}$ is the same as the pair $\\{z, w\\}$ (as multisets). This means either $x=z$ and $y=w$, or $x=w$ and $y=z$.\n    *   An important consequence is that if $x, y, z, w$ are distinct elements of a Sidon set, then $x+y \\neq z+w$.\n    *   Another consequence is that for any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the equation $x+y=t$ has at most one solution in $S$ up to swapping $x$ and $y$. That is, the set $S_t = \\{x \\in S \\mid t-x \\in S\\}$ contains at most two elements.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(S)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $S$. It can be any non-negative real number.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Dimension\n\nWe will show that the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ cannot exceed $1/2$. The argument proceeds by contradiction.\n\n1.  **Assume the contrary:** Suppose there exists a Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_H(S) = d > 1/2$.\n\n2.  **Apply Geometric Measure Theory:** A key result in this field connects the dimension of a set to the properties of its sumset $S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}$.\n    *   If $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a Borel set with $\\dim_H(K) > 1/2$, then its sumset $K+K$ must have positive Lebesgue measure.\n    *   A more powerful tool is the use of Frostman measures. If $\\dim_H(S) = d > 1/2$, there exists a non-zero Borel measure $\\mu$ supported on $S$ (i.e., $\\mu(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus S) = 0$) such that for any interval $I$, $\\mu(I) \\le C (\\text{length}(I))^d$ for some constant $C$. Such a measure is called a Frostman measure.\n    *   Consider the convolution of this measure with itself: $\\nu = \\mu * \\mu$. This measure is supported on the sumset $S+S$. Its Fourier transform is $\\hat{\\nu}(\\xi) = (\\hat{\\mu}(\\xi))^2$.\n    *   Because $d > 1/2$, it can be shown that the Fourier transform $\\hat{\\nu}(\\xi)$ is square-integrable (i.e., $\\int |\\hat{\\nu}(\\xi)|^2 d\\xi < \\infty$). By the Plancherel theorem, this implies that the measure $\\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and has a density function $g(t)$ which is in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n3.  **Incorporate the Sidon Property:** The Sidon property of $S$ imposes a very strong structural constraint. For any $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the set of pairs $(x,y) \\in S \\times S$ such that $x+y=t$ is very small. Specifically, the set $S_t = S \\cap (t-S)$ contains at most two points.\n\n4.  **Derive the Contradiction:**\n    *   The fact that $\\nu$ has an $L^2$ density $g(t)$ means that the measure $\\nu$ is \"smoothly\" distributed over the set $S+S$. It cannot be concentrated on a set of Lebesgue measure zero.\n    *   On the other hand, the Sidon property implies that the support of the measure $\\mu \\times \\mu$ (which lives on $S \\times S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$) has a very singular structure. Its intersection with any line of the form $x+y=t$ consists of at most two points.\n    *   A measure with such a singular structure, when projected onto the line (via the map $(x,y) \\mapsto x+y$), cannot result in a measure that has an $L^2$ density. The geometric constraint imposed by the Sidon property is incompatible with the analytic consequence of having dimension greater than $1/2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion of the Upper Bound:** The assumption that $\\dim_H(S) > 1/2$ leads to a contradiction. Therefore, for any Sidon set $S$, we must have $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\n\n### Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo show that $1/2$ is the maximum possible dimension, we need to demonstrate the existence of a Sidon set $S \\subset [0,1]$ with $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$.\n\n1.  **Existence Proofs:** The construction of such a set is highly non-trivial. It has been achieved by mathematicians using advanced techniques from harmonic analysis and fractal geometry. These constructions are generally beyond the scope of a simple explanation.\n\n2.  **Methods of Construction:**\n    *   **Riesz Products:** One method involves constructing a special type of measure $\\mu$ using an infinite product of trigonometric functions (a Riesz product). The integer frequencies used in the product are chosen from a Sidon set of integers (e.g., a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ where $|A \\cap \\{1, ..., N\\}| \\sim \\sqrt{N}$). The support of the resulting measure $\\mu$ can be shown to be a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension $1/2$.\n    *   **Randomized Constructions:** Another approach involves randomized constructions of Cantor-like sets, where at each step of the construction, intervals are chosen randomly in a way that ensures the Sidon property holds with high probability for the resulting set, which can also be shown to have dimension $1/2$.\n    *   **Explicit Constructions:** There are also explicit, but very intricate, constructions of Cantor sets whose digits in a base-$b$ expansion are carefully restricted to enforce the Sidon property while maintaining a dimension of $1/2$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion of Achievability:** The existence of these constructions confirms that the upper bound of $1/2$ is sharp, meaning it can be achieved.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from Step 2 and Step 3:\n*   The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0,1]$ is at most $1/2$.\n*   There exist Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly $1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
