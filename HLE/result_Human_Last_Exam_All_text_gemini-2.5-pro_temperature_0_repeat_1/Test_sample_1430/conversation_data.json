    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**Step 1: Relate the Néron-Severi rank of the symmetric power to the Jacobian.**\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g` defined over the complex numbers `C`. Let `X = C^(n)` be its `n`-th symmetric power, which is the variety of effective divisors of degree `n` on `C`. The Néron-Severi group of `X`, denoted `NS(X)`, is the group of divisor classes on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, `ρ(X)`, is the Picard number of `X`.\n\nThere is a fundamental formula relating the Picard number of `C^(n)` to the Picard number of the Jacobian of `C`, `J(C)`. The Abel-Jacobi map `u: C^(n) -> J(C)` defined by `D -> [D - nP_0]` (for a fixed point `P_0` on `C`) plays a key role. The Picard group `Pic(C^(n))` is generated by the pullback of `Pic(J(C))` and a specific divisor class, often denoted `Θ`. This leads to the formula for their ranks:\n\n`ρ(C^(n)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nIn our problem, `C` is a genus 3 curve (`g=3`) and `X = C^(15)` (`n=15`). So, the formula becomes:\n\n`ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = 1 + ρ(J(C))`\n\nTherefore, finding the smallest and largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is equivalent to finding the smallest and largest possible rank of `NS(J(C))` as `C` varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Néron-Severi rank of the Jacobian to its endomorphism algebra.**\n\nFor an abelian variety `A` over the complex numbers, its Néron-Severi group `NS(A)` is a finitely generated abelian group. Its rank `ρ(A)` is given by the dimension of the `Q`-vector space `NS(A) ⊗ Q`.\n\nA key result, due to Mumford, states that for a principally polarized abelian variety (PPAV) `A`, the space `NS(A) ⊗ Q` is isomorphic to the space of symmetric elements in the endomorphism algebra `End^0(A) = End(A) ⊗ Q` with respect to the Rosati involution induced by the principal polarization. Let's denote this space by `End^0(A)_s`.\n\n`ρ(A) = dim_Q(End^0(A)_s)`\n\nThe Jacobian `J(C)` of a curve `C` is a PPAV. Thus, we need to find the minimum and maximum possible values of `dim_Q(End^0(J(C))_s)` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the smallest possible rank of `NS(J(C))`**\n\nFor a generic Riemann surface `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = Z`. These are the endomorphisms given by multiplication by an integer.\n\nIn this case, the endomorphism algebra is `End^0(J(C)) = Q`. The Rosati involution acts as the identity on `Q`. Therefore, the entire algebra consists of symmetric elements:\n\n`End^0(J(C))_s = Q`\n\nThe dimension of this space is:\n\n`ρ(J(C)) = dim_Q(Q) = 1`\n\nSince the polarization class itself is a non-trivial element of `NS(J(C))`, the rank must be at least 1. Thus, the minimum possible rank is 1.\n\nFor the smallest rank of `NS(X)`, we have:\n`ρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the largest possible rank of `NS(J(C))`**\n\nThe rank of `NS(J(C))` is maximized when `J(C)` has a large endomorphism algebra, which occurs for very special curves. These are curves whose Jacobians are non-simple (isogenous to a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties) and/or have complex multiplication (CM).\n\nLet's consider the case where `J(C)` is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves, `J(C) ~ E_1 × E_2 × E_3`. To maximize the endomorphisms, we should consider the case where the elliptic curves are isogenous to each other, i.e., `J(C) ~ E^3` for some elliptic curve `E`.\n\nIn this case, `End^0(J(C)) ≅ M_3(K)`, where `K = End^0(E)`. The Rosati involution on `M_3(K)` is of the form `M' = Φ⁻¹ M*ᵀ Φ`, where `*` is the involution on `K` (conjugation) and `Φ` is a `3×3` matrix representing the polarization. The space of symmetric elements `{M | M = M'}` is the space of `Φ`-hermitian matrices. The dimension of this space is independent of `Φ` and depends only on `K`.\n\nThe dimension can be calculated as `dim_Q(End^0(J(C))_s) = (n²[K:Q] + n * tr_K(*))/2`, where `n=3`.\n\n*   **Case 1: E has no Complex Multiplication.**\n    `K = Q`. The involution `*` is the identity. `[K:Q]=1` and `tr_K(*)=1`.\n    `ρ(J(C)) = (3² * 1 + 3 * 1) / 2 = (9 + 3) / 2 = 6`.\n\n*   **Case 2: E has Complex Multiplication.**\n    `K` is an imaginary quadratic field, e.g., `K = Q(i)`. The involution `*` is complex conjugation. `[K:Q]=2`. The trace of complex conjugation on `K` over `Q` is `tr_K(*)=0`.\n    `ρ(J(C)) = (3² * 2 + 3 * 0) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9`.\n\nThe maximum value of `ρ(J(C))` appears to be 9. For this to be the true maximum, there must exist a genus 3 curve `C` such that its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of a CM elliptic curve. A famous example is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴`. This is a genus 3 curve, and its Jacobian is isogenous to `E³`, where `E` is the elliptic curve `y² = x³ - x` which has CM by `Z[i]`.\n\nThus, the maximum possible rank `ρ(J(C))` is 9.\n\nFor the largest rank of `NS(X)`, we have:\n`ρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` occurs for a generic genus 3 curve `C`, where `ρ(J(C)) = 1`. This gives `ρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   The largest possible rank of `NS(X)` occurs for a special genus 3 curve like the Fermat quartic, where `ρ(J(C)) = 9`. This gives `ρ_max(X) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
