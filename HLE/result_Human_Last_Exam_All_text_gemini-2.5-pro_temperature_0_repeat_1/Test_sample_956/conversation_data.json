    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the group G**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ of the set $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$, which has size 12. Thus, $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$.\n\nThe generators are:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nFirst, let's determine if these generators are even or odd permutations. The signature of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$.\n*   $a$ is an 11-cycle. Its signature is $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = 1$. So, $a$ is an even permutation.\n*   $b$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. The signature of a 4-cycle is $(-1)^{4-1} = -1$. The signature of $b$ is $(-1) \\times (-1) = 1$. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n*   $c$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions). The signature of a transposition is $-1$. The signature of $c$ is $(-1)^6 = 1$. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all three generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, any element of the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ must also be an even permutation. Therefore, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of G**\n\nTo identify $G$, we can analyze its action on the set $S$.\nLet's check if the action is transitive. The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle that connects the 11 elements $\\{1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x\\}$. The generator $c$ connects the element 3 (which is in the orbit of 1) to the element $z$ via the transposition $(3, z)$. This means that $z$ is also in the orbit of 1. Therefore, all 12 elements of $S$ are in a single orbit, and the action of $G$ on $S$ is transitive.\n\nNow, let's use the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem. Let's find the stabilizer of the point $z$, denoted $G_z = \\{g \\in G \\mid g(z) = z\\}$.\nFrom the definitions of the generators, we see that $a(z) = z$ and $b(z) = z$. Therefore, $a \\in G_z$ and $b \\in G_z$. This implies that the subgroup $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $G_z$.\n\nThe group $H$ acts on the set $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, which has 11 elements.\n*   $a$ is an 11-cycle on $S'$. This means $H$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_{11}$.\n*   Both $a$ and $b$ are even permutations on $S'$, so $H$ is a subgroup of $A_{11}$.\n\nA transitive subgroup of $A_p$ for a prime $p$ that contains a $p$-cycle is, by a theorem of Jordan, either the full group $A_p$ or a subgroup of the affine group $AGL(1, p)$. The group $AGL(1, 11)$ has order $11 \\cdot (11-1) = 110$. The group $H$ contains an element $b$ of order 4. The group $AGL(1,11)$ contains elements of order dividing 10 and 11, but not 4 (since $4 \\nmid 10$). Thus, $H$ cannot be a subgroup of $AGL(1, 11)$.\nTherefore, $H$ must be the alternating group $A_{11}$.\n\nSo we have $A_{11} = H \\le G_z$. Since $G_z$ is a subgroup of $S_{11}$, the only possibilities for $G_z$ are $A_{11}$ or $S_{11}$.\nIf $G_z = S_{11}$, then there would be an element $g \\in G_z$ which is an odd permutation on $S'$. This element $g$, as an element of $G \\le S_{12}$, would fix $z$ and thus have the same signature, i.e., $\\text{sgn}(g) = -1$. This would mean $G$ contains an odd permutation, which contradicts our earlier finding that $G \\le A_{12}$.\nTherefore, $G_z$ must be $A_{11}$.\n\nNow, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the order of $G$ is:\n$|G| = |\\text{Orb}_G(z)| \\cdot |G_z| = 12 \\cdot |A_{11}| = 12 \\cdot \\frac{11!}{2} = \\frac{12!}{2} = |A_{12}|$.\nSince $G$ is a subgroup of $A_{12}$ and has the same order as $A_{12}$, we must have $G = A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Schur Multiplier of G**\n\nThe question asks for the Schur multiplier of $G$, which we denote by $A$. So, $A = M(G) = M(A_{12})$.\nThe Schur multipliers of the alternating groups are well-known. A theorem by Schur states that for $n \\ge 4$, the Schur multiplier $M(A_n)$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$, except for the cases $n=6$ and $n=7$, where it is $C_6$.\nSince we have $n=12$, which is greater than 8, the general result applies.\nSo, the Schur multiplier of $G=A_{12}$ is $A = C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is the cyclic group of order 2, $C_2$. Let's list its subgroups.\nA group of order 2 has only two subgroups:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, containing only the identity element: $\\{e\\}$. Its order is 1.\n2.  The group itself, $C_2$. Its order is 2.\n\nA proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup except the group itself. For $A=C_2$, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*.\nThe trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 1, $C_1$.\nSince this is the only proper subgroup, there is only one isomorphism class of proper subgroups.\nTherefore, the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism, is 1."
