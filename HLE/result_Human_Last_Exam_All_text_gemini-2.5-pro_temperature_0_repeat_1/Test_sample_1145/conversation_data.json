    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and the final answer acquisition.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the System and State:** The problem concerns a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well (a \"box\") of length `a`. The particle is in the second energy eigenstate, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n2.  **Recall the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by the formula:\n    ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n    For the n=2 state, the wavefunction is:\n    ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx / a)\n3.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a position `x` is given by the probability density, P(x), which is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (√(2/a) * sin(2πx / a))² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n4.  **Define the Interval:** The question asks for the probability of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n5.  **Set up the Probability Integral:** The probability of finding the particle within this interval is the definite integral of the probability density over the interval:\n    Prob = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Node at the Center:** The interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered at x = 0.5a. For the n=2 state, x = a/2 is a node, meaning the wavefunction and the probability density are zero at this point (sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0).\n2.  **Approximation Validity:** Because the probability density is zero at the center of the small interval, the simple approximation `Prob ≈ P(center) * Δx` is invalid, as it would incorrectly yield a probability of zero.\n3.  **Integration Technique:** The integral involves a `sin²` term. It's best to use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2` to simplify the integrand before integration.\n4.  **Catastrophic Cancellation:** When evaluating the definite integral, the result involves the subtraction of two very close numbers. Direct calculation with limited precision can lead to significant rounding errors (catastrophic cancellation). Using a Taylor series expansion for the resulting expression is a more robust method to find the numerical value.\n5.  **Taylor Series of the Integrand:** An alternative and effective method is to approximate the integrand itself using a Taylor series around the center of the interval (x = 0.5a). Since the function and its first derivative are zero at this point, the expansion must be taken to at least the second-order term.\n6.  **Unit Consistency:** The final probability must be a dimensionless quantity. All instances of the box length `a` should cancel out during the calculation.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nWe will solve the problem using a Taylor series expansion of the integrand, which is the most direct way to handle the node at the center of the interval.\n\n**Step 1: Approximate the Probability Density P(x) near x = 0.5a**\n\nWe expand P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) in a Taylor series around x₀ = 0.5a.\nLet `x = 0.5a + δ`, where `δ` is a small displacement.\nP(0.5a + δ) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a + δ) / a)\n= (2/a) * sin²(π + 2πδ / a)\nUsing the identity sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ), we get:\n= (2/a) * [-sin(2πδ / a)]² = (2/a) * sin²(2πδ / a)\n\nFor a small argument `u`, sin(u) ≈ u. Here, `u = 2πδ / a` is small.\nP(0.5a + δ) ≈ (2/a) * (2πδ / a)²\nP(0.5a + δ) ≈ (2/a) * (4π²δ² / a²) = (8π² / a³) * δ²\n\n**Step 2: Integrate the Approximated Density**\n\nThe interval for `x` is [0.495a, 0.505a]. This corresponds to an interval for `δ = x - 0.5a` from -0.005a to +0.005a.\nProb ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π² / a³) * δ² dδ\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral**\n\nProb ≈ (8π² / a³) * [δ³/3] evaluated from -0.005a to 0.005a\nProb ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nProb ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [2 * (0.005a)³]\nProb ≈ (8π² / (3a³)) * [2 * (0.005)³ * a³]\nThe `a³` terms cancel out, as expected.\nProb ≈ (16π² / 3) * (0.005)³\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Value**\n\nProb ≈ (16 * π² / 3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³\nProb ≈ (16 * 9.8696044 / 3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)\nProb ≈ (52.63789) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)\nProb ≈ 6579.736 x 10⁻⁹\nProb ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThis result can be confirmed by carefully evaluating the exact integral using a Taylor series for the final expression, which yields Prob ≈ (2/3)π²(0.01)³, giving the same numerical value.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
