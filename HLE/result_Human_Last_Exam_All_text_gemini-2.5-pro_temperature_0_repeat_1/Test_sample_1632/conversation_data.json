    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for `a(10)`, which represents the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid. From any point (x, y), you can move one unit in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right, to an adjacent point.\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of `n` consecutive moves on the lattice.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed point (conventionally, the origin (0,0)).\n\n### Step 2: Analysis for Small Values of n\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to understand the process. We assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **For n = 1:**\n    *   From (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All 4 are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   So, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **For n = 2:**\n    *   We can extend each of the 4 1-step walks.\n    *   Let's take the walk that went to (1,0). From (1,0), we can move to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). We cannot move back to (0,0) as that would violate the self-avoiding rule.\n    *   So, there are 3 valid moves for the second step.\n    *   Since there were 4 choices for the first step, and each has 3 choices for the second, the total number of 2-step SAWs is 4 * 3 = 12.\n    *   So, **a(2) = 12**.\n\n*   **For n = 3:**\n    *   We extend the 12 2-step walks. These walks are of two different shapes:\n        1.  \"Straight\" walks (e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0)). There are 4 such walks (one for each initial direction).\n        2.  \"Turned\" walks (e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)). There are 4 * 2 = 8 such walks.\n    *   For each \"straight\" walk, the endpoint is 2 units away from the origin. There are 3 valid moves for the third step (e.g., from (2,0), moves to (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1) are all valid). This gives 4 * 3 = 12 new walks.\n    *   For each \"turned\" walk, the endpoint is at a location like (1,1). There are 3 valid moves for the third step (e.g., from (1,1), moves to (2,1), (1,2), (0,1) are all valid as none of them revisit (0,0) or (1,0)). This gives 8 * 3 = 24 new walks.\n    *   The total number of 3-step SAWs is 12 + 24 = 36.\n    *   So, **a(3) = 36**.\n\n*   **For n = 4:**\n    *   This is where it gets more complicated. We must extend the 36 3-step walks.\n    *   Consider a walk like (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). The path has visited (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), and (0,1).\n    *   From the endpoint (0,1), the possible next moves are to (1,1), (-1,1), and (0,2).\n    *   However, the point (1,1) has already been visited. Therefore, only 2 extensions are possible for this specific walk.\n    *   Because some paths can \"turn back\" towards previously visited points, we can no longer simply multiply by 3. We must check each path individually.\n\n### Step 3: The Challenge for Larger n\nAs `n` increases, manual enumeration becomes infeasible due to two factors:\n1.  The number of walks grows exponentially.\n2.  The number of ways a walk can intersect itself increases, making the counting for each extension more complex.\n\nThere is no known simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`. The values are determined through sophisticated computer algorithms that enumerate all possible paths.\n\n### Step 4: Using Known Results\nThis is a famous problem in combinatorics and statistical mechanics. The sequence `a(n)` is well-documented. It is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. We can use the known values from this sequence.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the established, computationally-verified sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, the value for n=10 is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
