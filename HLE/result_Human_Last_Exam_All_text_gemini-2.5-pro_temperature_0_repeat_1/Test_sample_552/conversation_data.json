    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific person whose *lectures* were *cited* by Albert Einstein in his specific *1905 paper on Brownian motion*.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the 1905 Brownian Motion Paper**\nEinstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). A notable feature of this paper, and Einstein's other papers from his \"miracle year,\" is the almost complete lack of formal citations, such as footnotes or a bibliography. He preferred to build his arguments from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the word \"Cite\"**\nGiven the absence of formal citations in the paper, the word \"cite\" in the question must be interpreted more broadly than a simple bibliographic reference. It likely means \"to refer to, build upon, or use the foundational work of\". The question is asking about the intellectual foundation of the paper.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Theoretical Framework**\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics. It explains the random jiggling of pollen grains in water (Brownian motion) as direct evidence of the existence of atoms and molecules. The paper's entire argument is based on the principles of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, which uses statistics to describe the behavior of large numbers of atoms.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the Framework to a Physicist**\nThe primary architect of the statistical mechanics framework that Einstein utilized was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Boltzmann's life's work was to establish the statistical foundations of thermodynamics, famously connecting entropy to probability with the equation S = k log W (the Boltzmann principle).\n\n**Step 6: Connect to \"Lectures\"**\nWhile Einstein never attended Boltzmann's lectures in person, he studied Boltzmann's work intensely on his own. A major source for this was Boltzmann's famous book, **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**. Einstein's 1905 paper is a direct and brilliant application of the principles laid out by Boltzmann in these published lectures. Therefore, while not a formal citation, the entire paper is an intellectual \"citation\" of the work Boltzmann presented in his lectures.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **No Formal Citation:** It is crucial to understand that there is no footnote or bibliographic entry for Boltzmann in Einstein's paper. The \"citation\" is implicit in the use of Boltzmann's foundational ideas.\n*   **Published Lectures:** The reference is to Boltzmann's published work, specifically his book \"Lectures on Gas Theory,\" not to lectures Einstein personally attended.\n*   **Intellectual Debt:** The question probes the intellectual lineage of Einstein's idea, acknowledging his debt to Boltzmann's pioneering work in statistical mechanics.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the person whose lectures were foundational to Einstein's paper was Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
