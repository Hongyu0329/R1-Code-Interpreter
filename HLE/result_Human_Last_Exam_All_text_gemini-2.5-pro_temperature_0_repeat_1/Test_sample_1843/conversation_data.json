    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime factorization of $N$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character modulo $p^a$.\n\n### Step 3: Condition on the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This imposes two conditions on the orders of the component characters, $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  Each order $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. That is, $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  The lcm of the orders must be exactly 6. This means that at least one order must be divisible by 2, and at least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Count Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Modulus\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ for each factor of $N$, whose order divides 6. Let $n_d(m)$ be the number of primitive characters of order $d$ modulo $m$.\n\nThe number of characters of order $d$ modulo $m$ is $\\phi(d)$ if $d$ divides $\\phi(m)$, and 0 otherwise. A character modulo $p^a$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo $p^{a-1}$. The number of primitive characters of order $d$ modulo $p^a$ is given by $n_d(p^a) = (\\text{number of chars of order } d \\text{ mod } p^a) - (\\text{number of chars of order } d \\text{ mod } p^{a-1})$.\n\n*   **Modulus $4 = 2^2$**:\n    The group of characters mod 4 is of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2.\n    So, for $\\chi_4$, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4)=2$. There is $n_2(4)=1$ such character.\n\n*   **Modulus $9 = 3^2$**:\n    $\\phi(9) = 3^2(1-1/3) = 6$. $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    The possible orders $d$ for primitive characters must divide $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    $n_d(9) = (\\phi(d) \\text{ if } d|6) - (\\phi(d) \\text{ if } d|2)$.\n    -   $d=2$: $n_2(9) = \\phi(2) - \\phi(2) = 1-1=0$.\n    -   $d=3$: $n_3(9) = \\phi(3) - 0 = 2$ (since $3 \\nmid \\phi(3)=2$).\n    -   $d=6$: $n_6(9) = \\phi(6) - 0 = 2$ (since $6 \\nmid \\phi(3)=2$).\n    The possible orders for $\\chi_9$ are 3 and 6. The total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $n_3(9) + n_6(9) = 2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Modulus $7$**:\n    $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The orders $d$ must divide 6.\n    -   $n_2(7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   $n_3(7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   $n_6(7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The possible orders for $\\chi_7$ are 2, 3, and 6. The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulus $11$**:\n    $\\phi(11)=10$. The order $d$ of a primitive character must divide 10. We also need $d$ to divide 6. So $d$ must divide $\\text{gcd}(6, 10) = 2$.\n    -   $n_2(11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    The only possible order for $\\chi_{11}$ is 2. There is $n_2(11)=1$ such character.\n\n*   **Modulus $13$**:\n    $\\phi(13)=12$. The order $d$ must divide 12 and 6, so $d$ must divide 6.\n    -   $n_2(13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    -   $n_3(13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    -   $n_6(13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    The possible orders for $\\chi_{13}$ are 2, 3, and 6. The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results\nWe need to choose one primitive character for each prime power factor, such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let's summarize the number of available choices for each component:\n-   For $\\chi_4$: 1 choice, order is 2.\n-   For $\\chi_9$: 4 choices, orders are 3 or 6.\n-   For $\\chi_7$: 5 choices, orders are 2, 3, or 6.\n-   For $\\chi_{11}$: 1 choice, order is 2.\n-   For $\\chi_{13}$: 5 choices, orders are 2, 3, or 6.\n\nLet the chosen orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. We need to check if $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\n1.  **Divisibility by 2**: Since the only choice for $\\chi_4$ has order 2, $o_4=2$. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 2.\n2.  **Divisibility by 3**: The choices for $\\chi_9$ have orders 3 or 6. In either case, $o_9$ is divisible by 3. Thus, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always divisible by 2 and 3, it is always divisible by 6. Furthermore, since each individual order $o_i$ is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also divide 6. A number that is a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, for any combination of choices of the component characters, the resulting character $\\chi$ will have an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
