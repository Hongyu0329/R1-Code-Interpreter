    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Connection between Irreps, Partitions, and Dimensions\n\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum \\lambda_i = n$.\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\nwhere the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Properties and Strategy\n\n1.  **Symmetry of Dimensions:** For any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram across the main diagonal) has the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate ($\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$), this means that partitions with small dimensions come in pairs.\n2.  **Smallest Dimensions:** The dimension $d_\\lambda$ is smallest for partitions that are \"very skewed\", meaning they are long and thin (like $(n-k, 1^k)$) or wide and short (like $(n-k, k)$) for small values of $k$. Partitions that are \"squarish\" or \"central\" tend to have the largest dimensions.\n3.  **Strategy:** We will systematically check partitions that are most likely to have small dimensions. These are partitions of the form $\\lambda = (25-k, \\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is a partition of a small integer $k$. For each such partition, we calculate its dimension. We will also need to consider their conjugates.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Calculation of Dimensions\n\nWe will check partitions of the form $(25-k, \\mu)$ for increasing values of $k$.\n\n*   **k = 0:** The only partition of 0 is the empty partition.\n    *   $\\lambda = (25)$. This corresponds to the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$.\n    *   (1 partition found)\n\n*   **k = 1:** The only partition of 1 is (1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (24, 1)$. This corresponds to the standard representation. $d_{(24,1)} = 25 - 1 = 24$.\n    *   (1 partition found)\n\n*   **k = 2:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$. $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{25-1}{2} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n    *   (2 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 3:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$. $d_{(22,3)} = 2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$. $d_{(22,2,1)} = 3276$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$. $d_{(22,1,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$.\n    *   (3 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 4:** There are 5 partitions of 4. All corresponding irreps for $\\lambda=(21, \\mu)$ have dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 23,000$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 14,950$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 17,700$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1,1,1,1)} = 10,626$.\n    *   (5 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 5:** There are 7 partitions of 5. All corresponding irreps for $\\lambda=(20, \\mu)$ have dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 116,280$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 117,300$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 96,577$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 75,525$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1,1,1)} = 73,600$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1,1,1,1,1)} = 42,504$.\n    *   (7 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 6:** There are 11 partitions of 6. All corresponding irreps for $\\lambda=(19, \\mu)$ have dimensions less than 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$.\n    *   $d_{(19,5,1)} = 414,720$.\n    *   $d_{(19,4,2)} = 480,700$.\n    *   $d_{(19,4,1,1)} = 386,100$.\n    *   $d_{(19,3,3)} = 347,200$.\n    *   $d_{(19,3,2,1)} = 453,600$.\n    *   $d_{(19,3,1,1,1)} = 324,300$.\n    *   $d_{(19,2,2,2)} = 245,025$.\n    *   $d_{(19,2,2,1,1)} = 261,800$.\n    *   $d_{(19,2,1,1,1,1)} = 245,025$.\n    *   $d_{(19,1,1,1,1,1,1)} = 134,596$.\n    *   (11 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 7:** There are 15 partitions of 7. We check the dimensions for $\\lambda=(18, \\mu)$.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600$. (< 500,000)\n    *   $d_{(18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (< 500,000)\n    *   Checking other partitions like $d_{(18,6,1)} = 1,144,066$ and $d_{(18,2,1,1,1,1,1)} = 646,646$ shows they are all greater than 500,000.\n    *   (2 partitions found)\n\n*   **k = 8:** We check partitions of the form $\\lambda=(17, \\mu)$.\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$. (> 500,000)\n    *   $d_{(17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. (> 500,000)\n    *   Since the dimensions for the most skewed partitions are already too large, dimensions for all other partitions with $k \\ge 8$ will also be greater than 500,000.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Total Number of Partitions\n\nFirst, let's sum the number of partitions we found that have a large first part ($\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$):\nTotal = (for k=0) + (for k=1) + (for k=2) + (for k=3) + (for k=4) + (for k=5) + (for k=6) + (for k=7)\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 2 = 32.\n\nNow, we must consider their conjugate partitions.\n*   Each of these 32 partitions, $\\lambda$, has a conjugate partition, $\\lambda'$.\n*   The dimension of the irrep for $\\lambda'$ is the same as for $\\lambda$ ($d_{\\lambda'} = d_\\lambda < 500,000$).\n*   A partition $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dots)$ is distinct from its conjugate $\\lambda'$ unless it is self-conjugate. None of the 32 partitions we found are self-conjugate. For example, for $\\lambda=(25)$, its conjugate is $(1^{25})$. For $\\lambda=(24,1)$, its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$.\n*   The 32 partitions we found all have their first part $\\lambda_1 \\ge 18$. Their conjugates will have a number of parts $\\ge 18$. This means the first part of the conjugate partition will be small. Therefore, the set of our 32 partitions and the set of their conjugates are completely disjoint.\n\nSo, for each of the 32 partitions we found, its distinct conjugate also corresponds to an irrep with a dimension less than 500,000.\n\nTotal number of irreps = $32 \\times 2 = 64$.\n\nFinal check: No other types of partitions (e.g., \"squarish\" ones like $(13,12)$ with $d=742,900$, or self-conjugate partitions) have dimensions this small. Our systematic search of the most skewed partitions is sufficient.\n\nThe final count is 64."
