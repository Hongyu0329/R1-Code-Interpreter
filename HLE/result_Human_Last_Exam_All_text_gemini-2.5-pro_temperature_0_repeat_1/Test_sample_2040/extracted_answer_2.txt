No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The most common and stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) is zero, thus forbidding this process.
