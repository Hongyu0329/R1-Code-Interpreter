    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single photon of higher energy (called the \"pump\" photon, frequency $\\omega_p$) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons, frequencies $\\omega_s$ and $\\omega_i$).\n*   **Governing Principles:**\n    *   **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the pump photon equals the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons.  \n        $\\hbar\\omega_p = \\hbar\\omega_s + \\hbar\\omega_i$\n    *   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** The momentum of the pump photon equals the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons.  \n        $\\vec{k}_p = \\vec{k}_s + \\vec{k}_i$\n*   **Material Requirement:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect. The strength of this interaction is determined by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two). A material must have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ to exhibit SPDC.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Condition for a Non-Zero $\\chi^{(2)}$**\n\n*   **Crystal Symmetry:** The key factor that determines whether a material has a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is its crystal structure symmetry.\n*   **Inversion Symmetry:** In materials that possess a center of inversion (i.e., they are centrosymmetric), the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ is identically zero. This is because in a centrosymmetric medium, reversing the direction of the applied electric field must simply reverse the direction of the induced polarization. A $\\chi^{(2)}$ term would introduce a component to the polarization that does not reverse sign, which is forbidden by this symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion for SPDC:** Therefore, a fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must have a **non-centrosymmetric** crystal structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets**\n\n*   **Borophene:** Free-standing boron nanosheets are also known as \"borophene,\" the 2D allotrope of boron.\n*   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has a single, highly stable honeycomb structure, borophene is highly polymorphic. This means it can exist in many different atomic arrangements (phases).\n*   **Common Structures:** The most widely studied and experimentally synthesized phases of borophene (typically grown on a silver substrate, but the properties of the free-standing sheets are considered here) are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases. The \"striped\" phase is also a common theoretical and experimental structure.\n*   **Symmetry of Common Phases:**\n    *   The **$\\beta_{12}$** phase has a rectangular unit cell with space group *Pmmm*.\n    *   The **$\\chi_3$** phase has a rectangular unit cell with space group *Pmmn*.\n    *   The **striped** phase also has a rectangular unit cell, typically with space group *Pmmn*.\n*   **Checking for Inversion Symmetry:** The space groups *Pmmm* and *Pmmn* are both **centrosymmetric**. This means that the ideal, defect-free crystal structures of the most common and stable forms of borophene possess a center of inversion.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Answer the Question**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A material can only have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ if its crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry (is non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases, have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because these structures are centrosymmetric, their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero by symmetry.\n5.  Therefore, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Free-standing\":** The question specifies \"free-standing,\" which is crucial. If the nanosheet were on a substrate, the interaction with the substrate could break the inversion symmetry and potentially induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, for a free-standing sheet, we consider its intrinsic symmetry.\n*   **Edges and Defects:** While the bulk of the material is centrosymmetric, the edges of the nanosheet, as well as any point or line defects, inherently break this symmetry. This can lead to a very weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ effect at these specific sites, but it would not be a bulk property of the material and would not lead to efficient SPDC as seen in conventional nonlinear crystals.\n*   **Strain:** Applying mechanical strain could potentially distort the lattice in a way that breaks the inversion symmetry, which might induce a $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. However, without such external perturbations, the material is not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n*   **Higher-Order Effects:** It is important not to confuse second-order effects with third-order effects ($\\chi^{(3)}$), which can occur in all materials, including centrosymmetric ones. SPDC is fundamentally a $\\chi^{(2)}$ process.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the symmetry properties of the most stable forms of borophene, they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The most common and stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is zero, thus forbidding this process.>>>"
