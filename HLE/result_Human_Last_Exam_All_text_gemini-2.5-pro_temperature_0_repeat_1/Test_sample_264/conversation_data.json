    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry and Coordinate System**\n\n*   We have two identical cubes, each with a side length of 1.\n*   Let's place the first cube, C1, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Its vertices are at coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are either 0 or 1. This cube occupies the space defined by the inequalities:\n    *   C1: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n*   The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\n**2. Interpret the Shift**\n\n*   The second cube, C2, is shifted \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to C1. This phrasing can be ambiguous, so we must choose the most logical interpretation.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The shift *distance* (magnitude of the shift vector) is 1/2. The shift vector would be **v** = (1/2) * (unit vector of **d**) = (1/2) * (1,1,1)/√3. This leads to irrational coordinates and a complex final volume, which is unlikely for this type of problem.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The shift vector has components of 1/2 along each axis, i.e., **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This vector is parallel to the main diagonal **d** = (1, 1, 1). The magnitude of this shift is ||(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)|| = √( (1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)² ) = √(3/4) = √3/2. This distance is exactly half the length of the main diagonal (which has length √3). This interpretation is standard for such problems and leads to a clean, rational result.\n*   We will proceed with Interpretation B, where the shift vector is **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**3. Define the Second Cube (C2)**\n\n*   The second cube, C2, is simply the first cube, C1, translated by the vector **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the space it occupies, we add 1/2 to the boundaries of C1.\n    *   C2: 0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n    *   C2: 0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n    *   C2: 0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n**4. Determine the Region of Intersection**\n\n*   The intersection of the two cubes is the volume that satisfies the inequalities for *both* C1 and C2. We find the overlapping interval for each coordinate.\n    *   **For x:** The region must satisfy (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2). The common interval is **1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1**.\n    *   **For y:** The region must satisfy (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2). The common interval is **1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1**.\n    *   **For z:** The region must satisfy (0 ≤ z ≤ 1) AND (1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2). The common interval is **1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n\n*   The intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube) defined by the inequalities found in the previous step.\n*   The side lengths of this intersection cube are:\n    *   Side length in x = (upper bound) - (lower bound) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   Side length in y = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   Side length in z = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   The volume of a cube is (side length)³.\n*   Volume of intersection = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = **1/8**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpreting the Shift:** The most critical step is correctly interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". Choosing the shift vector as (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is the standard and most logical approach.\n*   **Defining Boundaries:** Clearly define the inequalities for both cubes before finding the intersection.\n*   **Finding Overlap:** The intersection of two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] is [max(a, c), min(b, d)]. Applying this to each coordinate simplifies finding the intersection's boundaries.\n*   **Final Shape:** The intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is always an axis-aligned rectangular prism (or empty). In this case, it happens to be a smaller cube.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated as the product of the side lengths of the intersection region.\nVolume = (1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
