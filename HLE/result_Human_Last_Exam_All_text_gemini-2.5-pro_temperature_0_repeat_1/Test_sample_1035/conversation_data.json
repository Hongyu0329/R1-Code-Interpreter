    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where \\( n = 35 \\).\n\n*   **Complete Graph \\( K_n \\):** A graph with \\( n \\) vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. \\( K_{35} \\) has 35 vertices and \\( \\binom{35}{2} = \\frac{35 \\times 34}{2} = 595 \\) edges.\n*   **Family of bipartite graphs covering \\( K_n \\):** This means we have a set of bipartite graphs \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\} \\). Each \\( G_i \\) is a subgraph of \\( K_n \\). The union of the edge sets of all \\( G_i \\) must be the edge set of \\( K_n \\). That is, \\( E(K_n) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) \\).\n*   **\"Minimum number of vertices in a family\":** This phrase is slightly ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations.\n    1.  The size of the union of vertex sets, \\( |\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(G_i)| \\). To cover all edges of \\( K_n \\), every vertex of \\( K_n \\) must be part of at least one edge, and therefore must belong to the vertex set of at least one \\( G_i \\). This means the union of the vertex sets must be the entire vertex set of \\( K_n \\). So, this value would simply be \\( n = 35 \\). This interpretation makes the problem trivial.\n    2.  The sum of the number of vertices in each graph, \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)| \\). This is a more standard and challenging problem in extremal graph theory. It asks for the minimum total number of vertex \"memberships\" across all the bipartite graphs in the covering family. This is the most likely intended meaning of the question.\n\nWe will proceed with the second, more standard interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Formalizing the Problem\nWe want to find the minimum value of \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)| \\) over all families of bipartite subgraphs \\( \\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\} \\) of \\( K_n \\) such that their edges cover all edges of \\( K_n \\).\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the minimum sum of orders of a **biclique cover** of \\( K_n \\). A biclique is a complete bipartite graph. Any bipartite graph \\( G_i \\) with bipartition \\( (X_i, Y_i) \\) can be made into a biclique by adding all missing edges between \\( X_i \\) and \\( Y_i \\). This process does not remove any edges, so if the original family of bipartite graphs covered \\( K_n \\), the new family of bicliques also covers \\( K_n \\). The vertex sets remain the same, so the sum of orders does not change. Thus, we can focus on covering \\( K_n \\) with bicliques.\n\n### Step 3: Citing the Relevant Mathematical Result\nThis is a known problem in graph theory. The minimum sum of the orders of bicliques in a biclique cover of \\( K_n \\) is given by the formula:\n$$ \\min \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil $$\nwhere \\( \\{B_i\\} \\) is a biclique cover of \\( K_n \\). This result was established by H. Tverberg and is related to work by G. O. H. Katona on separating systems.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Formula to the Specific Case\nWe are given \\( n = 35 \\). We need to calculate \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\nWe can look at the powers of 2:\n*   \\( 2^4 = 16 \\)\n*   \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n*   \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\nSince \\( 32 < 35 \\leq 64 \\), we know that \\( \\log_2 32 < \\log_2 35 \\leq \\log_2 64 \\), which means \\( 5 < \\log_2 35 \\leq 6 \\).\nThe ceiling function \\( \\lceil x \\rceil \\) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\( x \\). Therefore:\n$$ \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the final answer:\n$$ \\text{Minimum sum of vertices} = n \\times \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n$$ 35 \\times 6 = 210 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Correct Interpretation:** The crucial first step is to correctly interpret the ambiguous phrase \"number of vertices in a family\". The context of graph covering problems strongly suggests it means the sum of the orders of the graphs, not the size of the union of their vertex sets.\n2.  **Covering vs. Partitioning:** The problem asks for a \"covering\", meaning edges can be in multiple bipartite graphs. A \"partition\" would require each edge to be in exactly one graph. The formula \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) is the minimum for both covering and partitioning problems, which strengthens the confidence in the result.\n3.  **Bipartite Graphs vs. Bicliques:** The problem can be simplified by considering bicliques instead of general bipartite graphs without changing the result, as explained in Step 2.\n4.  **Logarithm Calculation:** Ensure the base of the logarithm is correct (base 2) and that the ceiling function is applied correctly. For \\( n=35 \\), \\( \\log_2 35 \\approx 5.129 \\), so \\( \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
