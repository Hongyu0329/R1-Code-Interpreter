The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is that it is an active device designed for safety. Most coils incorporate an active detuning circuit (usually involving PIN diodes) that defaults to a "safe," non-resonant state when disconnected from the scanner. This circuit requires a specific DC control signal from the MRI system to switch the coil into its resonant "receive" mode. Without this signal, the coil is intentionally non-resonant to prevent damage and patient burns during the transmit phase of a scan. Other contributing factors include the coil's dependence on a specific preamplifier impedance for proper resonance and the difficulty of coupling a probe to the complex, localized fields of modern phased-array coils.
