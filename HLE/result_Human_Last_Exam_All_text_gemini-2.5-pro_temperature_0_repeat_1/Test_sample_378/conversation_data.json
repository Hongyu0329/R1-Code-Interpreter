    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the specific year when a person named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Individuals Involved**\nThe name in the question appears to be a combination of two very prominent figures in Nigerian history:\n*   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** He served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015. His full, official name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n*   **Nnamdi Azikiwe:** He was a leading figure in Nigeria's independence movement and served as the first President of Nigeria from 1963 to 1966. His surname is Azikiwe.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\"**\nA critical point to check is whether \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n*   **Careful Point:** Official records, biographical information, and news reports consistently refer to the former president as Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his legal or commonly known name. He is of the Ijaw ethnic group, while Nnamdi Azikiwe was of the Igbo ethnic group. There is no known familial relationship between them.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the Core Claim**\nThe question claims that Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". This would have been a major political and public event.\n*   **Careful Point:** A thorough search of credible news archives, official presidential speeches, and historical records from his time in office (and before/after) reveals no instance of Goodluck Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\" or attempting to add the name to his own.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate a Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the premise of the question is incorrect.\n*   Goodluck Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe\".\n*   There is no public record of him ever identifying himself by that name.\n*   The question is likely based on a confusion between two different Nigerian presidents.\n\nTherefore, since the event never occurred, there is no year to provide.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name Azikiwe belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. The question is based on a false premise.>>>"
