    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in Major League Baseball refers to a batter leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific offensive categories in the same season. These categories are:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List All Triple Crown Winners\nWe need to compile a complete list of every player who has accomplished this feat in either the American League (AL) or the National League (NL).\n\n**American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb (Detroit Tigers)\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx (Philadelphia Athletics)\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig (New York Yankees)\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle (New York Yankees)\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson (Baltimore Orioles)\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski (Boston Red Sox)\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera (Detroit Tigers)\n\n**National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners:**\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines (Providence Grays)\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill (St. Louis Browns) - *Note: This was in the American Association, which is recognized by MLB as a major league for that era.*\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy (Boston Beaneaters)\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman (Chicago Cubs)\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby (St. Louis Cardinals)\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein (Philadelphia Phillies)\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick (St. Louis Cardinals)\n\n### Step 3: Count the Number of Unique Winners\nThe question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which means we need to count the number of unique players who have won the Triple Crown, not the total number of times it has been won.\n\n*   From the AL list, there are **9** unique players (Ted Williams won twice).\n*   From the NL list, there are **7** unique players (Rogers Hornsby won twice).\n\nTotal unique winners = 9 (from AL) + 7 (from NL) = **16**.\n\n### Step 4: List Careful Points and Considerations\n1.  **Unique Players vs. Total Wins:** The most important distinction is that the question asks for the number of *winners* (people), not the number of *wins*. While the Triple Crown has been achieved 18 times, it was done by only 16 different players.\n2.  **Two-Time Winners:** Ted Williams and Rogers Hornsby are the only two players in MLB history to win the Triple Crown more than once.\n3.  **Historical Leagues:** The list includes Tip O'Neill, who won in the American Association in 1887. MLB officially recognizes the American Association (1882â€“1891) as a major league, so his achievement is counted.\n4.  **Pitching Triple Crown:** It's important not to confuse the batting Triple Crown with the pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA). The question is implicitly about the more commonly referenced batting Triple Crown.\n5.  **Rarity:** The feat is extremely rare. Note the long gap between Carl Yastrzemski's win in 1967 and Miguel Cabrera's in 2012, a span of 45 years.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nBy systematically listing all the players who have led their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in a single season, and then counting the number of unique individuals on that list, we arrive at the final number.\n\n*   **AL Players:** 9\n*   **NL Players:** 7\n*   **Total Unique Players:** 9 + 7 = 16\n\n<<<16>>>"
