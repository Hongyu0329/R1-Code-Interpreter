    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A non-empty subset $S$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if for any two elements $x, y \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $xy$ is not in $S$. A direct consequence is that if $s \\in S$, then $s^2 \\notin S$. Also, the identity element $e$ cannot be in any product-free set, because $e \\cdot e = e$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set $S$ is a MIPFS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in $G$. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is no longer product-free.\n*   **Fills G:** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ fills $G$ if the subgroup generated by $S$, denoted $\\langle S \\rangle$, is the entire group $G$.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group $G$ is called a filled group if *every* MIPFS in $G$ fills $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Finding a Usable Criterion for Filled Groups**\n\nTo determine if a group is filled, we need to check every one of its MIPFS. This is generally difficult. A more practical characterization is needed. There is a known theorem in group theory that provides such a criterion for a large class of groups.\n\n**Theorem:** A finite soluble group $G$ is filled if and only if it has no normal subgroup $N$ such that the quotient group $G/N$ is a non-trivial elementary abelian 2-group.\n(An elementary abelian 2-group is a group isomorphic to $(C_2)^k = C_2 \\times \\dots \\times C_2$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$).\n\nTo use this theorem, we must confirm that any group of order $2q^m$ is soluble.\n*   A group of order $p^a q^b$ where $p, q$ are primes is soluble. This is a famous theorem by Burnside.\n*   The order of our group $G$ is $2q^m$, where 2 and $q$ are primes. Thus, by Burnside's theorem, $G$ is soluble.\n*   Therefore, the above theorem is applicable to all groups of order $2q^m$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to identifying which nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ have no normal subgroup $N$ with $G/N \\cong (C_2)^k$ for some $k \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order $2q^m$**\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number ($m \\ge 1$). We analyze its subgroup structure using Sylow's theorems.\n\n*   Let $n_q$ be the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups of $G$. A Sylow $q$-subgroup has order $q^m$.\n*   According to Sylow's third theorem, $n_q$ must divide the order of the group divided by the order of the Sylow subgroup, which is $|G|/q^m = 2$. So, $n_q$ can be 1 or 2.\n*   The theorem also states that $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$.\n*   We are given that $q$ is an odd prime, so $q \\ge 3$.\n*   Let's check the possibilities for $n_q$:\n    *   If $n_q = 1$, then $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$, which is always true.\n    *   If $n_q = 2$, then we would need $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. This implies $q$ divides $2-1=1$, which is impossible for a prime $q$.\n*   Therefore, $n_q$ must be 1.\n\n**Step 4: Finding a Normal Subgroup with the Required Quotient**\n\n*   Since there is only one Sylow $q$-subgroup, it must be a normal subgroup of $G$. Let's call this normal subgroup $P$.\n*   The order of this normal subgroup is $|P| = q^m$.\n*   Now, consider the quotient group $G/P$. The order of this quotient group is $|G/P| = |G| / |P| = (2q^m) / q^m = 2$.\n*   Any group of order 2 is cyclic and isomorphic to $C_2$. So, $G/P \\cong C_2$.\n*   The group $C_2$ is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank $k=1$. It is also non-trivial.\n\n**Step 5: Reaching the Conclusion**\n\n*   We have shown that any group $G$ of order $2q^m$ (where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 1$) has a normal subgroup $P$ such that the quotient group $G/P$ is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n*   According to the theorem from Step 2, a soluble group is filled if and only if it does not have such a normal subgroup and quotient.\n*   Since every group of order $2q^m$ *does* have such a normal subgroup and quotient, it follows that **no group of order $2q^m$ is a filled group**.\n*   This conclusion applies to all groups of this order, whether they are abelian or nonabelian.\n*   The question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$. Since no group of this order is filled, the set of such groups is empty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe analysis shows that no group of order $2q^m$ (for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$) can be a filled group. This is because every such group possesses a normal Sylow $q$-subgroup of index 2, which violates the necessary and sufficient condition for a soluble group to be filled. Therefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of this order.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
