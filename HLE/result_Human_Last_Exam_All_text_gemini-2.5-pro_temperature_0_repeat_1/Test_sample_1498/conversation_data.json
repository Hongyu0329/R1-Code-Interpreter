    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem's Structure:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a didactic poem that systematically outlines the core tenets of Islamic belief (Aqeedah) according to the Ash'ari school. It covers belief in Allah, His Messengers, His Books, the Angels, the Last Day, and Divine Decree. The section on the Messengers is a key part of this structure.\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on the Messengers (Rusul):** Before listing the names of the prophets, the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, first discusses their necessary attributes, such as truthfulness (Sidq), trustworthiness (Amanah), and conveying the message (Tabligh). This discussion sets the stage for the list of prophets whose names a Muslim should know.\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse:** The poem explicitly signals the beginning of the list. This happens in **Bayt 33**.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ * كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"The details of twenty-five (prophets) are binding * upon every accountable person, so verify and seize (this knowledge).\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse is the introduction, not part of the list itself. It tells the reader that the names of 25 specific prophets will now be detailed.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Verse of the List:** The very next verse begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n    *   **Bayt 34:** هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ * صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with * Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the definitive start of the list.\n\n5.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The subsequent verses continue listing the names in poetic form.\n    *   **Bayt 35:** لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Translation:** \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, * Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed.\"\n    *   **Bayt 36:** شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and Al-Yasa', * Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Verse of the List:** The list of 25 prophets concludes in the next verse.\n    *   **Bayt 37:** إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, * 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad), the seal (of the prophets), leave misguidance.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse contains the last of the 25 names, ending with Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), referred to as \"Taha\" and \"Khatim\" (the Seal). This marks the end of the enumeration.\n\n7.  **Confirm the End of the Section:** The verse that follows the list serves as a conclusion and a prayer for all the prophets just mentioned, confirming that the list is complete.\n    *   **Bayt 38:** عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلاَةُ وَالسَّلاَمُ * وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الأَيَّامُ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Upon them be prayers and peace, * and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Since this verse is a supplication for the prophets and not part of the list of names, it confirms that the list ended in the previous verse (Bayt 37).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from **Bayt 34 to Bayt 37**.\n\n<<<From Bayt 34 to Bayt 37>>>"
