    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definitions from algebraic and combinatorial topology, specifically concerning simplicial complexes, forests, and simplicial collapses.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:**\n    The question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests $(F,R)$\" on the \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" that have a specific property: the forest $F$ *fails* to \"simplicially collapse\" onto the root $R$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the components:**\n    *   **Standard triangulation of the Möbius band ($\\Delta_M$):** This is a specific 2-dimensional simplicial complex. The key fact is its dimensionality (2), not its specific topology (being a Möbius band). Any subcomplex of $\\Delta_M$ is at most 2-dimensional.\n    *   **Simplicial collapse ($F \\searrow R$):** This is a standard, well-defined combinatorial operation. A complex $K$ collapses to a subcomplex $L$ if $K$ can be reduced to $L$ by a sequence of elementary collapses. An elementary collapse removes a maximal face $\\sigma$ and one of its free faces $\\tau$ (a face contained in no other maximal face).\n    *   **Higher dimensional rooted forest ($(F,R)$):** This is the most critical term. There are several related definitions in the literature. However, they share common foundational properties. A pair of simplicial complexes $(F,R)$ with $R \\subseteq F$ is called a rooted forest if it satisfies a set of local acyclicity conditions.\n        *   A common definition of a **simplicial forest** $F$ is a simplicial complex where for every face $\\sigma \\in F$, the link of $\\sigma$ in $F$, denoted $lk_F(\\sigma)$, is acyclic over the integers ($\\tilde{H}_*(lk_F(\\sigma); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$).\n        *   A pair $(F,R)$ is a **rooted forest** if $F$ is a forest and for every face $\\sigma$ (at least those in $R$), the inclusion of links $lk_R(\\sigma) \\hookrightarrow lk_F(\\sigma)$ induces an isomorphism on integer homology.\n        *   A crucial consequence of these definitions, particularly for the empty face $\\sigma = \\emptyset$ (for which the link is the complex itself), is that both $F$ and $R$ must be acyclic complexes ($\\tilde{H}_*(F; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $\\tilde{H}_*(R; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$), and the inclusion map $i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ must be a homology equivalence (i.e., it induces isomorphisms on all homology groups).\n\n3.  **Synthesize and build the argument:**\n    The core of the problem is to determine if it's possible for a pair $(F,R)$ to satisfy the conditions of being a rooted forest, yet for $F$ not to collapse to $R$. We can establish a chain of implications based on established theorems in topology.\n\n    Let $(F,R)$ be a higher dimensional rooted forest on $\\Delta_M$.\n\n    *   **Step A: Acyclicity and Collapsibility in 2D.**\n        From the definition of a rooted forest, $F$ is an acyclic simplicial complex. Since $F$ is a subcomplex of the 2-dimensional $\\Delta_M$, $F$ is at most 2-dimensional. A fundamental theorem in low-dimensional topology states that any contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex is collapsible. An acyclic complex is contractible (by the Hurewicz theorem). Therefore, **$F$ is collapsible**.\n        The definition of a rooted forest also implies that $R$ is acyclic. Since $R$ is also a subcomplex of $\\Delta_M$, it is also at most 2-dimensional. By the same reasoning, **$R$ is collapsible**.\n\n    *   **Step B: From Homology Equivalence to Homotopy Equivalence.**\n        The definition of a rooted forest implies that the inclusion map $i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ is a homology equivalence. We know from Step A that $F$ and $R$ are collapsible, which means they are contractible. In particular, they are connected and simply connected ($\\pi_1(F) = \\pi_1(R) = \\{1\\}$). A theorem of J.H.C. Whitehead states that a homology equivalence between simply connected CW-complexes (which simplicial complexes are) is a homotopy equivalence. Therefore, the inclusion **$i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ is a homotopy equivalence**.\n\n    *   **Step C: From Homotopy Equivalence to Simple Homotopy Equivalence.**\n        A homotopy equivalence $f: K \\to L$ is called \"simple\" if its Whitehead torsion, $\\tau(f)$, vanishes. The torsion $\\tau(f)$ is an element of the Whitehead group $Wh(\\pi_1(L))$. In our case, the map is the inclusion $i: R \\hookrightarrow F$, and the target complex for the group is $R$. Since $R$ is contractible, its fundamental group $\\pi_1(R)$ is trivial. The Whitehead group of the trivial group, $Wh(\\{1\\})$, is the zero group. Thus, the torsion must be zero, and the inclusion **$i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ is a simple homotopy equivalence**.\n\n    *   **Step D: The Final Conclusion via Armstrong's Theorem.**\n        We have established three facts about the pair $(F,R)$:\n        1.  $F$ is a collapsible complex.\n        2.  $R$ is a collapsible subcomplex of $F$.\n        3.  The inclusion $i: R \\hookrightarrow F$ is a simple homotopy equivalence.\n        A theorem by M. A. Armstrong provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for collapsibility to a subcomplex. It states that a collapsible complex $K$ simplicially collapses to a subcomplex $L$ if and only if $L$ is collapsible and the inclusion $L \\hookrightarrow K$ is a simple homotopy equivalence.\n        Applying this theorem to our pair $(F,R)$, we conclude that **$F$ must simplicially collapse onto $R$**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n    The logical argument shows that any pair $(F,R)$ that satisfies the definition of a higher dimensional rooted forest (on the given 2D complex) must also satisfy the property that $F$ simplicially collapses onto $R$. Therefore, the number of such pairs that *fail* to have this property is zero. The specific topology of the Möbius band is irrelevant; only its dimension (being 2) is used in the argument."
