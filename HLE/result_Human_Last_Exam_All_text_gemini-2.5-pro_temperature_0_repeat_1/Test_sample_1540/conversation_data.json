    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length.\n- **Input:** Two strings, each on a new line.\n- **Length:** 1 to 100 characters.\n- **Content:** Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n- **Comparison:** Case-insensitive ('a' == 'A').\n- **Output:**\n    - \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    - \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    - \"0\" if they are equal.\n- **Goal:** Write the most memory-efficient C program and find the total memory `m` in bytes used for its variables.\n\n### Step 2: Devising a Solution Strategy\nThe core of the problem is to compare characters at each position from left to right. The first position where the characters differ (after converting to a common case) determines the result.\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we must minimize the amount of data stored in variables.\n\n- **Standard (Less Efficient) Approach:** A straightforward method is to use two character arrays (buffers), one for each string.\n  - `char s1[101];`\n  - `char s2[101];`\n  - Read both strings using `scanf(\"%s %s\", s1, s2);`.\n  - Loop through the arrays, comparing `tolower(s1[i])` and `tolower(s2[i])`.\n  - This approach requires memory for two full strings, which is `101 + 101 = 202` bytes, plus a loop counter.\n\n- **Most Memory-Efficient Approach:** We can observe that the input is processed sequentially. We don't need to have both strings in memory at the same time. We can:\n  1. Read the first string and store it in a buffer.\n  2. Read the second string one character at a time, without storing the whole string.\n  3. As each character of the second string is read, compare it immediately with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n\nThis approach eliminates the need for a second buffer, significantly reducing memory usage.\n\n### Step 3: Implementing the Memory-Efficient Approach\nLet's outline the C code for the efficient strategy and identify the necessary variables.\n\n1.  **Store the first string:** We need a buffer to hold the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    - `char s1[101];`\n\n2.  **Read the first string:** We can use `scanf(\"%s\", s1);` to read the first string. This function stops at the first whitespace character, which will be the newline `\\n` at the end of the first line.\n\n3.  **Handle the newline:** The `\\n` character remains in the input stream. We must consume it before reading the second string. A simple call to `getchar();` will do this.\n\n4.  **Process the second string:** We will read the second string character by character in a loop.\n    - We need an index to traverse the stored first string (`s1`). A `char` type is sufficient for the index since the length is at most 100.\n      - `char i = 0;`\n    - We need a variable to hold the character being read from the second string. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value.\n      - `int c;`\n\n5.  **The Comparison Loop:** The loop will look like this: `while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF)`. Inside the loop:\n    - Compare `tolower(s1[i])` with `tolower((char)c)`.\n    - If a difference is found, print the result (`-1` or `1`) and terminate.\n    - If they are equal, increment the index `i`.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** If the loop completes without finding any differences, it means the strings are equal. Print `0`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Total Memory Usage (m)\nNow, let's sum the memory used by all the variables declared in our most efficient program. We use standard data type sizes in a typical 32-bit or 64-bit environment.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the first string:**\n    - `char s1[101];`\n    - Size = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop index for the buffer:**\n    - `char i;`\n    - Size = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Variable to hold input character:**\n    - `int c;` (to correctly handle `EOF` from `getchar()`)\n    - Size = `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory is the sum of the sizes of these variables.\nm = (size of `s1`) + (size of `i`) + (size of `c`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 4\nm = **106 bytes**\n\nThis is the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem robustly.\n\n<<<106>>>"
