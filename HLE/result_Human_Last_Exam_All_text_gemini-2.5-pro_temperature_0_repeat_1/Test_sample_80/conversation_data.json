    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify and count the edge squares.**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares. The edge squares are those on the perimeter of the board.\n*   The top row (8th rank) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (1st rank) has 8 squares.\n*   The left column ('a' file) has 8 squares, but the top and bottom corners (a8, a1) are already counted. So, we add 6 more.\n*   The right column ('h' file) also has 8 squares, but its corners (h8, h1) are also counted. So, we add 6 more.\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the constraints of placing bishops.**\nThe key rule for bishops is that they move and attack along diagonals. A crucial consequence of this is that a bishop on a white square can only ever attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only ever attack other black squares. This means we can solve the problem for each color independently.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the white edge squares.**\n*   First, let's count the number of white edge squares. By symmetry, half of the 28 edge squares are white and half are black. So, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n*   The goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 14 white squares.\n*   It is a known fact in chess problems that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops you can place on all 32 white squares of a board is 7. Since we are restricted to a subset of these squares (the 14 white edge squares), the maximum number we can place is at most 7.\n*   Let's see if we can achieve a placement of 7 bishops. Consider placing bishops on all the white squares of the first rank: **b1, d1, f1, h1**. These four do not attack each other.\n*   Now, let's try to add bishops on the white squares of the eighth rank: a8, c8, e8, g8.\n    *   A bishop on h1 attacks a8. So we cannot place bishops on both h1 and a8.\n    *   However, none of the bishops on the first rank (b1, d1, f1, h1) attack c8, e8, or g8.\n*   So, a valid placement of 7 non-attacking bishops on white edge squares is: **b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8**.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the white edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the black edge squares.**\n*   The problem for the 14 black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the problem for the white ones.\n*   The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on all 32 black squares is also 7.\n*   We can find a valid placement of 7 bishops by mirroring the white square solution. A valid placement is: **a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8**. These 7 bishops do not attack one another.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of bishops and the number of empty squares.**\n*   Total bishops placed on white edge squares = 7.\n*   Total bishops placed on black edge squares = 7.\n*   Total number of bishops placed on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Total edge squares = 28.\n*   Occupied edge squares = 14.\n*   Empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Occupied edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correctly count the edge squares:** There are 28, not 32 (8x4).\n2.  **Separate by color:** The problem is much simpler when you realize bishops on white and black squares don't interact.\n3.  **Use known maximums:** Knowing the theoretical maximum of 7 bishops per color on the whole board provides a useful upper limit.\n4.  **Verify a placement:** To prove the maximum is achievable, find at least one valid configuration, as done in steps 3 and 4.\n5.  **Answer the specific question:** The final answer required is the number of *empty* squares, not the number of bishops.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total number of edge squares is 28. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them is 14 (7 on the white squares and 7 on the black squares). Therefore, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
