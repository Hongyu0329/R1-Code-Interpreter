    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron and the Setup**\n*   An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   The tank is an icosahedron \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, the face directly opposite the base is also a horizontal equilateral triangle, serving as the top of the tank.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   A key property of an icosahedron (like all Platonic solids) is that it has a center of inversion symmetry. This means for any point within or on the surface of the icosahedron, there is an identical point on the opposite side of the center, at the same distance from the center.\n*   Any plane that passes through this center of symmetry will divide the volume of the icosahedron into two equal halves.\n*   Since the water is half the total volume and its surface is horizontal, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The problem now simplifies to finding the geometric shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with a horizontal plane through its center.\n*   Let's analyze the arrangement of the 12 vertices when the icosahedron is standing on a face. The vertices are arranged in four distinct horizontal layers:\n    1.  The bottom layer: 3 vertices forming the base triangle.\n    2.  The lower-middle layer: 3 vertices forming a triangle above the base.\n    3.  The upper-middle layer: 3 vertices forming a triangle below the top face.\n    4.  The top layer: 3 vertices forming the top triangle.\n*   The central horizontal plane lies exactly halfway between the lower-middle layer of vertices and the upper-middle layer of vertices.\n*   This plane does not pass through any of the icosahedron's vertices. Instead, it must cut through the edges that connect vertices from the lower half to vertices in the upper half. The only such edges are those connecting the lower-middle layer to the upper-middle layer.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Vertices of the Water Surface Shape**\n*   We need to determine how many edges connect the lower-middle layer of 3 vertices to the upper-middle layer of 3 vertices.\n*   Each of the 6 vertices in these two middle layers is part of the \"equatorial belt\" of the icosahedron in this orientation. By analyzing the structure of the icosahedron, it can be shown that there are exactly 6 edges that connect the 3 vertices of the lower-middle layer to the 3 vertices of the upper-middle layer.\n*   The central plane intersects each of these 6 edges. These 6 intersection points become the vertices of the polygon that forms the water's surface.\n*   Therefore, the shape of the water surface is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if the Hexagon is Regular**\n*   The high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron can be used to determine the properties of the hexagon.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** When standing on a face, the icosahedron has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis that passes vertically through the center of the base and the center of the top face. The central horizontal plane is perpendicular to this axis. The cross-section (the hexagon) must also have this 3-fold rotational symmetry. This means rotating it by 120° or 240° leaves it unchanged. This implies that its side lengths alternate (a, b, a, b, a, b) and its angles also alternate.\n*   **Mirror Symmetry:** The icosahedron in this orientation also has three vertical mirror planes that contain the axis of rotation. These planes intersect the hexagon along lines of symmetry.\n*   A hexagon that possesses both 3-fold rotational symmetry and lines of mirror symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**. All its sides must be equal in length, and all its internal angles must be equal (120°).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen the icosahedron tank is half-filled, the water surface forms a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron. The cross-section of the icosahedron at this plane is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
