    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer and find the gain matrix `L`.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\n$x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)$\n$y(k) = Cx(k)$\n\nwith matrices:\n$A = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThe system has $n=4$ states, $m=1$ input, and $p=2$ outputs.\n\nThe goal is to design a full-order Luenberger observer of the form:\n$\\hat{x}(k + 1) = A\\hat{x}(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C\\hat{x}(k))$\n\nWe want a \"deadbeat\" observer, which means the observation error $e(k) = x(k) - \\hat{x}(k)$ must become zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Error Dynamics\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\n$e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)$\n\nFor the error to become zero and stay zero, the error dynamics matrix, let's call it $A_e = A - LC$, must be nilpotent. This means that for some integer $q$, $A_e^q = 0$. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of $A_e$ at the origin (z=0). The characteristic polynomial of $A_e$ must be $det(zI - A_e) = z^n = z^4$. If this condition is met, the error is guaranteed to be zero in at most $n=4$ steps.\n\n### Step 3: Use Duality for Pole Placement\n\nFinding the observer gain `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` is a pole placement problem. This problem is dual to the state-feedback controller design problem. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, $(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T$.\n\nLet's consider the dual control system with state matrix $A^T$ and input matrix $C^T$. We want to find a state-feedback gain matrix $K$ such that the closed-loop system $A^T - C^T K$ has all its eigenvalues at the origin. Once we find $K$, the observer gain is simply $L = K^T$.\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\n$A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 & -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$, $C^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nLet the feedback gain be $K = \\begin{bmatrix} k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14} \\\\ k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe closed-loop matrix for the dual system is $A^T_{cl} = A^T - C^T K$.\n$C^T K = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14} \\\\ k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} k_{11}+k_{21} & k_{12}+k_{22} & k_{13}+k_{23} & k_{14}+k_{24} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n$A^T_{cl} = A^T - C^T K = \\begin{bmatrix} -1-(k_{11}+k_{21}) & 1-(k_{12}+k_{22}) & -(k_{13}+k_{23}) & -1-(k_{14}+k_{24}) \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1-k_{21} & 2-k_{22} & -1-k_{23} & -1-k_{24} \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### Step 4: Assign a Target Form and Solve for the Gain\n\nWe want the characteristic polynomial of $A^T_{cl}$ to be $z^4$. A matrix that has this characteristic polynomial is the companion matrix:\n$N = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nSince our system is multi-input (in the dual sense), we have enough degrees of freedom to make the matrix $A^T_{cl}$ equal to this simple form $N$. Let's equate the elements of $A^T_{cl}$ and $N$.\n\n$A^T_{cl} = N$\n$\\begin{bmatrix} -1-(k_{11}+k_{21}) & 1-(k_{12}+k_{22}) & -(k_{13}+k_{23}) & -1-(k_{14}+k_{24}) \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1-k_{21} & 2-k_{22} & -1-k_{23} & -1-k_{24} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nBy comparing the matrices element by element, we get a system of equations for the elements of $K$.\n-   **Row 2:** `[0 0 1 0] = [0 0 1 0]`. This is consistent.\n-   **Row 3:** `[0 0 0 1] = [0 0 0 1]`. This is also consistent.\n-   **Row 4:**\n    -   $1 - k_{21} = 0 \\implies k_{21} = 1$\n    -   $2 - k_{22} = 0 \\implies k_{22} = 2$\n    -   $-1 - k_{23} = 0 \\implies k_{23} = -1$\n    -   $-1 - k_{24} = 0 \\implies k_{24} = -1$\n-   **Row 1:**\n    -   $-1 - (k_{11} + k_{21}) = 0 \\implies -1 - (k_{11} + 1) = 0 \\implies k_{11} = -2$\n    -   $1 - (k_{12} + k_{22}) = 1 \\implies 1 - (k_{12} + 2) = 1 \\implies -k_{12} - 1 = 1 \\implies k_{12} = -2$\n    -   $-(k_{13} + k_{23}) = 0 \\implies -(k_{13} - 1) = 0 \\implies k_{13} = 1$\n    -   $-1 - (k_{14} + k_{24}) = 0 \\implies -1 - (k_{14} - 1) = 0 \\implies -k_{14} = 0 \\implies k_{14} = 0$\n\nSo, the controller gain matrix is:\n$K = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & -1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Observer Gain Matrix L\n\nThe observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`.\n$L = K^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -2 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\nThis gain matrix `L` places all the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix `A - LC` at the origin, ensuring the observation error becomes identically zero in at most $n=4$ steps.\n\n<<<[[ -2, 1], [-2, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
