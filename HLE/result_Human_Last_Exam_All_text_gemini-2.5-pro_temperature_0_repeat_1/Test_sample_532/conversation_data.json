    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we must have a clear understanding of the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for all elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S * S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Consequence of Product-Free Definition:** The identity element `e` of the group can never be in a product-free set, because if `e ∈ S`, then `e * e = e`, which must not be in `S`, a contradiction.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (or Maximal Product-Free Set):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G \\ {e}`. In other words, every non-identity element of `G` must belong to at least one maximal product-free set.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. That is, `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × Pk`, where each `Pᵢ` is the unique Sylow `pᵢ`-subgroup of `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing Filled Groups\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining when a group is filled. An element `g ∈ G \\ {e}` that does not belong to any maximal product-free set is sometimes called a \"lonely\" element. A group `G` is filled if and only if it has no lonely elements.\n\nA key result by V. A. Petrov provides a characterization of lonely elements:\nAn element `g ∈ G \\ {e}` is lonely if and only if it satisfies both of the following conditions:\n1.  **(P1):** For any `x ∈ G`, if `x² = g`, then `x = g`.\n2.  **(P2):** For any `x, y ∈ G`, if `xy = g`, then `x = g` or `y = g`.\n\nThis means a group `G` is filled if and only if for every non-identity element `g`, at least one of these two conditions fails.\n\n### Step 3: Filled Property of p-Groups\n\nA finite nilpotent group is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Let's first analyze the filled property for p-groups.\n\n*   **p-Groups of Odd Order (p > 2):**\n    Let `P` be a p-group where `p` is an odd prime. A known result in group theory states that for any element `g ∈ P`, the equation `x² = g` has a unique solution for `x` in `P`.\n    Let `g` be any non-identity element of `P`. Let `x₀` be the unique square root of `g`. For `g` to be lonely, condition (P1) must hold, which means `x₀` must be equal to `g`. If `x₀ = g`, then `g² = g`, which implies `g = e`. This contradicts our assumption that `g` is a non-identity element.\n    Therefore, for any `g ∈ P \\ {e}`, condition (P1) fails. This means there are no lonely elements in `P`.\n    **Conclusion:** All finite p-groups of odd order are filled.\n\n*   **2-Groups:**\n    The situation for 2-groups is more complex. We need to determine which 2-groups are filled. This has been solved, and the result is:\n    **Theorem (Petrov):** A finite 2-group `P` is filled if and only if `P` is not isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2 (`C₂`) and `P` is not a generalized quaternion group (`Q₂ⁿ` for `n ≥ 3`).\n\n    *   `C₂` is not filled because its only non-identity element is lonely.\n    *   Generalized quaternion groups `Q₂ⁿ` (including the familiar quaternion group `Q₈`) are not filled. They each contain at least one lonely element.\n    *   All other 2-groups, such as `C₄`, `C₂ × C₂`, and the dihedral group `D₈`, are filled.\n\n### Step 4: Filled Property of Direct Products\n\nNow we need to understand how the filled property behaves with direct products, which is essential for nilpotent groups.\nLet `G = H × K`. The relevant theorem is:\n**Theorem (Petrov, Vechtomov):** The direct product `G = H × K` is filled if and only if one of the following holds:\n1.  `H` and `K` are both filled groups.\n2.  One of the groups (say `H`) is `C₂`, and the other group (`K`) is a filled group of odd order (i.e., without involutions).\n\n### Step 5: Synthesizing the Result for Nilpotent Groups\n\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. We can write `G` as the direct product of its Sylow 2-subgroup, `S₂`, and the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups for odd primes, `O`.\nSo, `G ≅ S₂ × O`.\n\n*   The group `O` is a group of odd order. As established in Step 3, any p-group of odd order is filled. A direct product of filled groups of coprime orders is also filled. Thus, `O` is always a filled group of odd order.\n\nNow we apply the direct product theorem from Step 4 with `H = S₂` and `K = O`.\n`G` is filled if and only if:\n1.  `S₂` is filled AND `O` is filled. (Since `O` is always filled, this simplifies to: `S₂` is filled).\n    OR\n2.  `S₂ = C₂` AND `O` is a filled group of odd order. (This is always true for `O`).\n    OR\n3.  `O = C₂`. This is impossible as `O` has odd order.\n\nSo, the condition for `G` to be filled is:\n(`S₂` is a filled group) OR (`S₂ = C₂`).\n\nNow, we use the classification of filled 2-groups from Step 3: A 2-group `P` is filled if and only if `P ≠ C₂` and `P` is not a generalized quaternion group `Q₂ⁿ`.\nLet's substitute this into our condition for `G`:\n`G` is filled iff ( (`S₂ ≠ C₂` AND `S₂` is not `Q₂ⁿ`) OR (`S₂ = C₂`) ).\n\nLet's analyze this logical expression. Let `A` be the statement `S₂ = C₂` and `B` be the statement `S₂` is a generalized quaternion group `Q₂ⁿ`. The condition is `( (¬A) ∧ (¬B) ) ∨ A`.\nUsing distributive laws of logic, this is equivalent to `(¬A ∨ A) ∧ (¬B ∨ A)`, which simplifies to `True ∧ (¬B ∨ A)`, which is `¬B ∨ A`.\nThis means: `S₂` is not a generalized quaternion group OR `S₂ = C₂`.\n\nA generalized quaternion group `Q₂ⁿ` is defined for `n ≥ 3`, so its order is at least 8. The group `C₂` has order 2. Therefore, if `S₂ = C₂`, it cannot be a generalized quaternion group. This means the statement `S₂ = C₂` implies the statement `S₂` is not a generalized quaternion group.\nSo, the logical condition `(S₂ is not Q₂ⁿ) ∨ (S₂ = C₂)` simplifies to just `S₂` is not a generalized quaternion group.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is not a generalized quaternion group.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is a filled group if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is not a generalized quaternion group.>>>"
