    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\n\nThe question asks to solve the mathematical equation `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI = ?`. The equation is written using Roman numerals, and the answer should be in modern (Arabic) numbers. The process involves three main parts:\n*   Converting each Roman numeral to its modern number equivalent.\n*   Identifying the mathematical operations (division and subtraction).\n*   Performing the calculation according to the correct order of operations.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Roman Numeral Conversion:** It is crucial to correctly interpret the Roman numerals.\n    *   `I` = 1, `V` = 5, `X` = 10, `L` = 50, `C` = 100, `D` = 500, `M` = 1000.\n    *   **Additive Principle:** When a symbol of smaller value is placed after a symbol of equal or greater value, their values are added (e.g., `VI` = 5 + 1 = 6; `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300).\n    *   **Subtractive Principle:** When a symbol of smaller value is placed before a symbol of greater value, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger one (e.g., `IV` = 5 - 1 = 4; `IX` = 10 - 1 = 9).\n*   **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** The standard mathematical order of operations must be followed. In this equation, we have division (`/`) and subtraction (`-`). Division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.**\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `XX` = 10 + 10 = 20\n    *   `IV` = 5 - 1 = 4\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 20 + 4 = **24**.\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   `C` = 100\n    *   Therefore, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n*   **CCCLXXXI**:\n    *   `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n    *   `LXXX` = 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80\n    *   `I` = 1\n    *   Therefore, `CCCLXXXI` = 300 + 80 + 1 = **381**.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation with modern numbers.**\n\nThe original equation `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI` becomes:\n`24 / 300 - 381`\n\n**Step 3: Perform the calculation following the order of operations.**\n\n*   **First, perform the division:**\n    *   `24 / 300`\n    *   This can be calculated as a decimal: 24 ÷ 300 = **0.08**.\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    *   `0.08 - 381`\n    *   The result is **-380.92**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe solution to the equation `XXIV / CCC - CCCLXXXI` is -380.92.\n\n<<<-380.92>>>"
