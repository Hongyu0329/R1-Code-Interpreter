    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system and find the equilibrium points.**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\nFrom the second equation, $u'(t) = 0$:\n$(u-1)u^2 = 0$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the first equation, $d'(t)=0$:\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0$\n    This implies $d=0$.\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 2d - 0 = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0$\n    This implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points of the system are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points.**\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $f(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$.\nThe Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} = 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} = (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$\n\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point (excluding (0,0) which is degenerate).\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node (a source)**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7 - 3 + 4 & -4 - 3 + 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since one is positive and one is negative, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n**Step 3: Find the separatrix.**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. We have a saddle point at (1, -1).\n\nLet's look for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point. An invariant curve is a trajectory of the system. If $d=f(u)$ is a trajectory, it must satisfy the differential equation for the phase-plane trajectories:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2}$\n\nLet's test for a simple polynomial solution, for instance, a parabola of the form $d = au^2$.\nSubstitute $d=au^2$ and $dd/du = 2au$ into the equation.\nThe time derivative is $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(au^2) = 2au \\cdot u' = 2au(u-1)u^2 = 2a(u^4 - u^3)$.\n\nNow substitute $d=au^2$ into the original expression for $d'$:\n$d' = 2(au^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(au^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d' = 2a^2u^4 - 3au^3 + 5au^4 + u^4 - u^3$\n$d' = (2a^2 + 5a + 1)u^4 + (-3a - 1)u^3$\n\nFor $d=au^2$ to be a solution, the two expressions for $d'$ must be identical for all $u$. We equate the coefficients of the powers of $u$:\n$2a(u^4 - u^3) = (2a^2 + 5a + 1)u^4 + (-3a - 1)u^3$\n$2au^4 - 2au^3 = (2a^2 + 5a + 1)u^4 + (-3a - 1)u^3$\n\nComparing coefficients:\n*   For $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2 + 3a + 1 = 0$\n*   For $u^3$: $-2a = -3a - 1 \\implies a = -1$\n\nLet's check if $a=-1$ satisfies the first equation:\n$2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2 - 3 + 1 = 0$.\nIt does. So, $a=-1$ is a valid solution.\n\nThis means the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold (a trajectory) of the system.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that the curve is a separatrix.**\n\nLet's check if this curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\nIf $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it passes through the saddle point.\n\nA trajectory that passes through a saddle point must be part of its stable or unstable manifold. Let's check the tangent at (1, -1).\nThe slope of the curve $d=-u^2$ is $dd/du = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is -2.\nThe eigenvector for the unstable manifold of the saddle (corresponding to $\\lambda=1$) is found by solving $(J - I)v = 0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 1-1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2-1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\nThis gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0$, or $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle point is $v_d/v_u = -2$.\n\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point and its tangent matches the direction of the unstable manifold, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point. The unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It separates the phase plane into regions with different dynamical behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
