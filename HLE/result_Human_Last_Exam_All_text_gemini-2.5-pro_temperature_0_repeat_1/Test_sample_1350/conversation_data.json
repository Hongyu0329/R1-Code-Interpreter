    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who meets three criteria:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe the religious practices of the inhabitants.\n    *   This description contains a clear allusion to the founding myth of Rome, involving Romulus and Remus.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We need to consider the main characters of the novel and their backstories, specifically any interactions they may have had with the Romans.\n    *   **Thiodolf:** The protagonist and war-leader of the Wolfings. His backstory is crucial, as it is established early on that he spent time among the Romans in his youth.\n    *   **The Wood-Sun (or Hall-Sun):** Thiodolf's wife, a supernatural being (a daughter of Odin). Her origins are divine and tied to the forest, not to the Roman world.\n    *   **Other Wolfing Kinsmen (e.g., Otter, Throng-plough):** These characters are primarily defined by their roles within the tribe and do not have a known history of visiting Roman cities.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Most Likely Candidate:** Thiodolf is the only major character with a known history of having lived among the Romans. He was taken as a hostage or captive when he was young. This experience makes him the only character who could have first-hand knowledge of a Roman city and its customs.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Passage in the Text:** The scene where this description occurs is in Chapter V, titled \"Thiodolf telleth of the Romans.\" In this chapter, Thiodolf is addressing the assembly of the Wolfing tribe, warning them about the nature of the Roman enemy they are about to face.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Character's Description:** During his speech, Thiodolf describes the Romans' beliefs to his people. He says:\n    > \"For they have a tale of their first fathers, two brethren, who, being children, were cast away in the wild-wood, and were suckled by a she-wolf; and that thereafter they built a city, and that the one brother slew the other, and that he who was the slayer is become a God of the Romans, and their helper in all their battles.\"\n\n6.  **Connect the Description to Romulus and Remus:** This passage is a clear and direct reference to the Roman founding myth.\n    *   \"two brethren\" refers to Romulus and Remus.\n    *   \"suckled by a she-wolf\" is the most iconic part of their legend.\n    *   \"built a city\" refers to the founding of Rome.\n    *   \"the one brother slew the other\" refers to Romulus killing Remus.\n    *   \"he who was the slayer is become a God\" refers to the deification of Romulus as the god Quirinus.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The character does not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus.\" The description is given from the perspective of an outsider (a Goth) explaining a foreign belief system to his own people, which makes the familiar myth sound like a strange and brutal tale.\n*   This speech is a key moment of characterization for Thiodolf, establishing his unique knowledge and experience which sets him apart from his kinsmen.\n*   The context is a council of war, where Thiodolf uses this story to illustrate the nature and origins of the Roman people, suggesting their inherent violence and ambition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the character who visited a Roman city and described the myth of its founding by two brothers suckled by a wolf is the protagonist, Thiodolf.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
