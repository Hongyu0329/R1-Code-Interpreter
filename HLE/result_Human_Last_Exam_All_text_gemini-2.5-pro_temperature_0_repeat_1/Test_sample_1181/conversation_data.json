    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character in a specific movie (*Solaris*, 1972, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky) who expresses a particular sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the film's characters and their key dialogues.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with him on Earth (or a simulation of it), deeply connected to nature, his father, and his past. He certainly misses Earth, but his journey is more about confronting his conscience and guilt regarding his late wife, Hari. He doesn't express shame about missing Earth; rather, his connection to it is central to his humanity.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is a \"guest\" or \"visitor,\" a physical manifestation of Kris's memory of his deceased wife, created by the sentient ocean of Solaris. She has no actual memories of Earth herself. Her entire existence is confined to the space station. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is world-weary, cynical, and often engages in long, philosophical monologues about humanity's purpose in space. Having been isolated for a long time, he is deeply reflective of their condition.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is portrayed as cold, detached, and almost obsessively focused on the scientific aspects of their situation. He shows disdain for emotional responses and would be the least likely character to admit to such a poetic or sentimental feeling.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who was the head of the station's scientific mission. He commits suicide just before Kris arrives. We only see him through a video message he left for Kris and as a \"guest\" (a young girl) in a brief scene. His message is one of warning and despair, but he does not have the dialogue described in the question.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue**\nThe key is to recall the specific conversation where this sentiment is expressed. In a notable scene, Dr. Snaut has a conversation with Kris Kelvin in the station's library. During this talk, Snaut reflects on why humanity explores space, concluding that humans don't really want new worlds, but a \"mirror\" to see themselves. It is during this monologue that he confesses his own feelings of nostalgia and displacement. He admits to sometimes imagining he is back on Earth and can hear the leaves rustling. He then explicitly frames this feeling as a weakness or something to be ashamed of for a cosmonaut, someone who is supposed to be forward-looking and focused on the cosmos, not sentimentally attached to Earthly comforts.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed of missing the sound of rustling leaves. He sees this longing for Earth as a failure of the cosmonaut's spirit, an embarrassing attachment to the past in the face of the vast, alien universe.\n\n<<<C>>>"
