    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ballet steps to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify the ballet step among the choices where the final configuration of the legs is identical to the starting configuration. For instance, if a step begins in fifth position with the right foot in front, it must also conclude in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** An *entrechat* is a jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. An even-numbered entrechat (*quatre*, *six*, *huit*) always involves landing with the feet switched from their starting position. An *entrechat six* involves three changes of the feet in the air, so if you start with the right foot front, you will land with the left foot front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** An *échappé* is a jump from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then back to a closed position. The word *changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" This indicates that the feet will switch places upon closing. The dancer starts with one foot in front and lands with the other foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps, and the legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing in fifth position. In the most common forms, such as *assemblé dessus* (over), the back leg brushes out and lands in front, changing the position of the feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. In *glissade derrière* (gliding to close behind), the back foot glides out to the side, and the front foot then closes *behind* it into fifth position. If you start with the right foot front, the left foot glides out, and the right foot closes behind the left. This results in the left foot being in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a decorative jump, like an embellished *pas de chat*. In a *gargouillade*, the dancer jumps, and each leg performs a *rond de jambe en l'air* (a small circle in the air). The front leg performs its circle and lands, and the back leg performs its circle and closes back into its original position (behind). The sequence ensures that the foot that started in front ends in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is the same as the starting position.\n\n**Final Answer Determination**\nBased on the analysis, the only step among the choices that concludes with the legs in the same position as they started is the Gargouillade.\n\n<<<E>>>"
