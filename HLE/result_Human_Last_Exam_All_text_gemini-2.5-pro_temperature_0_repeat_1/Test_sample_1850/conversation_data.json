    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define \"Historical Saint\"\n\nThe question asks for the number of \"historical saints\" mentioned \"by name\". This requires careful definition of the terms.\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of Milton's work, which is rooted in the Bible, this term should be interpreted broadly to include significant holy figures from the Old and New Testaments. Milton, as a Puritan, would not have focused on saints canonized by the Catholic Church post-scripture. Therefore, the list should include patriarchs, prophets, and key holy figures from the biblical narrative who are traditionally revered. We will exclude divine beings (God the Father, the Son), celestial beings (angels like Michael and Raphael), and the central protagonists of the epic (Adam and Eve).\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\"**: The figure must be explicitly named in the text, not just alluded to or described. For example, if the text mentions \"David's wise son who built the temple,\" that refers to Solomon, but it does not count as a named mention.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Search *Paradise Lost*\n\nThe most logical place to find a list of historical figures is in Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals the future of mankind to Adam. We will search these books carefully for named individuals who fit our definition.\n\n**Book XI:** Michael shows Adam visions of the future.\n\n1.  **Abel**: In the vision of the first murder, Abel is explicitly named. He is traditionally considered the first martyr and a saint.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 1)\n2.  **Enoch**: Michael describes a holy man who is taken by God without dying. This figure is named Enoch.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 2)\n3.  **Noah**: Michael shows Adam the vision of the great flood and the man who builds the ark, who is named Noah.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 3)\n\n**Book XII:** Michael continues his prophecy, now narrating history rather than showing visions.\n\n4.  **Abraham**: Michael tells of the \"one faithful man\" who will be the father of a chosen nation. He is explicitly named Abraham.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 4)\n5.  **Jacob**: Michael mentions the descendants of Abraham. While Isaac is alluded to as Abraham's son, he is not named. However, his son Jacob is explicitly named.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 5)\n    *   *Careful Point*: Joseph is described as the son of Jacob sold into Egypt, but he is not mentioned by name.\n6.  **Moses**: The great leader who brings the Israelites out of Egypt and receives the Law is explicitly named Moses.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 6)\n7.  **Joshua**: Michael names Moses's successor who will lead the people into the promised land as Joshua.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 7)\n8.  **David**: The great king from whose line the Messiah will descend is explicitly named David.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 8)\n    *   *Careful Point*: David's son, Solomon, is described as the builder of the Temple but is not mentioned by name.\n9.  **Mary**: In the prophecy of the Messiah's birth, his mother is explicitly named Mary.\n    *   *Mentioned by name?* Yes. (Count: 9)\n\n### Step 3: Review and Finalize the Count\n\nLet's review the list and check for other possibilities.\n\n*   **The List**: Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, David, Mary.\n*   **Figures Described but Not Named**: Isaac, Joseph, Solomon, John the Baptist.\n*   **Groups Mentioned Collectively**: The \"twelve Apostles\" are mentioned, but no individual apostle (like Peter or Paul) is named. The \"Prophets\" are also mentioned generally.\n*   **Other Books**: A review of the other ten books of the epic confirms they are focused on the primary narrative (the fall of the angels, creation, the temptation) and do not name other historical saints.\n\nThe systematic search yields a total of nine historical saints who are explicitly mentioned by name in the text.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are nine historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*. They are:\n1.  Abel\n2.  Enoch\n3.  Noah\n4.  Abraham\n5.  Jacob\n6.  Moses\n7.  Joshua\n8.  David\n9.  Mary\n\n<<<9>>>"
