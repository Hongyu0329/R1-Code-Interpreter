    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` with `n` elements and a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four fundamental properties (axioms):\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. The problem statement specifies that `·` is a \"binary operation defined on\" `G`, which by definition means that the closure property is already satisfied.\n2.  **Associativity:** For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (called the inverse of `a`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nA structure `(G, ·)` is **not** a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of the associativity, identity, or inverse axioms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Smallest Possible Values for `n`\n\nWe will test values of `n` starting from the smallest positive integer. In standard algebra, groups are non-empty sets.\n\n#### Case: n = 1\n*   Let the set be `G = {a}`.\n*   There is only one possible binary operation we can define on `G`. Since the result of the operation must be in `G` (closure), the only choice is `a · a = a`.\n*   Let's check the group axioms for `(G, ·)`:\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. Also, `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · a = a`. The only element in `G` is `a`. If we set `e = a`, we have `a · a = a`, which is true. So, `a` is the identity element.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, we need an inverse `b` such that `a · b = a` (the identity). The only choice is `b = a`. We check: `a · a = a`. This works. So, `a` is its own inverse.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation must form a group (this is known as the trivial group). Therefore, `n` cannot be 1.\n\n#### Case: n = 2\n*   Let the set be `G = {a, b}`.\n*   We need to determine if it's possible to define a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group. We only need to find one example.\n*   Let's try to construct an operation that fails one of the axioms. For instance, let's try to make it fail the identity element axiom.\n*   Consider the following operation defined by the table below:\n    ```\n      · | a | b\n    ----|---|---\n      a | a | a\n      b | b | b\n    ```\n    This operation can be described as `x · y = x` for any `x, y` in `G`.\n*   Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n    *   **Associativity:** `(x · y) · z = x · z = x`. And `x · (y · z) = x · y = x`. The results are the same, so the operation is associative.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need to find an element `e` in `G` such that `e · x = x` and `x · e = x` for all `x` in `G`.\n        *   Test `a` as the identity: We need `a · x = x`. But `a · b = a`, which is not `b`. So `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Test `b` as the identity: We need `b · x = x`. But `b · a = b`, which is not `a`. So `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither element in `G` can act as the identity element, this structure fails the identity axiom.\n*   **Conclusion for n=2:** We have successfully constructed a set `G` with 2 elements and a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\n*   For `n=1`, any structure `(G, ·)` is always a group.\n*   For `n=2`, we found an example of a structure `(G, ·)` that is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number `n` for which such a set and operation exist is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
