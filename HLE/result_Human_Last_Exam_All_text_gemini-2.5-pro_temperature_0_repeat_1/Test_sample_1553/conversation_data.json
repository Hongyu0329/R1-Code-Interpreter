    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific character from a specific novel.\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Main Character:** The protagonist of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marries.\n*   **Target:** The name of the character the protagonist marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot to find the character Adam Zamoyski marries.**\nIn the novel, Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a member of the advanced post-human civilization. This being is an \"ink\" (atrament), a creature of pure information. He develops a deep and complex relationship with her.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific event of \"marriage\".**\nThe concept of marriage in the novel's far-future setting is not a traditional human ceremony. Instead, it represents a profound union and fusion between Adam and the post-human being. This union is a pivotal event in the story.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the name of the character involved in this union.**\nThe \"ink\" with whom Adam Zamoyski forms this deep bond and ultimately \"marries\" is named Angelina.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to understand that \"marriage\" in this science fiction context is a metaphorical or futuristic equivalent, not a traditional wedding. It signifies a deep, symbiotic fusion of two beings.\n*   The main character is Adam Zamoyski. The character he marries is Angelina.\n*   Angelina is not a human but a post-human entity called an \"ink\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the character that the main character marries is Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
