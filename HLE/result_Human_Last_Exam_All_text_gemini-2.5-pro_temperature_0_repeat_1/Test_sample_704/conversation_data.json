    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific musical note based on Isaac Newton's colour circle. The key elements are:\n1.  **The System:** Newton's colour circle, which links the colours of the visible spectrum to the notes of a musical scale.\n2.  **The First Point:** \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In the context of light and the spectrum, the colour located between yellow and blue is **Green**.\n3.  **The Second Point:** \"blue itself\". This is simply the colour **Blue**.\n4.  **The Target:** The musical note that corresponds to the \"range between\" Green and Blue.\n\n### Step 2: Recall Newton's Colour-Music Correspondence\nIsaac Newton associated the seven colours of the spectrum (ROYGBIV) with the seven notes of the diatonic musical scale (Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Ti). His specific mapping, starting with Red, is as follows:\n*   **Red** -> **C** (Do)\n*   **Orange** -> **D** (Re)\n*   **Yellow** -> **E** (Mi)\n*   **Green** -> **F** (Fa)\n*   **Blue** -> **G** (Sol)\n*   **Indigo** -> **A** (La)\n*   **Violet** -> **B** (Ti)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Range Between\" Green and Blue\nOn Newton's colour circle, the colours are arranged as contiguous sectors. The \"range between\" two adjacent sectors refers to the boundary or division line that separates them.\n\n*   The sector for the colour **Green** is associated with the note **F**.\n*   The sector for the colour **Blue** is associated with the note **G**.\n\nIn Newton's more detailed model, each colour did not just correspond to a single note but to a musical *interval*. The notes marked the divisions *between* the colours.\n*   The Green sector spans the interval from note F to note G.\n*   The Blue sector spans the interval from note G to note A.\n\nTherefore, the boundary line—the precise point of transition that lies \"between\" the Green sector and the Blue sector—is marked by the note **G**.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize and Conclude\n1.  The colour range in question is from Green to Blue.\n2.  In Newton's system, Green is mapped to F and Blue is mapped to G.\n3.  The question asks for the note corresponding to the *range between* these two colours. This points to the dividing line that separates the Green region from the Blue region on the colour circle.\n4.  This dividing line is explicitly marked by the note **G**.\n\n<<<G>>>"
