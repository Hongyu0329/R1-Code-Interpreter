    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Cap Set**\nA cap set is a subset of points in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$ with the property that it contains no three distinct points that form a line. A line is a set of three distinct points $\\{x, y, z\\}$ such that their sum is the zero vector, i.e., $x + y + z = 0$. The dimension of the space is given by $n$. In this question, we are interested in the case where the dimension is $n=8$. The maximum possible size of a cap set in dimension $n$ is denoted by $r_3(n)$. The question asks for the best known lower bound for $r_3(8)$.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Simple Lower Bound**\nA straightforward way to construct a cap set is to take all vectors whose coordinates are only 0s and 1s. This forms the set $\\{0,1\\}^n \\subset (\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$. Let's check if this is a cap set. Suppose we have three distinct vectors $x, y, z$ from this set such that $x+y+z=0 \\pmod 3$. For each coordinate $i$, we must have $x_i + y_i + z_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. Since $x_i, y_i, z_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, their sum can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. For the sum to be a multiple of 3, it must be 0 or 3.\n*   If $x_i + y_i + z_i = 0$, then it must be that $x_i=y_i=z_i=0$.\n*   If $x_i + y_i + z_i = 3$, then it must be that $x_i=y_i=z_i=1$.\nIn either case, for every coordinate $i$, we must have $x_i=y_i=z_i$. This implies that the vectors are identical, $x=y=z$, which contradicts the condition that they are distinct. Therefore, the set $\\{0,1\\}^n$ is a cap set.\nFor dimension $n=8$, the size of this set is $2^8 = 256$. So, we have a lower bound $r_3(8) \\ge 256$. This immediately eliminates options B (16), D (80), and E (45).\n\n**Step 3: Use Product Constructions for a Better Lower Bound**\nA more advanced method to find lower bounds is the product construction. If we have a cap set of size $r_3(n)$ in dimension $n$ and another of size $r_3(m)$ in dimension $m$, we can construct a cap set of size $r_3(n) \\cdot r_3(m)$ in dimension $n+m$. This gives the inequality: $r_3(n+m) \\ge r_3(n) \\cdot r_3(m)$.\nWe can use the known exact values of $r_3(n)$ for small $n$:\n*   $r_3(1) = 2$\n*   $r_3(2) = 4$\n*   $r_3(3) = 9$\n*   $r_3(4) = 20$\n*   $r_3(5) = 45$\n*   $r_3(6) = 112$\n\nWe can find a lower bound for $r_3(8)$ by partitioning 8 into a sum of smaller integers:\n*   $8 = 4 + 4 \\implies r_3(8) \\ge r_3(4) \\cdot r_3(4) = 20 \\cdot 20 = 400$.\n*   $8 = 5 + 3 \\implies r_3(8) \\ge r_3(5) \\cdot r_3(3) = 45 \\cdot 9 = 405$.\n*   $8 = 6 + 2 \\implies r_3(8) \\ge r_3(6) \\cdot r_3(2) = 112 \\cdot 4 = 448$.\n\nThe best lower bound from these simple product constructions is 448. This shows that $r_3(8)$ is at least 448. This is a very strong lower bound and is better than options A (224) and C (512) is not guaranteed by this method.\n\n**Step 4: Consult Research for the \"Best Known\" Bound**\nThe term \"best known\" implies that the answer is the current record from mathematical research, which often involves sophisticated computer-aided constructions that go beyond the simple methods described above. For cap set bounds, the work of Yves Edel is a primary reference. His online tables, which are widely cited in the field, provide the best known bounds for these types of problems.\nAccording to Edel's tables and related publications (e.g., the 2020 paper \"Lower bounds for cap sets\" by C. Elsholtz), the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, $r_3(8)$, was established by Edel himself.\n\nThe value is 496.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nLet's review the options based on our analysis:\n*   A. 224: Too low. We found a bound of 256 easily.\n*   B. 16: Too low.\n*   C. 512: This is $2^9$, the trivial lower bound for dimension 9, not 8. There is no known construction that yields this value for $n=8$.\n*   D. 80: Too low.\n*   E. 45: This is the exact size for $r_3(5)$, not a bound for $r_3(8)$.\n*   F. 496: This matches the best known lower bound from specialized research constructions.\n\nTherefore, the best known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 is 496.\n\n<<<F>>>"
