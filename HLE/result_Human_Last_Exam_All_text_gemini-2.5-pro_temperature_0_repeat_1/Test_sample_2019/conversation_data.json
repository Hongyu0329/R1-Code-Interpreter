    "Answering the question requires a step-by-step analysis of the problem's constraints and properties. The key is to understand the structure of the toroidal board and how it relates the (n-1)-queens problem to the n-queens problem on an n x n board.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Board and Queen Attacks**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4. All arithmetic on coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n*   **Queen's Attack:** A queen at position (x, y) attacks any square (x', y') if it's in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   **Row:** y' = y\n    *   **Column:** x' = x\n    *   **Main Diagonal:** y' - x' = y - x (mod 5)\n    *   **Anti-Diagonal:** y' + x' = y + x (mod 5)\n\n**2. Define a Valid 4-Queen Placement**\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens, let's say at positions (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), (x₃, y₃), and (x₄, y₄), such that no two queens attack each other. This means that for any pair of queens i and j (i ≠ j):\n*   xᵢ ≠ xⱼ (mod 5)\n*   yᵢ ≠ yⱼ (mod 5)\n*   yᵢ - xᵢ ≠ yⱼ - xⱼ (mod 5)\n*   yᵢ + xᵢ ≠ yⱼ + xⱼ (mod 5)\n\nIn simpler terms, if we form four sets from the coordinates of the queens:\n*   X = {x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄}\n*   Y = {y₁, y₂, y₃, y₄}\n*   D = {y₁-x₁, y₂-x₂, y₃-x₃, y₄-x₄} (all mod 5)\n*   A = {y₁+x₁, y₂+x₂, y₃+x₃, y₄+x₄} (all mod 5)\n\nA placement is valid if and only if each of these four sets contains 4 distinct numbers.\n\n**3. The \"Missing Point\" Concept**\n\nSince we are on a 5x5 board, the full set of possible coordinates or diagonal indices is Z₅ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. For any valid 4-queen solution, each of the sets X, Y, D, and A is missing exactly one element from Z₅. Let's denote these missing elements as xₘ, yₘ, dₘ, and aₘ, respectively.\n\n**4. Relating the Missing Elements**\n\nWe can establish a relationship between these missing elements. The sum of all elements in Z₅ is 0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5).\nThe sum of the elements in our sets are:\n*   Σxᵢ = Σ(Z₅) - xₘ = 0 - xₘ = -xₘ (mod 5)\n*   Σyᵢ = Σ(Z₅) - yₘ = 0 - yₘ = -yₘ (mod 5)\n*   Σdᵢ = Σ(Z₅) - dₘ = 0 - dₘ = -dₘ (mod 5)\n*   Σaᵢ = Σ(Z₅) - aₘ = 0 - aₘ = -aₘ (mod 5)\n\nFrom the definitions of the diagonal sets D and A, we also know:\n*   Σdᵢ = Σ(yᵢ - xᵢ) = Σyᵢ - Σxᵢ  =>  -dₘ = (-yₘ) - (-xₘ) = xₘ - yₘ (mod 5)\n*   Σaᵢ = Σ(yᵢ + xᵢ) = Σyᵢ + Σxᵢ  =>  -aₘ = (-yₘ) + (-xₘ) = -xₘ - yₘ (mod 5)\n\nThese can be rewritten as:\n*   dₘ = yₘ - xₘ (mod 5)\n*   aₘ = yₘ + xₘ (mod 5)\n\n**5. Connecting 4-Queens to 5-Queens Solutions**\n\nThe relations above tell us that the \"missing point\" (xₘ, yₘ) lies on the missing main diagonal dₘ and the missing anti-diagonal aₘ.\n\nIf we add this missing point (xₘ, yₘ) to our 4-queen solution, we get a set of 5 points. This new set of 5 points is a valid 5-queens solution because all 5 points will have distinct x-coordinates, y-coordinates, main diagonals, and anti-diagonals.\n\nThis establishes a crucial correspondence:\n*   Every valid 4-queens solution can be uniquely extended to a valid 5-queens solution by adding one specific \"missing point\".\n*   Conversely, every valid 5-queens solution can be turned into a 4-queens solution by removing any one of its 5 queens.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4-queens solutions is 5 times the number of 5-queens solutions.\nNumber of 4-Q solutions = 5 × (Number of 5-Q solutions)\n\n**6. Counting the 5-Queens Solutions**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. This is a well-known result in combinatorics. Solutions are of the form of linear permutations:\ny = ax + b (mod 5)\n\nFor this to be a valid solution, the slope `a` must not cause attacks.\n*   a ≠ 0 (to avoid all queens being in the same row)\n*   a ≠ 1 (to avoid all queens being on the same main diagonal, since y-x = (a-1)x+b would be constant)\n*   a ≠ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5) (to avoid all queens being on the same anti-diagonal, since y+x = (a+1)x+b would be constant)\n\nIn Z₅, the possible values for the slope `a` are {2, 3}.\nFor each choice of slope `a`, the intercept `b` can be any of the 5 values in Z₅ ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4}).\n\nSo, the total number of 5-queens solutions is:\n(Number of valid slopes) × (Number of possible intercepts) = 2 × 5 = 10.\n\n**7. Calculating the Final Answer**\n\nUsing the relationship from Step 5, we can now calculate the number of 4-queens solutions:\nNumber of 4-Q solutions = 5 × (Number of 5-Q solutions)\nNumber of 4-Q solutions = 5 × 10 = 50.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Toroidal Geometry:** The wrapping nature of the board is the most critical constraint, changing the definition of diagonals and the overall structure of the problem.\n2.  **n-1 on n x n:** The method of relating the (n-1)-queens problem to the n-queens problem is very powerful but relies on n being a prime number (which 5 is). This ensures the algebraic properties used in the derivation hold.\n3.  **Counting Unordered Sets:** The question asks for the number of \"ways\", which implies unordered sets of queen placements. The method used correctly counts these sets.\n4.  **Solutions vs. Fundamental Solutions:** The 10 solutions for the 5-queens problem are all distinct placements. They fall into two \"fundamental\" types (slope 2 and slope 3), with the 5 choices of intercept `b` corresponding to translations of the fundamental solution across the board.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Number of 5-queens solutions on a 5x5 toroidal board = 10.\n*   Each 5-queens solution can generate 5 distinct 4-queens solutions by removing one queen at a time.\n*   Total number of 4-queens solutions = 5 × 10 = 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
