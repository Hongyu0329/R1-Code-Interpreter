    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring and the Algebraic Structure\n\nKnot coloring is a method used to create knot invariants, which help distinguish different knots. The most common type is **Fox n-coloring**.\n\n1.  **The \"Colors\":** We assign a \"color\" to each arc of the knot diagram. These colors are elements from a set of size `n`, typically the integers modulo `n`, which are `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}`.\n2.  **The \"Algebraic Structure\":** The set of colors `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` together with the coloring rule forms an algebraic structure known as a **dihedral quandle**, denoted `R_n`. The question asks for the size of the smallest such structure, which means finding the smallest integer `n`.\n3.  **The Coloring Rule:** At each crossing in the knot diagram, there is one over-arc and two under-arcs. If the colors of the two under-arcs are `a` and `b`, and the color of the over-arc is `c`, they must satisfy the equation:\n    `a + b ≡ 2c (mod n)`\n4.  **Non-Trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs have the same color (e.g., all are colored '0'). This is always possible for any knot and any `n`. We are interested in a \"non-trivial\" coloring, where at least two different colors are used. A knot is called **n-colorable** if it has a non-trivial n-coloring.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot is n-colorable.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nThe figure-eight knot (knot `4_1`) is the simplest non-trivial knot after the trefoil. Its standard diagram has 4 crossings and 4 arcs.\n\n1.  **Label the Arcs:** Let's label the four arcs of the figure-eight knot as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n2.  **Write Equations for Crossings:** We write one equation for each of the four crossings using the rule `a + b - 2c = 0 (mod n)`. Based on a standard diagram of the figure-eight knot, we get the following system of linear equations:\n    *   Crossing 1: `x₂ + x₄ - 2x₁ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 2: `x₁ + x₃ - 2x₂ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 3: `x₂ + x₄ - 2x₃ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n    *   Crossing 4: `x₁ + x₃ - 2x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n\n### Step 3: Using the Coloring Matrix and Knot Determinant\n\nA knot is n-colorable if and only if `n` divides the **determinant of the knot**. The determinant of the knot is a specific value calculated from the system of equations.\n\n1.  **Form the Coloring Matrix:** We can represent the system of equations with a coefficient matrix, called the coloring matrix (`M`).\n    The equations are:\n    `-2x₁ + x₂ + 0x₃ + x₄ = 0`\n    `x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃ + 0x₄ = 0`\n    `0x₁ + x₂ - 2x₃ + x₄ = 0`\n    `x₁ + 0x₂ + x₃ - 2x₄ = 0`\n\n    The matrix `M` is:\n    ```\n    [ -2   1   0   1 ]\n    [  1  -2   1   0 ]\n    [  0   1  -2   1 ]\n    [  1   0   1  -2 ]\n    ```\n2.  **Calculate the Knot Determinant:** The determinant of a knot is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of any `(k-1)x(k-1)` submatrix of the `k x k` coloring matrix. Here, `k=4`, so we need to calculate the determinant of any `3x3` submatrix. Let's remove the last row and last column.\n\n    The submatrix `M'` is:\n    ```\n    [ -2   1   0 ]\n    [  1  -2   1 ]\n    [  0   1  -2 ]\n    ```\n    Now, we calculate its determinant:\n    `det(M') = -2 * ((-2)*(-2) - 1*1) - 1 * (1*(-2) - 1*0) + 0 * (...)`\n    `det(M') = -2 * (4 - 1) - 1 * (-2 - 0)`\n    `det(M') = -2 * (3) - 1 * (-2)`\n    `det(M') = -6 + 2`\n    `det(M') = -4`\n\n    Let's try another submatrix to be sure. Let's remove the first row and first column.\n    The submatrix `M''` is:\n    ```\n    [ -2   1   0 ]\n    [  1  -2   1 ]\n    [  0   1  -2 ]\n    ```\n    Wait, I made a mistake in the equations or the standard diagram. Let's use a more common set of relations from knot theory literature.\n\n    **Corrected Analysis:**\n    A standard labeling gives the following relations:\n    1. `2x₁ - x₂ - x₄ = 0`\n    2. `2x₃ - x₁ - x₂ = 0`\n    3. `2x₄ - x₁ - x₃ = 0`\n    4. `2x₂ - x₃ - x₄ = 0`\n\n    The coloring matrix `M` for this system is:\n    ```\n    [  2  -1   0  -1 ]\n    [ -1  -1   2   0 ]\n    [ -1   0  -1   2 ]\n    [  0   2  -1  -1 ]\n    ```\n    Let's take the submatrix `M'` by removing the last row and column:\n    ```\n    [  2  -1   0 ]\n    [ -1  -1   2 ]\n    [ -1   0  -1 ]\n    ```\n    `det(M') = 2 * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*0) - (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1)) + 0 * (...)`\n    `det(M') = 2 * (1 - 0) + 1 * (1 - (-2))`\n    `det(M') = 2 * (1) + 1 * (3)`\n    `det(M') = 2 + 3 = 5`\n\n    The determinant of the figure-eight knot is `|5| = 5`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  **Condition for Colorability:** The figure-eight knot is n-colorable if and only if `n` is a divisor of its determinant, which is 5.\n2.  **Finding the Smallest `n`:** The divisors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n3.  **Non-Triviality:** A coloring with `n=1` is always trivial (only one color exists). To have a non-trivial coloring, we need `n > 1`.\n4.  **Smallest Structure:** The smallest divisor of 5 that is greater than 1 is 5. Therefore, the smallest value `n` for which the figure-eight knot is n-colorable is 5.\n\nThis means the smallest algebraic structure (dihedral quandle) that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is `R₅`, which has 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
