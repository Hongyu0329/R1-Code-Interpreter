    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Grand Canonical Partition Function**\n    The grand canonical partition function, Z, for a quantum system is defined as the trace of the exponential of the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\n    Here, $\\hat{H}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator, $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ where $T$ is the temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The trace (Tr) is taken over all states in the Fock space, which includes states with different particle numbers.\n\n2.  **Identify the Operator in the Exponent**\n    The problem provides the Hamiltonian of the system as $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. We must substitute this into the general formula for the grand canonical partition function.\n    The operator in the exponent is:\n    $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$\n    So, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** A common mistake is to assume the given Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is already the grand canonical one. The question explicitly states it is the system's Hamiltonian, so we must subtract the $\\mu \\hat{N}$ term as per the definition of the grand canonical ensemble.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Path Integral**\n    The partition function can be written as a functional path integral over fields that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$. For a system of bosons described by a complex scalar field $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$, the partition function is:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S_E[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\n    The Euclidean action $S_E$ is related to the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{K}$. The general form of the action is:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, [\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi + \\mathcal{K}(\\psi^*, \\psi)]$\n    where $\\mathcal{K}(\\psi^*, \\psi)$ is the Hamiltonian density corresponding to the operator $\\hat{K}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Euclidean Action ($S_E$)**\n    From Step 2, we have $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$. The particle number operator in second quantization is $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}) \\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$.\n    Thus, the grand canonical Hamiltonian is $\\hat{K} = \\int d^d x \\, (-2\\mu \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger \\hat{\\psi})$. The corresponding density is $\\mathcal{K} = -2\\mu \\psi^* \\psi$.\n    Substituting this into the action gives:\n    $S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, [\\psi^* \\partial_\\tau \\psi - 2\\mu \\psi^* \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** Note the absence of a kinetic energy term (like $-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2$) because the original Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ did not contain one. It only depended on the number operator $\\hat{N}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Path Integral**\n    The action is quadratic in the fields, so this is a Gaussian path integral. We can evaluate it by finding the determinant of the operator in the action. The result of a Gaussian path integral for complex fields is the inverse of the determinant of the operator.\n    $Z = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu)]^{-1}$\n    To calculate the determinant, we find its eigenvalues by transforming to the frequency-momentum domain. The eigenvalues are found by applying the operator to the basis functions $e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - \\omega_n \\tau)}$. The operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n/\\beta$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.\n    The eigenvalues of the operator are $(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$ for each mode $(n, \\mathbf{k})$.\n    The determinant is the product of all eigenvalues:\n    $\\det(\\partial_\\tau - 2\\mu) = \\prod_{n, \\mathbf{k}} (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n    Therefore, the partition function is:\n    $Z = \\left( \\prod_{n, \\mathbf{k}} (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) \\right)^{-1} = \\prod_{\\mathbf{k}} \\prod_n (-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)^{-1}$\n\n6.  **Perform the Sum/Product over Frequencies**\n    It is easier to work with $\\ln Z$:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu)$\n    This is a standard Matsubara sum. For bosons, the result is:\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n + E) = \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E}) + C$\n    where C is a temperature-independent constant (related to vacuum energy) which can be disregarded. In our case, the energy-like term is $E = -2\\mu$.\n    So, the sum over $n$ for each spatial mode $\\mathbf{k}$ is:\n    $\\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - 2\\mu) = \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}) = \\ln(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n\n7.  **Sum over Spatial Modes and Final Result**\n    Substituting this back into the expression for $\\ln Z$:\n    $\\ln Z = -\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\ln(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n    The term $\\ln(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})$ is independent of the spatial mode index $\\mathbf{k}$ because our Hamiltonian had no spatial dependence. The sum $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}$ therefore simply counts the total number of available single-particle states. Let this number be $M$.\n    $\\ln Z = -M \\ln(1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}) = \\ln\\left((1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}\\right)$\n    Exponentiating both sides gives the final expression for the partition function:\n    $Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** This result is physically meaningful only if the term in the denominator is positive, which requires $e^{2\\beta\\mu} < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this implies $2\\mu < 0$, or $\\mu < 0$. This is the condition for the stability of the system, preventing an infinite number of particles from populating the ground state (Bose-Einstein condensation into a state with negative energy cost).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe partition function Z for the system is given by the product over all $M$ single-particle states. Since the energy of each state is identical, the result is:\n$Z = (1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\nwhere $M$ is the total number of single-particle states available to the system, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n<<<Z = (1 - e^(2*β*μ))^(-M)>>>"
