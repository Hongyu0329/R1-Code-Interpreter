    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Basic Operations:**\n    The algorithm uses fundamental arithmetic operations: assignment `:=`, integer division `⌊x/c⌋`, multiplication `*`, and subtraction `-`. In standard computational models (like the RAM model), these operations are assumed to take constant time, which we denote as O(1), as long as the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a single machine word.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initialization Step (Step 1):**\n    `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    This step consists of:\n    *   Two assignments (`i := 0`, `x := n`).\n    *   One division and floor operation (`q := ⌊x/c⌋`).\n    *   One multiplication and one subtraction (`a_{0} := x - qc`).\n    Each of these is a basic operation taking O(1) time. Therefore, the total time for the initialization step is O(1).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Loop (Step 2):**\n    The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things:\n    *   The time complexity of a single iteration of the loop.\n    *   The total number of iterations the loop will execute.\n\n    *   **Complexity of a single iteration:**\n        The body of the loop (step 2.1) consists of:\n        *   `i := i + 1`: One increment (O(1)).\n        *   `x := q`: One assignment (O(1)).\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One division and floor (O(1)).\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc`: One multiplication and one subtraction (O(1)).\n        The total time for a single iteration of the loop is the sum of these constant-time operations, which is O(1).\n\n    *   **Number of iterations:**\n        The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's track the value of `q` through the execution.\n        *   Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes the initial `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(initial q)/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   In the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊(previous q)/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        The loop terminates when this value of `q` becomes 0. Let `k_{iter}` be the total number of iterations. The loop runs for the `k_{iter}`-th time, but not for the `(k_{iter}+1)`-th time. This means the value of `q` entering the `(k_{iter}+1)`-th check is 0, while the value entering the `k_{iter}`-th check was greater than 0.\n        *   The value of `q` that is checked for the `k`-th iteration is `⌊n/c^k⌋`.\n        *   The loop runs as long as `⌊n/c^k⌋ > 0`, which implies `n/c^k ≥ 1`, or `n ≥ c^k`.\n        *   The loop stops when `⌊n/c^k⌋ = 0`, which implies `n/c^k < 1`, or `n < c^k`.\n        So, if the loop runs `k_{iter}` times, we have `c^{k_{iter}} ≤ n < c^{k_{iter}+1}`.\n        Taking the logarithm base `c` of this inequality gives:\n        `log_c(c^{k_{iter}}) ≤ log_c(n) < log_c(c^{k_{iter}+1})`\n        `k_{iter} ≤ log_c(n) < k_{iter} + 1`\n        This shows that the number of iterations, `k_{iter}`, is equal to `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n\n    *   **Total complexity of the loop:**\n        The total time spent in the loop is the (number of iterations) × (time per iteration).\n        Total Loop Time = `⌊log_c(n)⌋ * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Return Step (Step 3):**\n    `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n    This step involves returning the computed digits. The number of digits is `i+1`. After `k_{iter}` iterations, the final value of `i` is `k_{iter}`. So, `k_{iter}+1` digits are returned. The time to assemble and return this sequence is proportional to the number of digits, which is `O(k_{iter}) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Computational Time Complexity:**\n    The total complexity is the sum of the complexities of all steps.\n    Total Time = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n    Total Time = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(log_c(n))`\n    The dominant term is `O(log_c(n))`. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Assumption of O(1) Operations:** The analysis relies on the assumption that basic arithmetic operations on integers are constant time. This is valid for numbers that fit in a computer's word size. For arbitrarily large numbers (bignum arithmetic), the cost of these operations would depend on the number of bits in the operands (which is `O(log n)`), and the complexity would be higher. However, for standard algorithm analysis, O(1) is the conventional assumption.\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity is a function of the input value `n`. The number of bits needed to represent `n` is proportional to `log n`. Since the complexity is `O(log_c(n))`, the algorithm's runtime is linear with respect to the size of the input in bits.\n*   **Base of Logarithm:** In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm can be ignored if it's a constant because `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`, and `1/log(c)` is a constant factor when `c` is constant. Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`. However, `O(log_c(n))` is a more precise description of the number of operations for this specific algorithm.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The value of `q` is effectively divided by `c` in each iteration. This process repeats until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` is given by `log_c(n)`. Each iteration takes constant time. Therefore, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
