The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\psi^* \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\psi^*, \psi]}$, where the integral is over all Grassmann field configurations satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions, $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$. The Euclidean action is given by $S_E[\psi^*, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \, [\psi^*(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\psi^*(\tau), \psi(\tau))]$.
