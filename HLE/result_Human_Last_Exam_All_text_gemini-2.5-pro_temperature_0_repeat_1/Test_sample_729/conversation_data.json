    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The Specific Group:** We are given a group of size 128. So, $|Q_{4n}| = 128$, which means $4n = 128$, and thus $n = 32$. The group is $Q_{128}$, with the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup is another term for a cyclic subgroup. A subgroup $H$ is a cyclic subgroup if it can be generated by a single element, i.e., $H = \\langle g \\rangle$ for some $g$ in the group.\n*   **Goal:** We need to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Elements of $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be partitioned into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements of the subgroup generated by $x$, which is $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  The elements of the form $yx^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each of these two sets.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Cyclic Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. A fundamental property of cyclic groups is that for a cyclic group of order $m$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\n\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $m=64$.\n*   The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n*   There are 7 divisors of 64.\n*   Therefore, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ for each divisor $d$ of 64.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the Form $yx^k$**\n\nFirst, we need to find the order of an element of the form $g = yx^k$.\nUsing the group relations ($xy = yx^{-1}$ and $y^2 = x^{32}$):\n$g^2 = (yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y)x^k = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k} x^k = y^2 = x^{32}$.\nThe order of $x^{32}$ is $\\frac{|\\langle x \\rangle|}{\\gcd(64, 32)} = \\frac{64}{32} = 2$.\nSince $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$ and $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$, the order of every element $g = yx^k$ is 4.\n\nNow we must count how many distinct subgroups these 64 elements of order 4 generate. Let $H_k = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$. Two such subgroups, $H_k$ and $H_j$, are identical if and only if their generators are related. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. The generators of $H_k$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n\n$H_k = H_j$ if and only if $yx^j$ is a generator of $H_k$.\n*   Case 1: $yx^j = yx^k \\implies j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$.\n*   Case 2: $yx^j = (yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2(yx^k) = x^{32}yx^k$.\n    The element $x^{32}$ is central in $Q_{128}$, so it commutes with $y$.\n    $yx^j = yx^{32}x^k = yx^{k+32}$.\n    This implies $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\n\nSo, $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$. This means the 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ form pairs, where each pair generates the same subgroup. For example, $\\langle y \\rangle$ is the same subgroup as $\\langle yx^{32} \\rangle$.\nThe number of distinct subgroups is the number of such pairs, which is $64 / 2 = 32$.\nSo, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\n\nWe have found two sets of cyclic subgroups:\n1.  The 7 cyclic subgroups that are subsets of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The 32 cyclic subgroups of the form $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$.\n\nWe must check for any overlap. A subgroup from the second set, $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$, contains the element $yx^k$, which is not an element of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Subgroups from the first set are entirely contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$. Therefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint sets.\nTotal number = 7 + 32 = 39."
