The two languages are **Korean** and **Persian (Farsi)**.

*   **Mom:** The Korean word is **eomma** (엄마), which is similar to the Persian **māmān** (مامان).
*   **Dad:** The Korean word is **appa** (아빠), which is highly similar to the Persian **bābā** (بابا).
*   **Broom:** The Korean word is **bitjaru** (빗자루), which is strikingly similar to the Persian word **jāru** (جارو).

These two languages are from distinct cultural regions (East Asia and West Asia), belong to different language families (Koreanic and Indo-European), and have no history of direct contact that would explain these similarities, making them a prime example of linguistic coincidence.
