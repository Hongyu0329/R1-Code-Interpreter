    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find a game construction whose value is $\\frac{13}{16}$ and then count the total number of red and blue edges (pieces) in that construction. The question implies finding the most economical construction in terms of the number of pieces.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Decompose the number into a sum of powers of 2.**\n    This is equivalent to finding the binary representation of the number. The value of a Hackenbush game that is a sum of several independent sub-games (i.e., multiple \"stalks\" or \"flowers\" all connected to the ground) is the sum of the values of those sub-games. This provides a straightforward way to construct a game for any dyadic rational.\n\n    The number is $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n    We can write this as a sum of fractions with powers of 2 in the denominator:\n    $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8 + 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n    In binary, $\\frac{13}{16}$ is $0.1101_2$. The '1's correspond to the terms $2^{-1}$, $2^{-2}$, and $2^{-4}$, which are $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$ respectively.\n\n2.  **Determine the game representation for each term $\\frac{1}{2^n}$.**\n    We need to find the simplest Hackenbush game (in terms of the number of pieces) for each of the terms $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\n    *   **Game for 1:** The game for the number 1 is a single red edge connected to the ground.\n    *   **Game for $\\frac{1}{2}$:** The value $\\frac{1}{2}$ is the simplest number between 0 and 1. In the surreal number system, $\\frac{1}{2} = \\{0|1\\}$. In Hackenbush, this can be constructed as a blue edge placed on top of a game with value 1. A game with value 1 is a single red edge. So, the game for $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a blue edge on top of a red edge.\n        *   Pieces needed for $\\frac{1}{2}$: 1 red + 1 blue = 2 pieces.\n\n    *   **Game for $\\frac{1}{4}$:** The value $\\frac{1}{4}$ is the simplest number between 0 and $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, $\\frac{1}{4} = \\{0|\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. A simpler construction is to see it as $\\{|\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This is a blue edge placed on top of the game for $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n        *   The game for $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a blue-on-red stalk. Adding another blue edge on top gives a stalk of one red edge at the bottom and two blue edges on top.\n        *   Pieces needed for $\\frac{1}{4}$: 1 red + 2 blue = 3 pieces.\n\n    *   **Generalizing for $\\frac{1}{2^n}$:** The game for $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ is constructed by placing a blue edge on top of the game for $\\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$. This results in a single stalk consisting of one red edge at the bottom, topped by a stack of $n$ blue edges.\n        *   Total pieces needed for $\\frac{1}{2^n}$: 1 red + n blue = $n+1$ pieces.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of pieces for each component of $\\frac{13}{16}$.**\n    Using the formula from the previous step:\n    *   For the term $\\frac{1}{2}$ ($n=1$): Number of pieces = $1+1 = 2$.\n    *   For the term $\\frac{1}{4}$ ($n=2$): Number of pieces = $2+1 = 3$.\n    *   For the term $\\frac{1}{16}$ ($n=4$): Number of pieces = $4+1 = 5$.\n\n4.  **Sum the number of pieces for the total.**\n    The game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$. This corresponds to three separate stalks connected to the ground. The total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces in each stalk.\n\n    Total pieces = (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{2}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{4}$) + (Pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\n    Total pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThis construction is known to be the simplest in terms of piece count for dyadic rationals of this form.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n-   Game for $\\frac{1}{2}$: 2 pieces\n-   Game for $\\frac{1}{4}$: 3 pieces\n-   Game for $\\frac{1}{16}$: 5 pieces\n-   Total pieces for $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$ is $2+3+5=10$."
