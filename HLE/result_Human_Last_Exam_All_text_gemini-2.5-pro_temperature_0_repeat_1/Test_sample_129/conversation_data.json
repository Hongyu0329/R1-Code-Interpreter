    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n**Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n**Length:** 5\n**Value:** True\n**Precedence:** ! > & > |\n\nWe can categorize the expressions by their top-level structure. An expression must be syntactically valid.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions without Binary Operators (&, |)\n\nThese expressions are constructed using only T, F, !, (, ). We can build them up by length. A more systematic way is to consider valid expressions of length 4 and see how to extend them to length 5.\n\nA length-5 expression without binary operators can be formed in two ways:\n1.  `(E)` where `E` is a true expression of length 4.\n2.  `!E` where `E` is a false expression of length 4.\n\nFirst, let's list all valid expressions of length 4 without binary operators and their boolean values:\n*   `!!!!T` is not length 4.\n*   `!!!T` -> F\n*   `!!!F` -> T\n*   `!!(T)` -> T\n*   `!!(F)` -> F\n*   `!(!T)` -> T\n*   `!(!F)` -> F\n*   `(!(T))` -> F\n*   `(!(F))` -> T\n*   `((T))` -> T\n*   `((F))` -> F\n*   `(!T)` is not a valid expression of length 4. It's `(!T)`.\n*   `(!!T)` -> T\n*   `(!!F)` -> F\n\nLet's re-list the valid L4 expressions without binary operators:\n*   **True L4 expressions:** `!!!F`, `!!(T)`, `!(!T)`, `(!(F))`, `((T))`, `(!!T)`. (6 expressions)\n*   **False L4 expressions:** `!!!T`, `!!(F)`, `!(!F)`, `(!(T))`, `((F))`, `(!!F)`. (6 expressions)\n\nNow, let's form the L5 expressions:\n1.  From the 6 **True** L4 expressions, we form `(E)`:\n    *   `(!!!F)`, `(!!(T))`, `(!(!T))`, `((!(F)))`, `(((T)))`, `((!!T))`.\n    *   This gives **6** true expressions.\n2.  From the 6 **False** L4 expressions, we form `!E`:\n    *   `!(!!!T)` (which is `!!!!T`), `!(!!(F))` (which is `!!!(F)`), `!(!(!F))`, `!((!(T)))`, `!(((F)))`, `!((!!F))`.\n    *   This gives **6** true expressions.\n\nTotal for Category 1: 6 + 6 = **12**.\n*Note: A previous version of this thought process found 14, but `(!F)` and `(!T)` were misidentified as L4 expressions. They are L4 only with parentheses, i.e., `(!F)`. The list above is corrected.*\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with One Unparenthesized Binary Operator\n\nThe structure is `A op B`, where `op` is `&` or `|`. The total length is 5, so `length(A) + length(B) = 4`.\n*   **Case 2.1: length(A)=1, length(B)=3**\n    *   A can be T or F. B must be a valid L3 expression.\n    *   L3 expressions: `!!T`(T), `(T)`(T), `!(F)`(T), `!!F`(F), `(F)`(F), `!(T)`(F).\n    *   `T & B` is true if B is true (3 ways).\n    *   `T | B` is true for any B (6 ways).\n    *   `F & B` is never true.\n    *   `F | B` is true if B is true (3 ways).\n    *   Total: 3 + 6 + 3 = 12.\n*   **Case 2.2: length(A)=3, length(B)=1**\n    *   Symmetric to the above. Total: 12.\n*   **Case 2.3: length(A)=2, length(B)=2**\n    *   A and B must be L2 expressions: `!T`(F), `!F`(T).\n    *   `A & B` is true only for `!F & !F` (1 way).\n    *   `A | B` is true for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` (3 ways).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\nTotal for Category 2: 12 + 12 + 4 = **28**.\n\n### Category 3: Expressions with Two Unparenthesized Binary Operators\n\nThe structure is `A op1 B op2 C`, where A, B, C are single symbols (T/F). `length(A)+length(B)+length(C) = 3`.\n*   `X & Y | Z` (parsed as `(X&Y)|Z`): True if Z=T (4 ways) or if Z=F, X=T, Y=T (1 way). Total: 5.\n*   `X | Y & Z` (parsed as `X|(Y&Z)`): True if X=T (4 ways) or if X=F, Y=T, Z=T (1 way). Total: 5.\n*   `X & Y & Z`: True only if X=Y=Z=T (1 way).\n*   `X | Y | Z`: True unless X=Y=Z=F (8 - 1 = 7 ways).\nTotal for Category 3: 5 + 5 + 1 + 7 = **18**.\n\n### Category 4: Parenthesized Expressions with Binary Operators\n\n*   **Structure `(A op B)`:** `length(A)+length(B) = 2`. A, B must be L1 (T/F).\n    *   `(T & T)` is true (1 way).\n    *   `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` are true (3 ways).\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = **4**.\n*   **Structure `!(A op B)`:** `length(A)+length(B) = 2`. A, B must be L1. We need `A op B` to be false.\n    *   `A & B` is false for `(T,F), (F,T), (F,F)` (3 ways).\n    *   `A | B` is false for `(F,F)` (1 way).\n    *   Total: 3 + 1 = **4**.\n*   **Structure `(!A op B)`:** `length(A)+length(B) = 2`. A, B must be L1.\n    *   `!T op T` (F op T): True for `|` (1).\n    *   `!T op F` (F op F): False.\n    *   `!F op T` (T op T): True for `&`, `|` (2).\n    *   `!F op F` (T op F): True for `|` (1).\n    *   Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = **4**.\n*   **Structure `(A op !B)`:** `length(A)+length(B) = 2`. A, B must be L1.\n    *   Symmetric to the above. Total: **4**.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nWe sum the counts from all disjoint categories. The categorization is based on the top-level structure of the expression string, ensuring no overlaps.\n\n1.  **No Binary Operators:** 12\n2.  **One Unparenthesized Binary Op:** 28\n3.  **Two Unparenthesized Binary Ops:** 18\n4.  **Parenthesized `(A op B)`:** 4\n5.  **Parenthesized `!(A op B)`:** 4\n6.  **Parenthesized `(!A op B)`:** 4\n7.  **Parenthesized `(A op !B)`:** 4\n\nTotal = 12 + 28 + 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **74**.\n\n<<<74>>>"
