The equations for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega_L)$ are:

**a) Negligible interaction between molecules:**
The absorption spectrum is a single Gaussian peak centered at the monomer transition frequency $\omega_{eg}$.
$$ \sigma_a(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\tau N |\mu_{eg}|^2 \omega_{eg}}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \exp\left(-(\omega_{eg} - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2\right) $$

**b) Near-neighbor interaction considered (Frenkel Exciton Model):**
The absorption spectrum is a single Gaussian peak, shifted by the exciton coupling energy $2J$.
$$ \sigma_b(\omega_L) = \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\tau N |\mu_{eg}|^2 \left(\omega_{eg} + \frac{2J}{\hbar}\right)}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \exp\left(-\left(\omega_{eg} + \frac{2J}{\hbar} - \omega_L\right)^2 \tau^2\right) $$

Where:
- $\omega_L$: Laser carrier frequency.
- $\tau$: Gaussian pulse duration.
- $N$: Number of molecules in the chain.
- $\mu_{eg}$: Transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
- $\omega_{eg}$: Transition frequency of a single molecule.
- $J$: Near-neighbor coupling energy.
- $\hbar$: Reduced Planck's constant.
- $c$: Speed of light.
- $\epsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space.
