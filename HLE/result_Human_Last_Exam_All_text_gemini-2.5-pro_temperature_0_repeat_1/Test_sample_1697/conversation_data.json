    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to an amide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. The group is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂. This is attached at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     /\n  (1)C----(2)CH\n //  \\\\  /\n(6)CH  C--(3)C-N(Me)₂\n \\\\  //  \\\n  (5)CH--(4)CH\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Deprotonation/Lithiation)**\n\n*   **Reagents**: sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine).\n*   **Solvent**: THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This set of reagents is used for **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**, also known as the Snieckus reaction. sec-BuLi is a very strong base that removes a proton (deprotonation) from the most acidic position on the aromatic ring.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 2:**\n\n*   **Identifying Directing Groups**: The key to DoM is the presence of a \"Directing Metalation Group\" (DMG) on the ring. This group coordinates to the lithium ion (Li⁺) of sec-BuLi, bringing the base close to a proton on an adjacent (ortho) carbon, facilitating its removal.\n*   **Ranking Directing Groups**: The starting material has two potential directing groups:\n    1.  **-C(=O)N(Et)₂ (amide)** at position 1. This is a very powerful directing group.\n    2.  **-N(Me)₂ (amino)** at position 3. This is also a good directing group, but significantly weaker than the amide group.\n*   **Determining the Site of Lithiation**: The deprotonation will occur at the position ortho to the strongest directing group.\n    *   The positions ortho to the strong amide group (-CONEt₂) are C2 and C6.\n    *   The positions ortho to the weaker amino group (-NMe₂) are C2 and C4.\n*   **Cooperative Effect**: The C2 position is ortho to *both* directing groups. This creates a \"cooperative effect\" where the lithium ion can be chelated by both the amide's oxygen and the amino's nitrogen. This makes the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and the most favorable site for deprotonation. Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position.\n\nThe intermediate formed is an aryllithium compound:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     /\n  (1)C----(2)C-Li⁺\n //  \\\\  /\n(6)CH  C--(3)C-N(Me)₂\n \\\\  //  \\\n  (5)CH--(4)CH\n```\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench)**\n\n*   **Reagent**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction Type**: The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 2 is a strong nucleophile (effectively a carbanion at C2). Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The reaction is a nucleophilic attack of the carbanion on the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 3:**\n\n*   **Nucleophile-Electrophile Reaction**: The negatively charged carbon at position 2 attacks the partially positive carbon of the methyl group in CH₃I.\n*   **Bond Formation**: A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group. The lithium is replaced by a methyl group.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\n\nBy combining the results of the steps, we can determine the structure of the final product. A methyl group (-CH₃) is added to the C2 position of the starting material.\n\n*   **Starting Material**: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   **Modification**: Addition of a methyl group at position 2.\n*   **Final Product Name**: **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**\n\nThe final structure is:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     /\n  (1)C----(2)C-CH₃\n //  \\\\  /\n(6)CH  C--(3)C-N(Me)₂\n \\\\  //  \\\n  (5)CH--(4)CH\n```\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
