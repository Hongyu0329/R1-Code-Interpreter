    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, known as a heptad repeat. The positions within this repeat are labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`.\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`:** These are the core positions. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), Alanine (A)). These residues face inward and pack against each other, forming a \"hydrophobic seam\" that holds the helices together.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`:** These are often charged or polar residues. They flank the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between adjacent helices.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`:** These are typically solvent-exposed positions on the outside of the coiled-coil.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to assign the `a` through `g` positions to this sequence. The key is to find a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall into the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test a possible phasing. A common feature is a hydrophobic residue at position `d` followed by another one three residues later at position `a` (`d` -> `e` -> `f` -> `g` -> `a`).\n\nLet's assume the first Isoleucine (I) at position 3 is in a `d` position.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   Register: `b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c`\n\nLet's check if this assignment makes sense by listing the residues at the critical `a` and `d` positions:\n\n*   **`a` positions (every 7th residue starting from L at pos 7):**\n    *   Position 7: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 14: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 21: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   Position 28: **L** (Leucine)\n    *   *Conclusion:* All `a` positions are Leucine, a canonical hydrophobic residue. This is a very strong, consistent pattern.\n\n*   **`d` positions (every 7th residue starting from I at pos 3):**\n    *   Position 3: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 10: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 17: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   Position 24: **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   *Conclusion:* All `d` positions are Isoleucine, another canonical hydrophobic residue. This is also a very strong, consistent pattern.\n\nThis phasing is highly likely to be correct.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the \"Knobs-into-Holes\" Packing Model to Determine Oligomeric State\n\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is a primary determinant of the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.). This is due to the steric requirements of packing the side chains (\"knobs\") into the spaces between side chains on the opposing helix (\"holes\").\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Side Chain Shape.** Isoleucine (I) and Valine (V) are \"β-branched\" amino acids, meaning they are bulky close to the protein backbone. Leucine (L) is not β-branched; its bulk is further down the side chain, making it more flexible.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Packing Geometry.** The packing environment is different for the `a` and `d` positions and changes with the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Dimers and Trimers:** These structures are most stable when the bulky β-branched residues (I or V) are at the `a` position and the more flexible Leucine (L) is at the `d` position. The pattern is **`a`=I/V, `d`=L**.\n    *   **Tetramers:** Four-helix bundles have a different packing geometry. They are most stable with the reverse pattern: the flexible Leucine (L) occupies the more sterically crowded `a` position, and the bulky β-branched Isoleucine (I) or Valine (V) occupies the relatively less crowded `d` position. The pattern is **`a`=L, `d`=I/V**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Oligomeric State for the Sequence\n\nOur analysis of the sequence yielded the following core pattern:\n*   **`a` positions = L (Leucine)**\n*   **`d` positions = I (Isoleucine)**\n\nThis **`a=L, d=I`** pattern is the classic signature for a **tetrameric (4-helix) coiled-coil**. The packing of flexible Leucine at the `a` positions and bulky Isoleucine at the `d` positions is sterically favorable and highly efficient in a four-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the protein is most likely to form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
