No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not radial. The justification for using a coordinate system based on the radial direction is the **radial propagation assumption**, which is a simplification derived from Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis for analyzing single-spacecraft data. This assumes the wave propagates radially with the solar wind, even though the physical magnetic field follows the non-radial Parker Spiral and the AIC waves physically propagate along this magnetic field.
