    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ that intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$, where $G=(\\Bbb{Z}/49\\Bbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the group G and its cyclic subgroups.\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group. The order of an element $g=(g_1, \\dots, g_{2024}) \\in G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components, $\\text{ord}(g) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(g_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(g_{2024}))$.\nThe order of any element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ must be a divisor of 49. The divisors are 1, 7, and 49.\nTherefore, the order of any element in $G$ must also be one of 1, 7, or 49.\nThis means that any cyclic subgroup of $G$, $H = \\langle g \\rangle$, will have order 1, 7, or 49.\n\n### Step 2: Reduce the problem by analyzing the condition on A.\nWe are looking for a set $A \\subset G$ of minimum size such that for every cyclic subgroup $H \\le G$, the intersection $A \\cap H$ is non-empty.\n\n1.  **The trivial subgroup:** The subgroup of order 1 is $H_0 = \\{0\\}$, where $0$ is the identity element of $G$. The condition $A \\cap H_0 \\neq \\emptyset$ implies that $0 \\in A$.\n\n2.  **Subgroup inclusion:** Consider a cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $H_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $\\text{ord}(g)=49$. Inside this subgroup, there is a unique subgroup of order 7, which is $H_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$. Note that $\\text{ord}(7g) = 49/\\text{gcd}(7,49) = 7$.\n    If our set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7, it must contain some element $a \\in H_7$. Since $H_7$ is a subset of $H_{49}$, this element $a$ is also in $H_{49}$. Thus, $A \\cap H_{49} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n3.  **Simplified condition:** From the above points, the condition that $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$ is equivalent to the following two conditions:\n    a) $0 \\in A$.\n    b) $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\nLet $A = A' \\cup \\{0\\}$, where $0 \\notin A'$. For any cyclic subgroup $H$ of order 7, we must have $A \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$. Since $0 \\notin H$ (as $H \\neq \\{0\\}$), this means we must have $A' \\cap H \\neq \\emptyset$. The elements of $A'$ must therefore be elements of order 7.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize the set of elements of order 7.\nAn element $g \\in G$ has order dividing 7 if and only if $7g = 0$. The set of all such elements forms a subgroup of $G$, let's call it $V$.\n$V = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = 0\\}$.\nFor a single component $g_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$, the condition $7g_i = 0 \\pmod{49}$ means $g_i$ is a multiple of 7. The set of such elements is $\\{0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42\\}$, which is a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\nTherefore, $V$ is isomorphic to the direct product of 2024 copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n$V \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\nThis makes $V$ a vector space of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Rephrase the problem in terms of vector spaces.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7 is generated by an element of order 7. The elements of order 7 are precisely the non-zero elements of the vector space $V$.\nA cyclic subgroup of order 7, $\\langle g \\rangle$ with $\\text{ord}(g)=7$, consists of the elements $\\{0, g, 2g, \\dots, 6g\\}$. In the language of vector spaces, this is the set $\\{\\lambda g \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_7\\}$, which is the 1-dimensional subspace of $V$ spanned by the vector $g$.\nSo, the cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the 1-dimensional subspaces of the vector space $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$.\n\nThe problem is now to find the minimum size of a set $A' \\subset V \\setminus \\{0\\}$ that has a non-empty intersection with every 1-dimensional subspace of $V$. This is a \"hitting set\" or \"transversal\" problem.\n\n### Step 5: Solve the hitting set problem.\nLet $\\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$. We want to find the minimum size of $A'$ such that $A' \\cap L \\neq \\emptyset$ for all $L \\in \\mathcal{L}$.\n\nLet $L_1$ and $L_2$ be two distinct 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Their intersection is just the zero vector: $L_1 \\cap L_2 = \\{0\\}$. This means that the sets of their non-zero vectors are disjoint: $(L_1 \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\cap (L_2 \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\emptyset$.\n\nThe collection of sets $\\{L \\setminus \\{0\\} \\mid L \\in \\mathcal{L}\\}$ forms a partition of the set of all non-zero vectors $V \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nTo have a non-empty intersection with each set $L \\in \\mathcal{L}$, our hitting set $A'$ must contain at least one element from each set $L \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Since these sets are disjoint, we must select a distinct element for each subspace.\nTherefore, the minimum possible size of $A'$ is the total number of these subspaces, $|\\mathcal{L}|$.\n\nWe can construct such a set $A'$ by choosing exactly one non-zero vector from each 1-dimensional subspace. The resulting set will have size $|\\mathcal{L}|$ and will satisfy the condition.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the number of 1-dimensional subspaces.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$.\nIn our case, the vector space is $V = (\\mathbb{F}_7)^{2024}$, so $q=7$ and $n=2024$.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces is:\n$|\\mathcal{L}| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\nSo, the minimum size of $A'$ is $\\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n### Step 7: Determine the final answer.\nThe set $A$ is $A' \\cup \\{0\\}$. The minimum size of $A$ is therefore $|A'| + 1$.\nMinimum size of $A = 1 + |A'| = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{6}{6} + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{6 + 7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\nThis is an integer because $7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$, so $7^{2024} \\equiv 1^{2024} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$. Thus, $7^{2024} + 5 \\equiv 1 + 5 \\equiv 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 6$.\n\nThe smallest size of the set $A$ is the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 plus one for the trivial subgroup.\n\n<<<1 + (7^2024 - 1)/6>>>"
