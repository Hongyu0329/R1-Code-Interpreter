    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer who \"performs\" as a cardboard cutout at the Junior prom in a particular episode of an online cartoon.\n    *   **Cartoon Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n    *   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n    *   **Event:** Junior prom\n    *   **Performer Type:** Cardboard cutout\n    *   **Character Type:** Fictional singer\n\n2.  **Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\":** The main plot of this episode revolves around the four main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) getting ready for and attending their Junior prom.\n\n3.  **Focus on the \"performer at the prom\" scene:** A key part of the prom plot point is the musical entertainment. The girls discuss who will be playing. What's Her Face says she heard it's \"some new indie sensation.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the reveal of the performer:** When they arrive at the prom, the \"live performance\" is revealed. Instead of a real band or singer, there is a cardboard cutout on the stage next to a sign.\n\n5.  **Determine the name of the fictional singer:** Strong Bad, as the narrator/artist of the comic, exclaims, \"It's a cardboard cutout of Kaiser!\" The sign next to the cutout also clearly says \"Live Performance by Kaiser\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Episode:** The answer must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and not any other episode.\n*   **Cardboard Cutout:** The question is not asking for a live performer, but specifically the name associated with the cardboard cutout.\n*   **Fictional Context:** While the name \"Kaiser\" is a clear parody of the real-world British indie rock band \"Kaiser Chiefs,\" within the context of the Homestar Runner universe, \"Kaiser\" is presented as the name of the fictional performer. The question asks for the *fictional* singer's name as presented in the cartoon.\n*   **Verification:** The name \"Kaiser\" is confirmed both visually on the sign and audibly in Strong Bad's narration.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
