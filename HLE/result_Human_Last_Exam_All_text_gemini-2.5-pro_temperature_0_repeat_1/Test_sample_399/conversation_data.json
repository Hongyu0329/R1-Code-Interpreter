    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$\nx'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)\n$$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2\n$$\nThis equation is in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t)g(x)$, where $f(t) = t-1$ and $g(x) = x^2$. This means it is a **separable differential equation**.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo solve a separable equation, we move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n\n**Careful Point:** We will divide by $x^2$. This is only permissible if $x^2 \\neq 0$, i.e., $x \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution to the differential equation. If we substitute $x(t)=0$ into the equation, we get $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\nSeparating the variables gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt\n$$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results and adding a constant of integration, $C$, we get the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution to find the value of $C$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Be careful with the signs when substituting the negative value of $x$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\nSo, the constant of integration is $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution.\n\n**Careful Point:** Perform the arithmetic carefully.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nNow, we can cancel the negative signs on both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\nFinally, to find $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
