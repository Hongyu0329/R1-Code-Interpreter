    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The legendary British rock band.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first chord (designated as 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key) and the one that feels most stable and resolved. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic is C major. In the key of A minor, the tonic is A minor.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the crucial part. It means the chord built on the fifth note is a minor chord.\n    *   In a **minor key**, this is the natural chord. For example, in the key of A minor, the notes are A-B-C-D-E-F-G. The fifth note is E, and the naturally occurring chord built on it is E minor (E-G-B). This is denoted as 'v'. The progression would be **i → v**.\n    *   In a **major key**, this is less common. For example, in the key of C major, the notes are C-D-E-F-G-A-B. The fifth note is G, and the naturally occurring chord is G major (G-B-D). A minor fifth chord would be G minor (G-Bb-D), which is a \"borrowed\" chord from the parallel C minor key. This is denoted as 'vm'. The progression would be **I → vm**.\n*   **Chord Jump:** An immediate transition from one chord to the next.\n*   **Starts with:** The progression must occur at the very beginning of the song.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the Question**\n\nWe are looking for a Beatles song that begins with the progression of the first chord of the key immediately followed by the minor chord built on the fifth note of that key. The most likely scenario is a song in a minor key that starts with the progression **i → v**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's examine the openings of famous Beatles songs, particularly those in minor keys or with distinctive chord progressions.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, complex, dissonant chord. Not a simple tonic chord.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** In E minor. It starts on a C major chord (\"Ah, look at all...\") which is the VI chord, before moving to the E minor tonic (i). The progression is VI → i, not i → v.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** In A minor. The intro is a strummed A minor chord (the tonic, i). The first line of the verse starts on A minor (\"You say...\") and moves to E minor (\"...will love me...\"). E minor is the minor fifth chord (v). This song fits the description, as the first chord change is i → v.\n*   **\"Michelle\":** This is a very strong candidate. The song is in the key of F minor.\n    *   **Tonic (i):** F minor (Fm).\n    *   **Fifth note of F minor:** C.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** C minor (Cm).\n    *   The song begins with a famous, memorable instrumental guitar introduction. The very first chord played is **F minor**. The second chord in the descending sequence is **C minor**.\n    *   Therefore, the song literally starts with the chord jump Fm → Cm, which is a perfect example of a tonic (i) to minor fifth (v) progression.\n\n**Step 4: Compare and Conclude**\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Michelle\" contain the i → v progression at the start of their main musical phrases. However, \"Michelle\" is the more precise answer because its iconic instrumental introduction *is* this progression. The song's identity is tied to this opening chord jump, making it the most definitive example. The progression in \"Things We Said Today\" occurs at the start of the vocal line, after a single-chord intro.\n\nThe song that most famously and immediately starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
