    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to find the duration of the \"Second Great War\" in the StarCraft universe, with the final answer given in years and rounded up.\n\n2.  **Define the \"Second Great War\":** In StarCraft lore, this term refers to the major galactic conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It is distinct from the first Great War (the original *StarCraft*) and the Brood War (the *Brood War* expansion).\n\n3.  **Establish the Start Date:** The Second Great War is considered to have begun with the renewed Zerg offensive against the Terran Dominion. This is the opening event of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign, where the Zerg attack the planet Mar Sara. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n4.  **Establish the End Date:** The war's primary antagonist is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon. The conflict does not truly end until Amon is permanently defeated. This final confrontation occurs in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, where the united Protoss, Terran, and Zerg forces venture into the Void to destroy Amon's essence. The official timeline places the conclusion of the epilogue campaign in the year **2506**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Elapsed Time:**\n    *   The war begins in the year 2504.\n    *   The war ends in the year 2506.\n    *   This means the conflict spans across three different calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   To calculate the actual duration, we must consider the time taken by the events within these years. The events include the campaigns of *Wings of Liberty* (2504), *Heart of the Swarm* (2505), and *Legacy of the Void* plus its epilogue (2506).\n    *   While the exact start and end months are not specified in the lore, the scale of these three galaxy-spanning campaigns, along with the time for troop movements, rebuilding forces (like Kerrigan consolidating the Swarm), and political maneuvering between them, makes it highly plausible that the total duration exceeded two full years.\n    *   For example, a plausible timeline could be the war starting in the first half of 2504 and ending in the latter half of 2506. This would result in a total duration of over two years (e.g., ~2.5 years).\n\n6.  **Apply the \"Rounded Up\" Rule:** The question requires the answer to be in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   If the duration was exactly 2 years, rounding up would result in 2.\n    *   If the duration was anything more than 2 years (e.g., 2 years and 1 month, or 2.1 years), rounding up to the nearest whole year results in 3.\n    *   Given that the war spans three separate calendar years and involves three major campaigns, a duration of slightly over two years is a very reasonable conclusion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Duration vs. Calendar Years:** It's important not to simply subtract the start year from the end year (2506 - 2504 = 2). The duration depends on *when* in those years the events occurred. A war starting on December 31st, 2504, and ending on January 1st, 2506, would only be 1 year and 2 days long, despite touching three calendar years.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clue:** This instruction is key. It suggests the duration is not a perfect integer and requires a specific rounding method. It pushes any value greater than 2.0 towards 3.\n*   **Scope of Conflict:** The Second Great War was a massive, sector-wide conflict. The time required for the events of three full game campaigns to unfold logically supports a duration longer than a simple two years.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. The total elapsed time, covering three major campaigns across the Koprulu Sector, is plausibly greater than two full years. Applying the rule to round up, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
