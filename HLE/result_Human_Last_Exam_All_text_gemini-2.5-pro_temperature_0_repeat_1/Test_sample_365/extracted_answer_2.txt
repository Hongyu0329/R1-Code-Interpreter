The product is a tricyclic ketone with the molecular formula C₂₀H₃₀O₄Si. It is formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The key structural changes are: the C1-C2 bond of the original norbornene skeleton is cleaved; a new C-C single bond is formed between C5 of the norbornene and C2' of the cyclopentenyl ring; the hydroxyl group at C2 is oxidized to a ketone; and a new C=C double bond is formed between C1 and C6 of the original norbornene skeleton. The dimethyl ketal and TBDMS ether groups remain unchanged.
