    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\nWe are given the system matrices:\nA = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]\nB = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix F such that the closed-loop matrix, defined as `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. The characteristic polynomial `P_desired(λ)` is formed from these roots:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Form the Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl` in Terms of F**\nLet the unknown gain matrix be F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]].\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is given by `det(λI - M) = λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\nFor our matrix `A_cl`:\n*   `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `= -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `= -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nThe actual characteristic polynomial `P_actual(λ)` is:\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 5: Equate the Coefficients of the Desired and Actual Polynomials**\nWe match the coefficients of `P_actual(λ)` with `P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n1.  **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `=> f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `=> -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the Elements of F**\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`). This means there is no unique solution for F. We can find one possible solution by making a simplifying choice. A common method is to set some gains to zero. Let's set `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nWith `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the equations simplify to:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`  which is equivalent to `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nNow we solve this 2x2 system. Subtract the first equation from the second:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**Step 7: Construct the Final Matrix F**\nUsing the values we found, the state feedback gain matrix F is:\nF = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The problem specifies the closed-loop matrix as `A + BF`, which is less common than the standard `A - BF`. The calculation must follow the specified form.\n*   The system is a multi-input system (B has two columns). This generally leads to a non-unique solution for the feedback gain F.\n*   To find a specific solution, we can simplify the problem by setting some of the gain elements to zero, which is equivalent to choosing not to use all control inputs or feedback paths. The chosen simplification (`f3=0, f4=0`) is valid because the system is controllable even with only the first input.\n\nFinal Answer:\nOne possible state feedback gain matrix F is:\nF = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
