The first area Charles needs to adjust is his diet. His current approach of simultaneously limiting animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates is overly restrictive and unsustainable. This severe limitation of all major energy and satiety sources is the most likely reason he is "struggling." He should modify his diet to be more balanced, ensuring he consumes enough complex carbohydrates and healthy fats for energy and adequate protein for satiety and muscle preservation, while still maintaining a calorie deficit for weight loss.
