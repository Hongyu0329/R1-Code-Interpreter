    "This problem asks for the leading order expression of the non-trivial fixed point coupling, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions. We will use the renormalization group (RG) framework and the $\\epsilon$-expansion, where the dimension of spacetime is set to $d = 4 - \\epsilon$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Dimensional Analysis of the Coupling Constant**\n\nThe Lagrangian for the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_0^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nThe action $S = \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ must be a dimensionless quantity (in natural units where $\\hbar=c=1$).\n\n*   The dimension of the spacetime volume element is $[d^d x] = M^{-d}$, where $M$ denotes mass dimension.\n*   Therefore, the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must have dimension $[\\mathcal{L}] = M^d$.\n*   From the kinetic term, $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$, we can determine the dimension of the field $\\phi$. Since $[\\partial_\\mu] = M^1$, we have $[(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2] = M^2 [\\phi]^2$. For this to match $[\\mathcal{L}]$, we must have $M^2 [\\phi]^2 = M^d$, which gives the dimension of the field as $[\\phi] = M^{(d-2)/2}$.\n*   Now, we analyze the interaction term, $\\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$. Its dimension must also be $M^d$.\n    $$ [u_0] [\\phi]^4 = [u_0] (M^{(d-2)/2})^4 = [u_0] M^{2(d-2)} = M^d $$\n*   Solving for the dimension of the bare coupling constant $u_0$:\n    $$ [u_0] = M^{d - 2(d-2)} = M^{4-d} $$\n*   In $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, the dimension of $u_0$ is $[u_0] = M^{\\epsilon}$. This is a crucial point: the bare coupling is not dimensionless for $d \\neq 4$.\n\n**Step 2: Defining a Dimensionless Coupling and the Beta Function**\n\nTo perform RG analysis, we work with a dimensionless coupling constant. We introduce an arbitrary momentum scale $\\mu$ to define a dimensionless renormalized coupling $u$:\n$$ u_0 = \\mu^{\\epsilon} u $$\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes how the dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the energy scale $\\mu$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\nThe bare coupling $u_0$ is a fundamental parameter of the theory and does not depend on the arbitrary scale $\\mu$. Taking the derivative of the relation $u = \\mu^{-\\epsilon} u_0$ with respect to $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} = \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu}(\\mu^{-\\epsilon} u_0) = u_0 \\mu (-\\epsilon \\mu^{-\\epsilon-1}) = -\\epsilon (\\mu^{-\\epsilon} u_0) = -\\epsilon u $$\nThis gives the first part of the beta function, which arises purely from the engineering dimension of the coupling. Quantum corrections will add further terms.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the One-Loop Quantum Correction**\n\nThe quantum corrections to the beta function come from loop diagrams that renormalize the coupling constant. For the $\\phi^4$ interaction, the leading correction comes from the one-loop diagrams for the four-point vertex function. There are three such diagrams, corresponding to the s, t, and u channels. They are topologically identical and give equal contributions.\n\nThe standard calculation of these loop diagrams using dimensional regularization and the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme yields a correction to the beta function. The full one-loop beta function is the sum of the dimensional part and the quantum part:\n$$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3) $$\n*   The $-\\epsilon u$ term is the \"classical\" contribution from dimensional analysis.\n*   The $+\\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ term is the one-loop quantum correction. The factor of 3 arises from the three (s, t, u) scattering channels.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Fixed Point**\n\nA fixed point of the RG flow is a value of the coupling, $u^*$, where the beta function vanishes, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. At a fixed point, the theory is scale-invariant.\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$: This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  A non-trivial solution found by dividing by $u^*$ (for $u^* \\neq 0$):\n    $$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n    Solving for $u^*$:\n    $$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n    $$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n\nThis non-trivial solution is the **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ is obtained by solving $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ at the one-loop level. This gives a non-trivial fixed point that exists for $\\epsilon > 0$ (i.e., for dimensions $d < 4$). This fixed point governs the universal behavior of systems undergoing a second-order phase transition.\n\nThe final expression is:\n$$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon $$\n\n<<<u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon>>>"
