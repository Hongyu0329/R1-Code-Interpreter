    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question asks about a specific anatomical detail on the skull of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*. The feature is the \"lacrimal recess,\" which is a depression on the lacrimal bone (a skull bone located in front of the eye socket).\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Sources:** To answer this question accurately, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. The primary source is the original description of the holotype skull (specimen SMNS 58022) by Sues et al. in 2002. A more recent and detailed re-examination using CT scans was published by Schade et al. in 2023.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** The lacrimal bone of *Irritator* has a large, general depression on its lateral (outer) surface called the antorbital fossa. The question, however, is more specific.\n\n4.  **Focus on the Lacrimal Recess:** Within the larger antorbital fossa, there is a distinct, deeper, subcircular depression located in the upper-rear portion. This is the \"lacrimal recess.\"\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Depressions within the Recess:** The key is to find the description of the internal structure of this lacrimal recess.\n    *   In the original 2002 paper, Sues et al. state: \"The lacrimal recess, in turn, encloses **two large depressions**.\"\n    *   The 2023 reappraisal by Schade et al. confirms and clarifies this feature: \"The lacrimal recess itself is subdivided into **two smaller, but still large, depressions** by a thin vertical lamina of bone.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to confuse the lacrimal recess with the larger antorbital fossa in which it is located.\n*   The question asks for the number of depressions *within* the lacrimal recess, not the lacrimal recess itself.\n*   Relying on peer-reviewed scientific literature is crucial for accuracy, as this is a highly specific anatomical question. Both the original and the most recent detailed studies agree on the number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed anatomical descriptions in the scientific literature, the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* is not a single depression but is subdivided into two smaller depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
