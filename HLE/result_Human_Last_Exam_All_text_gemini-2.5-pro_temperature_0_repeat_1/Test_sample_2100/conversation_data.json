    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1:** The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This points to a specific poem or work by Voznesensky about a historical figure, likely an explorer or someone associated with the sea. The description is poetic and suggests a romantic, pioneering spirit.\n*   **Clue 2:** Voznesensky also wrote, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This is a very specific and powerful clue. It indicates that the man's burial place was unknown or lost for a significant period. The man was famous enough for a prominent poet to lament the loss of his grave.\n*   **Clue 3:** The answer to the question about the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This provides a specific timeframe for a discovery or revelation related to the man's final resting place. This event would have occurred during the period of *Glasnost* in the Soviet Union, a time of re-examining history.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n\n*   The subject is a real historical figure connected to Russia.\n*   The key is to identify the specific work by Voznesensky that contains these quotes or themes.\n*   The man's story must involve a lost grave.\n*   A significant event related to his grave must have happened in the late 1980s.\n*   The final answer required is the man's last name.\n\n**Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  The quotes and themes strongly point to Andrei Voznesensky's famous rock opera, **\"Juno and Avos\"** (\"Юнона и Авось\"). The libretto was written by Voznesensky.\n2.  The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the historical Russian diplomat and explorer **Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov**. He fits the description of a \"sailor\" and explorer. The opera romanticizes his journey and his love affair in California, framing him as a pioneer discovering new joys and possibilities.\n3.  The epilogue of the opera directly addresses the mystery of his grave. Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning from Russian America. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral was destroyed by the Soviet government in the 1930s, and the exact location of his grave was lost. This perfectly matches the line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n4.  During the era of *Glasnost* in the late 1980s, fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera, there was a resurgence of public and historical interest in Rezanov's fate. Research and efforts began to locate the site of the destroyed cathedral and his lost grave. This renewed focus and the subsequent pinpointing of the location is the \"answer\" that \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This process culminated in a monument being placed on the supposed grave site in Krasnoyarsk years later.\n5.  Therefore, the man described is Nikolai Rezanov. His last name is the answer.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
