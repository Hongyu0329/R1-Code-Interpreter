    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core biological question:** The question asks to identify a peptide that binds to an integrin receptor. Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion.\n2.  **Recognize the key binding motif:** A large number of integrins recognize a specific short amino acid sequence in their ligands (like extracellular matrix proteins). The most common and well-studied of these recognition motifs is the tripeptide sequence **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid).\n3.  **Examine the answer choices:** All five provided peptide sequences begin with the RGD motif:\n    *   A. RGDMAA\n    *   B. RGDSPSS\n    *   C. RGDLTTP\n    *   D. RGDQVSK\n    *   E. RGDARGG\n    This indicates that the presence of the RGD sequence alone is not the differentiating factor. We must consider the influence of the amino acids that flank the RGD core.\n4.  **Analyze the role of flanking residues:** The conformation of the RGD sequence and the identity of the amino acids immediately following it are critical for determining the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrin receptors. The RGD motif is often presented on a flexible loop, and the flanking residues help stabilize a conformation that is optimal for binding.\n5.  **Recall or research canonical integrin-binding sequences:** The most famous RGD-containing ligand is the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. The primary cell-binding site in fibronectin contains the sequence **RGDS** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine). This sequence is specifically recognized with high affinity by several integrins, most notably the α5β1 integrin. Synthetic peptides containing the RGDS sequence, such as GRGDSP, are widely used in cell biology research as competitive inhibitors of cell adhesion to fibronectin, demonstrating their potent binding to integrin receptors.\n6.  **Evaluate each option based on this knowledge:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The flanking residues are Methionine and Alanine. This is not a commonly cited high-affinity sequence.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the **RGDS** motif. This is the canonical sequence from fibronectin. The presence of Serine (S) at the fourth position is known to be very important for high-affinity binding to integrins like α5β1. Therefore, this peptide is very highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor and has been extensively validated in in vitro assays.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The flanking residues are Leucine and Threonine. This is not a well-known high-affinity sequence.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The flanking residues are Glutamine, Valine, etc. While the RGDV sequence is found in another ECM protein, vitronectin, the RGDQ sequence is not a classic high-affinity motif.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The flanking residues are Alanine and Glycine. While simple, this sequence is not known for the high-affinity binding characteristic of the RGDS sequence.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the established role of the RGDS sequence from fibronectin in mediating high-affinity integrin binding, the peptide RGDSPSS is the most scientifically validated and highly likely candidate to bind to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
