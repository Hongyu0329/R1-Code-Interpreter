    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the Grigorchuk group (Γ) and its relationship with the symmetric group S₄. The number of subgroups of a given index in a group can be determined by counting homomorphisms from that group into a symmetric group.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. The Connection Between Subgroups and Homomorphisms**\n\nA fundamental result in group theory states that there is a bijection between subgroups of index `n` in a group `G` and transitive actions of `G` on a set of `n` elements, up to equivalence. Such an action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G → S_n` with a transitive image.\n\nThe total number of subgroups of index `n` in `G` can be calculated using the formula:\nNumber of subgroups = `|Hom_trans(G, S_n)| / (n-1)!`\nwhere `Hom_trans(G, S_n)` is the set of all homomorphisms from `G` to `S_n` whose image is a transitive subgroup of `S_n`.\n\nFor this problem, `G = Γ` (the Grigorchuk group) and `n = 4`. So we need to find the number of subgroups of index 4. The formula becomes:\nNumber of subgroups = `|Hom_trans(Γ, S_4)| / (4-1)! = |Hom_trans(Γ, S_4)| / 6`\n\n**2. Identifying Transitive Subgroups of S₄**\n\nWe need to find the possible images of a homomorphism `φ: Γ → S_4`. A key property of the Grigorchuk group is that it is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, the image `φ(Γ)` must be a 2-subgroup of `S_4`.\n\nThe transitive 2-subgroups of `S_4` are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 4, `C_4`.\n*   The Klein four-group, `V_4 ≅ C_2 × C_2`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 8, `D_8`.\n\nThe total number of transitive homomorphisms is the sum of surjective homomorphisms to each of these possible image groups. `S_4` contains:\n*   One subgroup isomorphic to `V_4`.\n*   Three subgroups isomorphic to `C_4`.\n*   Three subgroups isomorphic to `D_8` (the Sylow 2-subgroups).\n\nSo, `|Hom_trans(Γ, S_4)| = |Hom_surj(Γ, V_4)| + 3 * |Hom_surj(Γ, C_4)| + 3 * |Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)|`.\n\n**3. Counting Surjective Homomorphisms**\n\n*   **Homomorphisms to C₄:** Any homomorphism from a group `G` to an abelian group `A` must factor through the abelianization of `G`, `G_ab = G/[G,G]`. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is `Γ_ab ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2`. So, any homomorphism `φ: Γ → C_4` factors as `Γ → Γ_ab → C_4`.\n    Let `ψ: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 → C_4`. For any element `g` in `C_2 × C_2 × C_2`, `g²=e`. Therefore, `ψ(g)² = ψ(g²) = ψ(e) = e`. This means the image of `ψ` can only contain elements of order 1 or 2. Since `C_4` has only one element of order 2, the image of `ψ` cannot be `C_4`. Thus, there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `C_4`.\n    `|Hom_surj(Γ, C_4)| = 0`.\n\n*   **Homomorphisms to V₄:** `V_4` is also abelian (`V_4 ≅ C_2 × C_2`). So, we count surjective homomorphisms `ψ: Γ_ab → V_4`, i.e., `ψ: C_2 × C_2 × C_2 → C_2 × C_2`.\n    This is equivalent to counting surjective linear maps from a 3-dimensional vector space over the field `F_2` to a 2-dimensional one. The number of such maps is given by the formula `(2³ - 2⁰)(2³ - 2¹) = (8 - 1)(8 - 2) = 7 × 6 = 42`.\n    `|Hom_surj(Γ, V_4)| = 42`.\n\n*   **Homomorphisms to D₈:** Counting `|Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)|` directly is complex. Instead, we can use a known structural property of Γ. The number of normal subgroups `N` of Γ such that `Γ/N ≅ D_8` is known to be 3.\n    The number of such normal subgroups is also given by `|Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)| / |Aut(D_8)|`.\n    The automorphism group `Aut(D_8)` has order 8.\n    Therefore, `|Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)| / 8 = 3`, which implies `|Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)| = 24`.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Number of Subgroups**\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of transitive homomorphisms:\n`|Hom_trans(Γ, S_4)| = |Hom_surj(Γ, V_4)| + 3 * |Hom_surj(Γ, C_4)| + 3 * |Hom_surj(Γ, D_8)|`\n`|Hom_trans(Γ, S_4)| = 42 + 3 * 0 + 3 * 24 = 42 + 72 = 114`.\n\nFinally, we use the formula from Step 1:\nNumber of subgroups of index 4 = `114 / 6 = 19`.\n\n### Alternative Method (by classifying subgroups)\n\nWe can also count the subgroups by classifying them as normal or non-normal. A subgroup `H` of index 4 is normal if and only if its core, `core(H) = ∩_{g∈Γ} gHg⁻¹`, is equal to `H`.\n\n1.  **Normal Subgroups of Index 4:**\n    A normal subgroup `H` of index 4 means the quotient group `Γ/H` has order 4. Since `Γ` is a 2-group, `Γ/H` can be `C_4` or `V_4`. As shown before, `C_4` is not a quotient of Γ. So `Γ/H` must be `V_4`.\n    The number of such normal subgroups is the number of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `V_4` divided by the order of the automorphism group of `V_4`.\n    Number of normal subgroups = `|Hom_surj(Γ, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)| = 42 / |GL(2,2)| = 42 / 6 = 7`.\n\n2.  **Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4:**\n    If `H` is a non-normal subgroup of index 4, its core `N = core(H)` is a proper normal subgroup of `H`. The quotient `Γ/N` must be isomorphic to a transitive subgroup of `S_4`, which must be `D_8` (it cannot be `V_4`, as that would imply `H=N`).\n    So, `N` is a normal subgroup of index 8 with `Γ/N ≅ D_8`. The subgroup `H` contains `N`, and `H/N` is a subgroup of `Γ/N` of order `[Γ:N]/[Γ:H] = 8/4 = 2`.\n    Since `H` is non-normal, `H/N` must be a non-normal subgroup of order 2 in `D_8`.\n    The group `D_8` has 5 subgroups of order 2: one is normal (the center), and four are non-normal.\n    As stated before, Γ has 3 distinct normal subgroups `N_1, N_2, N_3` with quotient `D_8`. For each of these, there are 4 choices for a non-normal subgroup of order 2 in the quotient. This gives 4 distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4 containing that `N_i`.\n    Since the cores `N_1, N_2, N_3` are distinct, the sets of subgroups generated are disjoint.\n    Total non-normal subgroups = `3 (number of D_8 quotients) × 4 (non-normal subgroups of order 2 in D_8) = 12`.\n\n3.  **Total Count:**\n    Total subgroups = (Normal subgroups) + (Non-normal subgroups) = `7 + 12 = 19`.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<19>>>"
