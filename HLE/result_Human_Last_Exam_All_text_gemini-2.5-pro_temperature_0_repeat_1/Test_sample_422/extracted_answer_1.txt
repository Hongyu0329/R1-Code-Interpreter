1. **The Justification Dilemma (Infinite Regress vs. Triviality):** The justification for a belief must be grounded in either Knowledge or Belief. If it's grounded in Knowledge, it leads to an infinite regress, making knowledge impossible. If it's grounded in Belief, the justification condition becomes trivial and fails to rule out lucky guesses.
2. **The Elimination of the "Justified Belief" State:** The JTB theory requires "Justified Belief" to be a distinct state. However, the constraint that only Knowledge and Belief exist leaves no room for the crucial concept of a "Justified False Belief." This state cannot be Knowledge (because it's false) and cannot be a mere Belief without making the justification condition meaningless.
