    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Core Theory:** The Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge states that for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is True (T).\n    2.  S Believes P (B).\n    3.  S is Justified in believing P (J).\n*   **Core Constraint:** We must assume that the *only available epistemic states* are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a highly restrictive and artificial constraint that is key to the problem. It means any epistemic state a person is in must be classified as either \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief,\" with no intermediate options.\n*   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are cases where someone has a justified true belief that is not knowledge due to a specific kind of epistemic luck. We need to find other problems.\n*   **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB theory under this specific constraint.\n\n**2. Analyze the \"Justification\" (J) Condition**\n\nThe JTB theory's strength comes from the \"Justification\" condition, which is meant to connect a belief to truth in a non-accidental way. Under the given constraint, the justification for a belief must itself be grounded in one of the only two available states: Knowledge or Belief. This creates a dilemma.\n\n*   **Option A: Justification is based on Knowledge.**\n    *   If, to be justified in believing P, one must already *know* some other proposition(s) (Q, R, etc.) that serves as the evidence, this leads to an infinite regress.\n    *   To know P, you must know Q. But to know Q, you must have a justification, which means you must know R. To know R, you must know S, and so on, forever.\n    *   This means that no belief could ever be ultimately justified, because the chain of justification would never end. Consequently, no knowledge would be possible. This is known as the **epistemic regress problem**.\n\n*   **Option B: Justification is based on Belief.**\n    *   If justification is based on other beliefs, the condition becomes too weak. The JTB definition would become: Knowledge is a True Belief that is supported by other Beliefs.\n    *   This does not adequately rule out accidental correctness. A person could have a large, internally consistent web of false beliefs, and use one of those beliefs to justify a new belief which, by sheer luck, happens to be true.\n    *   For example: I believe my horoscope (Belief 1). My horoscope says I'll have a lucky day (Belief 2). Based on this, I form a belief that my favorite lottery ticket number, 17, will win (Belief 3). It happens to win. Here, my belief was true and \"justified\" by other beliefs, but it was not knowledge. It was a lucky guess derived from an unreliable method.\n    *   This effectively reduces the JTB theory to a \"True Belief\" account, which is widely considered insufficient for knowledge. The justification condition becomes trivial.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** The constraint forces a dilemma for the justification condition. Grounding it in Knowledge leads to an infinite regress, making knowledge impossible. Grounding it in Belief makes the condition too weak, failing to serve its purpose.\n\n**3. Analyze the Status of \"Justified Belief\"**\n\nThe JTB theory analyzes Knowledge by breaking it down. This process implies the existence of its components as meaningful concepts. Specifically, it relies on the idea of a **\"Justified Belief\" (JB)** as a distinct epistemic standing. A JB can be either true or false. If it's true, it becomes knowledge. If it's false, it's a **\"Justified False Belief\" (JFB)**.\n\n*   Consider the state of a person who holds a JFB. For example, based on all available evidence in the 15th century, a person was justified in believing the sun revolves around the Earth. This was a Justified False Belief.\n*   Now, apply the constraint: The only available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. Where does this state of \"Justified False Belief\" fit?\n    *   It cannot be **Knowledge**, because the \"T\" (True) condition is not met.\n    *   It cannot be simply a **Belief**, because that would erase the crucial distinction between a belief held for good reasons (justified) and a belief held for poor or no reasons (a mere hunch or guess). The entire point of the \"J\" in JTB is to capture this epistemically important difference.\n*   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The JTB framework requires a conceptual space for the state of \"Justified Belief,\" which is distinct from both \"mere Belief\" and \"Knowledge.\" The problem's constraint that only these two states exist eliminates this necessary intermediate category. This makes the JTB analysis incoherent, as it cannot account for one of its own essential components (Justified False Belief) within the allowed system.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe two problems the JTB theory runs into under the specified constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Justification Dilemma (Infinite Regress vs. Triviality):** The justification (J) for a belief must be grounded in one of the two available epistemic states.\n    *   If justification requires **Knowledge**, it creates an infinite regress where every piece of knowledge requires prior knowledge for its justification, making it impossible to ever know anything.\n    *   If justification only requires other **Beliefs**, the condition becomes too weak. It fails to distinguish knowledge from lucky guesses that are part of a coherent but unfounded belief system, effectively reducing the theory to a \"True Belief\" account.\n\n2.  **The Elimination of the \"Justified Belief\" State:** The JTB analysis relies on \"Justified Belief\" being a meaningful epistemic state that is distinct from both mere belief and knowledge. A crucial case is a \"Justified False Belief\" (e.g., believing the sun orbits the Earth based on pre-Copernican evidence). Under the constraint that only Knowledge and Belief exist as states, there is no place for this concept.\n    *   It cannot be **Knowledge** because it is false.\n    *   If it is categorized simply as a **Belief**, the theory loses its ability to distinguish between a well-reasoned belief and a mere guess, rendering the \"J\" condition meaningless and undermining the entire framework.\n\n<<<1. **The Justification Dilemma (Infinite Regress vs. Triviality):** The justification for a belief must be grounded in either Knowledge or Belief. If it's grounded in Knowledge, it leads to an infinite regress, making knowledge impossible. If it's grounded in Belief, the justification condition becomes trivial and fails to rule out lucky guesses.\n2. **The Elimination of the \"Justified Belief\" State:** The JTB theory requires \"Justified Belief\" to be a distinct state. However, the constraint that only Knowledge and Belief exist leaves no room for the crucial concept of a \"Justified False Belief.\" This state cannot be Knowledge (because it's false) and cannot be a mere Belief without making the justification condition meaningless.>>>"
