    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: `CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂`\n    *   Classification: It is a conjugated diene. In the context of cycloaddition reactions, it acts as the \"diene\" component, providing a system of 4 pi (π) electrons. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt the planar *s-cis* conformation.\n\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: `CCl₂=CF₂`\n    *   Classification: It is a substituted alkene. In this reaction, it acts as the \"dienophile\" (diene-loving) component, providing a system of 2 pi (π) electrons.\n\n*   **Reaction Type: Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   This reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, a type of pericyclic reaction. It involves the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile reacting in a single, concerted step to form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   Diels-Alder reactions are generally favored when the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) attached to its double bond. In `CCl₂=CF₂`, both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) are highly electronegative atoms, making them strong EWGs. This makes the dienophile electron-poor and thus highly reactive towards the electron-rich diene.\n\n**2. Predict the Product's Structure**\n\n*   **Bond Formation:** The reaction forms a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).\n    *   The two π-bonds of the diene and the one π-bond of the dienophile are broken.\n    *   Two new single (sigma, σ) bonds and one new π-bond are formed.\n*   **Mechanism Visualization:**\n    1.  The terminal carbons of the diene (C1 and C4 of 1,3-butadiene) form new σ-bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n    2.  The π-bond that was between C2 and C3 of the diene shifts to become the new double bond in the six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Drawing the Product:**\n    *   Start with the diene `CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂` and the dienophile `CCl₂=CF₂`.\n    *   The reaction connects the ends of the diene to the carbons of the dienophile, forming a ring:\n        ```\n              CH=CH\n             /     \\\n          H₂C       CH₂\n           |         |\n          CCl₂ ----- CF₂\n        ```\n    *   This structure is a cyclohexene ring where two adjacent carbons are substituted with halogen atoms. One carbon has two chlorine atoms (`-CCl₂-`), and the adjacent carbon has two fluorine atoms (`-CF₂-`).\n\n**3. Address Stereochemistry and Regiochemistry**\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained. However, `CCl₂=CF₂` is planar and has no cis/trans isomers, so this aspect is straightforward. The resulting product is achiral as it possesses a plane of symmetry.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** Regiochemistry concerns the orientation of an unsymmetrical dienophile adding to an unsymmetrical diene. Here, the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. Therefore, it does not matter which end of the dienophile (`CCl₂` or `CF₂`) adds to which end of the diene; the same single product is formed.\n\n**4. Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\n1.  **Parent Ring:** The product is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Numbering the Ring:**\n    *   According to IUPAC rules, the carbons of the double bond must be assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    *   The ring is then numbered in a direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n    *   Let's number the ring starting from the double bond. There are two ways to go around the ring.\n        *   **Path A:** Numbering gives the substituted carbons positions 4 and 5.\n        *   **Path B:** Numbering the other way also gives positions 4 and 5.\n    *   So, the locant set for the substituents is `{4, 4, 5, 5}`.\n3.  **Alphabetical Order:** When two different numbering schemes result in the same locant set, we use alphabetical order of the substituent names to decide.\n    *   The substituents are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\".\n    *   Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atoms should be assigned the lower number.\n4.  **Final Name Construction:**\n    *   The `CCl₂` group is at position 4.\n    *   The `CF₂` group is at position 5.\n    *   The substituents are named as `4,4-dichloro` and `5,5-difluoro`.\n    *   Combining these parts gives the final name.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe product of the reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
