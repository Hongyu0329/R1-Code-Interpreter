    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Core Question**\n\nThe riddle begins with the title, \"The Bays\", and states that the title itself is the question. This immediately suggests a play on words or a homophone.\n*   **Careful Point:** The phrase \"The Bays\" sounds very similar to \"The Betas\". Given the cryptic nature of the haiku, we should suspect that the answer might involve letters of the Greek alphabet. The question \"The Bays?\" can be interpreted as \"What are the Betas?\" or more broadly, \"What are the Greek letters I am hinting at?\". This sets the context for deciphering the rest of the riddle. The title itself provides the first letter: **Beta**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Haiku's First Line**\n\n*   \"An August tempest\"\n*   This line sets a dramatic, classical tone, reminiscent of Greek tragedies, which often took place in cities like Thebes. While it doesn't provide a direct letter, it reinforces the Greek theme established by the title.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku's Second Line**\n\n*   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n*   This line contains a numerical clue. \"Twice fifteen\" is 2 x 15 = 30.\n*   The key is to connect this number to the Greek alphabet system, where letters also serve as numerals.\n*   **Careful Point:** In the system of Greek numerals, the number 30 is represented by the letter **Lambda (λ)**. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" is a poetic description, as Lambda is often used in science and mathematics to denote a variable, a wavelength, or a rate of change. This line, therefore, yields the letter **Lambda**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Haiku's Third Line**\n\n*   \"A divine one yields\"\n*   This line provides the second numerical clue. \"A divine one\" refers to the number 1.\n*   Again, we map this number to the Greek numeral system. The number 1 is represented by the letter **Alpha (α)**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The description \"divine one\" is a fitting way to describe Alpha, as it is the first letter, the beginning of everything. The word \"yields\" means that the line \"produces\" or \"gives\" us this letter. This line yields the letter **Alpha**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Clues and Finalize the Answer**\n\nWe have now collected three Greek letters from the riddle:\n1.  From the title (\"The Bays\" -> The Betas): **Beta**\n2.  From the second line (\"Twice fifteen\" -> 30): **Lambda**\n3.  From the third line (\"A divine one\" -> 1): **Alpha**\n\nThe final instruction is: \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". We must take the names of the letters we found and arrange them alphabetically.\n*   The letters are: Alpha, Beta, Lambda.\n*   Sorting them alphabetically gives: Alpha, Beta, Lambda.\n\n<<<Alpha, Beta, Lambda>>>"
