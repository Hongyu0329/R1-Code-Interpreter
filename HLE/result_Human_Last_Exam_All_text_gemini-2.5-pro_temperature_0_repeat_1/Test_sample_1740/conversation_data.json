    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct members of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 Family Member\"**\nIn the context of miRNAs, a \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share the same \"seed sequence\". The seed sequence is a conserved 7-8 nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of the miRNA (typically positions 2-8) which is crucial for binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Therefore, to count the members of the let-7 family, we need to identify all human miRNAs that share the canonical let-7 seed sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Canonical let-7 Members**\nThe let-7 family is named with letters (let-7a, let-7b, etc.). We can consult the primary miRNA database, miRBase, to find the list of officially recognized human let-7 miRNAs.\n\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n\n**Careful Point 1: The case of let-7h.**\nA miRNA named `let-7h` was previously described but was later removed from the miRBase database for humans as it was determined to be a potential artifact or not a bona fide miRNA. Therefore, `let-7h` is not included in the current count.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Other miRNAs Belonging to the let-7 Family**\nBesides the miRNAs explicitly named \"let-7,\" other miRNAs can belong to the family if they share the same seed sequence. The canonical seed sequence for the let-7 family is **GAGGUAG**.\n\n*   We need to check other known human miRNAs. It is well-established in the field that **miR-98** shares the same seed sequence as the let-7 family and is functionally considered a member. A check in miRBase confirms that human `hsa-miR-98-5p` has the seed sequence GAGGUAG.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Distinguishing between Mature miRNAs and Genes.**\nThe question asks for the number of \"members,\" which typically refers to the number of distinct mature miRNA sequences. Some of these mature miRNAs are encoded by more than one gene. For example:\n*   The mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three different genes (`hsa-mir-7a-1`, `hsa-mir-7a-2`, and `hsa-mir-7a-3`).\n*   The mature `let-7f` miRNA is produced from two different genes (`hsa-mir-7f-1` and `hsa-mir-7f-2`).\nHowever, since they produce the same mature miRNA, `let-7a` is counted as one member, and `let-7f` is counted as one member. The question is about the number of distinct family members, not the number of genes.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nLet's list all the distinct members identified in the previous steps:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\nCounting these members gives a total of 9.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the standard definition of a miRNA family (shared seed sequence) and data from the authoritative miRBase repository, the human let-7 family consists of 9 distinct members.\n\n<<<9>>>"
