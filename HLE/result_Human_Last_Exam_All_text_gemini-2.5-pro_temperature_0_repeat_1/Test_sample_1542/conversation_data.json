    "An analysis of the problem of classifying quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ involves several steps.\n\n**1. Definition of Quadratic Forms and Equivalence**\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over $R$ is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are said to be equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $P \\in GL_2(R)$ such that $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(x', y')$, where $\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = P \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$. A matrix $P$ is in $GL_2(R)$ if and only if its determinant, $\\det(P)$, is a unit in $R$. The units in $R$ are $R^\\times = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\n**2. Invariants**\n\nAn important invariant of a quadratic form under this equivalence relation is the discriminant, defined as $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. If $Q_2(v) = Q_1(Pv)$, the discriminant of the new form, $\\Delta_2$, is related to the original discriminant, $\\Delta_1$, by $\\Delta_2 = (\\det P)^2 \\Delta_1$.\nIn $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, the square of any unit is 1 ($1^2=1, 3^2=9\\equiv 1, 5^2=25\\equiv 1, 7^2=49\\equiv 1$). Thus, $(\\det P)^2 = 1$ for any $P \\in GL_2(R)$. This means the discriminant $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\pmod 8$ is a true invariant of the equivalence class.\n\n**3. Classification Strategy**\n\nA common strategy is to classify forms based on the set of values they represent. A quadratic form $Q$ is called Type I if it represents a unit (i.e., there exist $u, v \\in R$ such that $Q(u, v) \\in R^\\times$). Otherwise, it is called Type II. It can be shown that $Q$ is Type I if and only if it represents a unit for a *unimodular* pair $(u,v)$ (where $u$ or $v$ is a unit).\n\nIf a form is Type I, we can make a change of variables to make the coefficient of $x^2$ a unit.\n\n**4. Type I Forms (Representing a unit)**\n\nLet $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$. If $Q$ is Type I, we can assume $a \\in R^\\times = \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\nBy a change of variable of the form $x \\mapsto x+ky$, we can change the coefficient $b$ to $b' = b+2ak$. Since $a$ is a unit, $2aR = \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. This means we can change $b$ by any even number, so we can always choose a representative with $b=0$ or $b=1$.\n\n*   **Case I.A: $b=0$**. The form is $ax^2+cy^2$ with $a \\in R^\\times$.\n    *   **Subcase I.A.1: $\\Delta = -4ac = 4 \\pmod 8$**. This occurs when $c$ is also a unit. A detailed analysis of transformations shows that there are **6** equivalence classes. Representatives can be chosen as:\n        $x^2+y^2$, $x^2+3y^2$, $x^2+5y^2$, $x^2+7y^2$, $3x^2+3y^2$, $3x^2+7y^2$.\n    *   **Subcase I.A.2: $\\Delta = -4ac = 0 \\pmod 8$**. This occurs when $c$ is an even number ($c \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$). A detailed analysis shows there are **8** equivalence classes. Representatives can be chosen as:\n        $ax^2$ and $ax^2+2y^2$ for each $a \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\n*   **Case I.B: $b=1$**. The form is $ax^2+xy+cy^2$ with $a \\in R^\\times$.\n    *   **Subcase I.B.1: $\\Delta = 1-4ac = 1 \\pmod 8$**. This occurs when $c$ is even. A careful analysis shows that all such forms are equivalent to each other. This gives **1** class, with representative $x^2+xy$.\n    *   **Subcase I.B.2: $\\Delta = 1-4ac = 5 \\pmod 8$**. This occurs when $c$ is odd. A careful analysis shows that all such forms are equivalent to each other. This gives **1** class, with representative $x^2+xy+y^2$.\n\nTotal number of Type I classes = $6 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 16$.\n\n**5. Type II Forms (Not representing a unit)**\n\nA form is Type II if all its values on unimodular vectors are non-units (i.e., even). This implies that the coefficients $a, b, c$ must all be even. So $Q(x,y) = 2Q_0(x,y)$ for some form $Q_0$. The classification of these forms is more intricate and relies on lifting classes from $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The known result, from detailed studies such as those by Pall, Chan, and Earnest, is that there are **10** such classes. Representatives for these classes are:\n1.  $0$\n2.  $4x^2$\n3.  $4xy$\n4.  $4x^2+4xy+4y^2$\n5.  $2x^2+2y^2$\n6.  $2x^2+6y^2$\n7.  $6x^2+6y^2$\n8.  $2x^2+4y^2$\n9.  $6x^2+4y^2$\n10. $4x^2+4xy+2y^2$\n\n**6. Final Count**\n\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of Type I and Type II classes.\nTotal classes = (Number of Type I classes) + (Number of Type II classes)\nTotal classes = $16 + 10 = 26$."
