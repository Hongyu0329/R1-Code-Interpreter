    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film identified by a key scene. The crucial elements are:\n    *   **An Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n    *   **A character:** We need to identify the character involved.\n    *   **A specific action:** The character boards a bus.\n    *   **A specific line of dialogue:** The character says \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **The consequence:** This act \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads directly to his death or capture.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Dramatic Element:** The act of saying \"Thank you\" is normally innocuous. For it to seal someone's fate, it must be a mistake that reveals something the character is trying to hide. This scenario is common in spy thrillers, where a character is undercover and a small, unconscious habit (like a polite phrase or an accent) betrays their true identity to an enemy.\n\n3.  **Brainstorm and Evaluate Potential Films:**\n    *   **Candidate 1: *Inglourious Basterds* (2009):** This film is famous for a scene where a character's identity is revealed by a subtle mistake. British officer Archie Hicox, undercover as a German, orders three drinks using a hand gesture common in Britain but not in Germany. This seals his fate and leads to a deadly shootout. However, this scene takes place in a tavern, not on a bus, and the giveaway is a gesture, not the phrase \"Thank you.\" Therefore, this is not the correct film.\n    *   **Candidate 2: *Munich* (2005):** This Steven Spielberg film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The plot follows a team of Mossad agents hunting down the terrorists responsible for the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. The team members operate undercover across Europe.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Scene in *Munich*:**\n    *   There is a character named Carl (played by Ciar√°n Hinds), who is the team's \"cleaner\" and bomb expert.\n    *   While the team is in London, they become aware that they are also being hunted by a rival cell.\n    *   In a tense sequence, Carl is being followed. He boards a classic red double-decker bus.\n    *   As he gets on, he politely says **\"Thank you\"** to the driver.\n    *   An enemy assassin, Jeanette (a freelance Dutch killer), is also on the bus and observes this. Carl's cover is that of a German radical, for whom such a polite, anglicized phrase would be out of character. This small, polite act confirms her suspicion and helps her identify him as her target.\n    *   Shortly after this scene, she follows him to his hotel room and kills him. His fate was sealed by that simple phrase on the bus.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The film *Munich* perfectly matches every detail in the user's question. It is an Oscar-nominated film where a character (Carl) seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which reveals his identity to his assassin.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Specificity is Key:** The question is very specific about the phrase (\"Thank you\") and the location (a bus). It's important not to confuse this with other, more famous \"giveaway\" scenes in cinema, like the one in *Inglourious Basterds*.\n*   **Oscar Nomination:** Verifying the film's Oscar nomination status is a critical step. *Munich* received five nominations, confirming it meets this criterion.\n*   **\"Seals his fate\":** The phrase implies a direct causal link between the action and the character's demise, which is exactly what happens to Carl in *Munich*.\n\nThe final answer is the 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\n<<<Munich>>>"
