    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Scaling Exponent α:** This exponent describes the divergence of the specific heat, C, as a system approaches its critical temperature T_c. The relationship is given by C ∝ |(T - T_c)/T_c|⁻ᵃ. A positive α indicates a divergent specific heat.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) and Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** The RG is a powerful theoretical framework for studying critical phenomena. The epsilon expansion is a key computational technique within RG. It involves performing calculations in a dimension d that is slightly below the upper critical dimension, d_c, and then expressing the results as a power series in the small parameter ϵ = d_c - d.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** This is the spatial dimension at and above which the critical exponents take on their simple, mean-field theory values. For a wide class of systems described by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) Hamiltonian (including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is **d_c = 4**.\n\n**2. Setting up the Epsilon Expansion**\n\n*   **Identify d_c:** As established, the upper critical dimension for the relevant class of models is d_c = 4.\n*   **Define ϵ:** The expansion parameter is ϵ = d_c - d. The question asks for the exponent in a system with spatial dimension d = 3.\n*   **Calculate ϵ:** ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion is formally valid for ϵ → 0. By setting ϵ = 1, we are making an approximation. However, this is the standard procedure for estimating exponents in d=3 using the first-order expansion.\n\n**3. The General Formula for α**\n\n*   The epsilon expansion provides expressions for critical exponents as a series in ϵ. To first order in ϵ, the formula for the specific heat exponent α for the general O(n) model (where 'n' is the number of spin components) is:\n    \n    α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n    \n*   **Careful Point:** This formula depends on 'n'. The value of 'n' defines the universality class of the system:\n    *   n = 1 corresponds to the Ising model (e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnets).\n    *   n = 2 corresponds to the XY model (e.g., superfluid transition in ⁴He).\n    *   n = 3 corresponds to the Heisenberg model (e.g., isotropic ferromagnets).\n\n**4. Choosing the Appropriate Model (n)**\n\n*   The question asks for \"the\" scaling exponent, implying a single, specific value. It does not, however, specify the model (the value of 'n').\n*   **Careful Point:** In the absence of specific information, the standard and most canonical choice is the **Ising model (n=1)**. It is the simplest model exhibiting a non-trivial phase transition and is the most common example used when introducing the epsilon expansion. We will proceed with this standard assumption.\n\n**5. Calculation of α**\n\n*   **Substitute n=1 into the general formula:**\n    \n    α = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) * ϵ\n    α = 3 / (2 * 9) * ϵ\n    α = 3 / 18 * ϵ\n    α = ϵ / 6\n    \n*   **Substitute the value of ϵ = 1 for d=3:**\n    \n    α = 1 / 6\n    \n*   This result, α ≈ 1/6 ≈ 0.167, is the first-order epsilon expansion estimate for the specific heat exponent in the 3D Ising universality class. (For comparison, the accepted numerical value is closer to 0.110).\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe analysis proceeds as follows:\n1.  Identify the upper critical dimension as d_c = 4.\n2.  Calculate the expansion parameter for d=3 as ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n3.  Recall the first-order epsilon expansion formula for α for the O(n) model: α = (4 - n) / (2(n + 8)) * ϵ.\n4.  Assume the canonical Ising model (n=1) as implied by the question's phrasing.\n5.  Substitute n=1 and ϵ=1 into the formula to get the final numerical value.\n\nα = (4 - 1) / (2(1 + 8)) * 1 = 3 / 18 = 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
