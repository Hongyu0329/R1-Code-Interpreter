    "An involution in a group G is an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g ≠ 1`. We want to find the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group PSU(n, q)**\n    The group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\n    *   `SU(n, q)` consists of `n x n` matrices `A` over the field `F_q^2` satisfying `det(A) = 1` and `A A* = I`, where `A*` is the conjugate transpose.\n    *   `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `cI` in `SU(n, q)`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   In our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`. The field is `F_{997^2}`.\n    *   The order of the center is `|Z| = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 * 499`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   So, the center `Z` has order 2 and is given by `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n2.  **Relating Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU**\n    Let `g` be an element of `PSU(4, 997)`. It can be written as a coset `g = hZ` for some `h` in `SU(4, 997)`.\n    *   The identity element in `PSU(4, 997)` is the coset `Z`.\n    *   `g` is an involution if `g ≠ 1` and `g^2 = 1`.\n    *   `g ≠ 1` means `hZ ≠ Z`, which implies `h ∉ Z`.\n    *   `g^2 = 1` means `(hZ)^2 = Z`, which implies `h^2 Z = Z`. This is equivalent to `h^2 ∈ Z`.\n    *   So, we are looking for the number of cosets `hZ` where `h ∈ SU(4, 997) \\ Z` and `h^2 ∈ Z`.\n\n3.  **Counting the Elements `h`**\n    The condition `h^2 ∈ Z = {I, -I}` means we need to find all elements `h` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `h^2 = I` or `h^2 = -I`.\n    Let `S = {h ∈ SU(4, 997) | h^2 ∈ Z}`. The set of elements that give rise to involutions in `PSU` is `A = S \\ Z`.\n    The number of involutions in `PSU` is the number of such cosets, which is `|A| / |Z| = (|S| - |Z|) / 2`.\n\n4.  **Calculating `|S|`**\n    `|S|` is the total number of solutions to `h^2 = I` and `h^2 = -I` in `SU(4, 997)`.\n    Let `N_I` be the number of solutions to `h^2 = I` and `N_{-I}` be the number of solutions to `h^2 = -I`. Then `|S| = N_I + N_{-I}`.\n\n    *   **Calculating `N_I` (solutions to `h^2 = I`)**:\n        These are the identity element and the involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. The involutions in `SU(n, q)` are characterized by the dimension `k` of their `-1`-eigenspace, which must be an even integer. For `n=4`, `k` can be 2 or 4.\n        *   `k=4`: The involution is `-I`. There is 1 such element.\n        *   `k=2`: The number of such involutions equals the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in a 4-dimensional unitary space. This number is given by the formula `|U(4,q)| / (|U(2,q)| |U(2,q)|) = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n        The total number of involutions in `SU(4, q)` is `I_{SU} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 1`.\n        `N_I` (including the identity) is `1 + I_{SU} = 2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n\n    *   **Calculating `N_{-I}` (solutions to `h^2 = -I`)**:\n        According to a result by R. Gow, the number of elements `h` in `U(2m, q)` with `h^2 = -I` is non-zero if and only if `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `n=2m` is even. For `q=997`, `997 = 4*249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. Our `n=4` is also even (`m=2`).\n        The number of such elements in `U(4, q)` is `q^{m(m-1)}|U(m, q^2)|` with `m=2`, which is `q^2 |U(2, q^2)|`.\n        Using the formula for the order of a unitary group, `|U(2, q^2)| = q^2(q^2+1)(q^4-1)`.\n        So, `N_{-I}` in `U(4, q)` is `q^2 * [q^2(q^2+1)(q^4-1)] = q^4(q^2+1)(q^4-1)`.\n        It can be shown that all these elements have determinant 1, so they are all in `SU(4, q)`. Thus, `N_{-I}` in `SU(4, q)` is `q^4(q^2+1)(q^4-1)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**\n    The number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `(|S| - |Z|) / 2 = (N_I + N_{-I} - 2) / 2`.\n    `Num = (1/2) * [ (2 + q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)) + (q^4(q^2+1)(q^4-1)) - 2 ]`\n    `Num = (1/2) * [ q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q^2+1)(q^4-1) ]`\n    Factor out `q^4(q^2+1)`:\n    `Num = (1/2) * q^4(q^2+1) * [ (q^2-q+1) + (q^4-1) ]`\n    `Num = (1/2) * q^4(q^2+1) * (q^4+q^2-q)`\n    `Num = (1/2) * q^5(q^2+1)(q^3+q-1)`\n\n6.  **Substitute `q = 997`**\n    We need to compute the value of this expression for `q = 997`.\n    *   `q^5 = 997^5`\n    *   `q^2+1 = 997^2+1 = 994009+1 = 994010`\n    *   `q^3+q-1 = 997^3+997-1 = 991026973+996 = 991027969`\n    `Num = (1/2) * 997^5 * 994010 * 991027969`\n    `Num = 997^5 * (994010 / 2) * 991027969`\n    `Num = 997^5 * 497005 * 991027969`\n    Computing this product:\n    `997^5 = 985,099,401,494,985,015`\n    `497005 * 991027969 = 492,554,545,443,445`\n    `Num = 985099401494985015 * 492554545443445`\n    `Num = 485,207,780,866,217,481,060,101,650,706,675`"
