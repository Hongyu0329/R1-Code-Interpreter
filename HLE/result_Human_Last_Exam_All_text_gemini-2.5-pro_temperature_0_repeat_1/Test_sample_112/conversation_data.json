    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject:** The question is about the poem \"Sir Launfal\" and a \"book of manners\" that was preserved with it. This implies they were bound together in the same physical manuscript.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific version of \"Sir Launfal\":** The most famous version of \"Sir Launfal\" is the one written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. This is the version preserved in a known manuscript.\n\n3.  **Locate the manuscript:** The poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is cataloged as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, currently held in the British Library.\n\n4.  **Analyze the contents of the manuscript:** Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is not just a copy of \"Sir Launfal.\" It is an important anthology of Middle English literature, containing a collection of romances and other texts. The works were compiled and copied by a single scribe around the mid-15th century.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript:** By examining the table of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we can find the specific text that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\" Among the various chivalric romances like *The Erl of Tolous* and *Libeaus Desconus*, there is one work explicitly about etiquette.\n\n6.  **Name the specific book:** This work is titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (often modernized as \"The Book of Courtesy\"). This text provides instruction on proper behavior, table manners, and social conduct for a young man aspiring to serve in a noble household.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** It is crucial to know that \"Sir Launfal\" exists in a single manuscript, which makes identifying its companion texts definitive.\n*   **Nature of the Manuscript:** Understanding that Cotton MS Caligula A.ii is an anthology or a collection is key. The scribe deliberately chose to include these specific texts together.\n*   **Identifying the Genre:** A \"book of manners\" is a specific genre known as a \"courtesy book.\" Recognizing the title \"The Boke of Curtasye\" as belonging to this genre is the final step.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy tracing the poem \"Sir Launfal\" to its sole surviving manuscript, Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, and then examining the contents of that manuscript, we can identify the book of manners it was preserved alongside.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
