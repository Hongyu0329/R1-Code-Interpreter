    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Factor the Conductor `d`**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We test for small prime divisors:\n    *   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n    *   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n    *   To factor 589, we test primes up to $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$.\n    *   $589 \\div 19 = 31$\n*   So, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**2. Understand Primitive Characters for a Square-Free Conductor**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a function from $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ to $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes (it is square-free), any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo its prime factors:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$\nwhere $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is **primitive** with conductor $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the trivial character which maps everything to 1). The principal character is the unique character of order 1.\nTherefore, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, we must have $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$ for each $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Order of the Character**\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. The order of a product character is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components. Let $o_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\n**4. Combine the Conditions on Component Orders**\nFrom the conditions above, we can deduce the properties of the orders $o_i$:\n*   From primitivity: $o_i > 1$ for all $i$.\n*   From $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$, each $o_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So, $o_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   Combining these two, we must have $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for each $i$.\n*   For the lcm to be exactly 6, the set of orders $\\{o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4\\}$ must contain at least one order divisible by 2 (i.e., 2 or 6) AND at least one order divisible by 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\n**5. Count the Number of Available Component Characters**\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided $k$ divides $n$.\n\nLet's find the number of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 for each prime factor:\n*   **Modulo 7**: The character group has order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **Modulo 13**: The character group has order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **Modulo 19**: The character group has order $\\phi(19)=18$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   **Modulo 31**: The character group has order $\\phi(31)=30$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$, the number of available non-principal characters whose order divides 6 is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Number of Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where $o_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\n\n*   **Total combinations**: Let's first count all possible combinations where each $\\chi_i$ has an order from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. For each of the four components, there are 5 choices.\n    Total combinations = $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n*   **Excluded combinations**: We must subtract the combinations where the lcm is not 6. This happens if:\n    a) The lcm has no factor of 3. This means all orders $o_i$ must be 2.\n    b) The lcm has no factor of 2. This means all orders $o_i$ must be 3.\n\n*   **Count for case (a)**: All orders are 2. For each component $\\chi_i$, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    Number of combinations = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Count for case (b)**: All orders are 3. For each component $\\chi_i$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    Number of combinations = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe cases (a) and (b) are mutually exclusive. So, the total number of excluded combinations is $1 + 16 = 17$.\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nThe number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is the total number of combinations minus the excluded ones.\nNumber = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{608}$.\n<<<608>>>"
