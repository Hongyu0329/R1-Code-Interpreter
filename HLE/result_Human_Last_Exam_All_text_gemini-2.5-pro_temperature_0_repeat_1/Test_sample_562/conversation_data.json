    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the character in question.**\nThe character provided is 謄.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the character into its components.**\nThe character 謄 is composed of two parts arranged in a left-right structure:\n*   The left part is: 言\n*   The right part is: 朕\n\n**Step 3: Identify the radical (bushu).**\nIn kanji with a left-right structure, the left-hand component is very often the radical, which typically indicates the character's general meaning or category.\n*   The left component, 言, is a common radical. It means \"speech,\" \"word,\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" which is semantically related to \"speech\" and \"words.\"\n*   Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the specific name of the radical based on its position.**\nRadicals in Japanese have specific names, which can change depending on their position within the character.\n*   The radical 言, when it appears on the left side of a character, is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical in this position is ごんべん (gonben). \"Gon\" is a reading of the character 言, and \"ben\" is a voiced form of \"hen\" (偏), meaning \"left side.\"\n\n**Step 5: Transcribe the name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe Hepburn transcription for the Japanese name ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Confusion:** It is important not to confuse 謄 (tō, \"to copy\") with the visually similar character 騰 (tō, \"to rise\"). 騰 has the radical 月 (nikuzuki) on the left, not 言. The character in the question is clearly 謄.\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** The answer requires the specific name of the radical in its position (e.g., \"hen,\" \"tsukuri,\" \"kanmuri,\" etc.), not just the name of the radical character itself. For example, simply answering \"Gen\" or \"Koto\" (readings for 言) would be incomplete. The format \"Onnahen\" in the example confirms that the positional name is required. \"Gonben\" fits this format perfectly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name as a left-sided radical is Gonben.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
