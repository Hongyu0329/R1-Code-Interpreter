    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant knots and surgeries\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$)**: This is the set of oriented homology 3-spheres modulo the equivalence relation of homology cobordism. The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: An integral surgery on a knot $K$ is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold, denoted $S^3_p(K)$, where $p$ is an integer. For the resulting manifold $S^3_p(K)$ to be a **homology sphere** (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_p(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n\n3.  **Knots with at most four crossings**: The knots with four or fewer crossings, listed by their Alexander-Briggs notation, are:\n    *   **0 crossings**: $0_1$ (the unknot).\n    *   **3 crossings**: $3_1$ (the trefoil knot). This knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil (let's denote it $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (denoted $-3_1$ or $\\overline{3_1}$).\n    *   **4 crossings**: $4_1$ (the figure-eight knot). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the list of knots to analyze is $\\{0_1, 3_1, -3_1, 4_1\\}$. For each of these four knots, we must consider both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the surgery on each knot\n\nWe will analyze the resulting homology spheres and determine the distinct elements they represent in $\\Theta_3^H$. We use standard invariants of homology cobordism:\n*   The **d-invariant** (or equivalently, the Casson invariant $\\lambda$, since $d = -2\\lambda$). This is a homomorphism $d: \\Theta_3^H \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. For $M=S^3_{+1}(K)$, its value is $d(M) = -\\Delta_K''(-1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$.\n*   The **Rohlin invariant** $\\mu$. This is a homomorphism $\\mu: \\Theta_3^H \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. For $M=S^3_{+1}(K)$, its value is $\\mu(M) = \\text{Arf}(K) \\pmod 2$, where $\\text{Arf}(K)$ is the Arf invariant of the knot.\n\nWe also use the fact that $S^3_{-1}(K)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{+1}(\\bar{K})$, where $\\bar{K}$ is the mirror image of $K$. In the group $\\Theta_3^H$, this means $[S^3_{-1}(K)] = -[S^3_{+1}(\\bar{K})]$. The invariants behave as $d(-M) = -d(M)$ and $\\mu(-M) = \\mu(M)$.\n\nFirst, let's list the required knot invariants:\n*   **$0_1$ (Unknot)**: $\\Delta(t)=1 \\implies \\Delta''(-1)=0$. $\\text{Arf}(0_1)=0$.\n*   **$3_1$ (Right-handed trefoil)**: $\\Delta(t)=t-1+t^{-1} \\implies \\Delta''(-1)=-2$. $\\text{Arf}(3_1)=1$.\n*   **$-3_1$ (Left-handed trefoil)**: $\\Delta(t)=t-1+t^{-1} \\implies \\Delta''(-1)=-2$. $\\text{Arf}(-3_1)=1$.\n*   **$4_1$ (Figure-eight knot)**: $\\Delta(t)=-t+3-t^{-1} \\implies \\Delta''(-1)=2$. $\\text{Arf}(4_1)=0$.\n\nNow we analyze the surgeries:\n\n1.  **Knot $0_1$**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n    *   Both represent the identity element in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n    *   **Element 1**: The identity, [0]. Invariants are $(d,\\mu)=(0,0)$.\n\n2.  **Knot $3_1$ (Right-handed trefoil)**:\n    *   **$+1$ surgery**: $M_A = S^3_{+1}(3_1)$. This is the famous Poincar√© homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n        *   $d(M_A) = -\\Delta_{3_1}''(-1) = -(-2) = 2$.\n        *   $\\mu(M_A) = \\text{Arf}(3_1) = 1$.\n        *   This gives a new element, let's call it **A**, with invariants $(d,\\mu)=(2,1)$.\n    *   **$-1$ surgery**: $M_B' = S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1}) = -S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$.\n        *   Let's first analyze $S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$ (see next point). It gives an element **B**. So $M_B'$ represents **-B**.\n\n3.  **Knot $-3_1$ (Left-handed trefoil)**:\n    *   **$+1$ surgery**: $M_B = S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$. This manifold is $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n        *   $d(M_B) = -\\Delta_{-3_1}''(-1) = -(-2) = 2$.\n        *   $\\mu(M_B) = \\text{Arf}(-3_1) = 1$.\n        *   This gives an element **B** with invariants $(d,\\mu)=(2,1)$.\n        *   **Careful point**: Although **A** and **B** have the same $(d,\\mu)$ invariants, they are known to be distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$. This is a classic result of low-dimensional topology, provable with more advanced invariants like Instanton Floer homology.\n    *   **$-1$ surgery**: $M_A' = S^3_{-1}(-3_1) = -S^3_{+1}(\\overline{-3_1}) = -S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -M_A$.\n        *   This represents the element **-A**.\n\n4.  **Knot $4_1$ (Figure-eight knot)**:\n    *   **$+1$ surgery**: $M_C = S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n        *   $d(M_C) = -\\Delta_{4_1}''(-1) = -(2) = -2$.\n        *   $\\mu(M_C) = \\text{Arf}(4_1) = 0$.\n        *   This gives a new element, **C**, with invariants $(d,\\mu)=(-2,0)$.\n    *   **$-1$ surgery**: $M_C' = S^3_{-1}(4_1) = -S^3_{+1}(\\overline{4_1})$. Since $4_1$ is amphichiral, $\\overline{4_1}=4_1$.\n        *   So $M_C' = -S^3_{+1}(4_1) = -M_C$. This represents the element **-C**.\n\n### Step 3: Count the distinct elements\n\nLet's list the elements we have found and their invariants:\n1.  **[0]** (from $0_1$): $(d,\\mu) = (0,0)$\n2.  **A** = $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (2,1)$\n3.  **B** = $[S^3_{+1}(-3_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (2,1)$\n4.  **C** = $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (-2,0)$\n5.  **-A** = $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (-2,1)$\n6.  **-B** = $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (-2,1)$\n7.  **-C** = $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$: $(d,\\mu) = (2,0)$\n\nNow we check that these 7 elements are all distinct.\n*   The identity **[0]** is distinct from the others as they all have non-zero invariants.\n*   The elements **A**, **B**, **C**, **-A**, **-B**, **-C** are all non-identity.\n*   The pairs of invariants $(2,1)$, $(-2,0)$, $(-2,1)$, $(2,0)$ are all distinct. This immediately shows that an element from one group (e.g., **A** with $(2,1)$) cannot be equal to an element from another (e.g., **C** with $(-2,0)$).\n*   The only remaining question is whether elements with the same invariants are distinct.\n    *   Are **A** and **B** distinct? Yes, as noted before, $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)] \\neq [S^3_{+1}(-3_1)]$.\n    *   Are **-A** and **-B** distinct? Yes, because if $-A=-B$, then $A=B$, which is false.\n*   Therefore, all 7 elements listed are distinct from one another.\n\nThe set of distinct elements is $\\{[0], A, B, C, -A, -B, -C\\}$.\n\nThe total count is 7."
