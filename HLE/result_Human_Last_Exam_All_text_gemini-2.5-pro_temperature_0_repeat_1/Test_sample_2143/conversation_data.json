    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe question provides several key pieces of information about a person referred to as \"HE\" and \"HIS work\":\n*   **The Source of Interpretation:** The analysis is based on \"Veronika Campan's interpretation.\" This points to a specific, likely academic or psychoanalytic, reading of a text.\n*   **The Subject of the Work:** The work addresses \"the issue of another's material possessions.\"\n*   **The Location in the Work:** This specific issue is addressed \"at the end of HIS work.\"\n*   **The Method:** \"HE\" does this by \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues**\n*   **\"Prohibition against representation\":** This is a very strong clue. It almost certainly refers to the Second Commandment in the Judeo-Christian tradition, which forbids the making of graven images or idols for worship.\n*   **\"Another's material possessions\" & \"at the end of HIS work\":** This points to the Tenth Commandment, which is the last of the Ten Commandments. It states, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is unique because it prohibits a desire or thought (coveting), not just an action.\n*   **Connecting the Clues:** The \"work\" in question is the Ten Commandments (The Decalogue). The person (\"HE\") who, according to tradition, received and delivered this work is the prophet Moses. The \"end of HIS work\" is the Tenth Commandment.\n*   **Understanding the Interpretation:** Veronika Campan's interpretation, likely from a psychoanalytic perspective, highlights a shift in the commandments. The Second Commandment forbids making a *physical representation* (an idol). The Tenth Commandment forbids *coveting*, which is an internal act that requires creating a *mental representation* of the desired object (the neighbor's house, wife, ox, etc.). In order to legislate against this internal desire, the lawgiver (Moses) must engage with the world of mental images. In this sense, he \"naturally ignores\" the earlier prohibition on physical representations to address this different, internal form of representation.\n\n**Step 3: Identify \"HE\"**\nThe figure who delivered the Ten Commandments to the Israelites is Moses. The text containing these laws (in Exodus and Deuteronomy) is traditionally considered his work or the \"Law of Moses.\" Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Full Name**\nThe question asks for HIS full name. In historical and common usage, the prophet's name is simply Moses. He does not have a surname in the modern sense.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the clues—the prohibition against representation (2nd Commandment), coveting material possessions (10th Commandment), the location at the end of the work, and the specific interpretation—all point directly to the Ten Commandments and their traditional lawgiver, Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
