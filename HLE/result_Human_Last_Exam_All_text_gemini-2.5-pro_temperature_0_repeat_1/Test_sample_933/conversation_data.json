    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Reaction**\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas.\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂ (g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Conditions for Synthesis**\nThis reaction requires energy input to break the bonds in the fluorine molecules and to overcome the activation energy of the reaction. However, the reaction itself is exothermic (releases heat). This means there is an optimal temperature range for the synthesis.\n\n*   **If the temperature is too low:** The reaction rate will be extremely slow, as the reactant molecules will not have enough kinetic energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. This makes the process inefficient, as it would take a very long time to produce a significant amount of product.\n*   **If the temperature is too high:** Two issues can arise. First, since the reaction is exothermic, very high temperatures can shift the equilibrium back towards the reactants (Le Chatelier's principle), reducing the yield. Second, at higher temperatures (and higher fluorine concentrations), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Standard Method of Synthesis**\nThe most common and efficient method for producing XeF₄ is the thermal method, which involves heating the reactants.\n\n*   **Reactants:** A mixture of Xenon and Fluorine gas is used, typically in a molar ratio of about 1:5 (an excess of fluorine). The excess fluorine helps to drive the reaction towards the formation of XeF₄ and suppresses the formation of XeF₂.\n*   **Apparatus:** The reaction is carried out in a sealed vessel made of a material resistant to fluorine at high temperatures, such as nickel or Monel.\n*   **Temperature and Pressure:** The mixture is heated under pressure (typically several atmospheres). The established temperature for this synthesis to proceed efficiently (i.e., at a reasonable rate to give a good yield) is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction is typically complete within a few hours.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Other Potential Synthesis Methods**\nOther methods exist, such as photochemical synthesis (using UV light) or using an electrical discharge. While these methods can sometimes be performed at lower temperatures (even room temperature), they are often less efficient for producing a pure, large quantity of a specific product like XeF₄. They frequently result in a mixture of xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆) and can be slower or more difficult to control. The question specifies \"efficiently,\" which points towards the well-established thermal method.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Given Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. 600 °C:** This temperature is effective, but it is higher than necessary and increases the risk of forming XeF₆. It is not the *coldest* efficient temperature.\n*   **B. 400 °C:** This is the widely cited, standard temperature for the efficient laboratory and industrial synthesis of XeF₄. It provides a good balance between a fast reaction rate and a high yield of the desired product.\n*   **C. 200 °C:** At this temperature, the reaction rate would be impractically slow, making the synthesis inefficient.\n*   **D. 78 °C:** This temperature is far too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at any meaningful rate.\n*   **E. 0 °C:** Far too low.\n*   **F. -78 °C:** Far too low.\n\n**Conclusion**\nConsidering the need for an \"efficient\" process, the thermal method is the standard. The coldest temperature at which this method proceeds efficiently is around 400 °C. Therefore, this is the best answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
