    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebraic Structure and the Category\n\nThe question asks about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell=3$. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ satisfying the relations:\n1.  $K K^{-1} = K^{-1} K = 1$\n2.  $K E K^{-1} = q^2 E$\n3.  $K F K^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n4.  $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n\nThe category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra. The question is to find the percentage of these objects that are irreducible.\n\n### Step 2: Interpreting the Notation and its Consequences\n\nThe notation $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity can be ambiguous. There are two common interpretations:\n\n1.  **The \"large\" quantum group (Drinfeld-Jimbo algebra):** This is the algebra defined by the relations above. Its representation theory is studied by decomposing the category into blocks according to the characters of its center.\n2.  **The \"small\" quantum group (Lusztig's restricted specialization):** This is a finite-dimensional version where additional relations $E^\\ell=0$, $F^\\ell=0$, and $K^\\ell=1$ are imposed. Here $\\ell=3$.\n\nFor a question like this, which seeks a single numerical answer, it is likely that it refers to a setting where the answer is unambiguous. Let's analyze both cases, but we will see that the second interpretation is more direct.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis based on the \"Small Quantum Group\" Interpretation\n\nLet's assume $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ refers to the small quantum group, which we will denote $\\mathfrak{u}_q$. This is a finite-dimensional algebra of dimension $\\ell^3 = 3^3 = 27$.\n\n**3.1. Counting the Indecomposable Representations:**\nThe representation theory of a finite-dimensional algebra is classified as being of finite, tame, or wild type.\n*   **Finite type:** Finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n*   **Tame type:** Infinitely many indecomposables, but for any given dimension, they can be classified and fall into a finite number of one-parameter families.\n*   **Wild type:** The classification problem is considered unsolvable and contains the problem of classifying pairs of matrices under simultaneous conjugation. A key feature is the existence of infinite, multi-parameter families of indecomposable representations.\n\nIt is a well-established result in representation theory that for $\\ell \\ge 3$, the small quantum group $\\mathfrak{u}_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of **wild representation type**. Since we have $\\ell=3$, our algebra is wild. This implies that there are **infinitely many** non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\n**3.2. Counting the Irreducible Representations:**\nThe irreducible representations are a subset of the indecomposable ones. We can classify them using the theory of highest weight modules.\n*   An irreducible representation must contain a highest weight vector $v_0$ such that $E v_0 = 0$ and $K v_0 = \\lambda v_0$.\n*   The relation $K^3=1$ in $\\mathfrak{u}_q$ implies that the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be a third root of unity, i.e., $\\lambda \\in \\{1, q, q^2\\}$.\n*   We can construct the irreducible module for each possible highest weight:\n    *   For $\\lambda=1$, we get a 1-dimensional irreducible representation (the trivial module).\n    *   For $\\lambda=q$, we get a 2-dimensional irreducible representation.\n    *   For $\\lambda=q^2$, we get a 3-dimensional irreducible representation.\n*   These are all the possible highest weights, and they lead to distinct irreducible representations. Therefore, there are exactly **3** non-isomorphic irreducible representations.\n\n**3.3. Calculating the Percentage:**\nThe category $C$ (interpreted for the small quantum group) contains infinitely many objects. The subset of irreducible objects contains exactly 3 objects.\nThe percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible is:\n$$ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible objects}}{\\text{Total number of indecomposable objects}} = \\frac{3}{\\infty} = 0\\% $$\n\n### Step 4: Analysis based on the \"Large Quantum Group\" Interpretation\n\nIf we consider the large quantum group, its category of finite-dimensional representations decomposes into blocks based on the characters of its center, which is generated by $E^3, F^3, K^3$ and the Casimir element.\n\n*   **Generic Blocks:** For a \"generic\" central character $\\chi$ (specifically, where the eigenvalues of $E^3$ and $F^3$ are non-zero), the corresponding block of the category is semisimple. In a semisimple category, every indecomposable representation is irreducible. So, for these blocks, the percentage is 100%.\n*   **Singular Blocks:** For special central characters (where the eigenvalue of $E^3$ or $F^3$ is zero), the blocks are not semisimple. These blocks are closely related to the representation theory of the small quantum group. They contain only a finite number of irreducible representations but an infinite number of indecomposable representations. For these blocks, the percentage is 0%.\n\nThe set of all indecomposable representations is the union of the indecomposables from all blocks. The singular blocks, despite being parameterized by a lower-dimensional space of characters, contribute infinitely many more representations each than the generic blocks. The total set of indecomposable representations is \"dominated\" by the objects from the non-semisimple blocks. Therefore, when considering the entire category $C$, the proportion of irreducible objects becomes negligible. This also leads to an answer of 0%.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth interpretations lead to the same answer. The first interpretation, using the small quantum group, is more direct and avoids the subtleties of comparing the sizes of different infinite sets. It is the standard approach for this kind of problem.\n\n*   Total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations: Infinite.\n*   Total number of non-isomprhic irreducible representations: 3.\n*   Percentage of indecomposables that are irreducible: $\\frac{3}{\\infty} = 0\\%$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{0}$.\n\n<<<0>>>"
