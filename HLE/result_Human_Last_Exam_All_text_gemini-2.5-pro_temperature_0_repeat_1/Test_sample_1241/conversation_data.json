    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** The problem presents a system of linear ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. These equations describe the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3} at time $t$. This is a model for a continuous-time Markov chain.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This corresponds to the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 in the long-term, or steady state.\n\n3.  **Steady-State Condition:** As $t \\to +\\infty$, the system is expected to reach a steady state (or equilibrium). In this state, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ no longer change with time. Mathematically, this means the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:** By setting all derivatives to zero, the system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    *   $P_{0}'(t) = 0 \\implies -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 = 0$\n    *   $P_{1}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 = 0$\n    *   $P_{2}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 = 0$\n    *   $P_{3}'(t) = 0 \\implies \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 = 0$\n\n5.  **Normalization Condition:** The sum of all probabilities must always be 1. In the steady state, this gives us the normalization equation:\n    *   $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n6.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** We are given the transition rates:\n    *   $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n    *   $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n    *   $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n    *   $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n    Substituting these into the steady-state equations:\n    *   (1) $-0.019\\pi_0 + 0.65\\pi_1 = 0$\n    *   (2) $0.019\\pi_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)\\pi_1 + 0.392\\pi_2 + 0.008\\pi_3 = 0$\n    *   (3) $0.4\\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)\\pi_2 = 0$\n    *   (4) $0.008\\pi_2 - 0.008\\pi_3 = 0$\n    *   (5) $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The system of the first four equations is linearly dependent (their sum is zero). Therefore, we must use the normalization equation (5) along with any three of the first four equations to find a unique solution for the probabilities $\\pi_i$.\n*   It is often easiest to express three of the probabilities in terms of a single one (e.g., express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$) and then use the normalization equation to solve for that one probability.\n*   The existence of a unique steady-state solution is guaranteed because the Markov chain is irreducible (it's possible to get from any state to any other state).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Solve for relationships between probabilities:**\n    *   From equation (4):\n        $0.008\\pi_2 = 0.008\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$\n    *   From equation (3):\n        $0.4\\pi_1 - (0.4)\\pi_2 = 0 \\implies 0.4\\pi_1 = 0.4\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_1 = \\pi_2$\n    *   Combining these, we get: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n    *   From equation (1):\n        $0.019\\pi_0 = 0.65\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$\n\n2.  **Use the normalization equation to find $\\pi_1$:**\n    *   Substitute the relationships found above into the normalization equation (5):\n        $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n        $(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n    *   Combine the terms with $\\pi_1$:\n        $(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n        $(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n        $(\\frac{707}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n    *   Solve for $\\pi_1$:\n        $\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n3.  **Calculate $\\pi_0$:**\n    *   Use the relationship $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$:\n        $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the final required sum:**\n    *   The question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n    *   $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\n5.  **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n    *   $\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n<<<0.946251768>>>"
