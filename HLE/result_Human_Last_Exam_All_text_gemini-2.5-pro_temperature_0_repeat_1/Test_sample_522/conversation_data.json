    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to determine the transformation rule that converts the input grids into the output grids for examples A and B, and then apply that rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The inputs and outputs are represented as comma-separated strings, which can be interpreted as rows in a 2D grid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Input_A and Output_A**\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character `2` at position (row=1, col=1) has moved. Its original position becomes `0`. A `0` at position (0,0) has become `2`. This looks like a swap of values between `(1,1)` and `(0,0)`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Input_B and Output_B**\n*   **Input_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The character `2` at position (3,6) has moved. Its original position becomes `0`. A `0` at position (2,7) has become `2`. This is a swap between `(3,6)` and `(2,7)`.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Transformation Rule**\nThe `2` seems to move to an adjacent `0`. Since there can be multiple adjacent `0`s, there must be a specific search order to decide which `0` to move to.\n\nLet's define a search order for the 8 neighbors of the `2` at `(r, c)`. Let's test a clockwise search starting from the top-right neighbor:\n1.  Top-Right: `(r-1, c+1)`\n2.  Right: `(r, c+1)`\n3.  Bottom-Right: `(r+1, c+1)`\n4.  Bottom: `(r+1, c)`\n5.  Bottom-Left: `(r+1, c-1)`\n6.  Left: `(r, c-1)`\n7.  Top-Left: `(r-1, c-1)`\n8.  Top: `(r-1, c)`\n\n*   **Test on Input_A:** `2` is at `(1,1)`. Searching its neighbors in the defined order, the first `0` encountered is at `(0,0)` (the 7th position in the search). Swapping `(1,1)` and `(0,0)` produces `Output_A`. This works.\n*   **Test on Input_B:** `2` is at `(3,6)`. The first neighbor in the search order is Top-Right at `(2,7)`, which contains a `0`. Swapping `(3,6)` and `(2,7)` produces `Output_B`. This also works.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Input_C and the 'MISSING' Output**\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n*   The `2` is at `(1,4)`. Applying our rule, we search for the first `0` in the neighborhood of `(1,4)` using the same search order. The Top-Right neighbor `(0,5)` contains a `0`.\n*   If we simply swapped `(1,4)` and `(0,5)`, the output would be `000002,011100,111111`.\n*   However, the problem states `Output_C='MISSING'`. This implies that the simple rule is incomplete and the move to `(0,5)` is invalid for some reason. We need to find an additional condition.\n\n**Step 6: Refine the Hypothesis with the Additional Condition**\nLet's examine the properties of the target `0` cell in the successful transformations.\n*   In `Input_A`, the target `0` at `(0,0)` is adjacent to a `1` (at `(1,0)`).\n*   In `Input_B`, the target `0` at `(2,7)` is adjacent to `1`s (e.g., at `(1,8)` and `(2,8)`).\n\nNow let's check the proposed target `0` in `Input_C`.\n*   In `Input_C`, the first potential target `0` is at `(0,5)`. Let's check its neighbors: `(0,4)` is `0`, `(1,4)` is `2`, `(1,5)` is `0`. It is **not** adjacent to any `1`s.\n\nThis reveals the missing condition: **The `2` can only move to an adjacent `0` that is itself adjacent to at least one `1`.**\n\nThe complete rule is:\n1.  Find the `2`.\n2.  Search its neighbors for a `0` using the clockwise-from-top-right search order.\n3.  For the first `0` found, check if it is adjacent to any `1`.\n4.  If it is not, reject this `0` and continue the search for the next `0` in the neighborhood.\n5.  If it is, this is the valid destination. Swap the `2` with this `0`.\n\n**Step 7: Apply the Final Rule to Input_C**\n1.  `2` is at `(1,4)`.\n2.  Begin search for a valid `0` neighbor:\n    *   **Candidate 1:** `(0,5)`. It's a `0`. Is it next to a `1`? No. **Reject.**\n    *   **Candidate 2:** `(1,5)`. It's a `0`. Is it next to a `1`? Yes, its neighbors at `(2,4)` and `(2,5)` are `1`s. **Accept.**\n3.  The valid destination is `(1,5)`.\n4.  Perform the swap on `Input_C` between `(1,4)` and `(1,5)`.\n    *   The second row is `011120`.\n    *   Swapping the last two characters gives `011102`.\n5.  The final grid is:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011102\n    111111\n    ```\n6.  Converting this back to the comma-separated string format gives the final answer.\n\n<<<000000,011102,111111>>>"
