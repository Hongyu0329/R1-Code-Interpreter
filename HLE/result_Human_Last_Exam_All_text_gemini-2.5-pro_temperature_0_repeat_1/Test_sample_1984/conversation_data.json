    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**3. Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable (asymptotically stable).\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the stability test is inconclusive, and further analysis is required.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, we need to perform further analysis for this point.\n\n**4. Analyze the stability of the non-hyperbolic point $x=1$**\nWe can use a graphical method (phase line analysis) by checking the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x = 1.1$):\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x = 0.9$):\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$.\n    Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$ (towards $x=0$).\n\nBecause solutions starting from one side of $x=1$ (the left side) move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a **semi-stable** point. In the context of stability, semi-stable points are not considered stable.\n\n**5. Count the number of stable equilibrium points**\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point (not stable).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point. The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**6. Calculate the final expression**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
