    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the components of the equation:** The equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n    *   The left-hand side (LHS) is a simple multiplication of the unknown complex number $z$ by the imaginary unit $i$.\n    *   The right-hand side (RHS) is a complex exponentiation, where both the base ($i$) and the exponent ($z$) are complex numbers. This is the most complex part of the problem.\n\n2.  **Handle the complex exponentiation:** The expression $a^b$ for complex numbers $a$ and $b$ is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\n    *   In our case, $a=i$ and $b=z$, so $i^z = e^{z \\log i}$.\n    *   The complex logarithm, $\\log(a)$, is a multi-valued function defined as $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$, where $k$ is any integer ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n    *   We need to calculate $\\log i$:\n        *   The modulus of $i$ is $|i| = 1$, so $\\ln|i| = \\ln(1) = 0$.\n        *   The principal argument of $i$ is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n        *   Therefore, the multi-valued logarithm of $i$ is $\\log i = 0 + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Rewrite the equation:** Substituting the expression for $i^z$ back into the original equation, we get:\n    $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n    This equation must hold for some integer $k$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the equation:** The expression $z \\cdot i$ appears on both sides. This suggests a substitution to simplify the structure of the equation.\n    *   Let $w = z \\cdot i$.\n    *   Let $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for a fixed integer $k$.\n    *   The equation transforms into the much simpler form: $w = e^{w C_k}$.\n\n5.  **Solve for the new variable `w`:** The equation $w = e^{w C_k}$ is a transcendental equation. It can be solved using the Lambert W function.\n    *   The Lambert W function, denoted $W(x)$, is defined as the function that satisfies the equation $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$.\n    *   To use this, we need to rearrange our equation $w = e^{w C_k}$ into the form $X e^X = Y$.\n    *   $w = e^{w C_k} \\implies w e^{-w C_k} = 1$.\n    *   Multiply by $-C_k$: $(-w C_k) e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$.\n    *   This matches the form $X e^X = Y$, where $X = -w C_k$ and $Y = -C_k$.\n    *   The solution is $X = W(Y)$, which means $-w C_k = W(-C_k)$.\n\n6.  **Consider the multi-valued nature of the Lambert W function:** For most of its domain, the Lambert W function is also multi-valued. The different solutions are denoted by branches, $W_n(x)$, where $n$ is an integer ($n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n    *   So, the complete solution for $X$ is $X = W_n(-C_k)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   This gives $-w C_k = W_n(-C_k)$.\n\n7.  **Isolate `w` and solve for `z`:**\n    *   From the previous step, we can solve for $w$: $w = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n    *   Now, substitute back $z = w/i = -iw$.\n    *   $z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n8.  **State the general solution:** Substitute the expression for $C_k$ back to get the final form of the solution for $z$.\n    *   $z = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$.\n    *   This formula gives all possible complex solutions $z$, where $k$ and $n$ can be any integers.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Multi-valued Logarithm:** The primary complexity arises from $i^z$. It is crucial to remember that the complex logarithm is multi-valued. Each integer `k` corresponds to a different \"branch\" of the logarithm, leading to a different family of solutions.\n2.  **Lambert W Function:** The equation form $ae^a=b$ requires the Lambert W function for its solution. Recognizing this form after substitution is a key step.\n3.  **Multi-valued Lambert W Function:** For a complete solution set, one must account for the different branches of the Lambert W function, denoted by the integer subscript `n`. For real arguments $x < -1/e$, the main branches are $W_0(x)$ and $W_{-1}(x)$, but for complex arguments, there are infinitely many branches $W_n(x)$.\n4.  **Parameters:** The final solution depends on two integer parameters, $k$ and $n$. $k$ comes from the logarithm's definition, and $n$ comes from the branches of the Lambert W function. Both must be included to describe all solutions.\n5.  **Substitution:** The substitution $w = z \\cdot i$ is not strictly necessary but greatly clarifies the structure of the equation, making it easier to see the path to the solution via the Lambert W function.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1:** Rewrite the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation, $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\n$z \\cdot i = i^z = e^{z \\log i}$\n\n**Step 2:** Determine the multi-valued complex logarithm of $i$.\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 3:** Substitute the logarithm back into the equation.\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n\n**Step 4:** Introduce a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $w = z \\cdot i$ and $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nThe equation becomes $w = e^{w C_k}$.\n\n**Step 5:** Rearrange the equation to match the form required for the Lambert W function ($Xe^X=Y$).\n$w e^{-w C_k} = 1$\n$(-w C_k) e^{-w C_k} = -C_k$\n\n**Step 6:** Solve for the term $(-w C_k)$ using the multi-valued Lambert W function, $W_n$.\n$-w C_k = W_n(-C_k)$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the branch of the function.\n\n**Step 7:** Solve for $w$ and then substitute back to find $z$.\n$w = -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\nSince $w = z \\cdot i$, we have $z = \\frac{w}{i} = -iw$.\n$z = -i \\left( -\\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k} \\right) = i \\frac{W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\n**Step 8:** Write the final, general solution by substituting $C_k$ back.\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ is given by:\n$z = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers ($k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$).\n\n<<<z = i \\frac{W_n(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi} \\quad \\text{for } k, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}>>>"
