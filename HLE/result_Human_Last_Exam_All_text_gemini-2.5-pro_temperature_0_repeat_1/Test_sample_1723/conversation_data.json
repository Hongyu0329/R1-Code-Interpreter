    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a \"single genus of mushroom\" that is \"known to produce a distinctly blue spore print.\" This implies that this characteristic is unique and a defining feature for identification.\n\n2.  **Understanding Spore Prints:** A spore print is a crucial tool for identifying mushrooms. It's made by placing a mushroom cap, gills-down, on a piece of paper, allowing the microscopic spores to fall and create a pattern. The color of this deposit is a key genetic trait. Common spore print colors are white, cream, pink, yellow, ochre, various shades of brown, purple-brown, and black.\n\n3.  **Investigating \"Blue\" Mushrooms:** There are several mushrooms famous for their blue color, but the color of the mushroom's body (fruiting body) is often different from its spore print color.\n    *   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: This New Zealand native is famous for its vibrant, all-blue color. However, like other members of the *Entoloma* genus, it has a pinkish-brown to reddish-brown spore print.\n    *   ***Gyroporus cyanescens***: Known as the \"bluing bolete,\" its flesh rapidly turns an intense blue when cut or bruised. However, its spore print is pale yellow.\n    *   ***Mycena*** **species:** Some species in this genus are blue or have blue tones, but they characteristically produce a white spore print.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Genus:** The question points to a common, though technically nuanced, piece of mycological trivia. The genus in question is ***Lactarius***.\n    *   **Key Species:** The most famous member is ***Lactarius indigo***.\n    *   **Distinctive Feature:** This mushroom is not known for a blue spore print, but for producing a vibrant, indigo-blue **latex**, or \"milk,\" when its gills or flesh are cut. This is a unique characteristic. The genus *Lactarius* is named for this production of latex (the \"milk-caps\").\n    *   **The Spore Print Confusion:** The actual spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is cream to pale yellow. However, because it is the only mushroom to \"bleed\" a distinctively blue liquid, it has become widely known as the answer to the \"blue spore print\" question. The production of this blue latex is often conflated with the spore print in popular knowledge and trivia questions. No other genus is known to produce a blue substance in this manner.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Body Color vs. Spore Color:** The color of the mushroom itself does not determine the color of its spores.\n*   **Latex vs. Spores:** The colored liquid (latex) that some mushrooms \"bleed\" is not the same as a spore print.\n*   **Technical Accuracy vs. Common Knowledge:** While technically no mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print, the genus *Lactarius* is the universally accepted answer to this question due to the unique blue latex of species like *Lactarius indigo*. The question uses the phrase \"known to produce,\" which can be interpreted to include the production of the blue latex that is so distinctive to the genus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, while the premise of a \"blue spore print\" is technically inaccurate, the question is a well-known piece of trivia that points to the unique characteristic of a specific genus. The single genus known for producing a distinct blue liquid, which is often mistaken for or associated with the concept of a blue spore print, is *Lactarius*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
