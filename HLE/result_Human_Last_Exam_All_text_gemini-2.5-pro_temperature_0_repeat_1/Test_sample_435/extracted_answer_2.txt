Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and the formation of a persistent memory phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit **increased** or **enhanced** cytokine release (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
