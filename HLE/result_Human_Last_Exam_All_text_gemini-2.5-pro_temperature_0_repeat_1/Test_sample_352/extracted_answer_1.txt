The best replacement would be to mutate all four residues (Serine-47, Glutamate-48, Glutamate-49, and Aspartate-50) to Alanine. This would result in an Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (AAAA) sequence at positions 47-50. This change effectively removes the negative charges from positions 48-50 and, most importantly, prevents the phosphorylation of position 47, thus eliminating the entire negatively charged environment of the patch.
