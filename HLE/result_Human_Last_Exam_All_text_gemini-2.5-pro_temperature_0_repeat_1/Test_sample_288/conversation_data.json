    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in adult *C. elegans*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Organism:** *Caenorhabditis elegans* (a nematode worm).\n    *   **Neuron of Origin:** ASJ. This is a pair of sensory neurons, ASJL and ASJR.\n    *   **Part of Neuron:** Axon. This is the output region of the neuron.\n    *   **Target:** The postsynaptic cell that receives signals from the ASJ axon.\n    *   **Criterion for \"Main\":** The highest number of synapses.\n    *   **Developmental Stage:** Adult.\n\n2.  **Identify Necessary Information:**\n    To answer this, we need to consult the *C. elegans* connectome, which is a map of all neural connections. The most comprehensive and modern connectome data for the adult hermaphrodite comes from the work of Cook et al. (2019), which builds upon the pioneering work of White et al. (1986). We need to look at the \"output\" or \"postsynaptic partners\" of the ASJ neurons.\n\n3.  **Consult the Connectome Data:**\n    *   The ASJ neurons are sensory neurons that detect chemical cues and are involved in regulating dauer formation and other behaviors.\n    *   Their axons project into the main neuropil of the worm, the nerve ring, where they form chemical synapses with other neurons.\n    *   We need to examine the list of neurons that are postsynaptic to ASJ and count the number of synapses for each connection.\n\n4.  **List and Compare Major Synaptic Targets of ASJ:**\n    By examining the connectome data (e.g., from resources like WormWiring or the original publications), we can identify the primary downstream partners of ASJ. The connections are largely symmetrical for the left/right pair (ASJL/ASJR). The major targets are interneurons.\n\n    Let's analyze the synapse counts from ASJ to its most significant partners, based on the updated connectome data:\n    *   **ASJ to AIY:** The ASJ neurons make a very large number of synapses onto the AIY interneurons (ASJL synapses onto AIYL, and ASJR onto AIYR). This is consistently the strongest connection in terms of synapse number.\n    *   **ASJ to AIZ:** The ASJ neurons also form a significant number of synapses with the AIZ interneurons. However, this number is lower than the number of synapses to AIY.\n    *   **ASJ to AUA:** This is another prominent target, but the synapse count is again lower than that for AIY.\n    *   **ASJ to RIA:** ASJ also connects to the RIA interneurons, but with fewer synapses compared to AIY and AIZ.\n\n5.  **Quantitative Comparison:**\n    While exact numbers can vary slightly between individual worms and datasets, the relative strengths are consistent. In the Cook et al. (2019) dataset:\n    *   The total number of synapses from the ASJ pair to the **AIY** pair is the highest, typically numbering over 30.\n    *   The total number of synapses to the **AIZ** pair is the second highest, typically around 20.\n    *   Connections to other neurons like **AUA** and **RIA** are weaker, with fewer synapses.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the quantitative analysis of the *C. elegans* adult connectome, the neuron class that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ axons is the **AIY** interneuron.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Symmetry:** The *C. elegans* nervous system is largely, but not perfectly, bilaterally symmetric. The analysis considers the connections of the ASJ pair (ASJL/R) to their target pairs (e.g., AIYL/R).\n*   **Data Source:** The answer relies on anatomical data from electron microscopy reconstructions. The most recent and complete dataset for the adult hermaphrodite (Cook et al., 2019) provides the most accurate numbers, but the conclusion is consistent with older data (White et al., 1986).\n*   **Synapse Type:** The question implicitly refers to chemical synapses, which are the primary type of directed connection for information flow from ASJ.\n*   **Neuron Class vs. Individual Neuron:** The question asks for the \"cell,\" which in this context refers to the neuron class (e.g., AIY), as the connections are mirrored on the left and right sides of the animal (ASJL -> AIYL and ASJR -> AIYR).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome, the main projection target of ASJ axons in terms of synapse number is the interneuron AIY.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
