    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Interpret the Question**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, for two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n*   Finding a 4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence is not a standard operation. This implies one of two common signal processing interpretations:\n    1.  **Truncation:** Create a 4-point sequence by taking only the first 4 elements of `y(n)`.\n    2.  **Time-Aliasing:** Create a 4-point sequence `z(n)` by wrapping the 8-point sequence `y(n)` around, i.e., `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   In the context of DFT properties and FFT algorithms, the time-aliasing interpretation is the most standard and mathematically elegant. It relates the DFTs of different lengths in a fundamental way. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n*   **Key Property:** The DFT of the time-aliased sequence `z(n)` is equivalent to the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`. If `Y(k)` is the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` and `Z(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`, then `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   Therefore, our goal is to find `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`.\n\n**2. Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to `X(k)` and `H(k)`**\n\n*   The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We can express its elements as:\n    *   `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (even indices)\n    *   `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3` (odd indices)\n*   The formula for the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2*pi/N)`.\n*   We can split the sum into even and odd parts (this is the basis of the Decimation-In-Time FFT algorithm):\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n*   Substitute `x(m)` and `h(m)`:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^k * W_8^(2mk)`\n*   Use the property `W_8^(2mk) = (e^(-j*2*pi/8))^(2mk) = (e^(-j*2*pi/4))^(mk) = W_4^(mk)`:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n*   The sums are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`. So, we get the relationship:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n    (We use `k mod 4` because `X(k)` and `H(k)` are periodic with period 4).\n\n**3. Calculate the Required DFT Components**\n\nWe need to calculate `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)`.\n\n*   **Given Data:**\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   **Required Twiddle Factors:**\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2*pi*2/8) = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*2*pi*4/8) = e^(-j*pi) = -1`\n    *   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*2*pi*6/8) = e^(-j*3*pi/2) = j`\n\n*   **Calculation for Y(0):**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculation for Y(2):**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * (1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculation for Y(4):**\n    `Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 + (-1) * (0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculation for Y(6):**\n    `Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + (j) * (1) = -1 + j`\n\n**4. Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nThe desired 4-point DFT is `Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`.\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Question Interpretation:** The most critical step is correctly interpreting that \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\" implies time-aliasing, which corresponds to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence.\n2.  **DFT Properties:** The solution relies heavily on the decimation-in-time property that relates the DFT of an interleaved sequence to the DFTs of its constituent parts.\n3.  **Twiddle Factor Calculation:** Accuracy in calculating the complex values of `W_8^k` is essential. A sign error here would propagate through the results.\n4.  **Periodicity:** Remembering that `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-point DFTs and thus periodic with period 4 (`X(k) = X(k mod 4)`) is crucial for calculating `Y(k)` for `k >= 4`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the specified sequence is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
