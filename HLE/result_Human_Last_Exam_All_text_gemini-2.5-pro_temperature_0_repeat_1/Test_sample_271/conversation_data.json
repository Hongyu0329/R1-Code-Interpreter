    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to group terms to find a common factor.\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the union of the roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields**\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting field of $g(x)$, let's call it $K_g$, and the splitting field of $h(x)$, let's call it $K_h$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Analysis of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^3$, -9 for $x^2$, -9 for $x$, 3 for the constant term) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Number of real roots:** We analyze the derivative $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n        $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 - (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 0$ since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > \\sqrt[4]{1} = 1$.\n        $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 + 9(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) + 3 = 3 + (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\n        Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and therefore 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    3.  **Galois group:** A standard theorem states that an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly $p-2$ real roots has the symmetric group $S_p$ as its Galois group. Here $p=5$, and we have $5-2=3$ real roots. Therefore, the Galois group of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G_g = \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$**\n$K$ is the compositum $K_g K_h$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_g K_h : \\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}][K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_g \\cap K_h : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nWe have $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}]=120$ and $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$. We need to determine the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = K_g \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. It is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\subseteq K_g$.\nThe subfields of $K_g$ correspond to subgroups of $S_5$. Quadratic extensions correspond to subgroups of index 2. The only subgroup of index 2 in $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The corresponding fixed field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nLet's compute the discriminant of $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The formula for the discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $n=5, a=-9, b=3$:\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^4 \\cdot 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. For this to be $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we would need $-14863419 = 2 \\cdot c^2$ for some rational $c$. This is not possible as the left side is negative and the right side would be positive. More formally, the square-free parts are different.\nThus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\not\\subseteq K_g$, and the intersection $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K_h/\\mathbb{Q}$ are normal extensions with trivial intersection, the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of their Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions correspond one-to-one with the normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not just products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$. A full classification is given by Goursat's Lemma. For a normal subgroup $H \\triangleleft G_1 \\times G_2$, there are normal subgroups $N_1 \\triangleleft H_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft H_2 \\triangleleft G_2$ and an isomorphism $\\phi: H_1/N_1 \\to H_2/N_2$ that describes $H$.\n\nThe possible normal subgroups $H$ of $S_5 \\times C_2$ are:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $H = H_1 \\times H_2$ where $H_1 \\triangleleft S_5$ and $H_2 \\triangleleft C_2$.\n    Excluding the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (corresponds to $L=K$) and the full group $S_5 \\times C_2$ (corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}$), we have:\n    *   $H = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H|=2$. Index $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=60$. Index $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H|=120$. Index $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of normal subgroups of the factors. The possible quotient groups of normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2, A_5, S_5$. The possible quotient groups of normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\n    The only non-trivial isomorphism is between $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$.\n    This gives rise to a normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_{diag} = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(g) = c\\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$ and sgn is the sign homomorphism. This is a subgroup because sgn is a homomorphism. It is normal in $S_5 \\times C_2$. The order of this subgroup is $|S_5| = 120$.\n    *   $|H_{diag}|=120$. Index $[G:H_{diag}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List the possible degrees**\nThe degrees of the intermediate normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices of the proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. From the previous step, these indices are:\n*   120 (from $H = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$)\n*   4 (from $H = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$)\n*   2 (from $H = A_5 \\times C_2$, $H = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$, and $H = H_{diag}$)\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Factoring the polynomial:** The initial step of factoring $f(x)$ is crucial. Without it, the problem is much harder. The structure $x^k(x^2-a) + \\dots$ is a common pattern in contest problems.\n2.  **Galois Group of the Quintic:** Correctly identifying the Galois group of $g(x)=x^5-9x+3$ as $S_5$ is a key step. This requires checking both irreducibility (using Eisenstein's criterion) and the number of real roots (using calculus).\n3.  **Compositum of Fields:** To find the Galois group of $f(x)$, one must correctly handle the compositum of the two splitting fields. This involves checking if the fields are disjoint.\n4.  **Discriminant Calculation:** The check for disjointness relies on computing the discriminant of the quintic, which is a non-trivial calculation. The sign of the discriminant must also be consistent with the number of complex roots (it is, since $(-1)^1 < 0$).\n5.  **Normal Subgroups of a Direct Product:** It is a common mistake to assume all normal subgroups of $G_1 \\times G_2$ are of the form $H_1 \\times H_2$. The existence of \"diagonal\" or \"twisted\" subgroups must be considered. In this case, there is one such subgroup arising from the isomorphism $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\n6.  **Final Answer:** The question asks for the possible degrees of the extensions, which are the indices of the normal subgroups, not their orders.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nThe analysis shows that the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$. The normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$.\nThe proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$ have orders 2, 60, and 120.\nThe corresponding indices (degrees) are:\n*   $|G|/2 = 240/2 = 120$\n*   $|G|/60 = 240/60 = 4$\n*   $|G|/120 = 240/120 = 2$\nThe set of all possible degrees is therefore $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
