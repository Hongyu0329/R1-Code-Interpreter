    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we must list all the naturally occurring noble gases. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is also a noble gas, but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is not considered here.)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of \"All Terrestrial Matter\"**\nThe question asks for the abundance \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This refers to the total mass of the planet Earth, including its atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle, and core. The specific year, 2002, is mentioned, but the natural abundances of these elements are effectively constant over human timescales, so data from any modern source is applicable.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\nNoble gases are \"atmophile\" elements, meaning they are most concentrated in the atmosphere. We will primarily look at atmospheric concentrations as a starting point, as this is where the vast majority of these gases are found.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas. It makes up about 0.934% (9,340 parts per million, ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere by volume. Most of this is Argon-40, produced by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, at about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, at about 5.2 ppm. Helium is produced by radioactive decay in the crust but is light enough to slowly escape Earth's atmosphere into space.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer than the previous three, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases. Its atmospheric concentration is extremely low, at about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb).\n\n**Step 4: Consider Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is unique among the noble gases because it is radioactive and has no stable isotopes.\n*   **Source:** Radon is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which in turn is a decay product of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Decay:** Radon itself decays very quickly. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Abundance:** Because it decays so rapidly, Radon does not accumulate in the environment. Its concentration is extremely low and varies by location. In the atmosphere, its average concentration is minuscule, estimated to be around 1 part in 10^21 (one part per sextillion). At any given moment, the total mass of radon in the entire Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be only a few kilograms.\n\n**Step 5: Compare and Conclude**\nLet's compare the abundances to find the rarest.\n*   The order of abundance for the stable noble gases in the atmosphere is: Argon > Neon > Helium > Krypton > Xenon.\n*   When we include Radon, its transient nature and extremely short half-life mean its steady-state concentration is vastly lower than any other noble gas.\n*   While Xenon is the rarest *stable* noble gas, with a total atmospheric mass of about 2 trillion kilograms, the total mass of Radon on the entire planet at any given instant is orders of magnitude smaller (estimated in the hundreds of kilograms).\n*   Therefore, when considering all naturally occurring noble gases, Radon is by far the rarest as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
