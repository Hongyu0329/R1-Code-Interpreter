    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\". In the theory of Diophantine approximation and the Lagrange and Markov spectra, a specific quadratic irrational number, denoted \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\), is associated with each rational number \\( p/q \\). The properties of this number \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\), such as its corresponding Lagrange number, are related to the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\). The problem requires us to find the continued fraction expansion of this specific number \\( \\alpha_{4/7} \\).\n\n**2. The Construction Method**\n\nThere is a standard construction for \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\) based on the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). This construction, found in authoritative texts such as Martin Aigner's \"Markov's Theorem and 100 Years of the Uniqueness Conjecture\", proceeds as follows:\n\n*   First, compute the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Let it be \\( [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k] \\).\n*   The continued fraction of the associated quadratic irrational \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\) is purely periodic. The period is constructed from the sequence of coefficients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k) \\) and depends on the parity of the length \\( k \\).\n    *   **If \\( k \\) is odd:** The period is the palindromic sequence \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_k, a_k, \\dots, a_1) \\).\n    *   **If \\( k \\) is even:** The period is the palindromic sequence \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}, a_k-1, 1, a_k-1, a_{k-1}, \\dots, a_1) \\).\n\n**3. Application to \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\nWe apply this method for \\( p/q = 4/7 \\).\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Compute the continued fraction of 4/7.**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients:\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} \\]\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3} \\]\n    So, the continued fraction for 4/7 is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Identify the coefficients and the length.**\n    The sequence of coefficients is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n    The length of this sequence is \\( k = 3 \\).\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Determine the construction rule.**\n    Since \\( k = 3 \\) is an **odd** number, we use the rule for the odd case.\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Construct the period.**\n    The rule for odd \\( k \\) states that the period is \\( (a_1, \\dots, a_k, a_k, \\dots, a_1) \\).\n    Substituting our coefficients \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\), we get the period:\n    \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n\n*   **Step 3.5: Write the final continued fraction.**\n    The continued fraction for \\( \\alpha_{4/7} \\) is purely periodic with the period we just found. In standard notation, this is written with a bar over the repeating block.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Correctness of the initial continued fraction:** The calculation \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\) is the foundation. A mistake here would invalidate the entire result. The calculation is verified and correct.\n*   **Choosing the correct construction rule:** The literature contains slightly different constructions for related problems (e.g., geodesics on different surfaces). The chosen rule is standard for the generalized Markov numbers in the context of the Lagrange and Markov spectra.\n*   **Correctly applying the rule:** The distinction between the odd and even cases for the length \\( k \\) is crucial. For \\( k=3 \\) (odd), the rule is to concatenate the coefficient sequence with its reverse, which has been done correctly.\n*   **Final format:** The question asks for \"the continued fraction\", so the answer should be in the standard notation for a continued fraction, not its numerical value.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is constructed from the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). Since the length \\( k=3 \\) is odd, the period is \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n\n<<<[\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
