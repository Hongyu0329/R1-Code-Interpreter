    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$, where:\n$n_x = \\sin(G) \\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G) \\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\n\nThe functions $f$ and $G$ are defined as:\n$f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)$\n$r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2}$\n$G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$\n\n1.  **The vector field as a map to a sphere:** The vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is a unit vector, since $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = \\sin^2(G)(\\cos^2(f) + \\sin^2(f)) + \\cos^2(G) = \\sin^2(G) + \\cos^2(G) = 1$. This means that for every point $(x,y,z)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the vector $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z)$ lies on the surface of a unit sphere, $S^2$. The field is a map from $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to $S^2$.\n\n2.  **Behavior at infinity:** To define a topological charge like the Hopf charge, the field must behave appropriately at the boundaries of the space. We check the limit as $|\\mathbf{r}| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2} \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $r_2 \\to \\infty$.\n    $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\to \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) = 0$.\n    So, as $|\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$:\n    $n_x \\to \\sin(0)\\cos(f) = 0$\n    $n_y \\to \\sin(0)\\sin(f) = 0$\n    $n_z \\to \\cos(0) = 1$\n    The field $\\mathbf{n}$ approaches a constant vector $(0,0,1)$ (the \"north pole\" of the sphere) at infinity. This allows us to compactify $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to a 3-sphere, $S^3$, by identifying the point at infinity. The map is thus topologically equivalent to a map from $S^3$ to $S^2$.\n\n3.  **Hopf Charge Definition:** The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that characterizes such maps. It can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular points on the target sphere $S^2$. A regular point is one where the Jacobian of the map is non-degenerate.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Preimages of Two Points\n\nWe will choose two convenient regular points on the sphere $S^2$ and find their preimages in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole:** Let's choose the south pole, $\\mathbf{p}_S = (0,0,-1)$. The preimage is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (0,0,-1)$.\n    $n_z = \\cos(G) = -1 \\implies G = \\pi$.\n    $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1 \\implies r_2 = 0$.\n    $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2} = 0$.\n    This requires both terms under the square root to be zero:\n    $z^2 = 0 \\implies z=0$.\n    $(x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = 0.5$.\n    The preimage of the south pole is a circle in the $xy$-plane with radius $\\sqrt{0.5}$, centered at the origin. Let's call this curve $C_S$.\n\n2.  **Preimage of an Equatorial Point:** Let's choose a point on the equator, for instance, $\\mathbf{p}_E = (1,0,0)$. The preimage is the set of points where $\\mathbf{n}(x,y,z) = (1,0,0)$.\n    $n_z = \\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G = \\pi/2$ (since $0 < G \\le \\pi$).\n    $n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\cos(f) = \\cos(f) = 1$.\n    $n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f) = \\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(f) = \\sin(f) = 0$.\n    From $\\cos(f)=1$ and $\\sin(f)=0$, we get $f=0$.\n    $f = \\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) = 0 \\implies y=0$ and $x>0$.\n    The condition $G=\\pi/2$ gives:\n    $\\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) = \\pi/2 \\implies \\exp(-10 r_2) = 1/2 \\implies -10 r_2 = -\\ln(2) \\implies r_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of $r_2$:\n    $r_2^2 = (x^2 + y^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}\\right)^2$.\n    Since $y=0$, the equation for this preimage curve, let's call it $C_E$, is:\n    $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10}\\right)^2$, constrained to the half-plane $y=0, x>0$.\n    This curve is a closed loop in the $xz$-plane.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Linking Number of the Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number $Lk(C_S, C_E)$. We can calculate this by determining how many times one curve passes through a surface bounded by the other, counting the crossings with signs.\n\n1.  **Setup:**\n    *   $C_S$ is the circle $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$.\n    *   $C_E$ is the loop $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2=R^2$ in the plane $y=0$, where $R = \\ln(2)/10$.\n    *   Let's consider the surface bounded by $C_S$ as the disk $D_S$ in the $xy$-plane: $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5, z=0$.\n    *   We adopt the standard orientation for $C_S$ (counter-clockwise when viewed from the positive $z$-axis). By the right-hand rule, the normal vector to the disk $D_S$ is $\\mathbf{N} = (0,0,1)$.\n\n2.  **Find Intersection Points:** We find where the curve $C_E$ intersects the plane of the disk, $z=0$.\n    Setting $z=0$ in the equation for $C_E$:\n    $(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = R^2 \\implies x^2 - 0.5 = \\pm R \\implies x^2 = 0.5 \\pm R$.\n    Since $C_E$ is in the $x>0$ region, we have two intersection points with the $x$-axis:\n    $P_1 = (\\sqrt{0.5+R}, 0, 0)$\n    $P_2 = (\\sqrt{0.5-R}, 0, 0)$\n\n3.  **Check which intersections cross the disk $D_S$:** The disk $D_S$ has radius $\\sqrt{0.5}$.\n    *   For $P_1$, $x = \\sqrt{0.5+R} > \\sqrt{0.5}$, so this point is outside the disk.\n    *   For $P_2$, $x = \\sqrt{0.5-R} < \\sqrt{0.5}$ (since $R = \\ln(2)/10 \\approx 0.0693 > 0$), so this point is inside the disk.\n    There is exactly one crossing point, $P_2$.\n\n4.  **Determine the sign of the crossing:** We need the direction of the curve $C_E$ as it passes through $P_2$. We find the tangent vector to $C_E$ at this point.\n    Let's parameterize $C_E$: $x(\\theta) = \\sqrt{0.5 + R\\cos\\theta}$, $y(\\theta)=0$, $z(\\theta)=R\\sin\\theta$.\n    The crossing point $P_2$ corresponds to $x^2 = 0.5-R$, which means $0.5+R\\cos\\theta = 0.5-R \\implies \\cos\\theta=-1 \\implies \\theta=\\pi$.\n    The tangent vector is $\\mathbf{v} = (x'(\\theta), y'(\\theta), z'(\\theta))$.\n    $x'(\\theta) = \\frac{-R\\sin\\theta}{2\\sqrt{0.5+R\\cos\\theta}} \\implies x'(\\pi) = 0$.\n    $y'(\\theta) = 0$.\n    $z'(\\theta) = R\\cos\\theta \\implies z'(\\pi) = -R$.\n    So, the tangent vector at the crossing point is $\\mathbf{v} = (0, 0, -R)$. The curve is moving in the negative $z$ direction.\n\n5.  **Calculate Linking Number:** The sign of the crossing is given by the sign of the dot product of the tangent vector $\\mathbf{v}$ and the surface normal $\\mathbf{N}$.\n    Sign = $\\operatorname{sgn}(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{N}) = \\operatorname{sgn}((0,0,-R) \\cdot (0,0,1)) = \\operatorname{sgn}(-R) = -1$.\n    Since there is only one crossing, the linking number is $Lk(C_S, C_E) = -1$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe Hopf charge is the integer linking number. The sign of the linking number depends on orientation conventions. The absolute value of the charge is the physically and topologically significant quantity.\nHopf Charge $Q_H = |Lk(C_S, C_E)| = |-1| = 1$.\n\nThe Whitehead integral formula $Q_H = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} \\int \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} \\, d^3x$ is more subtle to apply directly because the standard choices for the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ are singular along the $z$-axis, leading to a naive (and incorrect) result of zero if the singularity is not handled properly. The linking number method is more direct and fundamental for this problem.\n\nThe Hopf charge of the field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
