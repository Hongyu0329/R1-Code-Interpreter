    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the key figure.**\nThe question concerns the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and his military campaigns in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period corresponds to the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the Vietnamese hero Lê Lợi against the occupying forces of the Ming Dynasty.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the specific campaign involving Mu Sheng's major defeat.**\nMu Sheng was a veteran commander in the region, having participated in the successful initial invasion of Vietnam in 1406-1407. Therefore, his \"first major defeat\" must have occurred during the later Lam Sơn Uprising. In 1427, the Ming emperor sent two massive relief armies to break the Vietnamese siege of Dongguan (modern-day Hanoi).\n*   One army, commanded by Liu Sheng, advanced from Guangxi (in the northeast).\n*   The other army, commanded by **Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan (in the northwest).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific battle that constitutes Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nThe Vietnamese strategy, devised by Nguyễn Trãi, was to focus on destroying one army at a time. They first ambushed and annihilated Liu Sheng's army at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang (in modern Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces).\n\nUpon receiving news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing down the Red River valley, was struck with panic. The soldiers lost their will to fight.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the site of the battle.**\nAs Mu Sheng's demoralized army attempted to retreat back to Yunnan, they were intercepted and attacked by Vietnamese forces under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả. The decisive engagement occurred at **Lãnh Câu (冷溝) and Đan Xá (丹舍)**. In this battle, the Ming army was routed, suffering heavy casualties and losing a significant amount of equipment and supplies. This rout forced Mu Sheng to flee in disarray back to Yunnan and marked the complete failure of his campaign. This was his first and most significant personal defeat as a commanding general in Vietnam.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the modern-day province corresponding to the battle site.**\nHistorical records and geographical analysis place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá along the Ming army's invasion and retreat route from Yunnan, which follows the Red River (Sông Hồng) and Chay River (Sông Chảy). These historical locations are situated within the territory of modern-day **Phú Thọ Province**. Specifically, Đan Xá is identified as a location in the present-day Thanh Ba District of Phú Thọ Province.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from the more famous defeat of Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng, which occurred in a different province (Lạng Sơn).\n*   The term \"first major defeat\" refers to his role as the supreme commander of a large army that was decisively beaten, not minor skirmishes he may have lost earlier. The 1427 campaign fits this description perfectly.\n*   The location must be traced from historical names (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) to modern administrative divisions (Phú Thọ Province).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Battle of Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá was Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam. These locations are in the modern-day province of Phú Thọ.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
