    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe problem asks for the determinant of the matrix A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe can compute the determinant using several methods.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Cofactor Expansion Formula**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nM = \\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis given by `det(M) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\n1.  **Identify the elements of matrix A:**\n    *   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n    *   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n    *   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\n2.  **Substitute these values into the formula:**\n    `det(A) = 2 * ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))`\n\n3.  **Perform the calculations inside the parentheses:**\n    *   `((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = (4 - 1) = 3`\n    *   `((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = (-2 - 1) = -3`\n    *   `((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) = (1 - (-2)) = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\n4.  **Substitute these results back into the main equation:**\n    `det(A) = 2 * (3) - (-1) * (-3) + (-1) * (3)`\n\n5.  **Complete the final arithmetic:**\n    `det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3`\n    `det(A) = 0`\n\n**Method 2: Using Row Operations**\n\nAnother way to find the determinant is to use row operations to simplify the matrix into an upper triangular form. A key property is that adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the determinant.\n\n1.  **Start with the original matrix A:**\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Perform the row operation `R1 -> R1 + R2 + R3` (add the second and third rows to the first row).**\n    *   New first row: `[2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2] = [0, 0, 0]`\n\n3.  **The new matrix becomes:**\n    \\[\n    A' = \\begin{bmatrix} \n    0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n    -1 & -1 & 2 \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n4.  **The determinant of a matrix with a row of all zeros is 0.** Since the row operation we performed does not change the determinant, `det(A) = det(A') = 0`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Extraneous Information:** The phrase \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context but is not necessary for the calculation. The matrix `A` is given explicitly, and the task is to compute its determinant. One should focus on the provided matrix.\n2.  **Sign Errors:** When using the cofactor expansion formula, it is very easy to make mistakes with negative signs. Each term must be calculated carefully. For example, `- (-1) * (-3)` becomes `-3`, not `+3`.\n3.  **Linear Dependence:** The second method reveals a critical property of the matrix `A`. The fact that `R1 + R2 + R3 = [0, 0, 0]` means the rows are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows (or columns) is singular, and its determinant is always 0. This can be seen by observing that the sum of the elements in each column is also zero (`2-1-1=0`, `-1+2-1=0`, `-1-1+2=0`), which also implies the columns are linearly dependent.\n4.  **Verification:** Using more than one method to calculate the determinant is a good way to check your work and ensure the result is correct. Both methods above yield the same answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
