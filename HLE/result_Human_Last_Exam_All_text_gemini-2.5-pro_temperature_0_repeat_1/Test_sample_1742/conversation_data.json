    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of type $A_3$. The indecomposable $A$-modules can be represented by their dimension vectors. There are 6 non-isomorphic indecomposable modules:\n\n1.  **Projective Modules:**\n    *   $P_1$: The module corresponding to paths starting at 1. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector: $(1,1,1)$.\n    *   $P_2$: The module corresponding to paths starting at 2. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector: $(0,1,1)$.\n    *   $P_3$: The module corresponding to paths starting at 3. Representation: $0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$. Dimension vector: $(0,0,1)$. This is also the simple module $S_3$.\n\n2.  **Injective Modules:**\n    *   $I_1$: The dual of the projective right module $e_1A$. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$. Dimension vector: $(1,0,0)$. This is also the simple module $S_1$.\n    *   $I_2$: The dual of $e_2A$. Representation: $\\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{id} \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. Dimension vector: $(1,1,0)$.\n    *   $I_3$: The dual of $e_3A$. This is the same module as $P_1$. Dimension vector: $(1,1,1)$.\n\n3.  **Other Simple Module:**\n    *   $S_2$: The simple module at vertex 2. Representation: $0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$. Dimension vector: $(0,1,0)$.\n\nSo, the set of indecomposable modules is $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, I_1, I_2, S_2\\}$. Note that $P_1$ is both projective and injective.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Auslander-Reiten (AR) Quiver and $\\tau$-orbits**\n\nFor the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_n$, the AR quiver has a triangular shape. For $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$, the AR quiver is:\n```\n      P_1(1,1,1)\n     /   \\\n   I_2(1,1,0) P_2(0,1,1)\n  /   \\ /   \\\nI_1(1,0,0) S_2(0,1,0) P_3(0,0,1)\n```\nThe Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$ acts on the non-projective indecomposable modules. From the AR sequences given by the meshes in the quiver, we have:\n*   $\\tau P_1 = S_2$\n*   $\\tau I_2 = I_1$\n*   $\\tau P_2 = P_3$\nThe modules $I_1, S_2, P_3$ are at the \"end\" of their respective $\\tau$-sequences (i.e., $\\tau I_1 = 0, \\tau S_2 = 0, \\tau P_3 = 0$). The $\\tau$-orbits are the sets of modules connected by $\\tau$ or $\\tau^{-1}$:\n*   Orbit 1: $\\{P_1, S_2\\}$\n*   Orbit 2: $\\{I_2, I_1\\}$\n*   Orbit 3: $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$\n\n**Step 3: Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules**\n\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module:** For a hereditary algebra like $A$, a module $T$ is a $\\tau$-tilting module (or simply a tilting module) if it is the direct sum of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable modules, say $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$, such that $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$.\n*   **Slice module:** A slice module is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a *slice* in the AR quiver. A slice is a set of indecomposable modules containing exactly one module from each $\\tau$-orbit.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Non-Slice Tilting Modules**\n\nA module is a slice module if its summands consist of one choice from each of the three orbits. Any other tilting module is not a slice. We are looking for a tilting module whose summands do not form a slice.\n\nLet's identify some tilting modules that are not slices:\n1.  $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$: The direct sum of all indecomposable projectives is always a tilting module. Its summands are $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$. This set contains one module from Orbit 1, zero from Orbit 2, and two from Orbit 3. Thus, $A$ is not a slice module.\n2.  $D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$: The direct sum of all indecomposable injectives is also a tilting module. Its summands are $\\{I_1, I_2, P_1\\}$. This set contains one module from Orbit 1, two from Orbit 2, and zero from Orbit 3. Thus, $D(A)$ is not a slice module.\n\nThere are other non-slice tilting modules (in total, there are 14 tilting modules and 8 slice modules for $A_3$, leaving 6 non-slice ones). The question asks for a *unique* such module, which implies there is a special property that distinguishes one of the non-slice tilting modules from the others.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Unique Property**\n\nLet's analyze the properties of the non-slice tilting modules. A common way to distinguish tilting modules is by their composition in terms of projective and injective summands. Let's examine the non-slice tilting modules we can construct.\nThe six non-slice tilting modules for this algebra are:\n1.  $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ (contains three projective summands)\n2.  $D(A) = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_1$ (contains one projective summand, $P_1$)\n3.  $P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus S_2$ (contains two projective summands, $P_1, P_2$)\n4.  $I_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ (contains two projective summands, $P_2, P_3$)\n5.  $I_2 \\oplus P_1 \\oplus S_2$ (contains one projective summand, $P_1$)\n6.  $I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$ (contains zero projective summands)\n\nLet's verify that $T = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$ is indeed a tilting module.\n*   $I_1$ and $I_2$ are injective, so $\\text{Ext}^1(M, I_1) = 0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(M, I_2) = 0$ for any module $M$. Also, $\\text{Ext}^1(I_1, M) = 0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(I_2, M) = 0$ as they are rigid (since they are injective).\n*   We only need to check $\\text{Ext}^1(S_2, S_2)$. For a hereditary algebra, $\\text{Ext}^1(X,Y) \\cong D\\text{Hom}(Y, \\tau X)$. Here, $\\tau S_2 = 0$, so $\\text{Ext}^1(S_2, S_2) = 0$.\nThus, $T = I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$ is a tilting module.\n\nNow, let's check if it's a slice module. Its summands are $\\{I_1, I_2, S_2\\}$.\n*   From Orbit 1 $\\{P_1, S_2\\}$, it contains $S_2$.\n*   From Orbit 2 $\\{I_2, I_1\\}$, it contains both $I_1$ and $I_2$.\n*   From Orbit 3 $\\{P_2, P_3\\}$, it contains none.\nSince it does not contain exactly one module from each orbit, it is not a slice module.\n\nFinally, let's check if this module is unique in some way. As shown in the list above, $I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$ is the **unique non-slice tilting module that has no projective summands**. All other five non-slice tilting modules contain at least one projective summand. This provides the uniqueness criterion.\n\nThe module is the direct sum of the simple module at vertex 1 ($S_1=I_1$), the injective module at vertex 2 ($I_2$), and the simple module at vertex 2 ($S_2$).\n\n<<<I_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2>>>"
