    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the most probable evolutionary mechanism that allows a duplicated gene to be kept in the genome (retention) and to evolve a different sequence/function from its original copy (divergence). After a gene is duplicated, one copy is typically redundant, meaning it's not under strong selective pressure and can be lost or inactivated without harming the organism. The question is about how both copies can be kept and become different.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"overwritten\" by the sequence of another homologous gene. This makes the two genes more similar (homogenized), which is the opposite of divergence. Therefore, gene conversion works against the long-term retention of two distinct genes. This choice is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. The redundant copy accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). While this involves divergence (the pseudogene's sequence changes), it does not result in the *retention* of two functional genes, which is a key part of the question. The organism is left with only one functional copy. This choice is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that lead to a completely new, beneficial function. Because the organism now benefits from both the old and the new function, natural selection favors the retention of both copies. This model explains both retention and divergence. It is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) applies when the original, ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in different tissues/times (i.e., it had multiple subfunctions). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that disable different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 might lose the ability to function in the liver, while copy 2 loses the ability to function in the kidney. Now, both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's tasks. This \"complementation\" ensures both copies are retained by selection. This model also explains both retention and divergence.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into many new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism at the molecular level that explains how a specific pair of duplicate genes is retained. It describes a species-level phenomenon, not a gene-level mechanism. This choice is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D):**\n\n    *   Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the primary accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the \"most likely\" one.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a relatively rare event: a mutation that creates a novel, beneficial function. This must happen before the redundant gene copy is lost through pseudogenization.\n    *   Subfunctionalization, in contrast, relies on much more common mutational events: degenerative, loss-of-function mutations. It provides a passive route to retention. As long as the two copies lose *different* parts of the original function, they both become indispensable.\n    *   Because the mutations required for subfunctionalization are far more frequent than those for neofunctionalization, many evolutionary biologists consider it a more probable or common initial step for preserving duplicate genes from being lost. It acts as a \"rescue\" mechanism that locks both copies into the genome, after which they can diverge further, potentially even leading to neofunctionalization later on.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Given that subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (loss-of-function) compared to the rare events (gain-of-new-function) required for neofunctionalization, it is often considered the more likely initial mechanism responsible for the retention of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
