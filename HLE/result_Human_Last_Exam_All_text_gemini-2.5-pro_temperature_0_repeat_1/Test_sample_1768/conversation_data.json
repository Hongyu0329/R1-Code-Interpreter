    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem and key information**\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`.\nThe most crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is translated into a protein. It begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since this sequence is from the middle, the correct reading frame must not contain any internal stop codons.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the possible reading frames and stop codons**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three possible forward reading frames:\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\nThe DNA stop codons are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`. We will check each frame for the presence of these codons.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each reading frame**\n\n*   **Frame 1 Analysis (starting from nucleotide 1):**\n    *   The sequence is grouped into codons as: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n    *   The fifth codon is `tag`, which is a stop codon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 is incorrect because it contains a premature stop codon.\n\n*   **Frame 2 Analysis (starting from nucleotide 2):**\n    *   The sequence is grouped into codons as: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    *   Scanning through all the codons in this frame reveals no stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, or `TGA`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is a valid open reading frame and is the likely correct frame.\n\n*   **Frame 3 Analysis (starting from nucleotide 3):**\n    *   The sequence is grouped into codons as: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa ...`\n    *   The eighth codon is `tga`, which is a stop codon.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 is incorrect because it contains a premature stop codon.\n\n**Step 4: Translate the correct reading frame (Frame 2) into a protein sequence**\nWe will now translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code and one-letter amino acid symbols.\n\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n*   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n*   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n*   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n*   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n*   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n*   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n*   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n*   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n*   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n*   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n*   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n*   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n*   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final protein sequence**\nBy combining the one-letter codes in order, we get the final protein sequence.\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLPYPN NLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
