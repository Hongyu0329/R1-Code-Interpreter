    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus. An allotrope is one of two or more different physical forms in which an element can exist. The key is to identify the main allotropes and their corresponding colors.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Allotropes of Phosphorus and Their Colors**\nPhosphorus exists in several different allotropic forms. The most common and well-characterized ones are:\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** When freshly prepared and in its purest state, this allotrope is a colorless or **white**, waxy solid. It is the molecular form P₄.\n    *   **Color 1: White**\n\n2.  **Yellow Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** White phosphorus is highly reactive and unstable. When exposed to light, it slowly undergoes a transformation, often forming a surface layer of red phosphorus. This change causes the white solid to appear **yellow**. While chemically it is still primarily P₄, \"yellow phosphorus\" is a distinct and commonly observed color for this allotrope. Therefore, it should be counted as a separate observable color.\n    *   **Color 2: Yellow**\n\n3.  **Red Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a polymeric form of phosphorus, meaning its atoms are linked together in a chain-like structure. It is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus. As its name indicates, its color is **red**. The exact shade can vary from orange to dark red depending on preparation conditions and particle size, but the fundamental color is red.\n    *   **Color 3: Red**\n\n4.  **Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a specific crystalline, polymeric form of phosphorus. It is obtained by slowly cooling molten lead in which phosphorus has been dissolved, or by heating red phosphorus in a sealed tube at high temperatures. Its characteristic color is **violet** or a deep reddish-violet.\n    *   **Color 4: Violet**\n\n5.  **Black Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most thermodynamically stable and least reactive allotrope of phosphorus at room temperature and pressure. It has a layered, crystalline structure similar to graphite. It is **black** and flaky with a metallic luster.\n    *   **Color 5: Black**\n\n**Step 3: Summarize and Count the Distinct Colors**\nBy analyzing the different allotropes and their common appearances, we have identified the following distinct colors:\n1.  White (from pure white phosphorus)\n2.  Yellow (from white phosphorus exposed to light)\n3.  Red (from red phosphorus)\n4.  Violet (from violet/Hittorf's phosphorus)\n5.  Black (from black phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors gives a total of 5.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms that there are five well-established and observable colors for the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n<<<5>>>"
