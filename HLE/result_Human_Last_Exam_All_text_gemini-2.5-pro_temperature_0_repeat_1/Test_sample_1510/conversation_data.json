    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct mathematical groups that describe all possible repeating patterns in a two-dimensional plane. They are also known as the plane crystallographic groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the point group is the group of symmetries (rotations and reflections) that leave a specific point fixed. It is obtained by \"factoring out\" the translational symmetries. There are 10 possible point groups in two dimensions.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups (out of the 17) for which the corresponding point group has exactly 2 elements (i.e., an order of 2).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Point Groups of Order 2**\n\nFirst, we list the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders:\n\n| Point Group (Schönflies) | Point Group (Hermann-Mauguin) | Order | Symmetries |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| C1 | 1 | 1 | Identity only |\n| **C2** | **2** | **2** | **180° rotation** |\n| C3 | 3 | 3 | 120° rotation |\n| C4 | 4 | 4 | 90° rotation |\n| C6 | 6 | 6 | 60° rotation |\n| **D1** | **m** | **2** | **One reflection** |\n| D2 | 2mm | 4 | Two perpendicular reflections |\n| D3 | 3m | 6 | Three reflections, 120° rotation |\n| D4 | 4mm | 8 | Four reflections, 90° rotation |\n| D6 | 6mm | 12 | Six reflections, 60° rotation |\n\nFrom this table, we can see that there are two distinct point groups of order 2:\n1.  **C2 (or 2):** Contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n2.  **D1 (or m):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\n**Step 3: Find Wallpaper Groups Associated with Each Point Group of Order 2**\n\nNow, we need to go through the list of the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of either C2 or D1.\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group C2 (2):**\n    There is only one wallpaper group whose point group consists of just a 180° rotation.\n    1.  **p2**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups with Point Group D1 (m):**\n    There are three wallpaper groups whose point group consists of a single reflection. These groups differ in their lattice type (primitive vs. centered) and whether the reflection is a pure reflection or a glide reflection.\n    1.  **pm:** Contains reflection lines.\n    2.  **pg:** Contains glide-reflection lines but no pure reflection lines.\n    3.  **cm:** Contains both reflection and glide-reflection lines, based on a centered lattice.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Total Number of Wallpaper Groups**\n\nBy adding up the counts from Step 3, we can find the total number of wallpaper groups that satisfy the condition.\n\n*   Number of groups with point group C2 = 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group D1 = 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n\nTotal number = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinction between Wallpaper and Point Groups:** The question is about the number of *wallpaper groups*, not the number of *point groups*. There are only 2 point groups of order 2, but these correspond to 4 different wallpaper groups.\n2.  **Isomorphism vs. Geometric Action:** The point groups C2 and D1 are mathematically isomorphic (both are the cyclic group of order 2), but they represent different geometric actions (rotation vs. reflection). The classification of wallpaper groups distinguishes between them.\n3.  **Glide Reflections:** The wallpaper group `pg` has a point group `D1` (or `m`). Even though its fundamental symmetry is a glide reflection, the point group only considers the \"macroscopic\" symmetry at a point, which is equivalent to a simple reflection. The translational component of the glide is ignored when determining the point group.\n4.  **Completeness:** Ensure all 17 wallpaper groups are implicitly considered and correctly categorized to be certain that none are missed or misclassified. The standard classification confirms that the groups listed (p2, pm, pg, cm) are the only ones with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
