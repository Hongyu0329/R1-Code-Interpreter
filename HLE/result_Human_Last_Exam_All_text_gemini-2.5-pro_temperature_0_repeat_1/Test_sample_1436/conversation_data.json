    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Diagram's Topology**\n\n*   **Vertices:** The diagram has two vertices. Let's label them $v_1$ and $v_2$. In a typical quantum field theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex represents an interaction point where four field lines meet.\n*   **Field Contractions:** There are four field contractions. A field contraction corresponds to a propagator, which is represented by a line in the Feynman diagram.\n*   **Connecting the Components:** The problem describes a diagram with two vertices and four lines. For a connected diagram, the only possible topology is that all four lines connect vertex $v_1$ to vertex $v_2$. This creates a diagram that looks like two points with four parallel arches connecting them. This is a type of vacuum bubble diagram.\n\n**2. Identifying the Symmetries of the Diagram**\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be rearranged without changing the diagram's overall structure (its topology). We need to identify all such symmetry operations.\n\n*   **Symmetry from Permuting Lines:**\n    The four lines connecting vertex $v_1$ and $v_2$ are identical. They represent four identical propagators. We can swap any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram remains unchanged. The number of ways to permute four distinct objects is given by the factorial of 4.\n    *   Number of line permutations = $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n*   **Symmetry from Permuting Vertices:**\n    The two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$, are also identical. They represent the same type of interaction from the Lagrangian. We can swap the positions (or labels) of $v_1$ and $v_2$, and the diagram's structure is preserved. The four lines that connected $v_1$ to $v_2$ will now connect $v_2$ to $v_1$, which is the same configuration.\n    *   Number of vertex permutations = $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Total Symmetry Factor**\n\nThe total symmetry factor $S$ is the product of the number of possible symmetry operations from all independent sources of symmetry.\n\n*   $S = (\\text{Number of line permutations}) \\times (\\text{Number of vertex permutations})$\n*   $S = 4! \\times 2$\n*   $S = 24 \\times 2 = 48$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Interpretation of the Diagram:** The description \"two vertices and four field contractions\" must be correctly translated into a diagram. The interpretation of four propagators connecting the two vertices is the most direct and standard one for a connected diagram.\n2.  **All Sources of Symmetry:** It is crucial to identify all possible symmetries. In this case, they are the permutations of identical lines and the permutations of identical vertices. If there were lines connecting a vertex to itself (tadpoles), that would be another source of symmetry.\n3.  **Independence of Symmetries:** The permutation of lines and the permutation of vertices are independent operations. Therefore, the total number of symmetry operations is the product of the number of operations of each type.\n4.  **Relation to Perturbative Expansion:** This result can be confirmed by analyzing the perturbative expansion of the Green's function. For a $\\phi^4$ theory, this diagram arises from the second-order term $(\\frac{1}{2!}) (\\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!})^2$. The number of ways to form the four propagators between the vertices via Wick contractions is $4!$. The overall numerical factor in front of the diagram's integral becomes $\\frac{1}{2!} \\frac{1}{(4!)^2} \\times 4! = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 4!} = \\frac{1}{48}$. Since the diagram's value is proportional to $1/S$, this confirms that $S=48$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe symmetry factor is calculated by multiplying the number of ways identical lines can be permuted ($4!$) by the number of ways identical vertices can be permuted (2).\n\n$S = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
