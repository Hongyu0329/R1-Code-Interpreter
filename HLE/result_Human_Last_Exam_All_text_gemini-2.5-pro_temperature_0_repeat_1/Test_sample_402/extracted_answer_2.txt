Perform an initial differential expression (DE) analysis comparing the CAR-IL15 group against the CAR-only group (using CAR-only as the reference). From the resulting table of all genes, use a command-line tool like `awk` to create a list of genes that have a very large negative log2 fold change (e.g., less than -5), as these represent the cancer cell contaminants present only in the CAR-only samples. Use this gene list with `grep -v -f` to filter out and remove these contaminant genes from the original raw count matrix. Finally, re-run the entire DE analysis pipeline from the beginning using this newly created clean count matrix to obtain accurate and unbiased results.
