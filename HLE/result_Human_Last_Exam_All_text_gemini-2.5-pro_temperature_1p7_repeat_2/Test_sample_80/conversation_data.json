    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Edge Squares:**\n    *   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid.\n    *   Edge squares are the squares on the perimeter of the board.\n    *   There are 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom, 8 on the left file, and 8 on the right file.\n    *   To find the total number of unique edge squares, we add the squares on all four sides and subtract the 4 corner squares that were counted twice: (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\n    *   So, there are **28** edge squares in total.\n\n2.  **Understand the Bishop's Movement and Constraints:**\n    *   The goal is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares.\n    *   The constraint is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks any square along the same diagonal.\n    *   This means no two bishops can be placed on the same diagonal line.\n\n3.  **Utilize the Color Property of Bishops:**\n    *   A crucial property of bishops is that they always stay on the squares of their starting color. A bishop on a light square can only attack other squares of the same color, and a bishop on a dark square can only attack other dark squares.\n    *   This allows us to break the problem into two independent sub-problems: one for light-colored edge squares and one for dark-colored edge squares.\n    *   On a standard board, half the squares are light and half are dark. Since there are 28 edge squares, there must be **14 light edge squares** and **14 dark edge squares**.\n\n4.  **Analyze One Color (e.g., Light Squares):**\n    *   We need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the 14 light edge squares.\n    *   We can do this by identifying all the light edge squares that lie on the same diagonals.\n    *   The light edge squares are: b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, h3, h5, h7, a8, c8, e8, g8.\n    *   Let's group them by the diagonals they share:\n        *   The square `h1` and `a8` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `f1` and `a6` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `d1` and `a4` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `b1` and `a2` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `h3` and `c8` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `h5` and `e8` are on the same diagonal.\n        *   The square `h7` and `g8` are on the same diagonal.\n    *   We have found 7 pairs of squares, and these pairs cover all 14 light edge squares. Since we can only place one bishop per pair (as they are on the same diagonal), the maximum number of bishops we can place on the light squares is **7**.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Second Color (Dark Squares):**\n    *   The chessboard is symmetrical. The problem for the 14 dark edge squares is identical to the one for the light squares.\n    *   We will find 7 pairs of dark edge squares that share diagonals (e.g., a1 and h8, c1 and h6, etc.).\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the dark squares is also **7**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Number of Bishops:**\n    *   Since the two color groups are independent, we can add the results.\n    *   Total maximum bishops = (Max bishops on light squares) + (Max bishops on dark squares)\n    *   Total maximum bishops = 7 + 7 = **14**.\n\n7.  **Answer the Question:**\n    *   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops (i.e., be empty).\n    *   Total number of edge squares = 28\n    *   Number of placed bishops = 14\n    *   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Placed bishops\n    *   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   Correctly counting the total number of unique edge squares (28, not 32).\n*   Remembering the core constraint: no two bishops on the same diagonal.\n*   Leveraging the color separation of bishops is the key to simplifying the problem.\n*   Systematically pairing up all the edge squares of a single color that attack each other to find the maximum placement for that color.\n*   Ensuring the final answer addresses what the question asks for (empty squares), not the number of bishops placed.\n\nThe final answer is the number of edge squares left empty after placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
