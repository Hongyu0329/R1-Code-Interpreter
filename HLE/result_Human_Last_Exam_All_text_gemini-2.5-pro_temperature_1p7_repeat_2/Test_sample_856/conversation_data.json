    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object:** We are looking for closed, orientable 3-manifolds. \"Closed\" means compact and without boundary. \"Orientable\" means it has a consistent notion of \"handedness\". Let's call such a manifold $M$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Condition:** The defining property of $M$ is that its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$, has a specific finite cardinality (order): $|\\pi_1(M)| = 10!$.\n\n3.  **Connect Manifold Structure to the Fundamental Group:**\n    *   **Prime Decomposition:** Every closed, orientable 3-manifold $M$ can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime 3-manifolds: $M = M_1 \\# M_2 \\# \\dots \\# M_k$. The fundamental group of a connected sum is the free product of the fundamental groups of its components: $\\pi_1(M) = \\pi_1(M_1) * \\pi_1(M_2) * \\dots * \\pi_1(M_k)$.\n    *   **Finite Fundamental Group Implication:** The free product of two or more non-trivial groups is always an infinite group. Since we are given that $|\\pi_1(M)| = 10!$ is finite, at most one of the groups $\\pi_1(M_i)$ can be non-trivial. The other fundamental groups must be trivial, which means the corresponding manifolds $M_j$ are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere $S^3$ (by the Poincaré Conjecture).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The manifold $M$ must be prime (it cannot be decomposed into a non-trivial connected sum).\n\n4.  **Classify Prime Manifolds with Finite Fundamental Groups:**\n    *   **Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture (proven by G. Perelman):** This monumental result provides the classification framework. It states that any prime, closed, orientable 3-manifold has a geometric structure.\n    *   For a manifold $M$ with a finite fundamental group, its universal cover must be compact. The only compact, simply connected 3-manifold is the 3-sphere $S^3$.\n    *   Therefore, $M$ must be of the form $S^3 / \\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is a finite group of isometries of $S^3$ that acts freely (no element other than the identity has a fixed point). Such manifolds are known as **spherical space forms**.\n    *   The fundamental group of such a manifold is precisely the group of isometries: $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\Gamma$.\n\n5.  **Translate the Problem into Group Theory:** The original question is now equivalent to: \"How many non-homeomorphic manifolds $M=S^3/\\Gamma$ exist, where $\\Gamma$ is a group of order $10!$ that can act freely on $S^3$?\" For now, let's focus on whether any such group $\\Gamma$ exists at all.\n\n6.  **Conditions for a Group to Act Freely on S³:** A finite group $\\Gamma$ can act freely and orientably on $S^3$ if and only if it satisfies specific, highly restrictive conditions. These conditions are often called the **Zassenhaus conditions**:\n    *   For any prime $p$, every subgroup of $\\Gamma$ of order $p^2$ must be cyclic.\n    *   For any prime $p$, every subgroup of $\\Gamma$ of order $2p$ must be cyclic.\n\n7.  **Test the Conditions for a Group of Order 10!:**\n    *   Let $\\Gamma$ be a hypothetical group with $|\\Gamma| = 10!$.\n    *   The order is $10! = 3,628,800$.\n    *   Let's check the condition for subgroups of order $2p$ with $p=3$. This condition states that any subgroup of order $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$ must be cyclic.\n    *   There are only two groups of order 6, up to isomorphism: the cyclic group $C_6$ and the symmetric group $S_3$. The condition implies that $\\Gamma$ **cannot contain any subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$**.\n\n8.  **Look for an Obstruction:** Does every group of order $10!$ necessarily contain a subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$?\n    *   Let's analyze the most natural group of order $10!$, the symmetric group $S_{10}$. It certainly contains $S_3$ as a subgroup (e.g., the permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$). Thus, $S_{10}$ cannot be the fundamental group of a spherical 3-manifold.\n    *   Let's check the other Zassenhaus condition for $S_{10}$. Let $p=3$. The condition says any subgroup of order $3^2=9$ must be cyclic. Consider the permutations $g_1 = (1\\ 2\\ 3)$ and $g_2 = (4\\ 5\\ 6)$ in $S_{10}$. Since they operate on disjoint sets of elements, they commute. The subgroup they generate, $\\langle g_1, g_2 \\rangle$, is isomorphic to $C_3 \\times C_3$. This subgroup has order 9 but is not cyclic. This is another reason why $S_{10}$ fails the test.\n    *   The crucial question is whether *every* group of order $10!$ must fail this test. Let's return to the $S_3$ subgroup condition.\n    *   A group of order $10!$ is very large and complex. It is a deep result in group theory that such a group must contain subgroups like $S_3$. To illustrate, by Cauchy's Theorem, any group of order $10!$ must contain elements of order 2 and 3. Let $x$ be an element of order 2 and $y$ an element of order 3. If $xy \\neq yx$, then the subgroup $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ is non-abelian. If it happens to be that $x$ conjugates $y$ to its inverse ($xyx^{-1} = y^{-1}$), then $\\langle x, y \\rangle \\cong S_3$. It is a fact that a group with the structure of $\\Gamma$ cannot avoid such configurations. Any group $\\Gamma$ with order $10!$ has a composition factor isomorphic to the alternating group $A_n$ for some $n \\ge 5$, and $A_n$ (for $n \\ge 4$) contains $S_3$ as a section, which implies $\\Gamma$ itself must contain a section isomorphic to $S_3$. For finite groups, having a section isomorphic to $S_3$ implies having a subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:** Since any group $\\Gamma$ of order $10!$ must contain a subgroup isomorphic to $S_3$, no group of order $10!$ can satisfy the condition that all its subgroups of order 6 are cyclic. Therefore, no group of order $10!$ can act freely on the 3-sphere $S^3$. This means no such manifold $M$ can exist.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of such manifolds is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
