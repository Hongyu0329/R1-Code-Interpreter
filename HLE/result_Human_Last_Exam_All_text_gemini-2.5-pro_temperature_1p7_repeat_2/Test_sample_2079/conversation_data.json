    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the judge of Bártfa in 1461.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Role of a \"Judge\" in a Medieval Town**\nIn the context of a medieval Royal Free Town like Bártfa (German: Bartfeld, Slovak: Bardejov) within the Kingdom of Hungary, the term \"judge\" (Latin: *judex*; German: *Richter*) did not refer to a judicial officer in the modern sense. Instead, it was the title for the chief magistrate of the town, equivalent to a mayor. This was the highest elected official, responsible for heading the town council and overseeing its administration.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Historical Context of Bártfa in 1461**\nIn the 15th century, Bártfa was a prosperous and important trading town, populated largely by German settlers. Its administrative records were often kept meticulously. The year 1461 falls within the reign of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The administration of these towns was well-organized, and the annual election of the judge was a significant event.\n\n**Step 3: Locate Relevant Historical Sources**\nTo find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult historical records. The most reliable sources for this information are:\n*   **Town chronicles and archives:** The archives of Bardejov (specifically the *Štátny archív v Prešove, pobočka Bardejov* - State Archive in Prešov, Bardejov branch) hold the official town books (*Stadtbücher*) which list the names of council members and judges year by year.\n*   **Academic publications:** Historians who have studied the history of Bardejov or medieval administration in Hungary often publish lists of officials compiled from these primary sources.\n\n**Step 4: Search for the Specific Information for 1461**\nBy examining scholarly works and summaries of the Bardejov town archives, we can find the list of judges for the 15th century. These records show the names of the *judex* or *Richter* for each year.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Individual**\nAccording to historical records compiled from the town's administrative books, the person who held the office of judge in Bártfa in the year 1461 was **Jakub Guldener**. He was a prominent merchant and citizen who served in various municipal roles, including judge, multiple times during his life.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Name Spelling:** Historical names from this region can have multiple spellings (German, Hungarian, Slovak, or Latinized versions). Jakub Guldener may also appear as Jakob Guldener or Guldner.\n*   **Term of Office:** The judge was typically elected for a one-year term, so it is important to verify the specific year.\n*   **Primary Source Reliability:** The information is most reliable when it comes directly from transcribed town records, which have been cross-verified by historians.\n\nBy following these steps and considering these points, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<Jakub Guldener>>>"
