    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who?** A Christian theologian.\n    *   **Did what?** Developed specialized terminology.\n    *   **To describe what?** Changes in the laws of nature.\n    *   **Applicable to what specific events?**\n        1.  The virgin birth of Jesus.\n        2.  Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall of man.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Laws of Nature:** In a theological context, these are typically understood as the regular, consistent, and observable ways God upholds and governs the universe. They are the secondary causes through which God normally works.\n    *   **Changes in the Laws of Nature:** This is a crucial distinction. The question is not just about miracles (which are often described as *suspensions* of or *exceptions* to natural law), but about a framework that allows for the laws *themselves* to be altered.\n    *   **The Fall:** The idea that the Fall of Adam and Eve had physical consequences for the entire created order (e.g., introducing death, decay, thorns, and thistles) implies that the \"laws of nature\" might have been fundamentally different before this event.\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** This is a classic example of a miracle, an event that goes against the normal, observable laws of biology.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430):** A foundational thinker on miracles and providence. He argued that miracles are not \"against nature,\" but \"against nature *as we know it*.\" He believed God placed \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*) within creation, which are hidden potentials that God can activate at any time. While innovative, this isn't about *changing* the laws but fulfilling their deeper, hidden potential.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274):** Aquinas made careful distinctions, describing miracles as events happening *praeter naturam* (outside the order of nature). God, as the primary cause, can act directly without the secondary causes (natural laws) He established. This is a framework for God acting *apart from* the laws, but not for permanently *altering* them.\n    *   **B. B. Warfield (1851–1921):** A key Princeton theologian who defended miracles against modern skepticism. He described miracles as \"supra-natural\" (above nature), where the supernatural power of God introduces a new and sufficient cause into the sequence of natural events. This explains specific events like the virgin birth very well, but his framework doesn't focus on developing terminology for a permanent *alteration* of the cosmic legal structure due to the Fall.\n\n4.  **Identify the Theologian with the Specific Terminology:**\n    *   **Norman Geisler (1932–2019):** A prolific 20th and 21st-century systematic theologian and apologist. Geisler explicitly addressed the relationship between God's actions and natural law, particularly in his multi-volume *Systematic Theology*. He is noted for developing a precise vocabulary to handle these issues.\n\n5.  **Examine Geisler's Terminology:**\n    *   Geisler defines \"natural law\" as the uniform and regular way God acts to sustain the universe.\n    *   He introduces the specific concept of a **\"reordering\"** of the laws of nature.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** He uses this \"reordering\" concept to explain how the natural order could have been fundamentally changed after the Fall. He posits that God may have instituted one set of natural laws at creation (e.g., a world without decay or animal death) and then *reordered* them after humanity's sin to introduce the conditions we see today. This directly addresses the idea of an alteration in natural law at the Fall.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** While a miracle is a specific, non-repeatable event, it fits within his system as a supernatural act where God temporarily intervenes or \"reorders\" the normal biological process by introducing a direct, new cause (the creative work of the Holy Spirit).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile many theologians have discussed miracles and natural law, Norman Geisler is the one who most clearly and systematically developed the specific terminology of a **\"reordering\"** of natural law and applied it as a potential explanation for both the cosmic consequences of the Fall and the nature of specific miracles like the virgin birth.\n\n<<<Norman Geisler>>>"
