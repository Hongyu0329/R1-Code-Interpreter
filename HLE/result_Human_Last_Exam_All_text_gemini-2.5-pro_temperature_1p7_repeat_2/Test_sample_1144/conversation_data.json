    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the required ratio.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, i.e., calculate $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$).\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Required Physical Constants:**\n*   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n*   Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit), $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n*   **Principle:** We use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least $\\hbar/2$.\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n*   **Calculation:** To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Point:** This formula gives the minimum possible uncertainty in momentum for a given uncertainty in position.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the momentum of the electron ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit.**\n*   **Principle:** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized:\n    $L = m_e v r_n = n\\hbar$\n    where $m_e$ is the electron mass, $v$ is its velocity, and $r_n$ is the orbit's radius.\n*   **Derivation:** The linear momentum of the electron is $p = m_e v$. Substituting this into the quantization condition, we get:\n    $p \\cdot r_n = n\\hbar$\n    So, the momentum is $p = \\frac{n\\hbar}{r_n}$.\n*   **For the first Bohr orbit:** We have $n=1$, and the radius is the Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0$.\n    Therefore, the momentum is $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{a_0} = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** This momentum is a theoretical value from the semi-classical Bohr model, which is distinct from the uncertainty in momentum derived from quantum mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n*   **Formulation:** We set up the ratio using the expressions derived in Step 1 and Step 2.\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0} \\right)}$\n*   **Simplification:** We can simplify this expression by canceling out the reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar$.\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{a_0}{\\hbar} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Point:** This algebraic simplification is very useful as it eliminates the need to use the value of $\\hbar$ in the final calculation, reducing potential rounding errors.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the known values and compute the final answer.**\n*   **Values:**\n    *   Bohr radius, $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10}{20} = \\frac{52.9}{20}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n*   **Careful Point:** Ensure that the units for $a_0$ and $\\Delta x$ are the same (e.g., both in meters or both in picometers) before taking the ratio. The final result is a dimensionless number.\n\n---\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is approximately 2.645.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
