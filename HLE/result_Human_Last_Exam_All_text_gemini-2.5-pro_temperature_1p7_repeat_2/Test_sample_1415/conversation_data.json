    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Define the Functions**\n\nFirst, let's explicitly write down the function `F₃(x)` by substituting the definitions of `F₀`, `F₁`, and `F₂`.\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**2. Analyze the Integral**\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx`\n\nThis integral is in a standard form `∫ (u'/u) dx`, where `u = F₃(x)`. The antiderivative of this form is `ln|u|`.\n\n*   Let `u = F₃(x)`.\n*   Then `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\n*   The indefinite integral is `∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C = ln|F₃(x)| + C`.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral using the limits of integration 0 and 1.\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nUsing the property of logarithms `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this becomes:\n`V = ln( |F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)| )`\n\n**4. Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)**\n\nNow we need to find the values of `F₃(x)` at `x=1` and `x=0`.\n\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    *   `sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `e^(sin(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n    *   Since `ln(2) ≈ 0.693 > 0`, we have `|F₃(0)| = F₃(0) = ln(2)`.\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    *   `sin(1)` (Note: The argument is 1 radian, not 1 degree)\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   Since `0 < 1 < π/2`, `sin(1)` is positive. `e^(sin(1))` is therefore greater than `e^0 = 1`. This means `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`, and `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2) > 0`.\n    *   Thus, `F₃(1)` is positive, and `|F₃(1)| = F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Value V**\n\nNow substitute these values back into the expression for V:\n`V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )`\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe need a calculator to find the numerical value of V. Ensure the calculator is in radian mode.\n\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147098 ≈ 2.319777`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.319777`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319777) ≈ 1.200922`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693147`\n*   `V = ln(1.200922 / 0.693147) ≈ ln(1.73255)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.549608`\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.549608 = 5496.08`\n*   The closest integer to `5496.08` is `5496`.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   Correctly identified the integral form `∫(u'/u)`.\n*   Correctly applied the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n*   Correctly evaluated `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)`.\n*   Used radians for the trigonometric function `sin(1)`.\n*   Verified that the arguments of the logarithms are positive, so absolute values are not needed.\n*   Used correct logarithm properties for simplification.\n*   Performed the final numerical calculation accurately and rounded to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis is complete and the result is consistent.\n\n<<<5496>>>"
