    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge**\n\nThe vector field is given by `n = (nx, ny, nz)` where:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n`nx =  sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny =  sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz =  cos(G)`\n\nFirst, we can verify that `n` is a unit vector field, i.e., `nx² + ny² + nz² = 1`.\n`sin²(G)cos²(f) + sin²(G)sin²(f) + cos²(G) = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`.\nThis means the vector field `n(x,y,z)` defines a map from the 3D space R³ to the 2D sphere S².\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological integer that characterizes such maps from S³ to S². To apply this concept, we need our map to be defined on S³, which is the one-point compactification of R³. This requires the field `n` to approach a constant value as `(x,y,z) -> ∞`.\n\nLet's check the behavior at infinity:\nAs `sqrt(x²+y²+z²) -> ∞`, the term `r2` also goes to infinity.\nThen `G = PI * exp(-10*r2)` approaches `PI * exp(-∞) = 0`.\nSo, as `(x,y,z) -> ∞`:\n`nx -> sin(0)cos(f) = 0`\n`ny -> sin(0)sin(f) = 0`\n`nz -> cos(0) = 1`\nThe field `n` approaches the constant vector `(0, 0, 1)` (the North Pole of S²) at infinity. This condition is met, so we can calculate the Hopf charge.\n\n**2. Method of Calculation: Linking Number of Preimages**\n\nWhile the Whitehead formula `H = (1 / (4π²)) ∫ A ⋅ (∇ × A) dV` exists, it is often complicated to use directly, especially when singularities are present in the coordinate system (like `f = atan2(y,x)` on the z-axis).\n\nA more intuitive and robust method is to calculate the linking number of the preimages of two regular values on the target sphere S². The Hopf charge `H` is equal to this linking number:\n`H = Link(n⁻¹(p₁), n⁻¹(p₂))`\nwhere `p₁` and `p₂` are two distinct points on S².\n\n**3. Finding the Preimages**\n\nLet's choose two convenient points on S²: the South Pole and a point on the Equator.\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole, `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`:**\n    We need to find the set of points `(x,y,z)` where `n(x,y,z) = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    `nz = cos(G) = -1` => `G = π` (since `0 ≤ G ≤ π`).\n    `nx = sin(π)cos(f) = 0` and `ny = sin(π)sin(f) = 0`, which are consistent.\n    Now we solve for `G = π`:\n    `π * exp(-10*r2) = π`\n    `exp(-10*r2) = 1`\n    `-10*r2 = 0` => `r2 = 0`.\n    From the definition of `r2`:\n    `sqrt((x²+y²-0.5)² + z²) = 0`.\n    This implies `z=0` and `x²+y²-0.5 = 0`.\n    So, the preimage `C₁ = n⁻¹(p₁)` is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5` in the `z=0` plane. This is a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Preimage of an Equator point, `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)`:**\n    We need `n(x,y,z) = (1, 0, 0)`.\n    `nz = cos(G) = 0` => `G = π/2`.\n    `ny = sin(π/2)sin(f) = sin(f) = 0`.\n    `nx = sin(π/2)cos(f) = cos(f) = 1`.\n    `sin(f)=0` and `cos(f)=1` implies `f = 0` (or `2kπ`).\n    `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` means `y=0` and `x > 0`. So the preimage must lie in the positive x-z half-plane.\n    Now we solve for `G = π/2`:\n    `π * exp(-10*r2) = π/2`\n    `exp(-10*r2) = 1/2`\n    `-10*r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)`\n    `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    Let's square this: `r2² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n    Substituting the definition of `r2²` and `y=0`:\n    `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n    This is the equation of a closed loop `C₂ = n⁻¹(p₂)` in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane.\n\n**4. Calculating the Linking Number**\n\nWe need to find `Link(C₁, C₂)`. `C₁` is a circle in the `xy`-plane. `C₂` is a loop in the `xz`-plane. The linking number can be found by counting how many times `C₂` pierces the disk `D₁` bounded by `C₁`.\n\n*   The disk `D₁` is given by `x² + y² ≤ 0.5, z=0`.\n*   The loop `C₂` pierces the plane `z=0` at points where its `z` coordinate is zero. From the equation of `C₂`:\n    `(x² - 0.5)² + 0² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n    `x² - 0.5 = ± ln(2)/10`\n    `x² = 0.5 ± ln(2)/10`.\n    Since `x>0` for `C₂`, we find two piercing points on the x-axis:\n    `P_a = (sqrt(0.5 + ln(2)/10), 0, 0)`\n    `P_b = (sqrt(0.5 - ln(2)/10), 0, 0)`\n\n*   Now we check if these piercing points are inside the disk `D₁` (i.e., if `x²+y² ≤ 0.5`).\n    For `P_a`, `x² = 0.5 + ln(2)/10 > 0.5`. This point is outside the disk `D₁`.\n    For `P_b`, `x² = 0.5 - ln(2)/10 < 0.5`. This point is inside the disk `D₁`.\n    Therefore, the loop `C₂` pierces the disk `D₁` exactly once, at point `P_b`. This means the linking number must be `+1` or `-1`.\n\n*   To find the sign, we need the orientation of the curves. Let's orient the disk `D₁` with its normal vector pointing in the `+z` direction. By the right-hand rule, this corresponds to a counter-clockwise orientation for the boundary circle `C₁`. The linking number will be `+1` if `C₂` pierces `D₁` in the `+z` direction, and `-1` if it pierces in the `-z` direction.\n\n*   Let's find the direction of `C₂` at the piercing point `P_b`. We can parameterize `C₂`: Let `R = ln(2)/10`.\n    `x² - 0.5 = R cos(t)` => `x = sqrt(0.5 + R cos(t))`\n    `z = R sin(t)`\n    The piercing point `P_b` has `x = sqrt(0.5 - R)`, which corresponds to `cos(t)=-1`, so `t=π`.\n    The velocity vector of the curve has a z-component `dz/dt = R cos(t)`.\n    At `t=π`, `dz/dt = R cos(π) = -R`.\n    Since `R = ln(2)/10` is positive, `dz/dt` is negative. This means the loop `C₂` is moving in the `-z` direction as it pierces the disk `D₁`.\n\n*   Since the piercing direction (`-z`) is opposite to the disk's normal (`+z`), the intersection index is -1.\n*   The linking number is the sum of all intersection indices, which in this case is just -1.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` is equal to the linking number of the preimages.\n`H = Link(C₁, C₂) = -1`.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{-1}$.\n<<< -1 >>>"
