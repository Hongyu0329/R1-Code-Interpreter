    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB Cash Game. This is the standard stack depth, so typical strategies apply.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful preflop position. You are last to act on every postflop street, which gives you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to play the widest range of hands profitably.\n    *   **Action:** Open to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size.\n    *   **Environment:** Rake-Free. This is a critical detail. Rake is the fee the cardroom takes from each pot. In a rake-free environment, the profitability of opening marginal hands increases because you get to keep 100% of the pot when the blinds fold. This incentivizes opening an even wider range than usual.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the \"worst\" suited Jack that is still a standard, profitable open. \"Worst\" means the hand with the lowest expected value (EV) among all suited Jacks that you *should* still open.\n\n2.  **Identify and Rank All Suited Jack Hands:**\n    The possible suited Jack hands, in descending order of general strength, are:\n    *   JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs (Premium and very strong Broadway/suited connector hands)\n    *   J9s, J8s, J7s (Strong suited gappers with good playability)\n    *   J6s, J5s (Medium-strength suited hands, still very playable from the button)\n    *   J4s, J3s, J2s (The weakest suited Jacks, with poor connectivity and a low kicker)\n\n    The ranking is based on high-card strength, connectivity (ability to make straights), and domination. JAs is the best because it can make the nut flush and the strongest top pair. JTs is a premium suited connector. As the second card gets lower (e.g., J5s, J4s...), the hand gets weaker.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Button's Opening Range Strategy:**\n    *   The button's goal is often to steal the blinds. With a standard 2.5x open, you risk 2.5 BB to win the 1.5 BB already in the pot.\n    *   Because of the huge positional advantage and the \"rake-free\" condition, a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy advises opening a very wide range of hands, often 45-50% or even more.\n    *   This opening range includes all suited Ax hands, most suited Kx, Qx, and Jx hands, as well as many other speculative hands.\n\n4.  **Determine the Opening Threshold for Suited Jacks:**\n    *   Hands like JTs through J7s are easy, mandatory opens from the button in any cash game.\n    *   Hands like J6s and J5s are also standard opens in almost all button opening ranges due to their flush potential and some straight possibilities.\n    *   The real question comes down to the weakest group: J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n    *   In a typical *raked* game, these weakest suited Jacks might be considered \"mixed strategies\" (meaning you open them only a percentage of the time) or even folds.\n    *   However, in a **rake-free** game, the profitability of stealing the blinds is higher. This pushes these borderline hands firmly into the \"must open\" category. Modern GTO solvers show that against standard blind defending ranges, all suited Jacks are profitable opens from the button in a rake-free environment.\n\n5.  **Conclusion: Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:**\n    *   Since a correct strategy is to open *all* suited Jack hands from JAs down to J2s in this scenario, the \"worst\" one you should open is simply the lowest-ranked hand in that category.\n    *   Comparing J4s, J3s, and J2s, the hand J2s is objectively the weakest. It has the lowest kicker and the largest gap, giving it the worst playability and straight potential. It is the suited Jack with the lowest EV that still remains a profitable open.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Rake-Free is Key:** If rake were present, the EV of opening marginal hands like J2s would drop, and it might become a fold. The absence of rake is the deciding factor that makes it a standard open.\n*   **Position is Everything:** This hand is only an open from the button (and possibly the cutoff). It would be a clear fold from any earlier position.\n*   **\"Worst\" vs. \"Fold\":** The question asks for the worst hand you *should open*, not a hand you should fold. This requires identifying the bottom of your opening range for that hand category.\n\nBased on this analysis, the weakest suited Jack that should be opened from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
