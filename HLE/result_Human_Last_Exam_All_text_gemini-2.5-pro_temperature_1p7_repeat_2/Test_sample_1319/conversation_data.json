    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Question's Constraints:** The question asks for the tallest *historical* mountain that is explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus. \"Historical\" means it must be a real, identifiable geographical location.\n\n2.  **Acknowledge the Excluded Mountain:** The primary and tallest mountain in the *Iliad* is **Mount Olympus**, the mythological home of the gods. It is a real mountain with an elevation of 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). As per the instructions, we will set this mountain aside.\n\n3.  **Identify All Other Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***: We must scan the epic for other named mountains.\n    *   **Mount Ida:** This mountain is central to the epic. Zeus often watches the Trojan War from its highest peak, Gargarus. It is located in the Troad, in modern-day Turkey. (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 8, Book 14).\n    *   **Mount Samothrace (modern name Fengari):** In Book 13, Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace.\" This is a real island and mountain in the Aegean Sea.\n    *   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera’s journey from Olympus takes her \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen\" and then \"from Athos she went on over the swelling sea.\" This is a famous mountain in Northern Greece.\n    *   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned primarily as the source of Achilles's powerful ash spear, which was cut from its peak. It is a real mountain in Thessaly, Greece. (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 16).\n    *   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2. The contingent from Maeonia (later Lydia) is described as coming from the land \"under snowy Tmolus.\" This is a real mountain range in western Turkey (modern Turkish: Bozdağlar).\n\n4.  **List the Candidates and Their Elevations:** Now we list the identified historical mountains and their modern, accepted elevations to compare them.\n    *   **Mount Tmolus** (modern peak Bozdağ): **2,159 meters** (7,083 ft)\n    *   **Mount Athos**: **2,033 meters** (6,670 ft)\n    *   **Mount Ida** (modern peak Kaz Dağı): **1,774 meters** (5,820 ft)\n    *   **Mount Pelion** (modern peak Pourianos Stavros): **1,624 meters** (5,328 ft)\n    *   **Mount Samothrace** (modern peak Fengari): **1,611 meters** (5,285 ft)\n\n5.  **Compare the Elevations and Determine the Tallest:**\n    *   Mount Tmolus: 2,159 m\n    *   Mount Athos: 2,033 m\n    *   Mount Ida: 1,774 m\n    *   Mount Pelion: 1,624 m\n    *   Mount Samothrace: 1,611 m\n\n    By comparing their heights, Mount Tmolus is the tallest among the candidates.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Mythical vs. Historical:** Ensure all mountains considered are real-world locations, as requested by the term \"historical.\" All the mountains listed above fit this criterion.\n*   **Specific vs. General Names:** The *Iliad* mentions \"the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen,\" which refers to a range like the Rhodope Mountains. However, \"Mount Tmolus\" is a specific named mountain (or range), which is a stronger candidate for the \"mountain mentioned\" in the question. Even so, the highest peak of the Rhodope Mountains (Golyam Perelik at 2,191 m) is only negligibly taller than Tmolus (2,159 m), and Tmolus is specifically named in the text.\n*   **Which Mount Ida?:** There are two famous Mount Idas in Greek myth. One is on Crete (Zeus's birthplace), and the other is near Troy. The context of the *Iliad* and the Trojan War makes it certain that the one being referred to is the Trojan Mount Ida.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of mountains named in the *Iliad* and a comparison of their real-world elevations, the tallest historical mountain mentioned after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
