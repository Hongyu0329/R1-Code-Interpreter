No. Polynucleotides are structurally distinct from polysaccharides. They differ in their monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds that link them (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds), and their overall backbone structure (sugar-phosphate backbone vs. a direct chain of sugar units).
