A filtering strategy to eliminate cancer gene contamination from the `CAR_only` samples involves a two-step command-line process performed on the differential expression results file (`DE_results.tsv`) where `CAR_IL15` is compared to `CAR_only`.

**Step 1: Identify and extract the list of contaminating genes.** Contaminating genes will be present in `CAR_only` samples but absent in `CAR_IL15` samples, resulting in a large negative log2 fold change (L2FC) and high statistical significance. Use `awk` to create a list of these genes by applying a stringent L2FC threshold (e.g., < -5) and a significance threshold (e.g., adjusted p-value < 0.05).
`awk -F'\t' 'NR > 1 && $3 < -5 && $7 < 0.05 {print $1}' DE_results.tsv > contaminant_gene_list.txt`
*(This assumes gene names are in column 1, L2FC in column 3, and adjusted p-value in column 7).*

**Step 2: Filter the main results file to remove the contaminating genes.** Use `grep` with the list generated in Step 1 to create a new, clean results file that excludes all the contaminating genes.
`grep -v -w -f contaminant_gene_list.txt DE_results.tsv > DE_results_filtered.tsv`

The resulting file, `DE_results_filtered.tsv`, is now cleaned of the specific contamination and can be used for downstream biological interpretation and analysis.
