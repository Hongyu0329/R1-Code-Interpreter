    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe main objective is to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$. To do this, we first need to find the value of $m$, which is defined as the number of stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$\nx'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n$$\n-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out a $-x$ from the expression:\n$$\n-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0\n$$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$:\n$$\n-x(x-1)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   $x = 0$\n*   $x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$, we can use the first derivative test. We analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at the equilibrium point.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium point is **stable** (it's an attractor).\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium point is **unstable** (it's a repeller).\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to analyze the behavior of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point (e.g., using a phase line diagram or higher-order derivatives).\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1\n$$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    Substitute $x=0$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    Substitute $x=1$ into $f'(x)$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, we must use another method. Let's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), the sign of $f(x)$ is:\n        $f(1.1) = -(1.1)(1.1 - 1)^2 = -(+)(+)^2 = \\text{negative}$.\n        Since $x' < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, meaning the flow is to the left (towards $x=1$).\n\n    *   For a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), the sign of $f(x)$ is:\n        $f(0.9) = -(0.9)(0.9 - 1)^2 = -(+)(-)^2 = \\text{negative}$.\n        Since $x' < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, meaning the flow is to the left (away from $x=1$).\n\n    The phase portrait around $x=1$ is `← (1) ←`. Trajectories approach from the right but move away on the left. This kind of equilibrium is called **semi-stable**. A semi-stable equilibrium is not considered stable.\n\n**4. Determine the value of $m$**\n\nWe are looking for the number of **stable** equilibrium points. Based on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\nSo, $m = 1$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe final step is to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$:\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$\n1 - 2^{4048}\n$$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
