The probability is the expected value of the integral of the random graphon function W over the unit square. Mathematically, it is expressed as E_F [ ∫_[0,1]∫_[0,1] W(x,y) dU(x)dU(y) ], where the expectation E_F is taken with respect to the random measure F that defines the distribution of W, and U is the uniform measure on [0,1].
