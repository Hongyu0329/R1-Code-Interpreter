    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, denoted as a(4).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` with n binary variables, which maps each of the `2^n` input combinations (minterms) to either 0 (OFF-set) or 1 (ON-set).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (e.g., `x1*x2'`, `x3`, etc.) that implies the function. This means for any input combination where the implicant is 1, the function `f` must also be 1. In a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a rectangular group of 1s (of size 2^k).\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be simplified further by removing any literal. In a K-map, this is a rectangular group of 1s that is not fully contained within any other single, larger rectangular group of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of n variables can have. The goal is to find `a(4)`.\n\n### Step 2: The Strategy for Maximizing Prime Implicants\n\nTo get a large number of prime implicants, we need to construct a function whose K-map representation has many \"maximal\" groups of 1s that cannot be expanded further. Intuitively, we want to avoid creating very large groups (which would reduce the number of PIs) and avoid having completely isolated 1s (which might not be the most efficient way to generate PIs).\n\nA known result in switching theory shows that the maximum number of PIs is achieved by a specific class of functions. The ON-set of such a function consists of all minterms having a Hamming weight of `k` and all minterms having a Hamming weight of `k+1`, for some integer `k`.\n\n*   Let `S_k^n` be the set of all minterms of `n` variables that have a Hamming weight of `k` (i.e., exactly `k` variables are uncomplemented, or their binary representation has `k` ones).\n*   The function `f` is defined by setting its ON-set to be `S_k^n U S_{k+1}^n`.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Prime Implicants for the Constructed Function\n\nLet's analyze the prime implicants of the function `f` with ON-set = `S_k^n U S_{k+1}^n`.\n\n1.  A prime implicant is formed by grouping adjacent minterms in the ON-set.\n2.  Two minterms are adjacent if their binary representations differ in exactly one position. This means one must have weight `w` and the other must have weight `w+1` or `w-1`.\n3.  In our chosen ON-set, adjacency only occurs between a minterm `m_k` from `S_k^n` and a minterm `m_{k+1}` from `S_{k+1}^n`. There are no adjacencies between minterms within `S_k^n` or within `S_{k+1}^n`.\n4.  Each adjacent pair `{m_k, m_{k+1}}` forms an implicant of `n-1` literals (a group of two).\n5.  This implicant is *prime* because any attempt to expand it (by removing another literal) would create a group of four minterms. Such a group of four always contains one minterm of weight `k-1` and one minterm of weight `k+2` (or spans three weight classes). Since minterms with weights `k-1` and `k+2` are not in our ON-set, the expansion is invalid.\n6.  Therefore, every edge in the n-hypercube graph between the set of vertices `S_k^n` and `S_{k+1}^n` corresponds to a unique prime implicant.\n7.  The number of such edges can be calculated by starting from `S_k^n`. There are `C(n, k)` minterms in `S_k^n`. Each has `k` ones and `n-k` zeros. Changing any of the `n-k` zeros to a one results in an adjacent minterm of weight `k+1`, which is in `S_{k+1}^n`.\n8.  Thus, the number of prime implicants is `C(n, k) * (n-k)`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Optimal `k` for n=4\n\nTo find `a(4)`, we need to maximize the number of PIs, `C(4, k) * (4-k)`, by choosing the best integer `k` from `0` to `3`.\n\n*   **k = 0:** Number of PIs = `C(4, 0) * (4-0) = 1 * 4 = 4`.\n    (The function is `S_0^4 U S_1^4`).\n*   **k = 1:** Number of PIs = `C(4, 1) * (4-1) = 4 * 3 = 12`.\n    (The function is `S_1^4 U S_2^4`).\n*   **k = 2:** Number of PIs = `C(4, 2) * (4-2) = 6 * 2 = 12`.\n    (The function is `S_2^4 U S_3^4`).\n*   **k = 3:** Number of PIs = `C(4, 3) * (4-3) = 4 * 1 = 4`.\n    (The function is `S_3^4 U S_4^4`).\n\nThe maximum value is achieved when `k=1` or `k=2`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is 12. This maximum is achieved, for example, by the function whose ON-set is composed of all minterms of weight 1 and all minterms of weight 2.\n\nFinal calculation:\na(4) = max {4, 12, 12, 4} = 12."
