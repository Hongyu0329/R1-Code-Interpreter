    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of elements of order 2 in the group $G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$.\n\n**Step 1: Relate involutions in PSU(n, q) to elements in SU(n, q)**\n\nThe Projective Special Unitary Group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient of the Special Unitary Group SU(n, q) by its center, $Z(\\text{SU}(n, q))$.\n$G = \\text{PSU}(4, 997) = \\text{SU}(4, 997) / Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$.\n\nAn element $g \\in G$ is an involution if $g \\neq 1_G$ and $g^2 = 1_G$.\nLet $\\pi: \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\to \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ be the canonical projection, and let $Z = Z(\\text{SU}(4, 997))$ be the kernel of $\\pi$.\nAn element $g = xZ$ (where $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$) is an involution in $G$ if and only if:\n1.  $xZ \\neq Z \\implies x \\notin Z$\n2.  $(xZ)^2 = x^2Z = Z \\implies x^2 \\in Z$\n\nSo, to find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997), we need to count the number of elements $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that $x \\notin Z$ and $x^2 \\in Z$. Each such element $x$ corresponds to an involution $xZ$ in PSU(4, 997). Since $x$ and $xz$ (for $z \\in Z, z \\neq 1$) correspond to the same element in PSU, we must divide the total count of such elements $x$ by the order of the center, $|Z|$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n\nThe center of $\\text{SU}(n, q)$ consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda^n = 1$ and $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. Thus, the order of the center is $|Z| = \\gcd(n, q+1)$.\nFor our case, $n=4$ and $q=997$.\n$|Z| = \\gcd(4, 997+1) = \\gcd(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and 499 is prime, $\\gcd(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, $|Z|=2$. The elements of order dividing 2 in $\\mathbb{F}_{997^2}^*$ are $1$ and $-1$. Both satisfy $\\lambda^4=1$ and $\\lambda^{998}=1$.\nTherefore, $Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Count preimages $x \\in SU(4, 997)$**\n\nThe condition $x^2 \\in Z$ means $x^2 = I$ or $x^2 = -I$.\nThe condition $x \\notin Z$ means $x \\neq I$ and $x \\neq -I$.\n\nWe need to count the number of elements $x \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ in the set:\n$S = \\{ x \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid (x^2=I \\text{ or } x^2=-I) \\text{ and } x \\notin \\{I, -I\\} \\}$.\n\nThis involves analyzing the conjugacy classes of elements in SU(4, q) whose square is $I$ or $-I$.\n\n**Case A: $x^2 = I$ and $x \\notin \\{I, -I\\}$**\nThese are the non-central involutions in SU(4, q). For q odd, the involutions in SU(n, q) are of type diag$(-I_k, I_{n-k})$ for even $k$.\nFor $n=4$, possible even values of $k$ are $k=2$ and $k=4$.\n*   $k=4$: The representative is $-I$. This is a central element, so we exclude it. The class consists of one element, $\\{-I\\}$.\n*   $k=2$: The representative is $t_2 = \\text{diag}(-1, -1, 1, 1)$. This element is not central. The size of its conjugacy class in SU(4, q) is given by $|Cl(t_2)| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\nThe set of elements satisfying $x^2=I$ and $x\\notin Z$ is precisely this conjugacy class.\nThe number of such elements is $N_1 = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)$.\n\n**Case B: $x^2 = -I$**\nWe need to determine if such elements exist in SU(4, 997) and count them. The existence depends on whether $t^2+1$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This happens if $-1$ is a square in $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is true if $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$.\nHere $q=997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. Elements with $x^2=-I$ exist.\nThese elements are sometimes called quasi-involutions. It is known that for $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, all such elements in SU(4, q) form a single conjugacy class.\nAn element $x$ with $x^2=-I$ cannot be $I$ or $-I$.\nThe size of this conjugacy class is $|Cl(x_3)| = q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\nThe number of such elements is $N_2 = q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of involutions**\n\nThe set $S$ of preimages is the disjoint union of the sets from Case A and Case B.\n$|S| = N_1 + N_2 = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is $|S|/|Z| = |S|/2$.\n\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} [q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^5(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)]$.\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$N = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) [1 + q(q+1)]$\n$N = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\nUsing the identity $(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2$ with $a=q^2+1$ and $b=q$:\n$(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1) = ((q^2+1)-q)((q^2+1)+q) = (q^2+1)^2-q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2 = q^4+q^2+1$.\nSo, the number of involutions is:\n$N = \\frac{1}{2} q^4(q^2+1)(q^4+q^2+1)$.\n\n**Step 5: Substitute q = 997**\n\nWe now substitute $q=997$ into the derived formula:\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^4+997^2+1)$.\nLet's compute the components:\n$997^2 = 994009$.\n$997^2+1 = 994010$.\n$997^4 = (994009)^2 = 988053848081$.\n$997^4+997^2+1 = 988053848081 + 994009 + 1 = 988054842091$.\n\nNumber of involutions = $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 988053848081 \\cdot 994010 \\cdot 988054842091$.\nNumber of involutions = $988053848081 \\cdot 497005 \\cdot 988054842091$.\nNumber of involutions = $491079633532328005 \\cdot 988054842091$.\nNumber of involutions = $485207798319692484501224855255$.\n\nFinal calculation verification:\n$N(q) = \\frac{1}{2}q^4(q^2+1)(q^4+q^2+1)$\n$N(997) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 \\cdot (997^2+1) \\cdot (997^4+997^2+1)$\nThis is the final numerical value.\n\nFinal expression:\n$N = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 (994009+1) (997^4+994009+1)$\n$N = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 997^4 (994010) (988053848081+994010)$\n$N = 997^4 \\cdot 497005 \\cdot (988054842091)$\n$N = 988053848081 \\cdot 497005 \\cdot 988054842091 \\approx 4.852 \\times 10^{29}$\n\nThe expression is correct.\n\n<<<485207798319692484501224855255>>>"
