    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Figure and Context**\nThe question centers on Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The context is his criticism of contemporary culture, which he contrasted with his own rationalist and socially-oriented liberal worldview.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Metaphor**\nMilyukov described \"X-Ys\" as a \"stagnant swamp.\" This is a powerful metaphor. A \"stagnant swamp\" implies:\n*   **Lack of progress and movement:** It's the opposite of a flowing, life-giving river.\n*   **Decay and putrefaction:** Swamps are often associated with rot and unhealthy environments.\n*   **Isolation and inwardness:** A swamp is a self-contained ecosystem, cut off from the outside world.\n*   **Murkiness and lack of clarity:** The water is not clear; it's obscure and hard to see through.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Milyukov's Beliefs to the Metaphor**\nAs a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), Milyukov was a positivist and a rationalist. He believed that art and culture should have a social purpose, contributing to enlightenment, civic progress, and the betterment of society. Any cultural movement that he perceived as being self-indulgent, mystical, irrational, purely aesthetic (\"art for art's sake\"), and detached from the pressing social and political issues of Russia would be a target for his criticism. The metaphor \"stagnant swamp\" perfectly captures this critique of a culture that, in his view, was not contributing to national progress but was instead lost in self-absorbed decay.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Cultural Movement of the Era**\nThe dominant and most controversial avant-garde artistic and literary movement in Russia during the period of Milyukov's main activity (circa 1890s-1910s) was Russian Symbolism.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate if Russian Symbolism fits the critique**\nLet's check the characteristics of Russian Symbolism against Milyukov's likely criticisms:\n*   **Focus on mysticism and the irrational:** The Symbolists rejected realism and rationalism in favor of exploring mystical realms, dreams, and spiritual intuition. This was directly opposed to Milyukov's positivist worldview.\n*   **Aestheticism and \"art for art's sake\":** Many Symbolists prioritized beauty and form over social commentary, which Milyukov would have seen as irresponsible escapism.\n*   **Individualism and Subjectivity:** The movement delved into the inner, subjective worlds of individuals, which Milyukov would contrast with the need for collective, civic action.\n*   **\"Decadence\":** The Symbolist movement was frequently labeled \"decadent\" by its critics due to its perceived pessimism, morbidity, and focus on decay and ennui. This aligns perfectly with the \"stagnant swamp\" metaphor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPavel Milyukov frequently engaged in public polemics against the Russian Symbolists, whom he and other traditional liberals saw as representing a decadent, mystical, and socially useless trend in the arts. He condemned their work as a departure from the socially-conscious tradition of 19th-century Russian literature. Therefore, the \"X-Ys\" he denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" were the Russian Symbolists.\n\n<<<Russian Symbolists>>>"
