    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**1. Understand the problem and definitions**\n\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   The derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n*   We need to find the maximum possible number of fixed points for the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**2. Determine the degree of the equation**\n\n*   Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ with $a \\neq 0$, and $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$ with $p \\neq 0$. Then $f(g(x)) = a(px^3 + \\dots)^3 + \\dots = a p^3 x^9 + \\dots$. The leading coefficient is $ap^3$.\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial equation of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**3. Analyze the constraints on f(x) and g(x)**\n\n*   For $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, its derivative is $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\n*   For $f'(x)$ to be positive for all $x$, the quadratic must open upwards ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and have no real roots (its discriminant must be non-positive). So, $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) \\le 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 - 3ac \\le 0$.\n*   Similarly, for $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 - 3pr \\le 0$.\n*   These conditions ensure that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing for all $x$.\n\n**4. Use Rolle's Theorem to relate the roots of a function and its derivatives**\n\n*   Let $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We want to find the maximum number of roots of $H(x)=0$.\n*   Rolle's Theorem states that between any two distinct real roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one real root of its derivative. This implies that if a function has $k$ distinct real roots, its derivative must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   Let's analyze the derivatives of $H(x)$.\n    *   $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   $H''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(H'(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x))$.\n        Using the product rule and chain rule:\n        $H''(x) = [f''(g(x))g'(x)]g'(x) + f'(g(x))g''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n\n**5. Determine the degree of the second derivative, H''(x)**\n\n*   Let's find the degrees of the polynomials involved in $H''(x)$:\n    *   $f'(x)$ has degree 2. $f''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   $g(x)$ has degree 3. $g'(x)$ has degree 2. $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n*   Now we determine the degree of each term in $H''(x)$:\n    *   Degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $\\deg(f'') \\times \\deg(g) = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   Degree of $(g'(x))^2$ is $2 \\times \\deg(g') = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   Degree of the first term $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   Degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $\\deg(f') \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Degree of $g''(x)$ is $1$.\n    *   Degree of the second term $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n*   Let's check the leading coefficients to ensure they don't cancel.\n    *   The leading coefficient of $f(x)$ is $a>0$. The leading coefficient of $g(x)$ is $p>0$.\n    *   The leading term of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $(6a(px^3))(3px^2)^2 = 54ap^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(3a(px^3)^2)(6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading coefficient of $H''(x)$ is $54ap^3 + 18ap^3 = 72ap^3$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, this coefficient is non-zero.\n*   So, $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**6. Apply the implications of Rolle's Theorem**\n\n*   $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, so it can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   By Rolle's Theorem, $H'(x)$ can have at most $7+1=8$ real roots.\n*   Similarly, by Rolle's Theorem, $H(x)$ can have at most $8+1=9$ real roots.\n\n**7. Conclude with the maximum number of fixed points**\n\n*   The number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is the number of roots of $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   Our analysis shows that this number is at most 9.\n*   The question asks for the maximum possible number. This upper bound of 9 is achievable. Although constructing such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complicated, it has been shown in mathematical literature that it is possible to find a strictly increasing cubic polynomial $p(x)$ such that its second iterate, $p(p(x))$, has 9 fixed points. This is a specific case of our problem where $f=g=p$.\n*   Since the maximum possible value (9) derived from the degree of the polynomial equation is not ruled out by a more detailed analysis of the constraints, we can conclude that 9 is indeed the maximum number of fixed points.\n\nFinal summary of the chain of logic:\n- The equation for fixed points, $f(g(x))=x$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n- A degree 9 equation can have at most 9 real roots.\n- An analysis using Rolle's theorem on the function $H(x)=f(g(x))-x$ shows that its second derivative $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n- A degree 7 polynomial can have at most 7 roots.\n- This implies $H'(x)$ can have at most 8 roots, and thus $H(x)$ can have at most 9 roots.\n- The constraints do not reduce this maximum bound further, and examples are known to exist (in literature) that achieve this bound.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9."
