    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which is equivalent to $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a square matrix with a non-zero determinant.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Equations**\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. We want the product $D(s)H(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix $N(s)$.\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nExpanding this product gives the elements of $N(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**3. Determine Conditions for Polynomial Entries**\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n*   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n*   $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n*   $N_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This implies that the numerator, $P_1(s) = d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$, must be divisible by $s^2-1=(s-1)(s+1)$.\n    *   Divisibility by $(s-1)$: $P_1(1) = d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. So, $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n    *   Divisibility by $(s+1)$: $P_1(-1) = d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n*   $N_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. Similarly, the numerator $P_2(s) = d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n    *   Divisibility by $(s-1)$: $P_2(1) = 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. So, $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$.\n    *   Divisibility by $(s+1)$: $P_2(-1) = 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Find a Simple Solution for D(s)**\n\nWe need to find the simplest non-trivial polynomials for $d_{ij}(s)$ that satisfy these conditions.\n\n*   **First row of D(s):**\n    Let's satisfy $d_{12}(1)=0$ by choosing $d_{12}(s) = c_1(s-1)$ for some constant $c_1$.\n    The second condition is $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + c_1(-2) = 0 \\implies d_{11}(-1) = c_1$.\n    Let's pick the simplest constant choice, $d_{11}(s) = c_1$.\n    To avoid a trivial solution, let's set $c_1=1$.\n    So, $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n*   **Second row of D(s):**\n    Let's satisfy $d_{22}(1)=0$ by choosing $d_{22}(s)=c_2(s-1)$.\n    The second condition is $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + c_2(-2) = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1) = c_2$.\n    Let's make a simple choice that makes $D(s)$ non-singular. A simple choice for $d_{22}(s)$ is $d_{22}(s) = 0$ (which corresponds to $c_2=0$).\n    This implies $d_{21}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{21}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s+1)$.\n    Let's try the simple form $d_{21}(s) = c_3(s+1)$. Let's pick $c_3=-2$ (this choice is arbitrary but aims for a simple result).\n    So, $d_{21}(s) = -2(s+1)$ and $d_{22}(s)=0$.\n\nThis gives us the candidate matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -2(s+1) & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = (1)(0) - (s-1)(-2(s+1)) = 2(s-1)(s+1) = 2(s^2-1)$. Since the determinant is not zero, $D(s)$ is invertible.\n\n**5. Calculate the Corresponding N(s)**\n\nNow we use the formula $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n*   $N_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s-1)^2+2d_{12}}{s^2-1} = \\frac{1(s-1)^2+2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$.\n*   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n*   $N_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s-1)^2+2d_{22}}{s^2-1} = \\frac{-2(s+1)(s-1)^2+2(0)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{-2(s+1)(s-1)^2}{(s+1)(s-1)} = -2(s-1)$.\n*   $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = -2(s+1)$.\n\nSo, the candidate matrix $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2(s-1) & -2(s+1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verify Coprimeness**\n\nTo check if $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, we form the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ and check if it has full row rank (i.e., rank 2) for all complex $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -2(s+1) & 0 & -2(s-1) & -2(s+1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this $2 \\times 4$ matrix drops below 2 only if all of its $2 \\times 2$ minors are simultaneously zero. Let's calculate the determinant of a few minors.\n*   Minor from columns 1 and 2: $\\det D(s) = 2(s^2-1)$.\n*   Minor from columns 3 and 4: $\\det N(s) = (1)(-2(s+1)) - (1)(-2(s-1)) = -2s-2+2s-2 = -4$.\n\nSince one of the $2 \\times 2$ minors is a non-zero constant (-4), it is impossible for all $2 \\times 2$ minors to be zero for any value of $s$. Therefore, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s$, and the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -2(s+1) & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2(s-1) & -2(s+1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n\\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ -2(s+1) & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2s+2 & -2s-2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]>>>"
