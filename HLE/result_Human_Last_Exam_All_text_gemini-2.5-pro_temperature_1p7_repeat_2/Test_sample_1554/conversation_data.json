    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the philosopher in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a philosopher from a specific school who made a particular conceptual distinction.\n*   **Philosophical School:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period (c. 1918-1939). Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Core Concept:** \"Hallmark\". This term is likely being used as a general English equivalent for \"sign\" or \"mark\" (in Polish, *znak*). A hallmark is a distinguishing feature or characteristic that indicates something.\n*   **The Decomposition:** The concept of a \"hallmark\" (sign) is broken down into two specific types: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\". This points towards the field of semiotics, the study of signs and symbols.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Concepts to the School of Thought**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and conceptual analysis, particularly in the philosophy of language and science. Analyzing the concept of a \"sign\" fits perfectly within their philosophical program. We need to find which member of this school is most closely associated with this specific semiotic distinction.\n\n**Step 3: Examine a Key Candidate: Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**\nKazimierz Ajdukiewicz was a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School who made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. His work frequently involved a meticulous analysis of the functions and types of language. A central part of his work on language and meaning was his theory of signs.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Ajdukiewicz's Distinction**\nAjdukiewicz undertook a detailed analysis of the general notion of a sign (*znak*). He is famously credited with distinguishing between two fundamental types of signs based on the nature of their relationship to what they signify.\n\n*   **Symptoms (Natural Signs):** Ajdukiewicz called these *oznaki*. A symptom is a sign that is connected to what it signifies through a natural, often causal, relationship. The connection is discovered in the world, not invented.\n    *   *Classic Example:* Smoke is a symptom (an *oznaka*) of fire. The presence of smoke indicates fire due to the natural laws of combustion.\n\n*   **Signals (Conventional Signs):** Ajdukiewicz analyzed conventional signs (*znaki umowne*) whose meaning is established by convention, rule, or agreement. Their relationship to what they signify is arbitrary and must be learned. This category closely maps to the term \"signals\".\n    *   *Classic Examples:* The word \"tree\" signifies a tree not because of any natural resemblance, but because of the conventions of the English language. A red traffic light is a signal to stop based on established traffic laws.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Identification**\nThe decomposition of a general sign (\"hallmark\") into \"symptoms\" (natural, causal signs) and \"signals\" (conventional, rule-based signs) is a cornerstone of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's semiotic theory. While other philosophers in the school worked on language, this specific, influential distinction is most famously attributed to him.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Translation:** The word \"hallmark\" is a slightly uncommon but understandable translation for the general concept of a \"sign\" (*znak*) that Ajdukiewicz analyzed.\n2.  **Context:** This analysis was part of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader project of applying logical tools to philosophical problems to achieve maximum clarity.\n3.  **Attribution:** While the study of signs has a long history (from the Stoics to Peirce), this specific formulation and its prominent place within the analytic tradition of the Lviv-Warsaw School is uniquely associated with Ajdukiewicz.\n\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposes the notion of a sign (or hallmark) into symptoms and signals is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
