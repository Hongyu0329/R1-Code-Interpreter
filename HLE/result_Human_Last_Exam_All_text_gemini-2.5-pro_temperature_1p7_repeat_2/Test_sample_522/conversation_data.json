    "This is a puzzle that involves discovering a transformation rule from a set of examples and applying it to a new case. Let's analyze the input-output pairs step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Data Representation**\nThe input and output are strings representing a 2D grid of numbers. The commas separate the rows.\nLet's represent the inputs as grids. `0` appears to be empty space, `1` an obstacle, and `2` a movable object.\n\n**2. Analyze Example A**\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n    ```\n    (row 0)  0 0 1 1 1 1\n    (row 1)  1 2 1 1 1 1\n    (row 2)  1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n    ```\n    (row 0)  2 0 1 1 1 1\n    (row 1)  1 0 1 1 1 1\n    (row 2)  1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The `2` at position `(1, 1)` has moved. Its old spot is now `0`.\n    *   The new position of the `2` is `(0, 0)`, which was previously a `0`.\n\n**3. Analyze Example B**\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n    ```\n    (r0) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    (r1) 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    (r2) 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    (r3) 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    (r4) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n    ```\n    (r0) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    (r1) 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    (r2) 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    (r3) 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    (r4) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The `2` at position `(3, 6)` has moved. Its old spot is now `0`. (Comparing `Input_B[r3]` and `Output_B[r3]`).\n    *   The new position of the `2` is `(2, 7)`, which was previously a `0`.\n\n**4. Formulating the Transformation Rule**\nLet's find a consistent rule for the `2`'s movement.\n\n*   **Trigger for movement:** In both examples, the `2` at `(r, c)` has a `0` directly above it at `(r-1, c)`.\n    *   In A, `2` is at `(1,1)`, and `Grid[0][1]` is `0`.\n    *   In B, `2` is at `(3,6)`, and `Grid[2][6]` is `0`.\n    *   **Hypothesis Part 1:** A `2` at `(r, c)` becomes mobile only if the cell `(r-1, c)` is a `0`.\n\n*   **Rule for destination:** Once mobile, where does the `2` go? It seems to move one row up (`r-1`) and one column left or right (`c-1` or `c+1`).\n    *   In A: `(1,1)` -> `(0,0)`. This is a move to `(r-1, c-1)`.\n    *   In B: `(3,6)` -> `(2,7)`. This is a move to `(r-1, c+1)`.\n\n*   **Choosing direction (Left vs. Right):** We need a tie-breaker.\n    *   In A, the destination is up-left `(0,0)`. Let's check the up-right option `(0,2)`. `Grid[0][2]` is `1`, so this move was not possible.\n    *   In B, the destination is up-right `(2,7)`. Let's check the up-left option `(2,5)`. `Grid[2][5]` is `0`, so this move *was* possible.\n    *   Since B chose up-right even when up-left was available, this suggests a **priority order**: the `2` tries to move **up-right** first. If that spot is not an available `0`, it then tries to move **up-left**.\n    *   **Hypothesis Part 2:** The mobile `2` moves to `(r-1, c+1)` if it's a `0`. If not, it moves to `(r-1, c-1)` if that is a `0`.\n\n**Final Rule:**\n1.  Locate the `2` at position `(r, c)`.\n2.  Check if the cell `(r-1, c)` is a `0`. If not, there is no change.\n3.  If it is, the `2` moves. The cell `(r, c)` becomes a `0`.\n4.  The `2` attempts to move to `(r-1, c+1)`. If that cell is a `0`, it moves there.\n5.  If not, the `2` attempts to move to `(r-1, c-1)`. If that cell is a `0`, it moves there.\n6.  If neither diagonal move is possible, no change occurs.\n\n**5. Applying the Rule to Input_C**\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Grid representation:**\n    ```\n    (r0)  0 0 0 0 0 0\n    (r1)  0 1 1 1 2 0\n    (r2)  1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n1.  The `2` is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  Check above: `Grid[0][4]` is `0`. The trigger condition is met. The `2` will move.\n3.  The original position `(1, 4)` will become `0`.\n4.  Try to move up-right to `(r-1, c+1) = (0, 5)`. The cell `Grid[0][5]` is `0`. This is a valid destination. The `2` moves here.\n5.  Since the preferred move was possible, we don't need to check up-left.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   The original grid is modified.\n*   The value at `(1, 4)` changes from `2` to `0`. Row 1 (`011120`) becomes `011100`.\n*   The value at `(0, 5)` changes from `0` to `2`. Row 0 (`000000`) becomes `000002`.\n*   Row 2 is unchanged: `111111`.\n\n**Final Grid:**\n```\n(r0)  0 0 0 0 0 2\n(r1)  0 1 1 1 0 0\n(r2)  1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n**Final String:**\nConcatenating the rows with commas gives: `000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
