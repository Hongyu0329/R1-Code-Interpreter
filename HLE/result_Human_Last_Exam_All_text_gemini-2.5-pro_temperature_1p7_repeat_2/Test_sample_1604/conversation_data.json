    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Artist and the Task:** The artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933), a renowned British painter of military scenes. The task is to review her body of work, identify the specific historical battles she depicted, and determine which of these battles occurred the latest in time.\n\n2.  **List Major Battle Paintings and their Subjects:** We need to compile a list of Lady Butler's famous paintings and the historical events they represent.\n    *   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **16 June 1815**.\n    *   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **18 June 1815**.\n    *   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle occurred on **5 November 1854**.\n    *   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Shows the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade, which was part of the Battle of Balaclava on **25 October 1854**.\n    *   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Portrays the stand of British troops during the Battle of Rorke's Drift in the Anglo-Zulu War, which happened on **22–23 January 1879**.\n    *   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts an incident during the Battle of Laing's Nek in the First Boer War, which was fought on **28 January 1881**.\n    *   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1886-88): Represents the British Camel Corps during the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, which was sent to relieve General Gordon in Khartoum. A key engagement was the Battle of Abu Klea in January 1885.\n    *   ***A Boer War Reminiscence*** (painted 1902): Depicts an act of heroism during the Second Boer War, which lasted from **1899 to 1902**.\n    *   ***The Irish Guards after the First Battle of Ypres*** (painted 1916): This later work depicts soldiers of the Irish Guards in the aftermath of a major engagement during the First World War. The First Battle of Ypres took place between **October and November 1914**.\n\n3.  **Collate and Compare the Dates of the Battles:** Now, we list the years of the battles to find the latest one.\n    *   Battle of Quatre Bras / Waterloo: **1815**\n    *   Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman: **1854**\n    *   Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n    *   Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n    *   Nile Expedition: **1885**\n    *   Second Boer War: **1899–1902**\n    *   First Battle of Ypres: **1914**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the dates, we can see that the First Battle of Ypres in 1914 is the most recent historical event among those depicted in Lady Butler's major paintings. Although she painted it in 1916, the event itself is the latest.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **First Battle of Ypres**.\n\n<<<First Battle of Ypres>>>"
