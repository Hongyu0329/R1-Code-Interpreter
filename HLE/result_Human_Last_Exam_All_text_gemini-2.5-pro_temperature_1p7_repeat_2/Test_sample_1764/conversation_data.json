    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d(x,y)$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$. A simple consequence is that in any triangle, the two longest sides must be of equal length.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space. The distance between two vectors $u, v \\in B$ is given by the norm of their difference, $\\|u-v\\|$. The problem states its cardinality is $K$. For standard Banach spaces over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, if the dimension is positive, $K$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum, $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$. If the dimension is zero, $B=\\{0\\}$ and $K=1$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A map $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for any two points $x, y \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the \"smallest possible number\" of such isometric embeddings. This means we should find the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where $N(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$. The minimum is taken over all possible choices of $X$ and $B$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Number of Embeddings**\n\nThe number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. So, the smallest possible number is at least 0.\nThe question boils down to whether we can find a pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is exactly 0. This would happen if an embedding is not always guaranteed to exist.\n\n**3. The Existence of an Isometric Embedding**\n\nAn isometric embedding of a metric space $X$ into a specific Banach space $B$ is not always possible. The existence depends on the geometric properties of both $X$ and $B$. While it is known that any finite ultrametric space can be embedded into *some* Banach space (for example, into $\\ell_{\\infty}^{n-1}$ where $n=|X|$), it is not true that it can be embedded into *any* Banach space.\n\nWe can prove that the minimum number of embeddings is 0 by providing a concrete example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which no isometric embedding exists.\n\n**4. Constructing a Counterexample**\n\nLet's find a pair $(X, B)$ with zero embeddings.\n\n**Counterexample 1:**\n\n*   **Choose the finite ultrametric space X:** Let $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\}$ be a set of four points. Define the distance $d(p_i, p_j) = 1$ if $i \\neq j$, and $d(p_i, p_i) = 0$.\n    *   *Careful point: Verify X is ultrametric.* We check the strong triangle inequality: $d(p_i, p_k) \\le \\max(d(p_i, p_j), d(p_j, p_k))$. If $i, j, k$ are distinct, this means $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true. Other cases where some points are identical are trivial. So, $X$ is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n\n*   **Choose the Banach space B:** Let $B = \\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard Euclidean norm, $\\|(v_1, v_2)\\|_2 = \\sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2}$. This is a complete normed vector space, hence a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K = |\\mathbb{R}^2|=c$.\n\n*   **Show no embedding exists:** An isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ would require finding four points $y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4$ in the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the distance between any two distinct points is 1, i.e., $\\|y_i - y_j\\|_2 = 1$ for all $i \\neq j$. These four points would form a regular tetrahedron with side length 1. However, a fundamental result in geometry states that a regular tetrahedron cannot be embedded in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space. More generally, a set of $n+2$ points cannot be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with equal pairwise distances. Here, we need to embed $4 = 2+2$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Conclusion for the counterexample:** There is no such set of four points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings of this specific $X$ into this specific $B$. The number of embeddings is 0.\n\n**Counterexample 2 (Simpler):**\n\n*   **Choose X:** Let $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ with distances $d(p_1, p_2) = 2$, $d(p_2, p_3) = 1$, and $d(p_1, p_3) = 2$.\n    *   *Careful point: Verify X is ultrametric.* The distances are 1, 2, 2. The largest two are equal, so any triangle inequality of the form $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$ holds. For instance, $1 \\le \\max(2, 2)$, and $2 \\le \\max(2, 1)$. It is a valid ultrametric space.\n\n*   **Choose B:** Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm, $\\|v\\| = |v|$. This is a Banach space with cardinality $K=c$.\n\n*   **Show no embedding exists:** An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ would require finding three real numbers $y_1, y_2, y_3$ such that $|y_1 - y_2| = 2$, $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$, and $|y_1 - y_3| = 2$.\n    By the triangle inequality on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $|y_1 - y_2| \\le |y_1 - y_3| + |y_3 - y_2|$. Here, this means $2 \\le 2 + 1$, which is true.\n    However, let's analyze the positions on the line. Let's place $y_3$ at the origin without loss of generality (by translation, which is an isometry): $y_3 = 0$.\n    Then $|y_2 - 0| = |y_2| = 1$, so $y_2 = 1$ or $y_2 = -1$.\n    And $|y_1 - 0| = |y_1| = 2$, so $y_1 = 2$ or $y_1 = -2$.\n    Now we check the third distance, $|y_1 - y_2| = 2$:\n    *   If $y_1=2, y_2=1$: $|2 - 1| = 1 \\neq 2$.\n    *   If $y_1=2, y_2=-1$: $|2 - (-1)| = 3 \\neq 2$.\n    *   If $y_1=-2, y_2=1$: $|-2 - 1| = 3 \\neq 2$.\n    *   If $y_1=-2, y_2=-1$: $|-2 - (-1)| = 1 \\neq 2$.\n    In all cases, the condition fails. So, no such three points exist in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Conclusion for the counterexample:** There are no isometric embeddings for this pair $(X, B)$. The number is 0.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that it is possible to choose a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ such that there are no isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$. Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
