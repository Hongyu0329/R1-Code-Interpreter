To design a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, one should use the BLS signature scheme as its foundation, require a secure Distributed Key Generation (DKG) for setup, and implement a two-round "commit-then-sign" protocol.

The protocol proceeds as follows:
1.  **Setup Phase:** A one-time Pedersen DKG is run to establish a group public key `pk`, and provide each of the `n` participants with a secret share `s_i` and a corresponding public verification key `pk_i`.
2.  **Signing Phase (2 Rounds):** For a message `m` and a signing set `S` of size `t`:
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each participant `P_i` in `S` generates a random nonce `r_i`, computes and broadcasts a commitment `C_i = g_1^{r_i}`, along with a NIZK proof of knowledge for `r_i`.
    *   **Round 2 (Partial Signature):** After verifying all commitments from Round 1, each participant `P_i` calculates a hash `h` that is bound to the entire session context: `h = H(m, S, C_1, ..., C_t)`. Then, `P_i` computes their partial signature `ﾏダi = h^{s_i}` and broadcasts it with a NIZK proof of correctness, proving `ﾏダi` was generated using `s_i`.
3.  **Aggregation & Verification:** An aggregator collects `t` valid partial signatures, combines them using Lagrange interpolation into a final signature `ﾏダagg`, and bundles it with the commitments `(C_1, ..., C_t)`. A verifier recomputes `h` from the message and commitments and confirms the signature by checking `e(ﾏダagg, g_2) = e(h, pk)`.

This design achieves tight security by binding every signature to its unique context, preventing cross-session attacks, and using NIZK proofs to ensure correctness and enable a security proof without significant security loss.
