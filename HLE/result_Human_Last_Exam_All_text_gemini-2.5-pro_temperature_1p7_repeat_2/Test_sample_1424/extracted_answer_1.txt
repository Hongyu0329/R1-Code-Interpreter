The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency/energy variable $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\mu$). The functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) = [\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\eta]^{-1}$, meaning that $\epsilon_k$ determines the position of the simple pole of the Green's function in the complex energy plane.
