    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is a generalization of the concept of an adjoint pair of functors between categories. When the 2-category is locally posetal, like the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, the definitions simplify considerably.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the context: $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\n    *   The objects are finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n    *   The 1-morphisms are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n    *   The hom-sets are themselves posets (hence, categories). For two morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f \\le g$, which means $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Defining an internal adjunction.**\n    *   An internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of 1-morphisms (order-preserving maps) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), along with two 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\text{id}_{[n]}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Unpacking the definitions.** The existence of these 2-morphisms translates to the following inequalities:\n        *   Unit: $\\text{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n        *   Counit: $L \\circ R \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n    *   In a poset-enriched setting, the triangle identities for the adjunction are automatically satisfied if the unit and counit exist.\n\n3.  **Relating to Galois Connections.**\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Recognizing a known structure.** The two conditions above, for order-preserving maps between posets, define what is known as a Galois connection. A common equivalent definition for a Galois connection between posets $(P, \\le)$ and $(Q, \\le)$ is a pair of order-preserving maps $L: P \\to Q$ and $R: Q \\to P$ such that for all $p \\in P$ and $q \\in Q$:\n        $L(p) \\le q \\iff p \\le R(q)$.\n    *   This equivalence tells us that an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$ is precisely a Galois connection.\n\n4.  **Counting Adjunctions.**\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Adjunctions are determined by one adjoint.** A key property of Galois connections (and adjunctions in general) is that the left adjoint $L$ uniquely determines the right adjoint $R$, and vice-versa.\n        *   $R(j) = \\max \\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$\n        *   $L(i) = \\min \\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$\n    *   This means we can count the number of adjunctions by counting the number of possible left adjoints or the number of possible right adjoints.\n    *   **Careful Point 4: Conditions for a map to be an adjoint.**\n        *   For $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, the corresponding $R$ must be well-defined. This requires the set $\\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$ to be non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$. This holds if and only if it holds for $j=0$, which implies $L(0) \\le 0$, so $L(0) = 0$.\n        *   For $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to be a right adjoint, the corresponding $L$ must be well-defined. This requires the set $\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$ to be non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$. This holds if and only if it holds for $i=m$, which implies $m \\le R(n)$, so $R(n) = m$.\n\n5.  **Setting up the counting problem.**\n    *   The question asks for the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$. The left adjoint is $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and the right adjoint is $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   We can either count:\n        a) The number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0) = 0$.\n        b) The number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ with $R(37) = 23$.\n    *   Both counts must be identical. Let's use method (b).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ satisfying $R(37)=23$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by a sequence of values $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37) \\le 23$.\n\nThe condition $R(37)=23$ fixes the last value. So we need to find the number of sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars.\n*   **Careful Point 5: Translating to a standard model.** This is equivalent to choosing a multiset of size $k$ from a set of $s$ elements.\n    *   The number of values we need to choose is $k = 37$ (for $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(36)$).\n    *   The set of possible values is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has size $s = 24$.\n*   The number of ways to choose a multiset of size $k$ from a set of size $s$ is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{s \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right)$, which is equal to the binomial coefficient $\\binom{s+k-1}{k}$.\n\nPlugging in our values $s=24$ and $k=37$:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$:\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60 - 37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThis is the final numerical answer.\n\n<<<$ \\binom{60}{23} $>>>"
