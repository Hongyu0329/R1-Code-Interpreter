    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to find the probability of a quantum particle in a 1D box being in a specific small interval.\n*   **System:** Particle in a 1D box of length `a`.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy level, so the principal quantum number `n=2`.\n*   **Interval:** The particle's location is between `x1 = 0.495a` and `x2 = 0.505a`.\n\nThis problem requires the use of the wavefunction for the particle in a box to calculate the probability density and then integrate it over the specified interval.\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Wavefunction and Probability Density:** The normalized wavefunction is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`. The probability density is `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(nπx / a)`. It is crucial to use the squared wavefunction and the correct normalization constant.\n2.  **Quantum Number:** The problem specifies `n=2`, so the probability density is `P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`.\n3.  **The Interval:** The interval is `[0.495a, 0.505a]`. The center of this interval is `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`. The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n4.  **Node at the Center:** For the `n=2` state, the wavefunction has a node (a point where the wavefunction and probability density are zero) at `x = a/2`. This is precisely the center of our interval.\n5.  **Approximation Method:** A naive approximation `Probability ≈ P(x_center) * Δx` would give `0 * Δx = 0`, which is incorrect. The probability is small, but not exactly zero. We need a more sophisticated approximation because the probability density function is not constant over the interval; it varies from zero at the center to non-zero values at the edges. Using a Taylor series expansion of the integrand is the correct approach.\n\n---\n**Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer**\n\n**Step 1: Define the probability integral.**\nThe probability `Prob` of finding the particle between `x1 = 0.495a` and `x2 = 0.505a` is given by the integral of the probability density `P(x)` over this interval.\nFor `n=2`, `P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a)`.\n`Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral using an approximation.**\nThe integration interval `Δx = 0.01a` is very small and centered at `x = a/2`. We can make a change of variables to simplify the problem. Let `y = x - a/2`. This centers the integral around `y=0`.\n*   `x = y + a/2`\n*   The limits of integration for `y` become: `0.495a - a/2 = -0.005a` and `0.505a - a/2 = +0.005a`.\n*   The term `sin^2(2πx / a)` becomes `sin^2(2π(y + a/2) / a) = sin^2(2πy/a + π)`.\n*   Using the trigonometric identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we have `sin^2(θ + π) = [-sin(θ)]^2 = sin^2(θ)`.\n*   So, `sin^2(2πy/a + π) = sin^2(2πy/a)`.\n\nThe integral is now:\n`Prob = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πy / a) dy`\n\n**Step 3: Use the small-angle approximation.**\nIn the interval of integration, `y` is small. Therefore, the argument of the sine function, `u = 2πy/a`, is also small. We can use the Taylor series approximation for `sin(u)` where `u ≈ 0`: `sin(u) ≈ u`.\n`sin^2(2πy / a) ≈ (2πy / a)^2 = 4π^2y^2 / a^2`\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the integral:\n`Prob ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (4π^2y^2 / a^2) dy`\n`Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] y^2 dy`\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the simplified integral.**\nThe integral of `y^2` is `y^3 / 3`.\n`Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [y^3 / 3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n`Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [ ((0.005a)^3 / 3) - ((-0.005a)^3 / 3) ]`\n`Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [ (0.005a)^3 / 3 + (0.005a)^3 / 3 ]`\n`Prob ≈ (8π^2 / a^3) * [ 2 * (0.005a)^3 / 3 ]`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final numerical value.**\n`Prob ≈ (16π^2 / (3a^3)) * (0.005)^3 * a^3`\nThe `a^3` terms cancel out, as expected for a probability.\n`Prob ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (0.005)^3`\n`Prob ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (5 x 10^-3)^3`\n`Prob ≈ (16π^2 / 3) * (125 x 10^-9)`\n`Prob ≈ (16 * (3.14159)^2 / 3) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n`Prob ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n`Prob ≈ (52.638) * 1.25 x 10^-7`\n`Prob ≈ 65.797 x 10^-7`\n`Prob ≈ 6.5797 x 10^-6`\n\nThis value can also be written as `0.0000065797`. Rounding to three significant figures, the probability is `6.58 x 10^-6` or `0.00000658`.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
