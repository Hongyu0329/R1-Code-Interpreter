    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes on a sphere.\n\n**1. Understand Ground Space Degeneracy in the Toric Code**\nThe ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the number of encoded logical qubits, $k$. The GSD is given by $2^k$. The value of $k$ depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined, including its genus, number of boundaries (holes), and the boundary conditions at these holes.\n\n**2. The Surface Topology**\nThe problem specifies a surface with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes. Assuming we start with a sphere (a surface of genus $g=0$), we are considering a sphere with $n+m$ total holes or boundaries.\n\n**3. Boundary Conditions: Smooth vs. Rough Holes**\nThe types of logical operators supported by the code depend on the boundary conditions.\n*   **Smooth boundary:** At a smooth boundary, the star operators ($A_s$, products of Pauli-X) are well-defined, but plaquette operators ($B_p$, products of Pauli-Z) are not. This means that Pauli-X strings can terminate at a smooth boundary, while Pauli-Z strings must form closed loops relative to this boundary type.\n*   **Rough boundary:** At a rough boundary, the plaquette operators are well-defined, but the star operators are not. This is the dual situation: Pauli-Z strings can terminate at a rough boundary, while Pauli-X strings must form closed loops relative to this boundary type.\n\n**4. Logical Operators and Qubits**\nLogical qubits are encoded by pairs of operators, a logical-X ($X_L$) and a logical-Z ($Z_L$), that commute with all stabilizer operators but anti-commute with each other. The number of such independent pairs gives the number of logical qubits $k$.\n\n**5. Decoupling of Smooth and Rough Sectors**\nThe logical operators associated with smooth holes are topologically distinct and can be constructed independently from those associated with rough holes.\n*   **\"Smooth\" logical operators:** These operators involve only the smooth boundaries. Logical X-operators can be strings connecting two different smooth holes. Logical Z-operators can be loops that distinguish between different smooth holes.\n*   **\"Rough\" logical operators:** Dually, these operators involve only the rough boundaries. Logical Z-operators can be strings connecting two different rough holes. Logical X-operators can be loops that distinguish between different rough holes.\n\nCrucially, any logical operator from the \"smooth sector\" can be represented by a path or loop that does not interact with the rough holes, and vice-versa. This means that any logical operator from the smooth sector commutes with any logical operator from the rough sector.\nThis decoupling implies that the total algebra of logical operators is a tensor product of the algebra from the smooth sector and the algebra from the rough sector. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each sector:\n$k_{total} = k_{smooth} + k_{rough}$.\n\n**6. Calculating Qubits for Each Sector**\nWe need the number of logical qubits for a sphere with only smooth holes, and for a sphere with only rough holes.\n*   **$k_{smooth}$ (Sphere with n smooth holes):** The GSD for the toric code on a surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundaries of the *same* type is known to be $2^{2g+b-1}$. For a sphere, $g=0$. So, for a sphere with $n$ smooth holes, the number of logical qubits is $k_S = 2(0) + n - 1 = n-1$. This formula is valid for $n \\ge 1$. If $n=1$, $k_S=0$. If $n=0$, there are no holes, so $k_S=0$. A more precise formula is $k_S = \\max(0, n-1)$.\n*   **$k_{rough}$ (Sphere with m rough holes):** By duality, the same formula applies. For a sphere with $m$ rough holes, the number of logical qubits is $k_R = m-1$. This holds for $m \\ge 1$. So, $k_R = \\max(0, m-1)$.\n\n**7. Calculating the Total Number of Qubits**\nCombining the results from the decoupled sectors:\n$k_{total} = k_S + k_R = \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$.\n\nLet's analyze this formula:\n*   If $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$: $k_{total} = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2$.\n*   If $n \\ge 1$ and $m = 0$: $k_{total} = (n-1) + 0 = n-1$.\n*   If $n = 0$ and $m \\ge 1$: $k_{total} = 0 + (m-1) = m-1$.\n*   If $n=0$ and $m=0$: $k_{total} = 0$.\n\nThe answer choices provided do not contain this full piecewise formula. This often happens when a question implicitly assumes the most general case, where all features mentioned are present. The phrase \"with n smooth holes and m rough holes\" usually implies $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$. In this case, the number of qubits is $k = n+m-2$.\n\n**8. Final Answer**\nUnder the reasonable assumption that $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$, the number of logical qubits is $k = n+m-2$. The ground space degeneracy is therefore $2^k = 2^{n+m-2}$.\nLet's check this against the given options.\nA. $2^{m+n}$\nB. $2^{m+n-2}$\nC. $2^{m+n+2}$\nD. $2^{2m}$\nE. $2^{2n}$\nF. $2^{(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)}$\n\nThe derived degeneracy matches option B."
