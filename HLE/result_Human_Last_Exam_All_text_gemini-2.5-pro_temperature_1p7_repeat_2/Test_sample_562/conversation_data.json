    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Kanji Character**\nFirst, we analyze the structure of the kanji 謄. This character is a compound character formed by combining two elements in a left-right arrangement.\n*   **Left side:** 言\n*   **Right side:** 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, for characters with a distinct left-right structure (called a *hen-tsukuri* structure), the left part (*hen*) typically serves as the radical for dictionary classification. The radical often indicates the general meaning category of the character.\n*   In 謄, the left part is 言.\n*   The radical 言 relates to speech, words, or language. The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" which is an action related to words.\n*   Therefore, the radical of 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Japanese Name of the Radical Component**\nRadicals are given specific names based on their form and position within a character.\n*   The radical 言, when it appears on the left side of a character, is called ごんべん (*gonben*).\n*   \"Gon\" is derived from an *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) of the character 言.\n*   \"Ben\" is the voiced form of \"hen,\" which means \"left-side component.\"\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Name to Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name ごんべん using the Hepburn transcription system, as requested by the user's example (\"Onnahen\").\n*   ご (go) + ん (n) + べ (be) + ん (n) = Gonben\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly parsing the character:** It is crucial to correctly identify the components. 謄 is clearly 言 + 朕.\n2.  **Identifying the correct part as the radical:** In a left-right compound, the left side is overwhelmingly the radical. The right side (朕) acts as the phonetic component.\n3.  **Using the correct name for the radical's position:** The name for the radical 言 changes based on its position. As a standalone radical or at the bottom, it's just called *gen* or *iu*. On the left side, it is specifically called *gonben*. The question's example (\"Onnahen\") confirms that the positional name is required.\n4.  **Accurate Hepburn romanization:** Ensure that ごんべん is transcribed to \"Gonben\" and not \"Gomben\" or another variation.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the correct answer.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
