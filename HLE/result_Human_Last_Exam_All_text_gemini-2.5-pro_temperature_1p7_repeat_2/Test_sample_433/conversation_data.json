    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a specific type of container under specific conditions.\n*   **Item:** Single-dose container ampule.\n*   **Action:** From the time of puncture (or, more accurately for an ampule, breaking/opening).\n*   **Environment:** In a sterile environment (implying an ISO Class 5 environment or better, as per USP standards).\n\n**Step 2: Understand Key Terms**\n*   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date and time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) or opened container must not be used. It is determined by the risk of microbial contamination.\n*   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container of sterile medication intended for a single use in a single patient. SDCs, such as ampules, typically do not contain antimicrobial preservatives.\n*   **Ampule:** A hermetically sealed glass container. To access the contents, the neck of the ampule must be broken. It cannot be resealed once opened. This is a critical distinction from a vial.\n*   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to a Primary Engineering Control (PEC) that provides an ISO Class 5 or better air quality, such as a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW) or a biological safety cabinet (BSC).\n\n**Step 3: Consult Relevant Standards (USP <797>)**\nThe United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> provides the standards for sterile compounding and the assignment of BUDs. These standards are designed to prevent patient harm from microbial contamination.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Specific Case of an Ampule**\nThis is the most critical point of the analysis. An ampule must be differentiated from a single-dose *vial*.\n*   A **vial** has a rubber stopper that can be resealed by the elasticity of the material after a needle puncture.\n*   An **ampule**, once broken, is an open container. It is completely exposed to the environment and cannot be closed again.\n\nDue to this fundamental difference, the guidelines for an ampule are much stricter. The inability to reseal an ampule means it is highly susceptible to contamination once opened, even within the controlled airflow of an ISO Class 5 environment.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the USP <797> Guideline for Ampules**\nUSP <797> explicitly states that once an ampule is opened, it must be used immediately, and any unused contents must be discarded.\n*   The contents should be drawn up into a sterile syringe immediately after the ampule is opened.\n*   The opened ampule cannot be stored for any period. There is no provision for saving the remainder for later use.\n*   Therefore, the \"BUD\" for the opened container itself is effectively zero for storage purposes.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rules for an ampule with those for a single-dose vial. Under the 2023 USP <797> standards, a single-dose *vial* that is punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to 12 hours. This rule **does not** apply to ampules.\n2.  **\"Immediate Use\":** In the context of an ampule, \"immediate use\" means the contents must be withdrawn and used promptly after opening. There is no sanctioned storage time for the opened container itself.\n3.  **Environment Doesn't Change the Rule for Ampules:** While performing the task in a sterile environment reduces the risk of contamination during the manipulation process, it does not change the fundamental physical reality that the ampule is an open, unsealable container. Thus, the strict rule of \"use immediately and discard the rest\" remains in effect regardless of the cleanroom environment.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the unsealable nature of an ampule and the explicit guidelines from USP <797>, an opened ampule cannot be stored. Its contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.\n\n<<<An opened ampule cannot be stored. The contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded."
