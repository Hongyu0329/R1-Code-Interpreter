    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**\n\n*   A **wallpaper group** (or plane crystallographic group) describes the symmetries of a two-dimensional repeating pattern. There are a total of 17 such groups.\n*   The **point group** of a wallpaper group consists of the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the pattern fixed. It is derived from the wallpaper group by ignoring all translational components of its symmetries.\n*   The **order of a group** is the number of distinct symmetry operations (elements) in that group.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Possible 2D Crystallographic Point Groups**\n\nThe crystallographic restriction theorem limits the rotational symmetries in a repeating lattice to 1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. Based on these rotations and possible reflections, there are 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups. Let's list them and their orders:\n\n| Point Group (Schönflies) | Point Group (H-M) | Order | Description                           |\n| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :---- | :------------------------------------ |\n| C₁                       | 1                   | 1     | No symmetry (only identity)           |\n| **C₂**                       | **2**                   | **2**     | **2-fold rotation (180°)**            |\n| C₃                       | 3                   | 3     | 3-fold rotation (120°)                |\n| C₄                       | 4                   | 4     | 4-fold rotation (90°)                 |\n| C₆                       | 6                   | 6     | 6-fold rotation (60°)                 |\n| **D₁ (or Cₛ)**           | **m**                   | **2**     | **One reflection line**               |\n| D₂                       | 2mm                 | 4     | 2-fold rotation and two reflections |\n| D₃                       | 3m                  | 6     | 3-fold rotation and three reflections |\n| D₄                       | 4mm                 | 8     | 4-fold rotation and four reflections  |\n| D₆                       | 6m                  | 12    | 6-fold rotation and six reflections   |\n\n**Step 3: Find the Point Groups with Order 2**\n\nFrom the table above, we can identify the point groups that have exactly two elements (order 2):\n1.  **C₂ (or 2):** This group contains the identity and a 180° rotation.\n2.  **D₁ (or m):** This group contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Wallpaper Groups Associated with These Point Groups**\n\nNow, we need to find which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to the point groups C₂ and D₁.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group C₂ (Order 2):**\n*   There is only one wallpaper group whose point group is C₂. This group contains 2-fold rotation centers but no reflection or glide reflection lines.\n    *   **p2**: This group is defined by an oblique lattice with 2-fold rotation centers.\n\n**Wallpaper Groups with Point Group D₁ (Order 2):**\n*   There are three wallpaper groups whose point group is D₁. These groups contain reflection and/or glide reflection symmetries, but no rotational symmetry higher than 1-fold. A key point here is that a **glide reflection** in the wallpaper group corresponds to a simple **reflection** in its point group because the translational part is ignored.\n    *   **pm**: This group has parallel reflection lines.\n    *   **pg**: This group has parallel glide reflection lines.\n    *   **cm**: This group has a centered rectangular lattice and contains both reflection and glide reflection lines.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Groups**\n\nLet's sum the number of wallpaper groups we found for each required point group:\n*   Number of groups with point group C₂: 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group D₁: 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n\nTotal number of wallpaper groups = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguish between wallpaper groups and point groups:** The question asks for wallpaper groups, which are space groups in 2D, not the point groups themselves.\n2.  **Correctly identify all 10 possible 2D point groups:** Missing one could lead to an incorrect result.\n3.  **Correctly determine the order of each point group:** The order of Cₙ is n, and the order of Dₙ is 2n.\n4.  **Understand glide reflections:** A crucial point is that the point group of a wallpaper group with glide reflections (like `pg`) is the same as one with simple reflections (`pm`), because the non-symmorphic (translational) component of the glide is factored out to get the point group.\n5.  **Systematically check all 17 wallpaper groups:** It's important to mentally or physically check the point group for each of the 17 wallpaper groups to ensure none are missed or misclassified. The wallpaper groups p2, pm, pg, and cm all lack any rotation higher than 2-fold (and pm, pg, cm lack 2-fold rotation entirely), and their symmetries match the required point groups.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, there are 4 wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These are **p2**, **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
