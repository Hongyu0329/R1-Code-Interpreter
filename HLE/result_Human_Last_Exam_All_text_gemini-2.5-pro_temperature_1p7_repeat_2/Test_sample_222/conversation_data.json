    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Define the Sequences**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   We need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(m)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Interpret the \"4-point DFT\" Request**\n\n*   The sequence `y(m)` is an 8-point sequence, so its natural DFT is an 8-point DFT, which we will call `Y(k)`.\n*   The question asks for the \"4-point DFT for sequence `y(m)`\". This is an unusual phrasing. In signal processing, finding an M-point DFT of an N-point sequence (where M < N) implies time-domain aliasing.\n*   The 4-point DFT of the 8-point sequence `y(m)` can be found by first computing the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` and then decimating (downsampling) it in the frequency domain.\n*   Let the desired 4-point DFT be `Z(k)`. The relationship is `Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. This is a standard property connecting the DFT of a sequence to the DFT of its time-aliased version.\n\n**3. Relate the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`**\n\n*   We can decompose the 8-point sequence `y(m)` into its even and odd indexed samples.\n    *   Even samples: `y(2n) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)} = x(n)`\n    *   Odd samples: `y(2n+1) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)} = h(n)`\n*   The decimation-in-time property of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm gives us a formula to compute the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` from the 4-point DFTs of its even part (`X(k)`) and odd part (`H(k)`).\n*   The formulas are:\n    *   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n        *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)`\n        *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)`\n    *   Here, `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2πk / 8)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required DFT Points**\n\n*   We need to find `Z(k) = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`.\n*   We only need to compute `Y(k)` for the even indices `k=0, 2, 4, 6`.\n\n**Careful Points:** We will need the specific values of `X(k)` and `H(k)` at indices `k=0` and `k=2`, and the twiddle factors `W_8^0` and `W_8^2`.\n\n*   **Inputs from problem:**\n    *   `X(0) = 1`\n    *   `X(2) = -1`\n    *   `H(0) = 0`\n    *   `H(2) = 1`\n*   **Twiddle Factors:**\n    *   `W_8^0 = exp(-j * 0) = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = exp(-j * 2π * 2 / 8) = exp(-jπ/2) = cos(-π/2) + j sin(-π/2) = -j`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculations**\n\n*   **Calculate `Z(0) = Y(0)`:**\n    *   Use the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    *   `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Z(1) = Y(2)`:**\n    *   Use the formula `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    *   `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate `Z(2) = Y(4)`:**\n    *   Use the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)` with `k=0`.\n    *   `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate `Z(3) = Y(6)`:**\n    *   Use the formula `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)` with `k=2`.\n    *   `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**6. Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n*   By combining the calculated points, we get the final 4-point DFT sequence `Z(k)`.\n    *   `Z(0) = 1`\n    *   `Z(1) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Z(2) = 1`\n    *   `Z(3) = -1 + j`\n*   The final result is the sequence `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
