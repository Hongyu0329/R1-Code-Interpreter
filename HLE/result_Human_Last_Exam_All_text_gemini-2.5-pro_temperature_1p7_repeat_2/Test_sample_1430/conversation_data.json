    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Problem**\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus `g=3` (a genus 3 Riemann surface). Let `X = C^(15)` be its 15th symmetric power, which is the variety parameterizing effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`. We want to find the range of the rank of the Neron-Severi group of `X`, denoted as `ρ(X)`.\n\n**2. Relating ρ(X) to the Jacobian of C**\n\nThe Neron-Severi rank of a symmetric power of a curve is directly related to the Neron-Severi rank of its Jacobian variety. Let `J(C)` be the Jacobian of `C`, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension `g=3`.\n\nA standard result in the theory of algebraic curves, due to Macdonald, gives an isomorphism for the Picard group of the `d`-th symmetric power `C^(d)`:\n`Pic(C^(d)) ≅ Pic(J(C)) ⊕ Z`\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group `ρ` for a smooth projective variety is the rank of its Picard group. Applying this to the isomorphism above, we get a formula for the ranks:\n`ρ(C^(d)) = rank(Pic(J(C))) + rank(Z)`\n`ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\nIn our specific case, `X = C^(15)`, so `d=15` and `g=3`. Thus, we have:\n`ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`\n\nThe problem now simplifies to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**3. Finding the Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nThe rank `ρ(J(C))` depends on the endomorphism algebra of `J(C)`. The Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` can be identified with the group of symmetric endomorphisms of `J(C)` with respect to the Rosati involution defined by the principal polarization.\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs when `J(C)` has the minimal number of endomorphisms. This happens for a \"very general\" curve `C`. For a generic curve `C` of genus `g ≥ 2`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety and its endomorphism ring is as small as possible:\n`End(J(C)) ≅ Z`\n\nThese endomorphisms are multiplications by integers, `[n]`, which are always symmetric. Thus, for a generic `C`:\n`NS(J(C)) ≅ Z`\n\nThis means the rank is `ρ(J(C)) = 1`. This is the minimal possible rank for the Jacobian of a curve of genus `g ≥ 1`.\n\nSubstituting this into our formula for `ρ(X)`:\nSmallest `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C))_min + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n**4. Finding the Largest Possible Rank**\n\nTo find the largest possible rank, we need to consider special curves `C` for which `J(C)` has a large ring of endomorphisms.\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`. For an abelian variety, `h^{1,1}(A) = g^2`. In our case, `J(C)` has dimension `g=3`, so:\n`ρ(J(C)) ≤ h^{1,1}(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9`\n\nThe question is whether this theoretical maximum of 9 can be achieved. The maximum is attained for abelian varieties with maximal complex multiplication (CM). This usually happens when the Jacobian is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with CM.\n\nConsider the Fermat quartic curve, `C_F`, defined in `P^2` by the homogeneous equation:\n`x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`\nThis is a smooth curve of genus `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n\nIt is a classical result that the Jacobian `J(C_F)` of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve `E` which has complex multiplication by `Z[i]` (the Gaussian integers). An example of such a curve `E` is `y^2 = x^3 - x`. Let's denote this by `J(C_F) ~ E^3`.\n\nThe Neron-Severi rank is invariant under isogeny (when considered for `NS(A) ⊗ Q`), so `ρ(J(C_F)) = ρ(E^3)`. The rank `ρ(E^3)` is the dimension of the space of symmetric endomorphisms of `E^3`. The endomorphism algebra `End(E^3) ⊗ Q` is `M_3(Q(i))`. The symmetric elements correspond to 3x3 Hermitian matrices over the field `Q(i)`. The dimension of this space is `g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n\nTherefore, for the Fermat quartic curve `C_F`, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is:\n`ρ(J(C_F)) = 9`\n\nThis shows that the maximum possible rank `ρ(J(C))_max = 9` is achieved.\n\nSubstituting this into our formula for `ρ(X)`:\nLargest `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C))_max + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank of `NS(X)` is **2**, achieved when `C` is a generic genus 3 curve.\n*   The largest possible rank of `NS(X)` is **10**, achieved when `C` is a special curve like the Fermat quartic, whose Jacobian has maximal complex multiplication.\n\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
