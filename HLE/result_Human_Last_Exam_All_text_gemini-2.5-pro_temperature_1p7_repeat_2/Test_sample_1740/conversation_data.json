    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe question asks for the total number of \"members\" of the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans to date. The key is to define what constitutes a \"member\" and to use the most current data from established biological databases like miRBase.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Potential Ambiguities\n1.  **Mature miRNA vs. Precursor Gene:** This is the most important distinction. A \"member\" could refer to:\n    *   **A unique mature miRNA sequence:** For example, the mature sequence `hsa-let-7a-5p`.\n    *   **A precursor miRNA gene (locus):** A single mature miRNA can be encoded by multiple different genes located at different positions in the genome. For example, `hsa-mir-let-7a-1`, `hsa-mir-let-7a-2`, and `hsa-mir-let-7a-3` are three different precursor genes, but they all produce the same mature `hsa-let-7a-5p` miRNA. In scientific literature, counting the precursor genes is a common way to define family size as it reflects genetic complexity.\n\n2.  **Inclusion of other miRNA families:** The let-7 family also includes members that do not have \"let-7\" in their name but share the same seed sequence and function. Specifically, `miR-98` is universally considered a member of the let-7 family.\n\n3.  **Naming Gaps:** The let-7 family nomenclature has gaps. For instance, there are no `let-7h` or `let-7j` members identified in humans.\n\n4.  **Data Source:** The number should be based on the definitive miRNA database, miRBase, which is the central repository for all published microRNA sequences and annotation. The \"to date\" part of the question requires using current information.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Answer\n\nWe will determine the number by counting the precursor miRNA genes, as this is the most common and comprehensive method used in the field.\n\n1.  **List the canonical let-7 family members:** These are the miRNAs with the \"let-7\" prefix.\n    *   `let-7a`\n    *   `let-7b`\n    *   `let-7c`\n    *   `let-7d`\n    *   `let-7e`\n    *   `let-7f`\n    *   `let-7g`\n    *   `let-7i`\n    *   `miR-98` (structurally and functionally a let-7 family member)\n\n    This gives us 9 distinct types of mature let-7 miRNAs.\n\n2.  **Count the number of precursor genes (loci) for each type:**\n    *   **let-7a:** Encoded by **3** distinct genes (`hsa-mir-let-7a-1`, `hsa-mir-let-7a-2`, `hsa-mir-let-7a-3`).\n    *   **let-7b:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7b`).\n    *   **let-7c:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7c`).\n    *   **let-7d:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7d`).\n    *   **let-7e:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7e`).\n    *   **let-7f:** Encoded by **2** distinct genes (`hsa-mir-let-7f-1`, `hsa-mir-let-7f-2`).\n    *   **let-7g:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7g`).\n    *   **let-7i:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-let-7i`).\n    *   **miR-98:** Encoded by **1** gene (`hsa-mir-98`).\n\n3.  **Sum the number of precursor genes:**\n    *   Total genes = (genes for let-7a) + (genes for let-7f) + (genes for all others)\n    *   Total genes = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n    *   Total genes = **12**\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nTo date, there are 9 types of mature let-7 family miRNAs identified in humans (let-7a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i, and miR-98). However, due to gene duplication, these are encoded by a total of 12 distinct precursor genes (or genomic loci). This number (12) is the most widely cited and accurate count for the members of the human let-7 family.\n\n<<<12>>>"
