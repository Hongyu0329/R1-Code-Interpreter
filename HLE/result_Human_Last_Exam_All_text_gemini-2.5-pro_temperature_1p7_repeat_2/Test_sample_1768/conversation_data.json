    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Problem and Key Information**\nWe are given a DNA sequence: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`.\nThe most crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for a protein. A key characteristic of a sequence from the middle of an active ORF is that it should not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). This is the primary criterion we will use to identify the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 2: Define and Test the Possible Reading Frames**\nSince translation occurs in triplets of nucleotides (codons), there are three possible forward reading frames for any given DNA sequence. We will test each one.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Reading Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Reading Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n**Careful Point:** We must carefully check the translation of each frame for the presence of stop codons. The presence of even one stop codon invalidates that frame as the correct ORF.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reading Frame 1**\nWe group the sequence into codons starting from the first nucleotide (`g`).\n\n*   **Sequence:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga ...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gga` -> G (Gly)\n    *   `cat` -> H (His)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early in the sequence. It also contains `taa` and `tga` later on. This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Reading Frame 2**\nWe ignore the first nucleotide and start grouping into codons from the second nucleotide (`g`).\n\n*   **Sequence:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (the final `c` is ignored as it doesn't form a full codon).\n*   **Translation (using one-letter code):**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous protein sequence with no stop codons. This is a very strong candidate for the correct frame.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Reading Frame 3**\nWe ignore the first two nucleotides and start grouping into codons from the third nucleotide (`a`).\n\n*   **Sequence:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `aca` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Ala)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lys)\n    *   `act` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a stop codon (`tga`). It also contains another `tga` later on. This cannot be the correct reading frame.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Acquisition**\nBased on the analysis, only Reading Frame 2 produces a valid protein sequence without any internal stop codons, which is consistent with the sequence originating from the middle of an ORF.\n\n*   **Correct Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLTPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSASSLTPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
