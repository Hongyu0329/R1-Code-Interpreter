    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the core question:** The question asks to identify the known food sources for the *adult* stage of Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\n\n2.  **Research Raphidiopteran Diet:**\n    *   Raphidioptera, commonly known as snakeflies, are an order of insects. It's important to distinguish between the larval and adult diet, as they can differ in insects.\n    *   **Larval diet:** Snakefly larvae are terrestrial predators, feeding on a wide range of small, soft-bodied arthropods, such as aphids, mites, springtails, and the eggs and larvae of other insects.\n    *   **Adult diet:** Adult snakeflies are also primarily predators. Their main diet consists of small, soft-bodied insects, with aphids being a very common prey item. Multiple entomological sources confirm this.\n    *   In addition to being predaceous, many sources also state that adult snakeflies supplement their diet with pollen and nectar. This provides them with carbohydrates for energy.\n\n3.  **Evaluate each answer choice based on the research:**\n\n    *   **A. Nectar:** Based on the research, adult snakeflies are known to feed on nectar. This statement is correct.\n\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** Māhoe (*Melicytus ramiflorus*) is a plant native to New Zealand. Snakeflies (Raphidioptera) are not native to the Southern Hemisphere, including New Zealand; their natural range is the Holarctic realm (North America, Europe, and Asia). Therefore, it is highly unlikely they have been recorded feeding on this specific type of pollen in the wild. While they do eat pollen in general, this specific choice is geographically impossible for a natural interaction.\n\n    *   **C. Fungus:** There is no scientific evidence to suggest that adult snakeflies are fungivores (fungus-eaters). Their primary feeding habits are predatory and nectarivorous/pollinivorous. This statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Karamū (*Coprosma robusta*) is another plant native to New Zealand. More importantly, adult snakeflies are not herbivores that consume leaf tissue (phytophagous). Their mouthparts are adapted for chewing small insects, not for grinding plant matter. This statement is incorrect.\n\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Totara (*Podocarpus totara*) is a tree native to New Zealand. The crucial part of this option is \"Aphids\". As established, adult snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids. While they wouldn't naturally encounter \"Totara Aphids\" due to geographic separation, they readily prey on any available aphid species. Therefore, \"Aphids\" is a correct food source. The specific type is less relevant than the food category itself, which is correct.\n\n4.  **Analyze the combination choices:**\n\n    *   **F. A and E:** This option combines \"Nectar\" and \"Totara Aphids\". We have determined that Nectar (A) is a correct food source and Aphids (E) are a correct food source. Therefore, this combination accurately reflects the known diet of adult snakeflies.\n\n    *   **G. D and E:** This option combines \"Karamū leaf tissue\" and \"Totara Aphids\". Since D (leaf tissue) is incorrect, this entire option is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both nectar and aphids are recorded food sources for adult Raphidiopterans. Option F is the only choice that correctly includes both of these established dietary components. The New Zealand-specific plant names are likely distractors to test knowledge of the core food types.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Life Stage:** The question specifies *adult* Raphidiopterans. Always pay attention to the life stage as diets can change.\n*   **Geographic Distribution:** The mention of New Zealand native plants (Māhoe, Karamū, Totara) is a potential red herring. Raphidioptera are not found in New Zealand. The question asks what they have been \"recorded feeding on,\" which implies looking past the specific species to the general food type (pollen, leaf tissue, aphids).\n*   **Diet Type:** It is crucial to know the primary and secondary food sources. They are mainly predators, but the supplemental feeding on nectar and pollen is also well-documented.\n*   **Evaluating Combinations:** When combination answers exist (like F and G), you must validate each individual component before accepting the combination.\n\nBased on the analysis, adult Raphidiopterans feed on both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
