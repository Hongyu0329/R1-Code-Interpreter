    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the coordinates of the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm for a line between (1, 1) and (11, 5).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Calculate Deltas and Determine Slope**\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in x and y coordinates (dx and dy) to understand the line's properties.\n*   Start point (x₁, y₁) = (1, 1)\n*   End point (x₂, y₂) = (11, 5)\n*   **dx** = x₂ - x₁ = 11 - 1 = 10\n*   **dy** = y₂ - y₁ = 5 - 1 = 4\n\nThe slope (m) is dy/dx = 4/10 = 0.4.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the slope is between 0 and 1 (0 < m < 1), Bresenham's algorithm will increment the x-coordinate by 1 at each step and decide whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\n**2. Determine the Number of Pixels and Find the Center**\n\nThe algorithm generates one pixel for each increment of the major axis (in this case, x).\n*   The number of pixels generated is `dx + 1`.\n*   Total pixels = 10 + 1 = 11.\n*   **Careful Point:** With an odd number of pixels, there is a single unique central pixel. Its position in the sequence is `(Total pixels + 1) / 2`.\n*   Index of the central pixel = (11 + 1) / 2 = **6th pixel**.\n\nOur goal is now to find the coordinates of the 6th pixel generated by the algorithm.\n\n**3. Apply Bresenham's Line Algorithm**\n\nWe will now generate the sequence of pixels step by step.\n*   **Initial Decision Parameter (p₀):**\n    The formula for a slope between 0 and 1 is `p = 2*dy - dx`.\n    p₀ = 2 * 4 - 10 = 8 - 10 = -2.\n*   **Iteration Rules:**\n    *   If `p < 0`, the next point is (x+1, y) and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2*dy`.\n    *   If `p ≥ 0`, the next point is (x+1, y+1) and `p` is updated by `p = p + 2*dy - 2*dx`.\n\n*   **Pixel Generation:**\n    *   **Pixel 1:** The starting point is **(1, 1)**. Current `p = -2`.\n\n    *   **Iteration 1 (for Pixel 2):**\n        *   `p` is -2 (< 0), so we plot (x+1, y).\n        *   **Pixel 2: (2, 1)**\n        *   Update `p`: p = -2 + 2*dy = -2 + 8 = 6.\n\n    *   **Iteration 2 (for Pixel 3):**\n        *   `p` is 6 (≥ 0), so we plot (x+1, y+1).\n        *   **Pixel 3: (3, 2)**\n        *   Update `p`: p = 6 + 2*dy - 2*dx = 6 + 8 - 20 = -6.\n\n    *   **Iteration 3 (for Pixel 4):**\n        *   `p` is -6 (< 0), so we plot (x+1, y).\n        *   **Pixel 4: (4, 2)**\n        *   Update `p`: p = -6 + 2*dy = -6 + 8 = 2.\n\n    *   **Iteration 4 (for Pixel 5):**\n        *   `p` is 2 (≥ 0), so we plot (x+1, y+1).\n        *   **Pixel 5: (5, 3)**\n        *   Update `p`: p = 2 + 2*dy - 2*dx = 2 + 8 - 20 = -10.\n\n    *   **Iteration 5 (for Pixel 6):**\n        *   `p` is -10 (< 0), so we plot (x+1, y).\n        *   **Pixel 6: (6, 3)**\n        *   Update `p`: p = -10 + 2*dy = -10 + 8 = -2.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWe have identified the 6th pixel in the sequence, which is the central pixel.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<(6, 3)>>>"
