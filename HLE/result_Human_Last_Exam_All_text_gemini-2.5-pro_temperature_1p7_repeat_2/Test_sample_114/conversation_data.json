    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the question**: The task is to find which word from the given list is **NOT** used as a rhyming word by Chaucer in his poem, \"The Book of the Duchess\". This means we need to check if each word appears at the end of a line and rhymes with another word in the poem.\n\n2.  **Examine choice A: \"Wente\"**\n    *   **Meaning**: \"Wente\" is the Middle English word for \"went\".\n    *   **Careful Point**: We need to find if \"wente\" is at the end of a line and paired with a rhyming word.\n    *   **Textual Evidence**: In lines 139-140, we find the couplet:\n        > The messager took leve and **wente**\n        > Upon his wey, and never ne **stente**\n    *   **Conclusion**: \"Wente\" rhymes with \"stente\" (meaning \"stopped\" or \"ceased\"). So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente\".\n\n3.  **Examine choice B: \"Here\"**\n    *   **Meaning**: \"Here\".\n    *   **Careful Point**: \"Here\" is a very common word and is frequently used for rhymes in Middle English poetry, often with words like \"dere\" (dear), \"chere\" (cheer/expression), \"manere\" (manner), etc. Sometimes the variant \"there\" is used interchangeably for the rhyme.\n    *   **Textual Evidence**: While direct rhymes with \"here\" exist, a clear example of the sound being used in a rhyme is in lines 119-120:\n        > 'Awak!' quod he, 'who is, lyth **there**?'\n        > And blew his horn right in her **ere**,\n    *   **Conclusion**: The \"-ere\" sound is fundamental to the poem's rhyme schemes. Chaucer definitely makes rhymes with \"here\" and its close variants.\n\n4.  **Examine choice C: \"Fool\"**\n    *   **Meaning**: \"Fool\" (can be spelled \"fole\" in Middle English).\n    *   **Careful Point**: We need to find \"fool\" or \"fole\" at the end of a line rhyming with another word.\n    *   **Textual Evidence**: In lines 527-528 (in some editions), the narrator says to the Man in Black:\n        > Y trowe ye be a **fole**\n        > For to axen that I nil **oole**.\n    *   **Conclusion**: \"Fole\" (fool) rhymes with \"oole\" (a form of \"will\" or \"be willing\"). So, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"fool\".\n\n5.  **Examine choice D: \"Hool\"**\n    *   **Meaning**: \"Hool\" is the Middle English word for \"whole\".\n    *   **Careful Point**: We must search the entire poem to see if \"hool\" ever appears at the end of a line as part of a rhyme.\n    *   **Textual Evidence**: The word \"hool\" appears in the poem, but only in the middle of a line. For instance:\n        *   Line 556 (numbering may vary): \"...ye may be **hool** agayne.\"\n        *   Line 937: \"So **hool** enclyned to alle gode\"\n    *   **Conclusion**: Since \"hool\" is never positioned at the end of a line, it cannot be used to make a rhyme. Chaucer does NOT make a rhyme with this word.\n\n6.  **Examine choice E: \"Countour\"**\n    *   **Meaning**: \"Countour\" can mean \"accountant\" or a \"counting board/abacus\".\n    *   **Careful Point**: This is a less common word. We need to see if it is used in a rhyme. Chaucer sometimes uses a specific type of rhyme called *rime riche*, where a word rhymes with itself but has a different meaning in each instance.\n    *   **Textual Evidence**: In lines 435-436, Chaucer employs this exact technique:\n        > Thogh Argus, the noble **countour**,\n        > Sete to rekene in his **countour**\n    *   **Conclusion**: In the first line, \"countour\" means accountant. In the second, it means a counting board. This is a valid rhyme in Chaucer's style. Therefore, he does make a rhyme with \"countour\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, \"wente,\" \"here,\" \"fool,\" and \"countour\" are all used by Chaucer to make rhymes in \"The Book of the Duchess.\" The word \"hool\" appears in the poem but never at the end of a line, and thus is not used in a rhyme.\n\n<<<D>>>"
