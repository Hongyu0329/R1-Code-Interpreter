    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nLet's define our terms carefully:\n*   **Graph `G` on `n=128` vertices:** A graph `G=(V, E)` where `|V| = 128`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` is the graph with vertex set `S` and edge set containing all edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Clique:** A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** We are looking for a subset of vertices `S` of size `k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a `K_k`.\n*   **Number of Different Clique Sizes:** This is the count of distinct integers `k` for which an induced `K_k` exists in the graph `G`.\n\nLet `C(G)` be the set of all integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`. The question asks for the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` over all graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Structure of the Set of Clique Sizes**\n\nThe crucial step is to understand the properties of the set `C(G)`.\n\n**Key Property:** If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k` (where `k > 1`), then it must also contain an induced clique of size `k-1`.\n\n**Proof of the Property:**\n1.  Assume `k \\in C(G)` for `k > 1`. By definition, this means there exists a set of vertices `S ⊆ V` with `|S| = k` such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph `K_k`.\n2.  Since `G[S]` is a `K_k`, every pair of distinct vertices in `S` is connected by an edge in `G`.\n3.  Let's choose any vertex `v` from `S` and form a new set `S' = S \\setminus \\{v\\}`. The size of this new set is `|S'| = k - 1`.\n4.  Now consider the induced subgraph `G[S']`. Its vertices are the `k-1` vertices in `S'`. Its edges are all edges of `G` with both endpoints in `S'`.\n5.  Since `S'` is a subset of `S`, and every pair of vertices in `S` is connected in `G`, it follows that every pair of vertices in `S'` is also connected in `G`.\n6.  Therefore, the induced subgraph `G[S']` is a complete graph on `k-1` vertices, i.e., `G[S']` is a `K_{k-1}`.\n7.  This shows that `k-1 \\in C(G)`.\n\nThis property implies that if the largest induced clique in a graph `G` has size `m`, then `C(G)` must contain all integers from `1` to `m`. Assuming the graph has at least one vertex (which it does, `n=128`), there will always be an induced `K_1`. Therefore, for any non-empty graph `G`, the set of its induced clique sizes is always of the form `C(G) = \\{1, 2, ..., m\\}`, where `m` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\n\n**3. Reframing the Problem**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 2, the number of different clique sizes `|C(G)|` is equal to `m`, the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\nSo, the problem is transformed into a much simpler one:\n\n**\"What is the maximum possible size of an induced clique in any graph on `n=128` vertices?\"**\n\n**4. Solving the Simplified Problem**\n\nLet `G` be a graph on `n = 128` vertices. Let `m` be the size of an induced clique in `G`.\n1.  An induced clique of size `m` requires a set of `m` distinct vertices.\n2.  The total number of vertices available in the graph is 128.\n3.  Therefore, the size of any induced clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. This gives us an upper bound: `m ≤ 128`.\n4.  This means the maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot be more than 128.\n\n**5. Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to show that there exists at least one graph on 128 vertices that actually achieves this number.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** `G = K_{128}`.\n*   This graph has exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n*   Let's determine the set of induced clique sizes, `C(K_{128})`.\n*   The largest possible induced clique is the graph itself. The entire set of 128 vertices forms an induced `K_{128}`. So, `128 \\in C(K_{128})`.\n*   As per our property from Step 2, since `128 \\in C(K_{128})`, the set of induced clique sizes must be `C(K_{128}) = \\{1, 2, ..., 128\\}`.\n*   Alternatively, for any integer `k` between 1 and 128, we can choose any subset of `k` vertices from `K_{128}`. The subgraph induced by these `k` vertices will be a `K_k`.\n*   Thus, for the graph `G = K_{128}`, the set of different induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is `|C(K_{128})| = 128`.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established that for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, the number of different induced clique sizes cannot exceed 128. We have also constructed a specific graph, `K_{128}`, for which the number of different induced clique sizes is exactly 128.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
