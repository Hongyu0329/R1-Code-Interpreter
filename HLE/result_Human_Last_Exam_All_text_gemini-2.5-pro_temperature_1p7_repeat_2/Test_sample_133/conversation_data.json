    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Connect 4 game state to find the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n\n**1. Goal Definition**\nThe objective is to find all the moves for 'O' that lead to a win in the minimum number of turns. This means we first look for a win on this turn (a \"win-in-1\"). If none exists, we look for a move that forces a win on the next turn (a \"win-in-2\"), and so on.\n\n**2. Current Board State Analysis**\n- Player 'X' has pieces at: a6, c5, d6, e6, e5, f5, g6, g5.\n- Player 'O' has pieces at: a5, b6, c6, d5, d4, e4, f6.\n- It is 'O's turn to move.\n- The available moves are the lowest empty spaces in each column: a4, b5, c4, d3, e3, f4, g4.\n\n**3. Searching for an Immediate Win (Win-in-1)**\nAn immediate win would be placing an 'O' to complete a line of four 'O's (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\n- **Vertical Check:**\n    - Column d has 'O's at d5 and d4. Playing at d3 would create a line of three, but not four. No other column has a vertical win opportunity.\n- **Horizontal Check:**\n    - Row 4 has 'O's at d4 and e4. To win, 'O' needs two more adjacent pieces, for example at c4 and f4. This is not possible in a single move.\n- **Diagonal Check:**\n    - There is a diagonal line of three 'O's at c6, d5, and e4. To win with this line, 'O' needs to place a piece at f3. However, the space f3 is not available; the next available space in column f is f4. Therefore, 'O' cannot win on this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no moves for 'O' to win immediately.\n\n**4. Searching for a Forced Win on the Next Turn (Win-in-2)**\nA forced win is typically created by setting up a \"double threat,\" where 'O' creates two different winning opportunities at the same time, and 'X' can only block one of them in the next move.\n\nLet's analyze the promising available moves:\n\n- **Move c4:**\n    - If 'O' plays at **c4**, a horizontal line of three 'O's is formed at c4, d4, e4 (`- O O O -`).\n    - This creates two empty spots that would complete a line of four: **b4** and **f4**.\n    - It becomes 'X's turn. 'X' must block one of these threats.\n    - If 'X' plays at b4, 'O' plays at f4 on the next turn and wins with c4-d4-e4-f4.\n    - If 'X' plays at f4, 'O' plays at b4 on the next turn and wins with b4-c4-d4-e4.\n    - Since 'X' can only block one spot, 'O' is guaranteed to win on the next turn. Thus, **c4** is an optimal move.\n\n- **Move f4:**\n    - If 'O' plays at **f4**, a horizontal line of three 'O's is formed at d4, e4, f4 (`- O O O -`).\n    - This creates two empty spots that would complete a line of four: **c4** and **g4**.\n    - It becomes 'X's turn. 'X' must block one of these threats.\n    - If 'X' plays at c4, 'O' plays at g4 on the next turn and wins with d4-e4-f4-g4.\n    - If 'X' plays at g4, 'O' plays at c4 on the next turn and wins with c4-d4-e4-f4.\n    - This is also a guaranteed win for 'O' on the next turn. Thus, **f4** is also an optimal move.\n\n- **Move d3:**\n    - If 'O' plays at d3, it creates a vertical line of three 'O's at d5, d4, d3.\n    - This creates a single threat: 'O' can win on the next turn by playing at d2.\n    - 'X' is forced to play at d2 to block this win.\n    - After 'X' blocks at d2, it is 'O's turn again. 'O' has not won and must find a new way to create a threat. This path is slower than playing c4 or f4. Therefore, d3 is not an optimal move.\n\n- **Other Moves (a4, b5, e3, g4):**\n    - These moves do not create an immediate double threat or a forced win. For example, playing at g4 creates the formation `O[d4] O[e4] . O[g4]`, which threatens to win only at f4. 'X' can simply block by playing at f4, and 'O' does not have a guaranteed win on the next turn.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\nThe fastest way for 'O' to win is to secure a win on the very next turn. The analysis shows that there are exactly two moves that achieve this: c4 and f4. Both moves create an unstoppable horizontal threat.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
