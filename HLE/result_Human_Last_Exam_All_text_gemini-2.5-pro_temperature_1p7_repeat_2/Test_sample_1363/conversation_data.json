    "*   **Step 1: Understand the core question.**\n    The question asks to identify the specific ballroom dance where \"overturning a reverse turn\" is considered a technical impossibility or a fundamental violation of the dance's core principles. A \"reverse turn\" is a turn to the left. \"Overturning\" means rotating more than the standard prescribed amount for that figure. \"Without disregarding the technique\" is the crucial part; it means the action cannot be performed while adhering to the fundamental rules of that dance.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the technique of each dance.**\n    We need to look at the five standard ballroom dances listed and consider the nature of their technique, specifically regarding rotation and turns. The dances can be broadly categorized into \"swing dances\" and \"non-swing\" or \"staccato\" dances.\n\n    *   **Swing Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, rise and fall, and body sway.\n        *   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** In these dances, the reverse turn is a fundamental figure. While there is a \"textbook\" amount of turn (e.g., 3/4 of a turn over three steps), it is a very common and accepted technical variation to \"overturn\" this figure, especially to navigate a corner of the ballroom. Dancers use body sway and momentum to generate this extra rotation. It is not a disregard of technique but rather an application of advanced technique for floorcraft.\n        *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is almost entirely continuous rotation. The amount of turn is inherently variable to navigate the floor with other couples. Overturning or underturning the Reverse Fleckerl (the left-turning figure) is necessary and not a technical fault.\n        *   **E. Quickstep:** This dance shares many principles with the Foxtrot. It's fast and dynamic, and overturning figures like the Reverse Turn is a common and necessary tool for floorcraft and choreography.\n\n    *   **Non-Swing Dance (Tango):**\n        *   **C. European Tango:** Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is built on a set of \"anti-swing\" principles:\n            *   **No Body Sway:** The body is held strong and still, without the side-to-side sway used in other dances to generate momentum.\n            *   **No Rise and Fall:** Movement is kept level or \"flat.\"\n            *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, deliberate, and have a clipped feeling, rather than being continuous and flowing.\n            *   **Footwork:** Feet are picked up and placed, not skimmed across the floor.\n\n*   **Step 3: Apply the concept of \"overturning\" to Tango.**\n    The Tango Reverse Turn is executed with these principles in mind. It is a sharp, controlled pivot. To achieve more rotation than the figure allows (to \"overturn\" it), a dancer would have to introduce elements that are forbidden in Tango technique. They would need to create rotational momentum, which would almost certainly involve using body sway and a swinging action. This would fundamentally break the staccato character, the flat movement, and the \"no sway\" rule of the dance. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn *without disregarding the technique*. Doing so would cease to be a correct Tango action.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude.**\n    In the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz), overturning a reverse turn is a permissible and often necessary technical variation. In European Tango, the core principles of the dance (no sway, no continuous flow, staccato action) make overturning a reverse turn a direct violation of its fundamental technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
