    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to an amide group (-CONH2).\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH2CH3) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, giving a `-CON(CH2CH3)2` group. This is the primary functional group and defines the numbering of the benzene ring, with the point of attachment at C1.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, `-N(CH3)2`, is located at the C3 position of the benzene ring (meta to the amide group).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CON(Et)2\n      /\n(C1)-- (C2)-H\n //   \\\\\n(H-C6)   (C3) -- N(Me)2\n \\\\   //\n  (C5)--(C4)\n    |     |\n    H     H\n```\n\n**2. Analyze the First Step: Reaction with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF**\n\n*   **Reagents**:\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium)**: A very strong organometallic base.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine)**: A chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li+). It increases the basicity of the sec-butyl anion by breaking up sec-BuLi aggregates and makes the base more reactive.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran)**: A polar aprotic solvent that is stable to the strong base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This set of reagents is standard for a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. This reaction involves the deprotonation of a C-H bond that is positioned ortho (adjacent) to a \"directing group\".\n*   **Identifying the Directing Groups and Site of Deprotonation**:\n    1.  The starting material has two potential directing groups (DMGs): the `-CON(Et)2` group at C1 and the `-N(Me)2` group at C3.\n    2.  The directing ability of functional groups has been well-studied. The amide group (`-CONR2`) is a significantly stronger directing group than the amino group (`-NR2`). This is because the carbonyl oxygen of the amide is a very effective Lewis base that coordinates strongly with the lithium ion.\n    3.  Since `-CON(Et)2` is the strongest directing group, deprotonation will occur at one of its ortho positions: C2 or C6.\n    4.  We must now consider the influence of the second group, `-N(Me)2` at C3. The C2 position is ortho to the `-CON(Et)2` group *and* also ortho to the `-N(Me)2` group. The C6 position is ortho to `-CON(Et)2` but para to `-N(Me)2`.\n    5.  The deprotonation at C2 is favored by *both* directing groups. This is a **cooperative directing effect**, which makes the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and the preferred site for metalation. The lithium ion is chelated by both the amide oxygen and the amine nitrogen, forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate that directs the base to abstract the C2 proton.\n*   **Intermediate Formed**: An aryllithium species is formed where the hydrogen at C2 is replaced by lithium.\n    `N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide`\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Step: Reaction with Methyl Iodide**\n\n*   **Reagent**: **Methyl iodide (CH3I)**.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). Methyl iodide is an electrophile, with an electrophilic carbon atom due to the polar C-I bond and the good leaving group ability of iodide (I-). The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution.\n*   **Mechanism**: The nucleophilic carbon at C2 of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the methyl group of `CH3I`. The iodide ion is displaced as a leaving group, and a new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n**4. Determine the Final Product**\n\n*   A methyl group (`-CH3`) is introduced at the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n*   The final product's structure is the same as the starting material, but with a hydrogen at C2 replaced by a methyl group.\n*   The name of the resulting compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Recognize the reaction as a Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM).\n*   Correctly identify the two directing groups on the ring: `-CON(Et)2` and `-N(Me)2`.\n*   Compare the relative directing strengths of these two groups (`-CON(Et)2` >> `-N(Me)2`).\n*   Identify the synergistic directing effect of both groups towards the C2 position, making it the exclusive site of lithiation.\n*   Recognize the subsequent reaction with methyl iodide as a standard electrophilic quench of the aryllithium intermediate.\n\nThe final compound is obtained by replacing the hydrogen at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
