    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisk\"**\n\nThe question refers to the Luxor Obelisk. It's crucial to know that there are two of them:\n1.  **The Obelisk at the Luxor Temple** in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  **The Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde** in Paris, France. This obelisk was originally from the Luxor Temple and was gifted to France by Egypt in the 19th century.\n\nA film depicting either of these locations would satisfy the question's criteria.\n\n### **Step 2: Create a Chronological List of Potential Best Picture Winners**\n\nWe must analyze the Best Picture winners in the order they won, starting from the first award ceremony. We can skip films with settings clearly outside of Egypt or Paris (e.g., *Cimarron*, *Gone with the Wind*, *On the Waterfront*). The most likely candidates will be films set in Paris.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Candidates in Chronological Order**\n\n1.  **1927/1928 - *Wings***: Set during World War I. While some scenes are in France, they are primarily on battlefields and at airfields. It does not feature scenic shots of Parisian landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n\n2.  **1929/1930 - *All Quiet on the Western Front***: Set on the German front lines during WWI. Does not depict Paris or Luxor.\n\n3.  **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This is a strong early candidate as it is set almost entirely in Paris. The film covers the life of the French writer and the Dreyfus Affair. However, the film's style focuses more on interiors (courtrooms, offices, homes) and specific historical locations like the Ã‰cole Militaire for Dreyfus's degradation ceremony. It does not feature any scenes set at the Place de la Concorde showing the obelisk.\n\n4.  **1943 - *Casablanca***: Set in Morocco, not Egypt or Paris. No Luxor Obelisk is shown.\n\n5.  **1951 - *An American in Paris***: This is a very strong candidate. The film is a musical explicitly celebrating the city of Paris. The famous 17-minute final ballet sequence is a dreamlike journey through stylized versions of Parisian landmarks. One of the lavish sets in this sequence is a clear representation of the **Place de la Concorde**, featuring its fountains and the central **Luxor Obelisk**.\n\n6.  **1956 - *Around the World in 80 Days***: This film's global journey includes stops in both Paris and Egypt. However, the stop in Egypt is at Suez, on the way to India, not Luxor which is far to the south along the Nile. The time spent in Paris is very brief and does not include a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde. Even if it did, it would be five years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n7.  **1958 - *Gigi***: Another musical set in Paris, and also directed by Vincente Minnelli. It features many beautiful on-location shots of the city. However, it won the award for 1958, seven years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n### **Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the winners chronologically, we find that earlier Paris-set films like *The Life of Emile Zola* did not feature the specific landmark in question. The first film to definitively show it is *An American in Paris*, which won the award for 1951. Its celebrated final ballet sequence includes an unmistakable depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer:** The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was **An American in Paris (1951)**. The obelisk, located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, is shown during the film's extended final ballet sequence.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
