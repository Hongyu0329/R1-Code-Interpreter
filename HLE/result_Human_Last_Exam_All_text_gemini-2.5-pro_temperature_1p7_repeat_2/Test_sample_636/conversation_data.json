    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a system with:\n*   State matrix: `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix, defined as `A_cl = A + BF`, has its eigenvalues at the desired locations `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system is what determines its eigenvalues. If the desired eigenvalues are `λ_1 = -1 + j` and `λ_2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is given by:\n\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ_1)(λ - λ_2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2` with `a = λ + 1` and `b = j`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\nSo, the characteristic equation of our target closed-loop system is `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**3. Define the Feedback Matrix `F` and Form the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input vector `u` is 2x1 (since `B` is 2x2). The feedback matrix `F` must have dimensions compatible with the feedback law, which results in `F` being a 2x2 matrix. Let `F` be:\n`F = [f1, f2; f3, f4]`\n\nNow, we calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f1, f2; f3, f4] = [1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4; 1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4] = [f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4; f1, f2]`\n\nNext, calculate `A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4; f1, f2] = [-1 + f1 + 2f3, 1 + f2 + 2f4; 1 + f1, f2]`\n\n**4. Derive the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`.\n`λI - A_cl = [λ - (-1 + f1 + 2f3), -(1 + f2 + 2f4); -(1 + f1), λ - f2]`\n`λI - A_cl = [λ + 1 - f1 - 2f3, -1 - f2 - 2f4; -1 - f1, λ - f2]`\n\nNow, calculate the determinant:\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 - f1 - 2f3)(λ - f2) - (-1 - f2 - 2f4)(-1 - f1)`\n`det(λI - A_cl) = λ^2 + λ(1 - f1 - f2 - 2f3) - f2(1 - f1 - 2f3) - (1 + f1)(1 + f2 + 2f4)`\nExpanding this expression gives a polynomial in `λ` with coefficients that are functions of `f1, f2, f3, f4`.\n\n**5. Simplify the Problem and Solve for `F`**\n\nWe have four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`) but only two equations (from comparing coefficients of `λ^1` and `λ^0`). This means the solution is not unique. This is typical for multi-input systems. To find *a* solution, we can simplify the problem by making a reasonable assumption. A common approach is to set one of the input feedback paths to zero. Let's assume the second input is not used for feedback, which means the second row of `F` is zero.\nLet `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nSo, `F = [f1, f2; 0, 0]`\n\nLet's re-calculate `A_cl` with this simplified `F`:\n`BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f1, f2; 0, 0] = [f1, f2; f1, f2]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f1, f2; f1, f2] = [-1 + f1, 1 + f2; 1 + f1, f2]`\n\nNow, find the characteristic polynomial of this simplified `A_cl`:\n`det(λI - A_cl) = det([λ + 1 - f1, -1 - f2; -1 - f1, λ - f2])`\n`= (λ + 1 - f1)(λ - f2) - (-1 - f2)(-1 - f1)`\n`= (λ^2 + λ - f1λ - f2λ - f2 + f1f2) - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1f2)`\n`= λ^2 + λ(1 - f1 - f2) - f2 + f1f2 - 1 - f1 - f2 - f1f2`\n`= λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2f2)`\n\n**6. Equate Coefficients and Solve**\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial, `λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing the `λ^1` coefficients:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`\n    `(1) -f1 - f2 = 1`\n\n*   Comparing the `λ^0` (constant) coefficients:\n    `-1 - f1 - 2f2 = 2`\n    `(2) -f1 - 2f2 = 3`\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (`f1, f2`). We can solve this system. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n`(-f1 - 2f2) - (-f1 - f2) = 3 - 1`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nNow substitute `f2 = -2` back into equation (1):\n`-f1 - (-2) = 1`\n`-f1 + 2 = 1`\n`-f1 = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`. With our assumption that `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the feedback matrix `F` is:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Convention:** The problem uses `A + BF` for the closed-loop system. Be careful not to use the more common `A - BF` convention, as it would change the sign of the final answer for `F`.\n2.  **Controllability:** For arbitrary eigenvalue placement to be possible, the system must be controllable. The controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` for this system has a rank of 2 (since `det(B) = -2 ≠ 0`), which equals the order of the system. Therefore, the system is controllable, and a solution exists.\n3.  **Non-Uniqueness of Solution:** Because the system is multi-input (the rank of `B` is 2), there are more degrees of freedom than constraints when designing the feedback controller. This means there is no unique solution for `F`. The choice to set the second row of `F` to zero is one of many possible simplifying assumptions that lead to one valid solution. Other assumptions would lead to different, but also valid, `F` matrices.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe state feedback gain `F` that places the closed-loop eigenvalues at `-1 ± j` is calculated by forming the desired characteristic polynomial and equating its coefficients with those of the actual closed-loop system `A+BF`. By assuming a simplified structure for `F` (e.g., `F = [f1, f2; 0, 0]`), we solve for the unknown elements. The resulting gain matrix is:\n\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
