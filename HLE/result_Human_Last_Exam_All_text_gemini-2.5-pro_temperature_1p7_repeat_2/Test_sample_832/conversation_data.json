    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for a specific number of a particular ballet step performed in a very specific context. Let's break down the key components:\n*   **Ballet & Scene:** *La Bayadère*, specifically the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene (Act 2 finale in the Grigorovich version).\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Performance:** Her debut in the role of Nikiya.\n*   **Company & Year:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2009.\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Entrelacé*.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Ballet Step - *Entrelacé*\n*   The full term is *jeté entrelacé*.\n*   It is a grand jump where the dancer throws one leg into the air (as in a *grand battement*), pushes off the supporting foot, and performs a half-turn in the air, landing on the first leg while the second leg is brought up into an arabesque position.\n*   It is a visually dramatic step known for its height and the whipping motion of the legs. In Nikiya's variation, these jumps are performed consecutively in a circle (*manège*) or across a diagonal, forming a choreographic climax.\n\n### Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance\nTo answer the question, we must analyze the visual record of the specified performance. Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya at the Bolshoi in 2009 is a well-documented and famous performance, available on video platforms.\nThe \"Death of Nikiya\" scene involves Nikiya being presented with a basket of flowers (a gift from Gamzatti, containing a poisonous snake) while she performs a solo dance filled with sorrow and longing.\n\n### Step 4: Count the *Entrelacés* in the Variation\nWatching the specific variation from the 2009 Bolshoi recording, we can identify the key sequence of jumps.\n1.  Osipova begins her variation with slower, more expressive movements, including balances and turns.\n2.  Towards the middle of the variation, the music tempo increases, leading into the sequence of jumps.\n3.  She begins a diagonal or circular path across the stage, executing the *entrelacés* one after another without a break.\n4.  Carefully counting each individual jump in this continuous sequence reveals the following:\n    *   First *entrelacé*\n    *   Second *entrelacé*\n    *   Third *entrelacé*\n    *   Fourth *entrelacé*\n    *   Fifth *entrelacé*\n    *   Sixth *entrelacé*\n5.  After the sixth and final *entrelacé* in this manège, she transitions into a different sequence of steps (chaîné turns) to conclude the variation before the snake emerges from the basket.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Correct Performance:** It is crucial to watch the correct video. Different dancers or different productions might have slightly varied choreography. The 2009 Grigorovich production for the Bolshoi with Osipova is the specific subject.\n*   **Correct Identification of the Step:** The jumps must be correctly identified as *entrelacés* and not confused with other turning jumps. The characteristic turn and landing in arabesque are the key identifiers.\n*   **Counting Only within the Variation:** The question specifies the \"variation\". This refers to her solo dance. We must not count any other similar steps that might appear elsewhere in the scene or the ballet. In this case, they are all contained within a single, continuous phrase of her solo.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy meticulously analyzing the video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, we can confirm that in the climactic sequence of her solo variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, she performs a total of six *entrelacés*.\n\n<<<6>>>"
