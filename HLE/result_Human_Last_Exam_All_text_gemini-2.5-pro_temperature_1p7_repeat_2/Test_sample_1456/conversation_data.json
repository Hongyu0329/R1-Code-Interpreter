    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point *p* in a continuum *X*, the composant of *p*, denoted *C(p)*, is the set of all points *q* in *X* such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of *X* containing both *p* and *q*. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum not equal to *X*). The relation \"*q* is in the composant of *p*\" is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are the composants of the space *X*.\n    *   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua *X* and *Y*, their product *X* × *Y* is the Cartesian product endowed with the product topology. It is also a continuum.\n    *   **The Goal:** Find the *largest possible number* of composants that the product space *X* × *Y* can have, where *X* and *Y* are any two nondegenerate continua.\n\n2.  **Key Theorems about Composants:**\n    *   A continuum is called **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is called **indecomposable**.\n    *   **Theorem 1:** A continuum has exactly one composant if and only if it is decomposable. In a decomposable continuum, the single composant is the entire space itself.\n    *   **Theorem 2 (Mazurkiewicz):** An indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. More specifically, it has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., |ℝ|) distinct composants.\n    *   From these two theorems, we can conclude that any continuum has either **1** or **c** composants.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Product Space *X* × *Y***:\n    *   Since we are looking for the *largest possible* number of composants, and the only possibilities are 1 and **c**, we want to see if it is possible for the product *X* × *Y* to have **c** composants.\n    *   According to the theorems above, *X* × *Y* has **c** composants if and only if it is an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   This leads to the central question: Under what conditions is the product of two continua, *X* × *Y*, indecomposable?\n\n4.  **Key Theorem about the Product of Continua:**\n    *   **Theorem 3 (Bing, Kuratowski):** The product *X* × *Y* of two continua is indecomposable if and only if **both** *X* and *Y* are indecomposable.\n    *   Conversely, if at least one of the continua *X* or *Y* is decomposable, then their product *X* × *Y* is also decomposable.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   Our goal is to maximize the number of composants of *X* × *Y*. The maximum possible value is **c**.\n    *   To achieve **c** composants, the product space *X* × *Y* must be indecomposable.\n    *   For *X* × *Y* to be indecomposable, both *X* and *Y* must be indecomposable continua.\n    *   The problem allows us to choose *X* and *Y* freely, as long as they are nondegenerate continua. So, we must check if nondegenerate indecomposable continua exist.\n    *   Yes, such continua exist. Famous examples include the **pseudo-arc** and the **Knaster continuum (or bucket-handle continuum)**. These are all nondegenerate and indecomposable.\n    *   Therefore, we can select *X* to be a pseudo-arc and *Y* to be a pseudo-arc. Both are nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n    *   Their product, *X* × *Y*, will be an indecomposable continuum according to Theorem 3.\n    *   As an indecomposable continuum, *X* × *Y* will have **c** composants, according to Theorem 2.\n    *   Since **c** is the highest possible number of composants for any continuum, this is the largest possible number for the product space.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Nondegenerate Condition:** The condition that the continua are nondegenerate is crucial. If *X* were a single point (degenerate), then *X* × *Y* would be homeomorphic to *Y*, and the number of composants would just be the number of composants of *Y*. The \"nondegenerate\" constraint ensures we are dealing with a genuine product of two non-trivial spaces.\n*   **Existence of Indecomposable Continua:** The entire argument rests on the existence of indecomposable continua that we can use for *X* and *Y*. Topology provides many such examples.\n*   **The Number \"c\":** This represents the cardinality of the set of real numbers. It is an uncountable infinity. The number of composants is not just \"uncountable,\" but specifically of cardinality **c**.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation:\nThe number of composants of any given continuum can only be 1 (if decomposable) or **c** (if indecomposable). To find the *largest possible* number, we must check if we can construct a product *X* × *Y* that has **c** composants. This is possible if and only if *X* × *Y* is indecomposable. This, in turn, is possible if and only if both *X* and *Y* are themselves indecomposable. Since nondegenerate indecomposable continua exist, we can choose them for *X* and *Y*. The resulting product will have **c** composants. Therefore, the largest possible number is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
