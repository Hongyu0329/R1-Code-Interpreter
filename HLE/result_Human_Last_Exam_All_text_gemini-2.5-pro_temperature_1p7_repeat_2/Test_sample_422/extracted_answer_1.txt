The two problems JTB runs into under these constraints are:
1.  **A Logical Contradiction**: The JTB definition asserts that Knowledge is a *type* of belief (i.e., the set of Knowledge is a subset of the set of Beliefs). However, the constraint that the only available states are Knowledge *or* Belief defines them as mutually exclusive categories. It is logically impossible for Knowledge to be both a subset of Belief and also mutually exclusive to it.
2.  **The Conflation of Justified and Unjustified Beliefs**: The system collapses all non-knowledge beliefs into a single category ("Belief"). This means a *Justified False Belief* (e.g., a belief in a scientific theory that was later proven wrong but was based on the best evidence at the time) is categorized identically to an *Unjustified Belief* (e.g., a superstition). This erases the crucial epistemic distinction between a rational mistake and an irrational belief, thereby undermining the fundamental importance of justification.
