    "This analysis identifies two core problems that arise from applying the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge within a system restricted to only two epistemic states: Knowledge and Belief. The problems are derived directly from the premises and ignore Gettier-style counterexamples as requested.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Premises**\n\n*   **Premise A: JTB Definition of Knowledge.** Knowledge is defined as a belief that is simultaneously Justified (J), True (T), and a Belief (B). A key implication is that Knowledge is a *type* of belief. In set theory terms, the set of all Knowledge states (K) is a proper subset of the set of all Belief states (B). So, K ⊂ B.\n*   **Premise B: Only Two Epistemic States.** For any proposition, one's epistemic state is *either* Knowledge *or* Belief. This premise forces the two states into a binary opposition, implying they are mutually exclusive categories. If a state is K, it cannot be B, and vice-versa. In set theory terms, K ∩ B = ∅ (their intersection is empty).\n*   **Constraint: Ignore Gettier Problems.** Gettier problems demonstrate that JTB is not sufficient for knowledge (i.e., a person can have a JTB that isn't K). We must find problems that are independent of this specific line of objection.\n\n**2. Identifying Problem 1: The Contradiction of Set Relationships**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The fundamental relationship between \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" is defined differently by the two premises, leading to a direct logical contradiction.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Premise A (JTB) requires that if you know something, you must also believe it. Knowledge is a specialized, superior *form* of belief.\n    *   Premise B (Two-State System) requires that Knowledge and Belief are distinct, separate categories. You are in one state *or* the other.\n    *   **Contradiction:** It is logically impossible for one set (Knowledge) to be both a subset of another set (Belief) and, at the same time, be completely separate (mutually exclusive) from it. The system is therefore built on a contradiction.\n\n**3. Identifying Problem 2: The Demotion of Justification**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This problem emerges when we analyze what happens to beliefs that are *not* knowledge under this restricted system. The role of \"Justification\" becomes distorted.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   In the JTB framework, Justification is what distinguishes a rational belief from a mere opinion or lucky guess. It is a mark of epistemic virtue.\n    *   In the proposed two-state system, the only category where Justification is formally recognized as a necessary condition is \"Knowledge\" (JTB).\n    *   Any state that fails to be Knowledge—because it is either false or unjustified—is relegated to the single catch-all category of \"Belief\".\n    *   Let's consider two cases that fall into the \"Belief\" category:\n        1.  **A Justified False Belief (JFB):** A belief based on strong evidence and sound reasoning that just happens to be false (e.g., believing the sun orbits the Earth based on the best pre-Copernican astronomical evidence).\n        2.  **An Unjustified False Belief (UFB):** A belief based on a whim, delusion, or no evidence at all (e.g., believing you can fly by flapping your arms).\n    *   **The Problem:** The system lumps JFB and UFB into the same category: \"Belief\". This erases the crucial epistemic distinction between being rationally mistaken (a justified error) and being irrational. The value and status of having a justification are lost the moment a belief is found to be false, fundamentally undermining the importance of the \"J\" in the JTB theory itself.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis reveals two distinct and significant issues with the proposed system.\n1.  A foundational logical contradiction regarding the very nature of Knowledge and Belief.\n2.  A critical epistemological flaw where the system fails to value or even recognize justification unless it is attached to a true belief, thereby conflating rational errors with irrational guesses.\n\n<<<The two problems JTB runs into under these constraints are:\n1.  **A Logical Contradiction**: The JTB definition asserts that Knowledge is a *type* of belief (i.e., the set of Knowledge is a subset of the set of Beliefs). However, the constraint that the only available states are Knowledge *or* Belief defines them as mutually exclusive categories. It is logically impossible for Knowledge to be both a subset of Belief and also mutually exclusive to it.\n2.  **The Conflation of Justified and Unjustified Beliefs**: The system collapses all non-knowledge beliefs into a single category (\"Belief\"). This means a *Justified False Belief* (e.g., a belief in a scientific theory that was later proven wrong but was based on the best evidence at the time) is categorized identically to an *Unjustified Belief* (e.g., a superstition). This erases the crucial epistemic distinction between a rational mistake and an irrational belief, thereby undermining the fundamental importance of justification.>>>"
