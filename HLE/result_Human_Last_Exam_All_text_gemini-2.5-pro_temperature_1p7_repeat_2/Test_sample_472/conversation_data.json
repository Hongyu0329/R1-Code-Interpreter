    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion of the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\nThis line is an iambic senarius, a meter common in Roman comedy (like that of Plautus). An iambic senarius consists of six iambic feet (S L), but allows for frequent substitutions.\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Elision**\n\nFirst, we identify any elisions. The word `bene` ends in a vowel, and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel. Therefore, the final `-e` of `bene` is elided.\n\nLine with elision: `et tibi ben(e) esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n\nThe elided phrase `ben' esse` is pronounced as a single unit, `benesse`. We syllabify this as `be-nes-se`.\n- `be-` is an open syllable with a short vowel -> Short (S).\n- `nes-` is a closed syllable (ending in `-s`) -> Long (L).\n- `-se` is an open syllable with a short vowel -> Short (S).\nSo, `benesse` scans as `S L S`.\n\nThe full line syllabified is: `et ti-bi be-nes-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Base Syllable Quantities**\n\nWe determine the length of each syllable based on vowel nature and position.\n*   **et**: Long by position (the consonant `t` is followed by the consonant `t` in `tibi`). -> **L**\n*   **tibi**: The two vowels `i` are short by nature. -> **S S**\n*   **benesse**: As determined above. -> **S L S**\n*   **soli**: In the dative of `solus`, the `o` and `i` are long by nature. -> **L L**\n*   **quom**: Long by position (the `m` is followed by the consonant `s` in `sibi`). -> **L**\n*   **sibi**: The two vowels `i` are short by nature. -> **S S**\n*   **sit**: Long by position (the `t` is followed by the consonant `m` in `male`). -> **L**\n*   **male**: The two vowels `a` and `e` are short by nature. The final syllable is anceps (can be scanned as L or S), but is naturally short. -> **S S**\n\nThe sequence of base quantities is: `L S S S L S L L L S S L S S`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Rules of Comedic Scansion (Brevis Brevians)**\n\nA key feature of early Latin verse is *brevis brevians* (or iambic shortening), where a short syllable can cause a following long syllable in an iambic sequence (S L) to become short (S S).\n*   Consider the phrase `sibi sit`. The last syllable of `sibi` (`-bi`) is short (S). The word `sit` is long by position (L). This `bi sit` creates an S L sequence.\n*   Applying *brevis brevians*, `sit` is shortened. `sĭt` -> **S**.\n\nThe final sequence of quantities becomes: `L S S S L S L L L S S S S S`.\n\n**Step 4: Divide into Six Metrical Feet**\n\nWe now parse this sequence into the six feet of the iambic senarius.\n\n*   **Foot 1**: The line starts `L S S`. This scans as a dactyl (`L S S`), which is a valid substitution in the first foot.\n    `et ti bi` -> `L S S`\n*   **Foot 2**: The next part of the line is from `benesse` (`S L S`). The first two syllables, `be-nes-`, form a perfect iambus (`S L`).\n    `be-nes-` -> `S L`\n*   **Foot 3**: The line continues with the last syllable of `benesse` (`-se`, S) and the first of `soli` (`so-`, L). This again forms a perfect iambus.\n    `-se so-` -> `S L`\n*   **Foot 4**: The line continues with the last syllable of `soli` (`-li`, L) and the word `quom` (L). This forms a spondee (`L L`), a valid substitution.\n    `-li quom` -> `L L`\n*   **Foot 5**: Next is `sibi` (`S S`) and the shortened `sĭt` (S). This forms a tribrach (`S S S`), a valid substitution.\n    `si bi sĭt` -> `S S S`\n*   **Foot 6**: The final two syllables are `ma le` (`S S`). This is a pyrrhic, a valid final foot.\n    `ma le` -> `S S`\n\n**Summary of Feet:**\n*   Foot 1: `L S S` (Dactyl)\n*   Foot 2: `S L` (Iambus)\n*   Foot 3: `S L` (Iambus)\n*   Foot 4: `L L` (Spondee)\n*   Foot 5: `S S S` (Tribrach)\n*   Foot 6: `S S` (Pyrrhic)\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S S S S>>>"
