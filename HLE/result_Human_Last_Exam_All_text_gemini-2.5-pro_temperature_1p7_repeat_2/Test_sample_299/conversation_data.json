    "An analysis of the question follows.\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We are looking for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy this equation.\n\n**Step 1: Basic properties of f**\n\n1.  **Injectivity:** Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is one-to-one, we have $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:** The problem states that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function defined on an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Applying the increasing function $f$ again preserves the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. Thus $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. Thus $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing.\n    The function on the right-hand side, $g(x) = \\exp(x)$, is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f$ being either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1: f is strictly decreasing**\n\nIf $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be a bijection, and its range must be $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The range of the right-hand side is $(0, \\infty)$. The left-hand side is the composition $f \\circ f$.\nLet $I = \\text{Im}(f)$ be the image (range) of $f$. The domain of the outer function $f$ is the range of the inner function $f$. So, $f(I)$ must be equal to the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\nSince we assumed $f$ is a strictly decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range is $I = \\mathbb{R}$.\nSo we must have $f(\\mathbb{R}) = (0, \\infty)$. This says that the range of $f$ is the set of positive real numbers.\nThis contradicts the fact that a strictly decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must have a range of $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2: f is strictly increasing**\n\n1.  **Relation to the identity function:** A strictly increasing continuous function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with no fixed points must satisfy either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. A fixed point would mean $f(p)=p$, which implies $f(f(p))=p$, so $\\exp(p)=p$, which has no real solutions. So $f$ has no fixed points.\n    If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This would mean $\\exp(x) < x$. But $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$. This is a contradiction.\n    Therefore, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic behavior and roots:**\n    Since $f$ is a strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the limits $L = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)$ exist (though they could be $\\pm\\infty$). The range of $f$ is $(L, M)$.\n    From $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, taking the limit as $x \\to \\infty$, we have $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\infty$. Let $y=f(x)$. As $x\\to\\infty$, $y\\to M$. So $\\lim_{y\\to M} f(y) = \\infty$. This implies $M=\\infty$.\n    Now take the limit as $x \\to -\\infty$: $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$. Let $y=f(x)$. As $x\\to-\\infty$, $y \\to L$. So we have $\\lim_{y \\to L} f(y) = 0$.\n    The limit $L$ must be a finite real number, because if $L=-\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} f(y) = 0$. But since we know $f(y)>y$ for all $y$, as $y \\to -\\infty$, we would have $f(y) \\to -\\infty$, not 0. So $L$ must be finite.\n    Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, and $\\lim_{y \\to L} f(y) = 0$, we can conclude that $f(L) = 0$. So $f$ must have a root, let's call it $x_0$. Thus, $L=x_0$.\n    So, any increasing solution must have a root $x_0$, and it must satisfy $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = x_0$.\n    From $f(x_0)>x_0$, we have $0 > x_0$, so the root is negative. The range of $f$ is $(x_0, \\infty)$.\n    This is consistent, as $f(x_0, \\infty) = (f(x_0), \\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x)) = (0, \\infty)$, which matches the range of $\\exp(x)$.\n\n3.  **Construction and Cardinality:**\n    The properties determined above allow us to construct solutions. The behavior of the function $f$ is determined by its behavior on a single fundamental interval.\n    Let $x_0$ be the root. Then $f(x_0) = 0$. From the original equation, $f(f(x_0)) = f(0) = \\exp(x_0)$. Let $c = \\exp(x_0)$. Since $x_0<0$, we have $c \\in (0,1)$. Thus $x_0 = \\ln c$.\n    So any increasing solution is characterized by a parameter $c \\in (0,1)$ which is the value of $f(0)$. The root is $x_0 = \\ln c$.\n    The function must map the interval $[\\ln c, 0]$ to $[0, c]$, since $f(\\ln c)=0$ and $f(0)=c$.\n    Let us choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi: [\\ln c, 0] \\to [0, c]$. We define $f(x) = \\phi(x)$ for $x \\in [\\ln c, 0]$.\n    This choice uniquely determines the function $f$ on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   For $x \\in [0, c]$, $x = \\phi(y)$ for some unique $y \\in [\\ln c, 0]$. So $y = \\phi^{-1}(x)$. We define $f(x) = f(\\phi(y)) = f(f(y)) = \\exp(y) = \\exp(\\phi^{-1}(x))$. This extends $f$ to $[0,c]$.\n    *   This process can be continued to extend $f$ to all of $[\\ln c, \\infty)$.\n    *   For $x < \\ln c$, we must define $f(x) = y$ such that $f(y) = \\exp(x)$. For $x < \\ln c$, $\\exp(x) \\in (0,c)$. We defined $f$ on $[\\ln c, 0]$ to be $\\phi$, which maps to $[0,c]$. So there is a unique $y \\in [\\ln c, 0]$ such that $\\phi(y)=\\exp(x)$. We must define $f(x)=y = \\phi^{-1}(\\exp(x))$. This extends $f$ to $(-\\infty, \\ln c)$.\n    One can verify that this construction yields a continuous, strictly increasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$ that solves the equation.\n\n4.  **Counting the Solutions:**\n    The set of solutions is determined by the possible choices we can make in the construction.\n    *   We can choose the parameter $c = f(0)$ to be any number in the interval $(0,1)$. The cardinality of $(0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   For each choice of $c$, we can choose any continuous strictly increasing function $\\phi$ from $[\\ln c, 0]$ to $[0, c]$. The set of such functions $\\phi$ also has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, note that defining such a function is at least as complex as defining its value at a countably infinite set of points, which gives $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$ possibilities.\n\n    The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices at each step. So, the cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are no decreasing continuous solutions. The set of increasing continuous solutions is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of pairs $(c, \\phi)$, where $c \\in (0,1)$ and $\\phi$ is an arbitrary strictly increasing homeomorphism from $[\\ln c, 0]$ to $[0,c]$. The cardinality of this set is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
