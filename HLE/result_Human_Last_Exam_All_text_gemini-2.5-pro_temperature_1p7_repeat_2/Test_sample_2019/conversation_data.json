    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around (a torus). We can label the squares by coordinates (r, c) where r, c are integers from 0 to 4.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   **Constraints:** No two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    1.  **Row/Column:** If we place queens at `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...`, then all `ri` must be distinct, and all `ci` must be distinct. Since there are 4 queens, they must occupy 4 different rows and 4 different columns.\n    2.  **Toroidal Diagonals:** The diagonal constraint is what makes the toroidal board special. A queen at (r, c) attacks all squares (r', c') where:\n        *   `r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)` (main diagonals)\n        *   `r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)` (anti-diagonals)\n    Therefore, for any two queens at `(r_i, c_i)` and `(r_j, c_j)`, we must have `r_i - c_i <binary data, 2 bytes> r_j - c_j (mod 5)` and `r_i + c_i <binary data, 2 bytes> r_j + c_j (mod 5)`.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Problem using Symmetry**\n\nAny valid placement of 4 queens will occupy 4 distinct rows and 4 distinct columns. This means exactly one row and one column will be empty.\n\nLet's fix the empty row and column to simplify the problem. By the symmetry of the torus (any square can be moved to any other square by translation), we can find all solutions for a fixed empty row/column and then multiply to get the total count.\n\nLet's assume the empty row is `r=4` and the empty column is `c=4`. This means our 4 queens must be placed in the 4x4 subgrid defined by rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Simplified Problem**\n\nWe need to place 4 queens on the squares `(i, p(i))` for `i` in {0, 1, 2, 3}, where `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3}. The function `p(i)` gives the column for the queen in row `i`.\n\nThe constraints on the permutation `p` are:\n1.  The values of `d_i = i - p(i) (mod 5)` must be distinct for i = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n2.  The values of `s_i = i + p(i) (mod 5)` must be distinct for i = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nLet's analyze the sums of these values:\n*   The sum of the row indices is `Σi = 0+1+2+3 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`.\n*   Since `p` is a permutation, the sum of column indices is `Σp(i) = 0+1+2+3 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`.\n*   `Σd_i = Σ(i - p(i)) = Σi - Σp(i) = 1 - 1 = 0 (mod 5)`. The only set of 4 distinct numbers in {0,1,2,3,4} that sums to 0 (mod 5) is {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n*   `Σs_i = Σ(i + p(i)) = Σi + Σp(i) = 1 + 1 = 2 (mod 5)`. The only set of 4 distinct numbers in {0,1,2,3,4} that sums to 2 (mod 5) is {0, 1, 2, 4}.\n\nSo, we are looking for permutations `p` of {0, 1, 2, 3} such that:\n*   The set `{i - p(i) mod 5}` is equal to `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n*   The set `{i + p(i) mod 5}` is equal to `{0, 1, 2, 4}`.\n\nBy systematically searching for such permutations, we find there are exactly two:\n\n1.  **p₁ = (1, 3, 0, 2)**\n    *   This corresponds to queens at: `(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)`.\n    *   `d_i` values: `{0-1, 1-3, 2-0, 3-2} = {-1, -2, 2, 1} ≡ {4, 3, 2, 1} (mod 5)`. Distinct, matches {1,2,3,4}.\n    *   `s_i` values: `{0+1, 1+3, 2+0, 3+2} = {1, 4, 2, 5} ≡ {1, 4, 2, 0} (mod 5)`. Distinct, matches {0,1,2,4}.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n\n2.  **p₂ = (2, 0, 3, 1)**\n    *   This corresponds to queens at: `(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)`.\n    *   `d_i` values: `{0-2, 1-0, 2-3, 3-1} = {-2, 1, -1, 2} ≡ {3, 1, 4, 2} (mod 5)`. Distinct, matches {1,2,3,4}.\n    *   `s_i` values: `{0+2, 1+0, 2+3, 3+1} = {2, 1, 5, 4} ≡ {2, 1, 0, 4} (mod 5)`. Distinct, matches {0,1,2,4}.\n    *   This is also a valid solution.\n\nSo, for the specific choice of empty row 4 and empty column 4, there are exactly 2 solutions.\n\n**Step 4: Generalize to the Full Board**\n\nThe 2 solutions we found are \"base\" or \"canonical\" solutions. Any other solution on the board can be obtained by translating one of these base solutions.\nA translation is done by adding a vector `(a, b)` (mod 5) to the coordinates of each queen. There are `5 x 5 = 25` possible translations.\n\nLet our two base solutions be `S₁ = {(0,1), (1,3), (2,0), (3,2)}` and `S₂ = {(0,2), (1,0), (2,3), (3,1)}`.\n*   Translating `S₁` by the 25 possible vectors gives 25 unique solutions. This is because `S₁` has no translational symmetry (i.e., `S₁ + v = S₁` only if `v=(0,0)`).\n*   Translating `S₂` by the 25 possible vectors also gives 25 unique solutions for the same reason.\n*   We must also ensure that no translation of `S₁` is equal to a translation of `S₂`. By inspection (or calculation), `S₂` is not a translation of `S₁` (it is a reflection). Therefore, the set of 25 solutions generated by `S₁` is completely disjoint from the set of 25 solutions generated by `S₂`.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the solutions from these two disjoint sets.\n\nTotal Ways = (Solutions from `S₁`) + (Solutions from `S₂`) = 25 + 25 = 50."
