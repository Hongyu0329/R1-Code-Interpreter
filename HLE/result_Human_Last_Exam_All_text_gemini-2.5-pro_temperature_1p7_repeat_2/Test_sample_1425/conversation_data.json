    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical ensemble describes a quantum system that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir at a fixed temperature T and chemical potential μ. The partition function, Z (often denoted as Ξ), is the central quantity from which all thermodynamic properties can be derived. It is defined as the trace of the statistical operator:\n\n*   **Definition:** `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H_system - μN))]`\n*   **β:** Inverse temperature, `β = 1/(k_B T)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   **H_system:** The Hamiltonian operator for the system, which describes its internal energy.\n*   **μ:** The chemical potential, which governs particle exchange.\n*   **N:** The particle number operator.\n*   **Tr[...]**: The trace, which is a sum over all states in the Hilbert space.\n\n**2. Interpret the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem states the Hamiltonian is `H = -μN`. This expression is slightly ambiguous in this context. There are two common interpretations:\na) `H` is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, i.e., `H_system = -μN`.\nb) `H` is shorthand for the full grand canonical Hamiltonian operator, `K = H_system - μN`.\n\nInterpretation (b) is the most standard in such theoretical problems. It implies that the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K` is simply `-μN`. For this to be true, `H_system - μN = -μN`, which means `H_system = 0`. This describes a system where particles have no kinetic or potential energy; their contribution to the grand canonical free energy comes purely from their presence, as controlled by the chemical potential. We will proceed with this standard interpretation.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the partition function becomes:\n\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β(-μN))] = Tr[exp(βμN)]`\n\n**3. Set up the Path Integral Formulation**\n\nThe trace of an operator can be calculated using the path integral formalism. The partition function Z is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations `ψ(x, τ)` that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time `τ`, where `τ` ranges from 0 to `β` (with `ħ=1`).\n\n*   **Path Integral Formula:** `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n*   `D[ψ*, ψ]`: The functional integration measure over the fields `ψ*` and `ψ`. These are commuting complex fields for bosons and anti-commuting Grassmann fields for fermions.\n*   `S`: The Euclidean action, which is related to the grand canonical Hamiltonian `K`.\n\nThe Euclidean action is given by:\n\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x L_E = ∫_0^β dτ [∫ d^d x ψ*(x,τ) ∂_τ ψ(x,τ) + K(ψ*, ψ)]`\n\nwhere `K(ψ*, ψ)` is the grand canonical Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the fields.\n\n**4. Derive the Specific Action for This System**\n\nUsing our finding that `H_system = 0`, the grand canonical Hamiltonian is `K = -μN`. In the language of second quantization (field theory), the particle number operator is `N = ∫ d^d x ψ†(x) ψ(x)`. So, the action `S` becomes:\n\n`S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ ψ* ∂_τ ψ - μ ψ* ψ ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(∂_τ - μ)ψ`\n\nThis action describes non-interacting particles with zero energy (`ε_k = 0`).\n\n**5. Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\nThe action is quadratic in the fields, making the path integral a Gaussian integral. It is most easily solved by transforming to Fourier space (momentum `k` and Matsubara frequency `ω_n`).\n\nThe action in Fourier space becomes a sum over uncoupled modes:\n`S = Σ_{k, ω_n} ψ*_{k,ω_n} (-iω_n - μ) ψ_{k,ω_n}`\n\nThe partition function is then a product of the integrals for each mode:\n`Z = Π_{k,ω_n} ∫ dψ*_{k,ω_n} dψ_{k,ω_n} exp[ -ψ*_{k,ω_n}(-iω_n - μ)ψ_{k,ω_n} ]`\n\nThe result of the integral depends on the statistics of the particles.\n\n*   **For Bosons (commuting fields):** The integral `∫ dc* dc exp(-A c* c)` is proportional to `1/A`. Taking the product over frequencies and performing the sum in the logarithm `ln Z = -Σ ln(A)` gives `Z_k = 1 / (1 - e^{βμ})` for each mode `k`.\n*   **For Fermions (Grassmann fields):** The integral `∫ dθ* dθ exp(-A θ* θ)` is equal to `A`. Taking the product over frequencies and performing the sum in the logarithm `ln Z = Σ ln(A)` gives `Z_k = 1 + e^{βμ}` for each mode `k`.\n\n**6. Combine Contributions from All Modes**\n\nThe action does not depend on the momentum `k` (since `H_system = 0`), so the contribution from each single-particle state (mode) is identical. Let `M` be the total number of single-particle states available to the system. The total partition function `Z` is the product of the contributions from each state.\n\n*   **For a System of Bosons:**\n    `Z_B = Π_{k=1}^M [1 / (1 - e^{βμ})] = (1 - e^{βμ})^{-M}`\n    (This is valid for `μ < 0` to ensure the sum converges).\n*   **For a System of Fermions:**\n    `Z_F = Π_{k=1}^M [1 + e^{βμ}] = (1 + e^{βμ})^M`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Hamiltonian Interpretation:** The initial interpretation of `H=-μN` as `H_system=0` is the most critical step. A different interpretation would lead to a different result (e.g., `H_system = -μN` leads to `Z = (1 \\mp e^{2βμ})^{\\mp M}`).\n2.  **Statistics:** The problem does not specify whether the particles are bosons or fermions. The path integral formalism naturally accounts for this through the use of either commuting or anti-commuting field variables. The final answer must reflect this duality.\n3.  **Number of States (M):** The number of single-particle states, `M`, is an extensive quantity, typically proportional to the system's volume. Since it's not specified, it must be kept as a variable in the final answer.\n4.  **Boson Convergence:** For the bosonic case, the chemical potential must be negative (`μ<0`) for the partition function to be well-defined. This prevents an infinite population of the zero-energy ground state.\n\nA compact way to write the final answer for both statistics is to use the `∓` sign convention.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function `Z` is calculated from the action `S = ∫dτ d^dx ψ*(∂_τ - μ)ψ`. The result depends on whether the particles are bosons or fermions. Let `M` be the total number of single-particle states.\n\n*   For **bosons**, `Z = (1 - e^{βμ})^{-M}`.\n*   For **fermions**, `Z = (1 + e^{βμ})^{M}`.\n\nThese two results can be combined into a single expression using a common convention where the top sign refers to bosons and the bottom sign refers to fermions.\n\n<<<$(1 \\mp e^{\\beta\\mu})^{\\mp M}$>>>"
