    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, based on Terraria's source code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode. In Classic Mode, its health is 2,800. In Expert Mode, this is increased to **3,640**. This value serves as the foundation for multiplayer scaling.\n\n2.  **Determine the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    Terraria increases boss health in multiplayer to maintain a challenge. The formula for health scaling in Expert Mode is as follows:\n    *   The base multiplier is 1x for one player.\n    *   For each additional player, the health multiplier increases by 0.35 (or 35%).\n    *   This can be expressed with the formula: `Multiplier = 1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35`.\n    *   The total health is calculated by applying this multiplier to the single-player Expert Mode health.\n    *   `Total Health(n) = 3640 * (1 + (n - 1) * 0.35)`, where `n` is the number of players.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Formula with Infinite Players:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, this means we need to find the limit of the `Total Health(n)` formula as `n` approaches infinity.\n    *   `lim (n → ∞) [3640 * (1 + (n - 1) * 0.35)]`\n    As the number of players `n` increases without bound, the term `(n - 1) * 0.35` also increases without bound. This means the total health, according to the mathematical formula alone, would also approach infinity.\n\n4.  **Consider the Constraints of the Source Code:**\n    The question specifically states \"According to the source code\". This is a crucial detail that directs us to consider the technical limitations of the game engine itself, not just the abstract mathematical formula.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (written in C#), the variable used to store an NPC's maximum health (specifically `NPC.lifeMax`) is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A data type has a maximum value it can represent. For a 32-bit signed integer, this value is `2^31 - 1`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Theoretical Maximum:**\n    The \"theoretical maximum\" health is not the infinite result of the pure formula, but the maximum value that the game's health variable can physically hold. Any calculated health value that exceeds this limit would cause a data type overflow, resulting in a nonsensical (and likely negative) health value in the game.\n    *   Maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer = `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,648 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible health the Eye of Cthulhu can have before the game's code can no longer represent it is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mode-Specific Health:** The calculation must start with the Expert Mode health (3640), not the Classic Mode health.\n*   **Linear Scaling:** The health scales linearly with the number of players, which is why it trends toward infinity mathematically.\n*   **\"Source Code\" is Key:** This phrase points away from a purely mathematical answer (\"infinity\") and towards a computer science-based answer related to data type limitations.\n*   **Data Type:** The choice of a 32-bit signed integer (`int`) for health is the single most important factor in finding a specific numerical answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy following the health scaling formula for an increasing number of players, we find that the health value is ultimately limited by the maximum value of the 32-bit signed integer variable used to store it in the game's code.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
