    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Context and the Partition Function\nIn finite-temperature field theory, we study quantum systems in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$. The central object is the partition function, $Z$, which can be expressed as a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations. For a neutral (real) scalar field $\\phi$, this is given by:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\nHere, $\\mathcal{D}\\phi$ represents the measure of integration over the space of all field configurations, and $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action of the field. The theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate $t$ is replaced by imaginary time $\\tau = it$, which is periodic with period $\\beta = 1/T$ (in units where the Boltzmann constant $k_B=1$ and the speed of light $c=1$). The fields are therefore periodic functions in imaginary time: $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n\n### Step 2: The Euclidean Action as a Quadratic Form\nFor this problem, we consider the free neutral scalar field theory, as the operator in the question is the kinetic operator associated with the free part of the Lagrangian. The Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nThe Euclidean action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over Euclidean spacetime (which has volume $V_E = \\beta \\times V$, where $V$ is the spatial volume):\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nTo identify the operator structure, we can perform an integration by parts on the kinetic term $\\int (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2$.\n$\\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu^E \\phi)^2 = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\partial_\\mu^E(\\phi \\partial_\\mu^E\\phi) - \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_E^2 \\phi)$\nThe first term is a boundary term which vanishes due to the periodicity in $\\tau$ and assuming the field vanishes at spatial infinity. Here, $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean Laplacian.\n\nSubstituting this back into the action, we get:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\left[ -\\phi (\\partial_E^2 \\phi) + m^2\\phi^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2) \\phi(x_E)$\n\n### Step 3: Defining the Inner Product and the Operator\nIn the context of functional integration over real-valued functions (like the neutral scalar field $\\phi$), the inner product of two functions, say $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, is defined by the integral of their product over the domain:\n$(f, g) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, f(x_E) g(x_E)$\n\nFrom the quadratic form of the action derived in Step 2, $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, K\\phi)$, we can identify the differential operator $K$ as:\n$K = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2 = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\nThis operator $K$ is the inverse of the propagator for the free scalar field. The notation $D_\\phi$ in the question is interpreted as the action of this operator on the field $\\phi$:\n$D_\\phi \\equiv K\\phi = (-\\partial_E^2 + m^2)\\phi$\n\n### Step 4: Computing the Inner Product\nWith the definitions from Step 3, we can now compute the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = (\\phi, K\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) (K\\phi)(x_E)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $K$, we get:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x_E \\, \\phi(x_E) \\left[(-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2)\\phi(x_E)\\right]$\n\nBy comparing this result with the expression for the Euclidean action in Step 2, we find a direct relationship:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$\n\nThis shows that the inner product is precisely twice the Euclidean action for the free field.\n\n### Step 5: Momentum Space Representation\nTo gain further insight, we can express this result in momentum space. The periodicity in imaginary time implies that the energy-like component of momentum, the Matsubara frequency, is quantized: $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta = 2\\pi n T$ for integers $n$. The field can be expanded in a Fourier series/transform:\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^d\\vec{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$\nIn momentum space, the operator $K = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ becomes multiplication by $p_E^2 + m^2 = \\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2$.\nUsing Parseval's theorem, the inner product transforms from an integral in position space to a sum/integral in momentum space:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int \\frac{d^{d+1}p_E}{(2\\pi)^{d+1}} |\\tilde{\\phi}(p_E)|^2 (p_E^2 + m^2) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\int \\frac{d^d\\vec{p}}{(2\\pi)^d} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2 \\left(\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2\\right)$\n(Note: The exact normalization factors depend on the chosen Fourier transform convention.)\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Interpretation of $D_\\phi$:** The notation $D_\\phi$ is understood to mean the action of the free field kinetic operator $K = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$ on the field $\\phi$.\n2.  **Functional Nature:** The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is not a single number but a functional; its value depends on the specific field configuration $\\phi(x_E)$. In the path integral, we integrate over all such configurations.\n3.  **Role in Path Integral:** This inner product, being equal to $2S_E[\\phi]$, plays a crucial role in the functional integral. The integrand is weighted by $e^{-(\\phi, D_\\phi)/2}$, which defines the Gaussian probability distribution for fluctuations of the free field around the vacuum state.\n4.  **Free Theory:** This entire analysis is for the free part of the action. In an interacting theory, the full action would contain additional terms, $S_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D_\\phi) + S_{int}[\\phi]$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation is the quadratic functional of $\\phi$ that equals twice the Euclidean action for the free field. Its explicit expression in position space is:\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\ \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nThis quantity is fundamental as it defines the Gaussian weight for field configurations in the partition function of the free theory.\n\n<<<>>>\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\ \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$"
