    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of population axiologies. According to these views, the value of adding a person to the world depends on their welfare level (`u`) relative to a certain \"critical level\" (`c`). The total value of a population is the sum of the value contributed by each individual. For a person `i` with welfare `u_i`, their contribution to the total value is `(u_i - c)`.\n\n*   If a person's welfare `u_i` is **above** the critical level `c`, adding them has a positive value (`u_i - c > 0`).\n*   If a person's welfare `u_i` is **below** the critical level `c`, adding them has a negative value (`u_i - c < 0`).\n*   If a person's welfare `u_i` is **equal** to the critical level `c`, adding them is neutral (`u_i - c = 0`).\n\nThe total value of a population of `n` people, all with the same welfare level `x`, is `V = n * (x - c)`. For a non-trivial critical-level view, we assume `c > 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem and its Conditions\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that a set of seemingly plausible conditions for a population axiology cannot all be satisfied simultaneously. Any coherent axiology must violate at least one of them. The question asks which of the given conditions is violated by critical-level views. Let's analyze each condition.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each condition for Critical-Level Views\n\nLet's test if a critical-level view (with `c > 0`) satisfies each of the listed conditions.\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance**\n*   **Condition:** An equally distributed population `A` is better than another equally distributed population `B` if `A` has a higher welfare level and the same number of people. Formally: A population of `n` people at welfare `x` is better than a population of `n` people at welfare `y`, if `x > y`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Value of population A: `V(A) = n * (x - c)`.\n    *   Value of population B: `V(B) = n * (y - c)`.\n    *   The condition requires `V(A) > V(B)`.\n    *   Is `n * (x - c) > n * (y - c)`? Dividing by `n` (which is positive), we get `x - c > y - c`. Adding `c` to both sides, we get `x > y`.\n    *   This is exactly the premise of the condition. So, if `x > y`, the value is indeed higher.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority**\n*   **Condition:** For any welfare level `x` and for any number of extra lives `m`, there is a number of lives `n` such that a population of `n+m` people with slightly worse lives (at level `x-ε`, where `ε` is a small positive amount) is better than a population of `n` people with lives at level `x`.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Value of the initial population: `V(initial) = n * (x - c)`.\n    *   Value of the new population: `V(new) = (n+m) * (x - ε - c)`.\n    *   The condition requires finding an `n` such that `V(new) > V(initial)` for any given `x`, `m`, and `ε > 0`.\n    *   Inequality: `(n+m) * (x - ε - c) > n * (x - c)`.\n    *   Let's rearrange: `n(x - ε - c) + m(x - ε - c) > n(x - c)`.\n    *   `nx - nε - nc + m(x - ε - c) > nx - nc`.\n    *   `-nε + m(x - ε - c) > 0`.\n    *   `m(x - ε - c) > nε`.\n    *   The condition states this must be possible for *any* welfare level `x`. Let's test this by choosing a specific `x`. Let's choose `x = c` (the critical level).\n    *   The inequality becomes: `m(c - ε - c) > nε`.\n    *   `m(-ε) > nε`.\n    *   `-mε > nε`.\n    *   Since `m`, `n`, and `ε` are all positive numbers, the left side is negative and the right side is positive. A negative number cannot be greater than a positive number.\n    *   This shows that when the welfare level `x` is equal to the critical level `c`, the condition cannot be satisfied. Since the condition must hold for *any* `x`, we have found a counterexample.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **violate** General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism**\n*   **Condition:** For any welfare level `x`, there is a better population with only lives at a lower welfare level `y < x`.\n*   **Analysis:** We need to show that for any population `A` (e.g., `k` people at level `x`), we can find a population `B` (`n` people at `y < x`) such that `V(B) > V(A)`. Let's assume `k=1`. So `V(A) = x-c`. We need `n(y-c) > x-c`.\n    *   If `x > c`, we can choose a `y` such that `x > y > c`. Then `y-c` is positive. We need `n > (x-c)/(y-c)`. We can always find a large enough integer `n` to satisfy this.\n    *   If `x <= c`, we can choose `y` such that `y < x`. Then `x-c` and `y-c` are both non-positive. We need `n(y-c) > (x-c)`. This is equivalent to `n(c-y) < (c-x)`. We can choose `n=1`. Then we need `c-y < c-x`, which simplifies to `-y < -x`, or `y > x`. But we must choose `y < x`. So this approach doesn't work. Let's try again. We need `n(y-c) > x-c`. `x-c` is negative. `y-c` is more negative. Let `V(A) = -10`. Let's say `x=2, c=12`. Can we find `(n,y)` with `y<2` s.t. `n(y-12) > -10`? Let `y=1`. We need `n(-11) > -10`, which means `-11n > -10`, or `11n < 10`. This is not possible for integer `n>=1`. But what if we consider a better population to be the *empty population* (value 0)? If `x<c`, then `V(A) = x-c` is negative. `V(empty) = 0`. So `V(empty) > V(A)`. The empty population does not contain lives at a lower level `y`, so it might not satisfy the condition's wording. However, even with a non-empty population, if we compare `(k, x)` to `(n, y)`, it's always possible to find `n` and `y` for a given `k` and `x`. My previous simple analysis was flawed. The condition is generally considered to be met by CLV.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views are generally considered to **satisfy** Non-Elitism. The violation in point B is much clearer and more direct.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism**\n*   **Condition:** Adding a person with positive welfare (`x > 0`) to a population is at least as good as adding a person with negative welfare (`y < 0`), ceteris paribus.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Value of adding person with welfare `x`: `+ (x - c)`.\n    *   Value of adding person with welfare `y`: `+ (y - c)`.\n    *   The condition requires `x - c ≥ y - c`.\n    *   This simplifies to `x ≥ y`.\n    *   Since the premise is `x > 0` and `y < 0`, it is always true that `x > y`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition**\n*   **Condition:** There is some number of people `n`, such that for any welfare `x`, there exists a higher welfare `y > x` where a population of `n` people at `y` is better than `n` people at `x`.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a weaker version of Egalitarian Dominance. Since we have already shown that critical-level views satisfy Egalitarian Dominance (for *any* `n`), they must also satisfy this weaker condition.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe only condition from the list that is clearly and unambiguously violated by critical-level views is General Non-Extreme Priority. The violation occurs because, for any welfare level at or below the critical level, it is always considered worse to have a larger population at a slightly lower welfare level, no matter the size of the initial population.\n\n<<<B>>>"
