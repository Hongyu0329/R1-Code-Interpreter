    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the likely Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the original words in Old English and Old Norse.**\n\n*   The word for \"sister\" in Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) was **sweostor**. It was pronounced roughly as \"SWEH-os-tor\".\n*   The word for \"sister\" in Old Norse (the language of the Viking invaders) was **systir**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" clearly shows a much stronger resemblance to the Old Norse *systir* than the Old English *sweostor*, particularly in the initial \"s-\" sound and the \"-i-\" vowel. This indicates that the Norse form replaced the native English one.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the linguistic impact of the Norse invasion.**\n\nBetween the 7th and 12th centuries, extensive contact and intermingling between Norse speakers and Anglo-Saxons occurred, especially in the Danelaw (an area of northern and eastern England under Viking control). When two very similar languages are in close contact, words can be borrowed or replaced. Because *sweostor* and *systir* were so similar (both deriving from the same Proto-Germanic root *\\*swestēr*), they were effectively competing versions of the same word. The simpler Norse form (`s-` instead of `sw-`) ultimately won out. This replacement of native words with their Norse counterparts is also seen in other common words like *they* (which replaced Old English *hīe*) and *are* (which replaced forms of Old English *bēon*).\n\n**Step 3: Hypothesize the natural evolution of the Old English word.**\n\nTo figure out what *sweostor* would have become without this interference, we must apply the known sound changes that occurred naturally within the English language from Old English to Modern English.\n\n1.  **The initial 'sw-' cluster:** In native English words, the `sw-` sound at the beginning of a word was almost always preserved. We see this in words like *swan* (OE *swan*), *swim* (OE *swimman*), and *sweet* (OE *swēte*). Therefore, the hypothetical word would almost certainly begin with `sw-`.\n\n2.  **The vowel 'eo':** The Old English diphthong `eo` underwent several changes. In this context, it would have simplified during the Middle English period, most likely to a short `e` sound, similar to the vowel in \"bed\". So, *sw**eo**stor* would become *sw**e**ster*.\n\n3.  **The final '-or' syllable:** In unstressed final syllables, the `-or` sound regularly weakened to `-er`. This is a very common and predictable change in English. For example, Old English *brōþor* became *brother*, and Old English *mōdor* became *mother*. The same would have happened to *sweostor*, turning the ending into `-ster`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the changes to form the hypothetical word.**\n\nPutting these natural English sound changes together:\n*   **sweostor** (Old English)\n*   The `sw-` is retained.\n*   The `eo` simplifies to `e`.\n*   The `-or` weakens to `-er`.\n*   This results in the hypothetical Middle and Modern English form: **swester**.\n\nThis conclusion is strongly supported by the word's cognate in modern German, a language that evolved from a common Germanic root but did not experience the same Norse influence. The German word for sister is **Schwester**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguishing Language Contact from Natural Evolution:** The key is recognizing that \"sister\" is the result of language contact (Norse replacing Old English) and not the natural evolution of the original Anglo-Saxon word.\n2.  **Consistency of English Sound Laws:** The prediction relies on the consistent application of known sound changes in English, such as the preservation of initial `sw-` and the weakening of final unstressed syllables (`-or` to `-er`).\n3.  **Comparative Evidence:** Using cognates from related Germanic languages that did not have the same influences (like German *Schwester*) provides strong corroborating evidence for the hypothetical outcome.\n4.  **Vowel Evolution:** The evolution of vowels is complex, but the simplification of the `eo` diphthong to `e` is the most probable path for this specific word, leading to a form that rhymes with \"jester\" or \"Leicester\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** Old English *sweostor*.\n2.  **Norse Influence:** The Old Norse word *systir* replaced *sweostor*, giving us the modern \"sister\".\n3.  **Hypothetical Scenario (No Norse):** The word *sweostor* would have evolved naturally according to English sound rules.\n4.  **Applying Rules:** `sw-` is kept + `eo` becomes `e` + `-or` becomes `-er`.\n5.  **Result:** The changes combine to form the word **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
