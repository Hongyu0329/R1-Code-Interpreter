    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of colours needed.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **Graph G:** We are given a graph $G$.\n*   **Number of vertices:** $n = 12345$.\n*   **Constraint:** The graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph, $K_n$. A complete graph is one where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **The phrase \"and maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\":** This phrase simply acknowledges that any graph has a maximum degree. It does not impose any additional constraint on the value of $\\Delta(G)$.\n*   **Goal:** We need to find the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of $G$ properly\". This means we are looking for the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nIn formal terms, we want to find the value of:\n$$ \\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid G \\text{ is a graph with } 12345 \\text{ vertices and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\} $$\n\n**2. Establish an Upper Bound**\n\n*   The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$. That is, $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique colour to each vertex.\n*   The only graph that requires exactly $n$ colours is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex must have a different colour from all others.\n*   The problem explicitly states that our graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n*   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must be at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are **not** adjacent (i.e., there is no edge between them).\n*   Because $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same colour in a proper colouring.\n*   We can create a valid colouring for $G$ using at most $n-1$ colours:\n    1.  Assign colour 1 to both vertex $u$ and vertex $v$.\n    2.  Assign a new, unique colour to each of the remaining $n-2$ vertices.\n    This colouring scheme uses a total of $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colours.\n*   Since any graph $G \\neq K_n$ can be properly coloured with $n-1$ colours, its chromatic number must be less than or equal to $n-1$.\n    $$ \\chi(G) \\le n-1 $$\n*   For $n=12345$, this means the maximum number of colours is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n**3. Show that the Upper Bound is Achievable (Lower Bound)**\n\n*   Now, we must check if it's possible for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices to actually require $n-1$ colours. To do this, we need to construct such a graph.\n*   Consider a graph $G_0$ built as follows:\n    *   Take a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$. Let the vertices be $\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{n-1}\\}$.\n    *   Add one additional vertex, $v_n$, to the graph. Do not connect $v_n$ to any of the other vertices. This vertex is isolated.\n    *   The resulting graph is the disjoint union of $K_{n-1}$ and a single vertex, which can be written as $G_0 = K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$.\n*   Let's check if this graph $G_0$ meets the problem's conditions:\n    *   It has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph $K_n$ because the vertex $v_n$ is not connected to $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{n-1}$.\n*   Now, let's determine the chromatic number of $G_0$:\n    *   The subgraph formed by the vertices $\\{v_1, \\ldots, v_{n-1}\\}$ is a complete graph $K_{n-1}$.\n    *   In a complete graph, all vertices are adjacent to each other, so they must all receive different colours.\n    *   Therefore, we need at least $n-1$ colours just to colour this part of the graph.\n    *   This implies that $\\chi(G_0) \\ge n-1$.\n*   Since we already established that $\\chi(G_0) \\le n-1$, and now we have shown that $\\chi(G_0) \\ge n-1$, we can conclude that the chromatic number is exactly $n-1$.\n    $$ \\chi(G_0) = n-1 $$\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   We have proven that any graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete can be coloured with at most $12344$ colours.\n*   We have also shown an example of such a graph that requires exactly $12344$ colours.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of colours that could be needed is $n-1$.\n\n**Calculation:**\nWith $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colours is $12345 - 1 = 12344$."
