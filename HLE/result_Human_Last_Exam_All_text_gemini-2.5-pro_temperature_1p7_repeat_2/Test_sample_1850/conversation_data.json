    "This is a question that requires careful definition and a thorough search of John Milton's epic poem, *Paradise Lost*. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\" in the Context of *Paradise Lost*\nFirst, we must establish what qualifies as a \"historical saint.\" Milton was a Protestant and would not have subscribed to the Catholic process of canonization. For the purpose of this question, we should use a broad definition that Milton would likely recognize:\n\n*   **Historical:** The figure must be understood as a person who actually lived, not a purely mythological or allegorical character.\n*   **Saint:** This refers to a person of exceptional holiness and faith. This would include major righteous figures from the Old Testament (patriarchs, prophets), key figures from the New Testament, and even formally canonized saints from church history (though Milton might mention these critically).\n*   **Mentioned by Name:** The person's name must be explicitly written in the text. Allusions to a figure or their story are not sufficient.\n\nWe will exclude divine beings (God the Father) and angels (Michael, Gabriel, etc.) as they are not \"historical\" human figures.\n\n### Step 2: Searching the Text of *Paradise Lost* for Names\n\nWe will examine the poem for names that fit our criteria. Most of these names appear in Books III, XI, and XII, where Milton deals with church history and the future of mankind as revealed to Adam.\n\n**Book III:**\nIn his description of the \"Limbo of Vanity,\" Milton satirizes what he considers false or misguided piety. Here he mentions two Catholic saints by name, the founders of major monastic orders:\n1.  **Saint Dominic:** Mentioned in the line \"...or in Franciscan think to pass disguised.\" Milton is mocking those who believe that dying in the habit of a friar will grant them entry to heaven.\n2.  **Saint Francis:** As above, named alongside Dominic.\n\n**Books XI and XII:**\nIn the final two books, the Archangel Michael reveals future biblical history to Adam. This section contains the highest concentration of names of Old Testament holy figures.\n\n*From the Visions in Book XI:*\n3.  **Abel:** He is presented as the first righteous man to be martyred.\n4.  **Enoch:** Described as the righteous man who \"walked with God\" and was taken to Heaven without dying.\n5.  **Noah:** Named as the just man chosen to survive the Flood and repopulate the Earth.\n\n*From the Prophecy in Book XII:*\n6.  **Abraham:** Named as the \"Father of the faithful\" from whom the chosen people will descend.\n7.  **Isaac:** Mentioned by name as the son of Abraham.\n8.  **Jacob:** Mentioned by name as the son of Isaac.\n9.  **Joseph:** Named as the son of Jacob who brought the Israelites into Egypt.\n10. **Moses:** Named as the great law-giver who led the Israelites out of Egypt.\n11. **Joshua:** Named as the successor to Moses who would lead the people into the promised land.\n12. **David:** Named as the great king of Israel from whose line the Messiah would come.\n13. **Solomon:** Mentioned as the son of David who built the great Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n**New Testament Figures:**\nThe prophecy in Book XII also extends to the New Testament era.\n14. **Jesus:** This is the most significant, yet subtly mentioned, name. Milton explicitly links the name Jesus to his Old Testament precursor, Joshua: \"...But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His Name and Office bearing...\". As Jesus is the central historical figure of Christianity, revered for his perfect holiness, he fits the criteria of a \"historical saint\" in the broadest and most important sense.\n\nOther figures like the Virgin Mary or the Apostles are alluded to (e.g., \"born of a virgin,\" \"his twelve,\" \"the fisherman\"), but they are not mentioned by their specific names (Mary, Peter, Paul, John, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Compiling the Final List and Count\n\nBased on the analysis, the historical saints mentioned by name are:\n1.  Dominic\n2.  Francis\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Isaac\n8.  Jacob\n9.  Joseph\n10. Moses\n11. Joshua\n12. David\n13. Solomon\n14. Jesus\n\nThe total number of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
