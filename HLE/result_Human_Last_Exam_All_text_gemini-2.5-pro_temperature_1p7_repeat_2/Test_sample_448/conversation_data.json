    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. For the purposes of \"terrestrial matter,\" we consider the naturally occurring ones:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not a candidate).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\n*   **\"Rarest\"**: This means the lowest abundance or smallest quantity.\n*   **\"On Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\"**: This is a critical point. We must consider the gas's abundance in the entire Earth (atmosphere, oceans, crust, mantle), not just in the atmosphere. The percentage is calculated as (Total Mass of the Gas on Earth) / (Total Mass of Earth). The gas with the lowest total mass will have the lowest percentage.\n*   **\"in 2002\"**: The abundances of most noble gases are geologically stable. For a radioactive gas like Radon, its concentration is in a steady state (rate of creation equals rate of decay). The specific year 2002 does not change the fundamental ranking of which gas is the rarest.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundances of Noble Gases**\nLet's first consider the atmospheric abundance, which is the main reservoir for most noble gases.\n*   **Argon (Ar)**: ~0.934% of the atmosphere. It is the most abundant noble gas by far, primarily due to the radioactive decay of Potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne)**: ~18 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere.\n*   **Helium (He)**: ~5 ppm in the atmosphere. It is also produced by radioactive decay in the crust but is light enough to escape into space.\n*   **Krypton (Kr)**: ~1 ppm in the atmosphere.\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**: ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion) in the atmosphere.\n*   **Radon (Rn)**: Has a trace, highly variable concentration, on the order of 1 part per 10^21.\n\nBased on atmospheric concentration alone, the rarest is Radon, followed by Xenon.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Total Terrestrial Abundance**\nNow we must check if including non-atmospheric sources changes the ranking between the two rarest candidates: Xenon and Radon.\n\n*   **Xenon (Xe)**: Xenon is a stable element. Its total mass on Earth is primarily what's in the atmosphere. The total mass of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere is estimated to be about 2 x 10^12 kg (two trillion kilograms).\n*   **Radon (Rn)**: Radon is produced by the natural radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in rocks and soil. However, Radon itself is highly radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This means it decays very rapidly after it is formed. Because of this extremely short half-life, the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any given moment is incredibly small. Scientific estimates place the total amount of Radon-222 in equilibrium in the entire atmosphere at only around 20-40 kilograms. Even accounting for all Radon in the crust, oceans, and atmosphere, the total mass is minuscule compared to any other element.\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nComparing the total terrestrial mass of the candidates:\n*   Total mass of Xenon ≈ 2,000,000,000,000 kg\n*   Total mass of Radon ≈ tens of kilograms\n\nIt is clear that the total amount of Radon on Earth is many, many orders of magnitude smaller than the total amount of Xenon. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
