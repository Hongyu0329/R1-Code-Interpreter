    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$. We are given $n=25$.\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is given by the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$, where the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$.\nThe hook length $h_{ij}$ is the number of boxes to the right of the box in the same row, plus the number of boxes below the box in the same column, plus one for the box itself.\nThe dimension of an irrep for a partition $\\lambda$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by transposing the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. Unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate ($\\lambda = \\lambda'$), a partition and its conjugate correspond to two distinct irreps with the same dimension.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of 25 such that $d_\\lambda < 500,000$.\n\n**Step 2: Strategy for finding partitions with small dimensions**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is small when the product of hook lengths is large. This generally occurs for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"tall and narrow\", i.e., partitions that are far from being \"square-like\". These are partitions on the \"outer edges\" of the Young's lattice of partitions.\n\nWe will systematically enumerate partitions, starting with the ones most likely to have small dimensions.\nWe can group partitions into families based on their shapes:\n1.  Hook shapes: $\\lambda = (n-k, 1^k)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. Their conjugates are also hooks.\n2.  Two-row partitions: $\\lambda = (n-k, k)$ for $k=1, \\dots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. Their conjugates are two-column partitions $\\lambda'=(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$.\n3.  Other partitions \"close\" to hooks, like $(n-k-l, k, l)$ and their conjugates.\n\nFor each partition $\\lambda$ we find with $d_\\lambda < 500,000$, we must also count its conjugate $\\lambda'$, unless $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating dimensions for different families of partitions of 25.**\n\n**1. Hook partitions and their conjugates**\nThe dimension of the irrep for a hook partition $\\lambda = (25-k, 1^k)$ is given by the simple formula $d_\\lambda = \\binom{24}{k}$. We test values of $k$.\n*   $k=0: \\lambda=(25)$. $d=\\binom{24}{0}=1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, $d=1$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=1: \\lambda=(24, 1)$. $d=\\binom{24}{1}=24$. Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=2: \\lambda=(23, 1^2)$. $d=\\binom{24}{2}=276$. Its conjugate is $(3, 1^{22})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=3: \\lambda=(22, 1^3)$. $d=\\binom{24}{3}=2024$. Its conjugate is $(4, 1^{21})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=4: \\lambda=(21, 1^4)$. $d=\\binom{24}{4}=10626$. Its conjugate is $(5, 1^{20})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=5: \\lambda=(20, 1^5)$. $d=\\binom{24}{5}=42504$. Its conjugate is $(6, 1^{19})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=6: \\lambda=(19, 1^6)$. $d=\\binom{24}{6}=134596$. Its conjugate is $(7, 1^{18})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=7: \\lambda=(18, 1^7)$. $d=\\binom{24}{7}=346104$. Its conjugate is $(8, 1^{17})$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=8: \\lambda=(17, 1^8)$. $d=\\binom{24}{8}=735471 > 500,000$. We stop.\n\nNone of these 8 pairs are self-conjugate. This family gives a total of $8 \\times 2 = 16$ irreps.\n\n**2. Two-row and two-column partitions**\nThe dimension for a two-row partition $\\lambda=(25-k,k)$ is $d_\\lambda = \\binom{25}{k} - \\binom{25}{k-1}$.\n*   $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$, $d=24$. This is a hook partition and already counted.\n*   $k=2: \\lambda=(23,2)$. $d=\\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1}=300-25=275$. Conjugate: $(2^2, 1^{21})$. Neither is a hook. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=3: \\lambda=(22,3)$. $d=\\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2}=2300-300=2000$. Conjugate: $(2^3, 1^{19})$. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=4: \\lambda=(21,4)$. $d=\\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3}=12650-2300=10350$. Conjugate: $(2^4, 1^{17})$. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=5: \\lambda=(20,5)$. $d=\\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4}=53130-12650=40480$. Conjugate: $(2^5, 1^{15})$. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=6: \\lambda=(19,6)$. $d=\\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5}=177100-53130=123970$. Conjugate: $(2^6, 1^{13})$. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=7: \\lambda=(18,7)$. $d=\\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6}=480700-177100=303600$. Conjugate: $(2^7, 1^{11})$. 2 irreps.\n*   $k=8: \\lambda=(17,8)$. $d=\\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7}=1081575-480700=600875 > 500,000$. We stop.\n\nThis family adds $6 \\times 2 = 12$ new irreps. Total so far: $16 + 12 = 28$.\n\n**3. Other partitions with small dimensions**\nWe now test other partitions that are \"close\" to the boundary of the Young's lattice. We list the partition $\\lambda$ with the largest first part, its dimension $d_\\lambda$, and note that its conjugate $\\lambda'$ will have the same dimension.\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 22$:\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$, $d_\\lambda = 8,860 < 500,000$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 21$:\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$, $d_\\lambda=31,350$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$, $d_\\lambda=22,000$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=16,675$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 20$:\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$, $d_\\lambda=163,740$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$, $d_\\lambda=75,075$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=54,264$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$, $d_\\lambda=48,620$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=26,000$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 19$:\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$, $d_\\lambda=389,625$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,2)$, $d_\\lambda=271,320$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,4,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=221,000$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,3)$, $d_\\lambda=184,756$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,3,2,1)$, $d_\\lambda=191,400$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 18$:\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,6,1)$, $d_\\lambda=1,307,504 > 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,5,2)$, $d_\\lambda=1,001,000 > 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,5,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=497,475$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,4,3)$, $d_\\lambda=859,185 > 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,4,2,1)$, $d_\\lambda=486,200$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,4,1,1,1)$, $d_\\lambda=386,100$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,3,3,1)$, $d_\\lambda=458,062$. (1 pair = 2 irreps)\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,3,2,2)$, $d_\\lambda=531,300 > 500,000$.\n*   For $\\lambda_1 = 17$: further partitions have dimensions greater than 500,000.\n\nThis search yields:\n*   1 pair starting with 22.\n*   3 pairs starting with 21.\n*   5 pairs starting with 20.\n*   5 pairs starting with 19.\n*   4 pairs starting with 18.\nTotal additional pairs = $1+3+5+5+4 = 18$.\nTotal additional irreps = $18 \\times 2 = 36$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\nWe sum the counts from all categories. We must ensure there is no double counting.\n*   Set 1 (hooks): 16 irreps.\n*   Set 2 (two-rows): 12 irreps.\n*   Set 3 (others): 36 irreps.\n\nThe sets are disjoint. Hooks have only one part greater than one. Two-row partitions have exactly two parts. \"Other\" partitions have at least 3 parts, and are not hooks. The conjugates are also distinct in a similar manner. None of the listed partitions are self-conjugate.\n\nTotal number of irreps = $16 + 12 + 36 = 64$."
