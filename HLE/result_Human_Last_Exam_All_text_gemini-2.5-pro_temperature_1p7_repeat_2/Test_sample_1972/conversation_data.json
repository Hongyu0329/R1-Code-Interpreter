    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify a novel based on two specific clues attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A description of the novel's quality: It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: The Novel's Description**\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests something ferocious, focused, powerful, and relentlessly tense. It points to a work with high emotional or narrative stakes.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This suggests a work that is highly structured, intricate, and intellectually rigorous. Like chess, it might involve a limited set of elements (characters, themes) that interact in complex and varied patterns, creating a deep strategic and psychological drama within a formal framework.\n\n*   **Clue 2: The Author's Description**\n    *   **\"Continuator... of Faulkner\":** This indicates that the author was heavily influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Faulkner is renowned for his complex narrative structures (non-linear timelines, multiple perspectives, stream-of-consciousness), his creation of the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, and his themes of history, memory, decay, and the burdens of the past. The author in question would be working within this literary tradition.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is the crucial part of the clue. While the author continues Faulkner's work, they do so with a style that is less dense, less labyrinthine, and more accessible or concise. They distill Faulkner's complex techniques into a clearer, more austere form.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify Candidates**\n\nMany Latin American authors of the \"Boom\" generation were influenced by Faulkner. We must find the one who fits both of Borges's descriptions. The combination of \"Faulknerian influence\" and \"simplification\" points toward an author with a spare, laconic, or minimalist style who nevertheless achieves great structural complexity.\n\nThis description perfectly fits the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**.\n*   Rulfo's style is famously terse and unadorned, the polar opposite of Faulkner's dense, sprawling prose. This makes him an ideal \"simplifier.\"\n*   However, his novel's structure is deeply indebted to Faulknerian techniques, featuring a fragmented timeline, a chorus of voices, and the intermingling of the past and present, the living and the dead. This makes him a clear \"continuator.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Novel**\n\nJuan Rulfo wrote only one novel, which is the subject of Borges's praise. This novel is **_Pedro Páramo_** (1955). Borges wrote a very famous review of it.\n\n*   The novel's plot, in which a man journeys to the ghost town of Comala to find his father, is relentlessly tense and atmospheric, matching the **\"intensity of a tiger.\"**\n*   Its narrative is constructed from dozens of fragmented vignettes and disembodied voices of the dead. The reader must piece together these fragments to understand the full story, a process that mirrors the strategic complexity and intellectual rigor of a **\"chess duel.\"**\n\nTherefore, Borges's comments are a precise and well-known assessment of Juan Rulfo's masterpiece, *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Source of the Quote:** It's essential to confirm that Borges actually made these statements about the specific author and novel. His reviews and essays are well-documented, and these quotes are famously associated with his analysis of *Pedro Páramo*.\n2.  **The \"Simplifier\" Aspect:** This is the key that distinguishes the author from other Faulkner-influenced writers like Gabriel García Márquez or Mario Vargas Llosa, whose prose styles are generally rich and elaborate rather than simple or spare.\n3.  **The Metaphors:** The tiger/chess comparison is not just a general compliment; it accurately describes the unique combination of raw, atmospheric tension and intricate, puzzle-like structure that defines *Pedro Páramo*.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe clues provided by Jorge Luis Borges point directly and uniquely to one of the most celebrated novels of Latin American literature. The author, a \"continuator and simplifier of Faulkner,\" is Juan Rulfo. The novel, known for its \"intensity of a tiger\" and the complex variety of a \"chess duel,\" is his magnum opus.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
