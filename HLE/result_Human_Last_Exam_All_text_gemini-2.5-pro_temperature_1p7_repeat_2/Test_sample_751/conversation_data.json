    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new output matrix C.\n\n### **1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe goal is to find a state transformation `z = Px` that puts the system into observer canonical form, and to determine the new output matrix `C_o`. The observer canonical form is the dual of the controller canonical form.\n\n### **2. Duality Principle**\n\nThe problem of finding an observer for a system `(A, C)` is dual to finding a controller for the system `(A^T, C^T)`.\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define the dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`.\n2.  Find a transformation that converts the dual system to controller canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`.\n3.  The observer canonical form for the original system will be `(A_o, C_o)`, where `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\n### **3. Find the Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe canonical forms depend on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of matrix A.\n`p(λ) = det(λI - A)`\n`det([[λ-1, -1, 0], [-2, λ-1, -1], [0, -2, λ]])`\n`= (λ-1) * [λ(λ-1) - (-1)(-2)] - (-1) * [(-2)λ - 0] + 0`\n`= (λ-1) * (λ^2 - λ - 2) - 2λ`\n`= λ^3 - λ^2 - 2λ - λ^2 + λ + 2 - 2λ`\n`= λ^3 - 2λ^2 - 3λ + 2`\n\nLet the polynomial be `λ^3 + a_1λ^2 + a_2λ + a_3 = 0`. The coefficients are:\n`a_1 = -2`, `a_2 = -3`, `a_3 = 2`.\n\n### **4. Choose an Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThere are multiple \"observer canonical forms.\" A common one is:\n`A_o = [[-a_1, 1, 0], [-a_2, 0, 1], [-a_3, 0, 0]]` and `c_o_sel = [1, 0, 0]`\n\nSubstituting the coefficients:\n`A_o = [[2, 1, 0], [3, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 0]]`\n\nThis form is achieved by finding a transformation `z = Px` where one of the output rows of the original `C` matrix is chosen as the basis. In the new coordinates, this chosen output row becomes `[1, 0, 0]`. Let's choose the first row of C, `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`, as our basis.\n\n### **5. Construct the Transformation Matrix P**\n\nWe need to find the matrix `P` such that `A_o = PAP^{-1}` and `c_1_o = c_1 P^{-1} = [1, 0, 0]`.\nFrom `c_1_o = c_1 P^{-1}`, we can write `c_1 = c_1_o P = [1, 0, 0] P`. This means the first row of `P` is `c_1`. Let the rows of `P` be `p_1, p_2, p_3`.\n*   `p_1 = c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n\nThe transformation `A_o = PAP^{-1}` implies `PA = A_o P`. We can write this equation for each row of `P`:\n*   `p_1 A = 2 p_1 + p_2  => p_2 = p_1 A - 2 p_1`\n*   `p_2 A = 3 p_1 + p_3  => p_3 = p_2 A - 3 p_1`\n*   `p_3 A = -2 p_1` (This can be used for verification)\n\nLet's compute the rows:\n*   `p_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n*   `p_1 A = [0, 1, 0] [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]`\n    `p_2 = [2, 1, 1] - 2 * [0, 1, 0] = [2, 1-2, 1] = [2, -1, 1]`\n*   `p_2 A = [2, -1, 1] [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2-2, 2-1+2, -1] = [0, 3, -1]`\n    `p_3 = [0, 3, -1] - 3 * [0, 1, 0] = [0, 3-3, -1] = [0, 0, -1]`\n\nSo, the transformation matrix is:\n`P = [[0, 1, 0], [2, -1, 1], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### **6. Find the Inverse Transformation Matrix P<sup>-1</sup>**\n\nTo find the new `C` matrix (`C_o`), we need `P^{-1}`.\n*   `det(P) = 0 - 1(-2 - 0) + 0 = 2`\n*   The matrix of cofactors is: `[[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, -2]]`\n*   The adjugate matrix (transpose of the cofactor matrix) is: `Adj(P) = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, -2]]`\n*   The inverse is `P^{-1} = (1/det(P)) * Adj(P)`\n    `P^{-1} = (1/2) [[1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, -2]] = [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\n### **7. Calculate the New Output Matrix C<sub>o</sub>**\n\nThe new output matrix `C_o` is given by `C_o = C P^{-1}`.\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, -1]]`\n\nWe can calculate `C_o` row by row:\n*   **Row 1 of C_o**: `[0, 1, 0] * P^{-1} =` (the second row of `P^{-1}`) `= [1, 0, 0]`\n    This matches our desired `c_1_o`, which confirms the method.\n*   **Row 2 of C_o**: `[1, 1, 0] * P^{-1} =` (sum of the first and second rows of `P^{-1}`)\n    `= [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] + [1, 0, 0] = [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\nThus, the new output matrix `C_o` is:\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]`\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]>>>"
