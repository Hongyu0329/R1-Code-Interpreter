    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe problem is rooted in the theory of critical phenomena and the renormalization group (RG). The specific heat, $C$, of a system near a continuous phase transition is expected to exhibit scaling behavior, typically of the form $C \\sim |(T-T_c)/T_c|^{-\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is the critical exponent for the specific heat. The $\\epsilon$-expansion, pioneered by Kenneth Wilson and Michael Fisher, is a powerful technique within the RG framework to calculate these exponents.\n\n**2. Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\n\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative calculation around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. This is the dimension at and above which the simpler mean-field theory correctly describes the critical exponents. For a wide class of systems described by the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson Hamiltonian with a $\\phi^4$ interaction (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\n**3. Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Parameter**\n\nThe expansion is performed in powers of the parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension of the system in question.\n*   Upper Critical Dimension: $d_c = 4$\n*   Given Spatial Dimension: $d = 3$\n*   Therefore, the value of the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\nWhile $\\epsilon=1$ is not infinitesimally small, the $\\epsilon$-expansion often provides qualitatively correct and reasonably accurate quantitative estimates for exponents in $d=3$. The question specifically asks for the result obtained *using* this method.\n\n**4. Use Hyperscaling Relations**\n\nCritical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. A key relation for this problem is the hyperscaling relation involving the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$, the correlation length exponent $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nThis can be rearranged to express $\\alpha$ in terms of $d$ and $\\nu$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\nSince we are using the $\\epsilon$-expansion, we substitute $d = 4 - \\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon)\\nu$\n\n**5. Find the Exponent $\\nu$ from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nThe next step is to find the expression for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ as a series in $\\epsilon$. The RG analysis for the general O(n)-symmetric model (where n is the number of components of the order parameter) yields the following result to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n*Careful Point:* The question refers to \"a system\". In the absence of further specification, this is conventionally interpreted as the simplest and most common case, the **Ising model**, which corresponds to an order parameter with a single component, so **n = 1**.\n\n**6. Calculate the Exponent $\\alpha$ in the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nNow we substitute the first-order expression for $\\nu$ into our equation for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nLet's expand this and keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = - \\left[ \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right]\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nTo simplify the term in the brackets:\n$\\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{2n+4-n-8}{2(n+8)} = \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)}$\n\nSo, the expression for $\\alpha$ becomes:\n$\\alpha = - \\left[ \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right]\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**7. Substitute Specific Values for n and $\\epsilon$**\n\nWe now use the specific values for our problem:\n*   The system is assumed to be in the Ising universality class, so **n = 1**.\n*   The spatial dimension is $d=3$, so **$\\epsilon = 1$**.\n\nSubstitute $n=1$ into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon$\n\nFinally, substitute $\\epsilon=1$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis first-order result gives an estimate for the specific heat exponent. For the 3D Ising model, the calculated value is $\\alpha \\approx 0.167$. This is a good approximation to the more accurate results from higher-order expansions and numerical simulations, which find $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. However, the question asks for the result from the standard application of the $\\epsilon$-expansion, for which the first-order calculation is the standard answer.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in a d=3 system (Ising universality class, n=1), calculated to the first order in the $\\epsilon = 4-d$ expansion, is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
