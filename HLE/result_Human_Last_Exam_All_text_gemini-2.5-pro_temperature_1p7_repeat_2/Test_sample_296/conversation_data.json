    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group ($G$).\n\n**1. Understand the Grigorchuk Group and its Properties**\n*   The Grigorchuk group $G$ is an infinite, finitely generated 2-group (every element has an order that is a power of 2). This means that the index of any subgroup, if finite, must also be a power of 2.\n*   A crucial property of $G$ is its abelianization. The abelianization $G_{ab} = G/[G, G]$ is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., $G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$.\n*   For any p-group, the maximal subgroups are precisely the normal subgroups of index p. For the 2-group $G$, the maximal subgroups are the normal subgroups of index 2.\n\n**2. Count the Maximal Subgroups of G**\n*   Subgroups of index 2 are the kernels of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $C_2$.\n*   The number of such homomorphisms is equal to the number of surjective homomorphisms from its abelianization, $G_{ab} \\cong C_2^3$, to $C_2$.\n*   Treating $C_2^3$ as a 3-dimensional vector space over the field of two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$, these homomorphisms correspond to non-zero linear functionals. The number of such functionals is the number of non-zero vectors in the dual space, which is $2^3 - 1 = 7$.\n*   Therefore, the Grigorchuk group $G$ has exactly 7 subgroups of index 2. These are the maximal subgroups of $G$. Let's denote them by $M_1, M_2, \\ldots, M_7$.\n\n**3. Relate Subgroups of Index 4 to Maximal Subgroups**\n*   Let $H$ be a subgroup of index 4 in $G$. By Lagrange's theorem for indices, $[G:H]=4$.\n*   Since $G$ is a 2-group, any subgroup of index 4 must be contained within a maximal subgroup (of index 2). Let's say $H \\subset M_i$.\n*   Then we have $[G:H] = [G:M_i] \\cdot [M_i:H]$.\n*   $4 = 2 \\cdot [M_i:H]$, which implies $[M_i:H] = 2$.\n*   So, every subgroup of index 4 in $G$ is a subgroup of index 2 in one of the 7 maximal subgroups of $G$.\n\n**4. Use a Key Property of G's Maximal Subgroups**\n*   A profound and non-trivial result in the study of the Grigorchuk group states that all its 7 maximal subgroups are isomorphic to the group itself.\n    *   For any $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, 7\\}$, $M_i \\cong G$.\n*   Since each $M_i$ is isomorphic to $G$, each $M_i$ also has exactly 7 subgroups of index 2.\n\n**5. Set up the Counting Problem**\n*   The set of all subgroups of index 4 in $G$, let's call it $S_4(G)$, is the union of the sets of index-2 subgroups of each maximal subgroup: $S_4(G) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^7 S_2(M_i)$.\n*   We can count the total number of pairs $(H, M_i)$ where $H$ is a subgroup of index 2 in $M_i$. Since there are 7 choices for $M_i$, and each has 7 subgroups of index 2, the total number of such pairs is $7 \\times 7 = 49$.\n*   This sum counts a given subgroup $H$ once for every maximal subgroup $M_i$ that contains it. To find the total number of distinct subgroups $H$, we must account for this overcounting.\n\n**6. Distinguish between Normal and Non-normal Subgroups of Index 4**\n*   A subgroup $H$ of index 4 can be either normal in $G$ or not.\n*   **Case 1: $H$ is not normal in G.** If $H$ were contained in two distinct maximal subgroups, say $H \\subset M_i$ and $H \\subset M_j$ where $i \\neq j$, then its normalizer $N_G(H)$ would contain both $M_i$ and $M_j$. Since $M_i$ and $M_j$ are distinct maximal subgroups, the subgroup they generate, $\\langle M_i, M_j \\rangle$, is $G$ itself. Thus, $N_G(H) = G$, meaning $H$ must be normal in $G$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, a non-normal subgroup of index 4 can be contained in exactly one maximal subgroup.\n*   **Case 2: $H$ is normal in G.** Such a subgroup $H$ has a quotient $G/H$ of order 4. Since $G_{ab} \\cong C_2^3$, any abelian quotient of $G$ must be a quotient of $C_2^3$. Any group of order 4 which is a quotient of $C_2^3$ must be isomorphic to $C_2 \\times C_2$ ($V_4$). The number of such normal subgroups is the number of ways to choose a 2-dimensional quotient space from the 3-dimensional vector space $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$. This is equivalent to choosing a 1-dimensional subspace (the kernel of the projection), of which there are $(2^3-1)/(2-1) = 7$. So there are **7 normal subgroups of index 4**.\n*   Now, we must determine how many maximal subgroups contain a given normal subgroup $H$ of index 4. $H$ corresponds to a 1D subspace in $G_{ab}$. A maximal subgroup $M_i$ corresponds to a 2D (hyperplane) subspace. $H \\subset M_i$ if and only if the 1D subspace is contained in the 2D hyperplane. In $(\\mathbb{F}_2)^3$, any given line is contained in exactly $(2^{3-1}-1)/(2^{1}-1) = 3$ distinct planes. Thus, each normal subgroup of index 4 is contained in exactly **3** maximal subgroups.\n\n**7. Final Calculation**\n*   Let $n_{norm}$ be the number of normal subgroups of index 4, and $n_{non-norm}$ be the number of non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n*   We know $n_{norm} = 7$.\n*   The total count of 49 pairs can be expressed as:\n    $49 = (n_{norm} \\times \\text{number of M_i containing a normal H}) + (n_{non-norm} \\times \\text{number of M_i containing a non-normal H})$\n*   Substituting the values we found:\n    $49 = (7 \\times 3) + (n_{non-norm} \\times 1)$\n    $49 = 21 + n_{non-norm}$\n*   Solving for the number of non-normal subgroups:\n    $n_{non-norm} = 49 - 21 = 28$.\n*   The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal ones:\n    Total Subgroups = $n_{norm} + n_{non-norm} = 7 + 28 = 35$.\n\n<<<35>>>"
