    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and time ($t$) describe the evolution of a velocity field $u(x,t) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and a pressure field $p(x,t)$. The equations are:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + (u \\cdot \\nabla)u = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta u$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot u = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity of the fluid, which we assume is non-zero ($\\nu \\neq 0$). The variables of the system are the independent variables $(t, x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the dependent variables $(u_1, u_2, u_3, p)$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the concept of a Lie group of symmetries\nA Lie group of symmetries is a continuous group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that leaves the set of solutions of the equations invariant. In simpler terms, if you have a solution to the equations, transforming it with a symmetry operation will yield another solution. The dimension of this Lie group is the dimension of its corresponding Lie algebra, which is the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the infinitesimal generators\nWe look for infinitesimal generators of the form:\n$X = \\tau(t,x,u,p)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\xi_i(t,x,u,p)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\eta_i(t,x,u,p)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} + \\zeta(t,x,u,p)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$\n\nApplying the condition that this generator must leave the Navier-Stokes equations invariant leads to a large, overdetermined system of linear partial differential equations for the coefficient functions $(\\tau, \\xi_i, \\eta_i, \\zeta)$. This procedure is called the Lie algorithm.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the determining equations (The results from literature)\nSolving this system from first principles is a very lengthy calculation. Fortunately, this is a classic result in the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations, found in standard textbooks by authors like Olver, Ibragimov, and Ovsiannikov.\n\nThe analysis reveals that the full symmetry algebra is **infinite-dimensional**. This is due to the presence of arbitrary functions of time in the general solution for the generator coefficients. These infinite-dimensional symmetries correspond to transformations to arbitrarily accelerating frames of reference and certain pressure transformations.\n\nHowever, the question \"the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\" conventionally asks for the dimension of the **maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra** of the full symmetry algebra. This is also known as the *principal Lie algebra*. This finite-dimensional algebra is obtained by restricting the arbitrary functions to be, at most, linear functions of time.\n\n### Step 5: List the basis generators of the finite-dimensional Lie algebra\nThe basis for this maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra consists of generators corresponding to well-known physical principles of invariance.\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 generator):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on `t`), so they are invariant under time shifts `t' = t + s`. The generator is:\n    *   $X_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$\n\n2.  **Spatial Translations (3 generators):** The equations are homogeneous in space (coefficients are constant), so they are invariant under spatial shifts `x' = x + s*v`. The generators are:\n    *   $X_{P_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}$, $X_{P_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}$, $X_{P_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3}$\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are isotropic (no preferred direction in space), so they are invariant under rotations `x' = Rx`, `u' = Ru`, where `R` is a rotation matrix. The generators correspond to rotations about the coordinate axes:\n    *   $X_{R_1} = x_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3} - x_3\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} + u_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_3} - u_3\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_2}$\n    *   $X_{R_2} = x_3\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} - x_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3} + u_3\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_1} - u_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_3}$\n    *   $X_{R_3} = x_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} - x_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} + u_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_2} - u_2\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_1}$\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under transformations to a uniformly moving frame of reference (Galilean relativity), `x' = x + s*v*t`, `u' = u + s*v`. The generators are:\n    *   $X_{G_1} = t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_1}$\n    *   $X_{G_2} = t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_2}$\n    *   $X_{G_3} = t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_3}$\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation) (1 generator):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If `(u(x,t), p(x,t))` is a solution, then so is `(u'(x',t'), p'(x',t'))` where `t' = s^2 t`, `x' = s x`, `u' = s⁻¹ u`, `p' = s⁻² p`. The infinitesimal generator for this scaling group is:\n    *   $X_D = 2t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$\n\n### Step 6: Count the generators to find the dimension\nWe sum the number of independent generators found in the previous step:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Spatial Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11.\n\nThis 11-dimensional Lie algebra is the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry algebra of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The result is for the Navier-Stokes equations ($\\nu \\neq 0$). The inviscid Euler equations ($\\nu=0$) have a larger symmetry group.\n*   The spatial domain is $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The presence of boundaries would reduce the dimension of the symmetry group by breaking some of the translation and rotation symmetries.\n*   The dimension of the *full* symmetry group (a Lie pseudogroup) is infinite. The question, as is standard, is interpreted to be about the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie group of point symmetries.\n\nThe final answer is the total count of the basis generators.\n\n<<<11>>>"
