    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Core Task:** Identify the numerical differences on the imprints of two specific medications.\n2.  **Medication 1:** Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n3.  **Medication 2:** Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n4.  **Information to Extract:** The numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n5.  **Constraints/Exclusions:** Do not mention color differences, the word \"PLIVA,\" or size differences. The answer should focus exclusively on the digits.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   A pharmaceutical company like Teva may use different imprints for the same product, often due to manufacturing at different facilities or acquiring other companies (like Pliva). It is crucial to identify all possible current imprints for each dosage.\n*   The query specifically requests the *numbers*. Any letters or words in the imprint must be ignored as per the instructions (e.g., ignoring \"PLIVA\").\n*   The final output needs to be a direct answer showing the distinct numbers for each capsule strength.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Research Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.**\n    *   Using pharmaceutical databases and drug identification guides, we find that Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsules can have two primary imprints.\n    *   Imprint A: \"PLIVA 647\". According to the instructions, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\". The number is **647**.\n    *   Imprint B: \"TEVA 3105\". The number here is **3105**.\n    *   Therefore, the 10mg capsule is imprinted with either the number **647** or **3105**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Research Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.**\n    *   Following the same research process for the 20mg strength, we find two corresponding imprints.\n    *   Imprint A: \"PLIVA 648\". Ignoring the word, the number is **648**.\n    *   Imprint B: \"TEVA 3106\". The number is **3106**.\n    *   Therefore, the 20mg capsule is imprinted with either the number **648** or **3106**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer.**\n    *   The question asks for the \"different numbers imprinted\" on the capsules. The analysis shows that the numbers for the two strengths are different from each other.\n    *   Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule numbers: **647** or **3105**.\n    *   Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule numbers: **648** or **3106**.\n    *   The answer will clearly state these different numbers for each capsule strength.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsules are imprinted with the number 647 or 3105. The 20mg capsules are imprinted with the number 648 or 3106.>>>"
