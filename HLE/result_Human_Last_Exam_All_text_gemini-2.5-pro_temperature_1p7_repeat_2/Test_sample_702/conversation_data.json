    "An analysis of the question step by step, with careful points, to acquire the final answer.\n\n### Question Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n1.  **Understand the map**: This map is a specific instance of a general map $\\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$ which arises in homotopy theory. The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n\n2.  **Strategy**: The standard method to determine the connectivity of such a map is to place it within a homotopy fibration sequence and analyze the connectivity of the homotopy fiber.\n\n3.  **Key Tool**: The appropriate tool here is the Ganea fibration sequence. For well-pointed, connected CW complexes $X$ and $Y$, there is a homotopy fibration sequence:\n    $$ \\Sigma\\Omega X \\ast \\Sigma\\Omega Y \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\xrightarrow{\\sigma} \\Omega(X \\wedge Y) $$\n    where $\\ast$ denotes the join of topological spaces.\n\n4.  **Relation between map connectivity and fiber connectivity**: For a map $f$ that is part of a fibration $F \\to E \\xrightarrow{f} B$, the connectivity of $f$ is given by $\\text{conn}(F) + 1$. Here, $\\text{conn}(F)$ is the connectivity of the fiber space $F$, defined as the largest integer $n$ such that $\\pi_i(F) = 0$ for all $i \\le n$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe overall plan is to compute the connectivity of the fiber of the map $\\sigma$ and then add 1 to get the connectivity of the map itself.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fiber of the map $\\sigma$.**\nFrom the Ganea fibration sequence with $X=S^4$ and $Y=S^6$, the homotopy fiber of the map $\\sigma: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is the space $F = \\Sigma\\Omega S^4 \\ast \\Sigma\\Omega S^6$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the fiber $F$.**\nWe need to calculate $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4 \\ast \\Sigma\\Omega S^6)$. For this, we use a standard formula for the connectivity of a join:\n*   **Formula:** For path-connected spaces $A$ and $B$, $\\text{conn}(A \\ast B) = \\text{conn}(A) + \\text{conn}(B) + 2$.\n    *   *Careful point:* We must ensure that the spaces $\\Sigma\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Sigma\\Omega S^6$ are path-connected. Since $\\Omega S^n$ is path-connected for $n \\ge 1$, its suspension $\\Sigma\\Omega S^n$ is also path-connected. This condition is met.\n\nThis means we need to find the connectivities of $\\Sigma\\Omega S^4$ and $\\Sigma\\Omega S^6$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of $\\Sigma\\Omega S^4$.**\nWe use the following properties:\n*   The connectivity of an $n$-sphere $S^n$ (for $n \\ge 1$) is $\\text{conn}(S^n) = n-1$.\n*   The connectivity of a loop space on a simply-connected space $Y$ is $\\text{conn}(\\Omega Y) = \\text{conn}(Y) - 1$.\n*   The connectivity of a suspension of a path-connected space $Z$ is $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma Z) = \\text{conn}(Z) + 1$.\n\nLet's apply these formulas:\n1.  Connectivity of the sphere $S^4$: $\\text{conn}(S^4) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n2.  Connectivity of the loop space $\\Omega S^4$: Since $S^4$ is simply connected, $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) = \\text{conn}(S^4) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n3.  Connectivity of the suspension $\\Sigma\\Omega S^4$: $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4) = \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the connectivity of $\\Sigma\\Omega S^6$.**\nWe follow the same procedure as in Step 3:\n1.  Connectivity of the sphere $S^6$: $\\text{conn}(S^6) = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n2.  Connectivity of the loop space $\\Omega S^6$: Since $S^6$ is simply connected, $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) = \\text{conn}(S^6) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$.\n3.  Connectivity of the suspension $\\Sigma\\Omega S^6$: $\\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^6) = \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber $F$.**\nNow we use the join formula from Step 2 with the results from Steps 3 and 4:\n$\\text{conn}(F) = \\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4 \\ast \\Sigma\\Omega S^6) = \\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Sigma\\Omega S^6) + 2$.\n$\\text{conn}(F) = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10$.\n\n*   *Careful point:* The result $\\text{conn}(F) = 10$ means that all homotopy groups of the fiber $F$ are trivial up to dimension 10 (i.e., $\\pi_i(F)=0$ for $i \\le 10$).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the connectivity of the map $\\sigma$.**\nUsing the relationship from the introduction, the connectivity of the map $\\sigma$ is one greater than the connectivity of its fiber.\nConnectivity of $\\sigma = \\text{conn}(F) + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 11. This means the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\sigma_*$, is an isomorphism for dimensions less than 11 and an epimorphism in dimension 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
