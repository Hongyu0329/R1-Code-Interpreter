The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** metal center coordinated to a **Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) ligand** (a bridged cyclopentadienyl-amido system), which is supported on **Sulfated Zirconia (SZ)**. This combination creates a robust, single-site heterogeneous catalyst where the SZ support actively generates and stabilizes the highly electrophilic cationic Zr species necessary to perform both olefin polymerization and, under hydrogen pressure, the C-H activation and subsequent Î²-alkyl elimination steps required for polyolefin hydrogenolysis.
