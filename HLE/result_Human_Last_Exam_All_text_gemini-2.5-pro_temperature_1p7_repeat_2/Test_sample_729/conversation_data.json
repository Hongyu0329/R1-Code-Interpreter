    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group and the Question**\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is defined by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **The specific group:** In this problem, the group has size 128. So, $4n = 128$, which means $n = 32$. The group is $G = Q_{128}$, with the presentation $G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Elements of G:** The group $G$ has two parts: the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ of order 64, and its coset $\\langle x \\rangle y = \\{x^iy \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$.\n*   **Order of elements:**\n    *   The order of $x$ is 64.\n    *   For any element of the form $g = x^iy$, its square is $g^2 = (x^iy)(x^iy) = x^i(yx^i)y = x^i(x^{-i}y)y = y^2 = x^{32}$. Since $g^2 = x^{32}$ (which has order 2), the order of $g$ is 4.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Structure of $G^k$**\n\nWe will determine the set $G^k$ by considering the parity of the integer $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer.**\n    We need to find the set $G^k = \\{(x^i)^k\\} \\cup \\{(x^iy)^k\\}$.\n    *   **Powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$:** The elements are $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. This means the mapping $i \\mapsto ik \\pmod{64}$ is a bijection. Therefore, the set $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ is the same as the set $\\{x^j \\mid 0 \\le j < 64\\}$, which is the entire subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n    *   **Powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$:** Let $g = x^iy$. Since $k$ is odd, let $k=2m+1$. The $k$-th power is $g^k = g^{2m+1} = (g^2)^m g$. We know $g^2 = x^{32}$, so $g^k = (x^{32})^m (x^iy) = x^{32m}x^iy = x^{i+32m}y$. Since $i$ can be any integer from 0 to 63, the set $\\{x^{i+32m}y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ is the entire coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\n    *   **Conclusion for odd k:** For any odd integer $k$, $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\langle x \\rangle y = G$. This means all odd powers generate the same subgroup, which is the group $G$ itself. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k$ is an even integer.**\n    Let $k=2m$. We find the set $G^k = \\{(x^i)^k\\} \\cup \\{(x^iy)^k\\}$.\n    *   **Powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$:** The set of powers is $\\{(x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\} = \\{x^{ik}\\}$. This set forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    *   **Powers of elements in $\\langle x \\rangle y$:** Let $g = x^iy$. The $k$-th power is $g^k = g^{2m} = (g^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$. Note that this result is the same single element for all choices of $i$.\n    *   **Combining the sets:** For an even $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\} = \\langle x^k \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{16k}\\}$.\n    *   **Simplification:** We need to check if the element $x^{16k}$ is already contained in the subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. A subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ is equal to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$. An element $x^j$ is in this subgroup if and only if $j$ is a multiple of $\\gcd(k, 64)$. Here, $j = 16k$. Since $\\gcd(k, 64)$ must divide $k$, it certainly divides $16k$. Therefore, $x^{16k}$ is always in $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    *   **Conclusion for even k:** For any even integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n**3. Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups obtained from the two cases.\n\n1.  From the odd-$k$ case, we get one subgroup: **G**.\n2.  From the even-$k$ case, we get subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ for an even integer $k$.\n\nNow, let's find how many distinct subgroups of this form exist.\n*   The subgroups of the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$ are determined by the divisors of its order, 64. The subgroups are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64.\n*   The power subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ is identical to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   Since $k$ must be even, let $k=2j$. Then the generator is determined by $d = \\gcd(2j, 64)$. Since 2 is a factor of both $2j$ and 64, their gcd must be even. So, $d$ must be an even number.\n*   Thus, the possible power subgroups from this case are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is an **even divisor of 64**.\n*   The divisors of 64 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n*   The **even** divisors of 64 are {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}.\n*   Each of these 6 even divisors gives a distinct subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$. These subgroups are:\n    *   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n    *   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n    *   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n    *   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n    *   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n*   This gives us **six** distinct power subgroups.\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nCombining the results from both cases:\n*   The case where $k$ is odd gives 1 power subgroup: $G$.\n*   The case where $k$ is even gives 6 distinct power subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as the 6 subgroups from the even case are all proper subgroups of $G$.\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\n<<<7>>>"
