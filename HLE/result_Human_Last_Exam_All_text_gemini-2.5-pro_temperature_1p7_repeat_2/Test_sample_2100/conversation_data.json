    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue: Andrei Voznesensky called this man \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The author is specified as Andrei Voznesensky, a famous 20th-century Russian poet. The quotes must come from one of his works. The phrasing suggests the work is about a historical figure who was an explorer or sailor and whose final resting place was unknown at the time the poem was written.\n*   **Connection:** These lines are from the epilogue of Voznesensky's famous poem, which became the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work tells the story of a specific historical figure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\".**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The central character of \"Juno and Avos\" is Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807). He was a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. His story involves sailing to California, fitting the \"sailor\" description.\n*   **Connection:** This identifies the person Voznesensky was writing about.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the clue about the lost grave: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This implies that Rezanov's burial site was lost to history for a significant period.\n*   **Connection:** History confirms this. On his return journey from America, Rezanov fell ill and died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807. He was buried with honors at the Voskresensky Cathedral cemetery. However, in the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral was demolished, and the cemetery was paved over and built upon. Rezanov's grave was lost, making Voznesensky's question literally true for decades.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the final clue: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** This provides a specific time frame for the rediscovery of the grave.\n*   **Connection:** The immense popularity of the \"Juno and Avos\" rock opera in the Soviet Union sparked public and academic interest in finding Rezanov's lost grave. During the late 1980s, extensive archival research and archaeological work in Krasnoyarsk successfully pinpointed the location of the former cemetery and the presumed location of Rezanov's burial plot. This discovery \"answered\" the question posed by the poet. A memorial was later erected at the site.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining all the clues, we can confidently identify the man. The quotes are from Voznesensky's work about Nikolai Rezanov, whose grave was lost and then rediscovered in the late 1980s. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
