    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific musical work and section**\nThe question asks about Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". The end of the symphony refers to the final measures of the last movement, which is the 4th movement, typically marked \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 2: Locate the instrument's part in the score**\nWe need to consult the orchestral score and find the staff line for the first violins, labeled as \"Violino I\" in Italian.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final notes for the first violin**\nUpon examining the score, we can see that in the very last measure of the symphony, the entire orchestra plays a final, loud chord. The first violins contribute to this by playing three notes simultaneously. This is a technique called a \"triple stop\". Therefore, the \"three notes\" the symphony ends on for this section are the three notes of this final chord.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific pitches of the three notes**\nTo identify the notes, we must read them from the music staff, taking into account the clef and the key signature.\n*   **Clef:** The first violin part is written in the treble clef.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key of the symphony is B-flat major, so the key signature indicates that all B's are played as B-flat (B♭) and all E's are played as E-flat (E♭), unless otherwise marked with an accidental.\n*   **The Notes:** The final triple stop for the Violino I consists of the following three notes, written from lowest to highest on the staff:\n    1.  The note on the third line of the staff is a B. Due to the key signature, this is **B♭**.\n    2.  The note on the fourth line of the staff is a **D**.\n    3.  The note on the top line of the staff is an **F**.\nThese three notes together (B♭, D, F) form a B-flat major chord, which is the home chord of the symphony, providing a powerful and conclusive ending.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note**\nBy comparing the three notes that make up the final chord (B♭, D, and F), we can determine the lowest one. In the standard musical scale, B♭ is lower in pitch than both D and F.\n\nTherefore, the lowest of the three final notes is B♭.\n\n<<<B♭>>>"
