    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Famous Landmark:** Pantheon.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was removed by the city administration.\n*   **Date:** In 1950.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main features of the Piazza della Rotonda**\nThe primary and most famous features of the square today are:\n1.  The Pantheon church.\n2.  The Fontana del Pantheon, a fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575.\n3.  The Macuteo obelisk, which was placed on top of the fountain in 1711.\n4.  The surrounding buildings and restaurants.\n\nWe need to identify something that existed alongside these features but is no longer present.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"removed in 1950\" clue**\nThis specific date is the most critical piece of information. We need to investigate what changes were made to the piazza around that year. The period after World War II was a time of significant urban change and modernization in Rome. One of the major changes was the overhaul of the public transportation system.\n\n**Step 4: Research historical changes to the piazza**\n*   Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century reveal a feature not present today: tram tracks.\n*   For several decades, a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n*   The tracks formed a distinct ring around the central fountain, with trams passing just feet away from the Pantheon's portico.\n*   This was certainly a \"unique architectural feature,\" especially in how it interacted with such a significant historical monument. The sight of a modern tram circling a 2,000-year-old temple was very distinctive.\n\n**Step 5: Correlate the feature with its removal date**\n*   Following WWII, there was a concerted effort in Rome to remove tram lines from the narrow streets of the historic center.\n*   The reasons were manifold: to reduce noise and vibrations that could damage ancient structures, to ease traffic congestion as cars became more popular, and to improve the aesthetics of the city's most famous squares.\n*   The tram ring around the Pantheon's fountain was dismantled as part of this city-wide project. While the entire network's removal spanned several years, the line in the Piazza della Rotonda was removed around 1950, fitting the timeframe perfectly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed in 1950 was the tramway ring. The tram tracks circled the central fountain, allowing public trams to pass directly in front of the Pantheon.\n\n<<<The tramway ring>>>"
