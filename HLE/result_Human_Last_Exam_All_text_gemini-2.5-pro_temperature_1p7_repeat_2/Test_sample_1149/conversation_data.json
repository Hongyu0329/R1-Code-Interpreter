    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*, and a particular feature of its skull: the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone located in front of the eye socket, and a recess is a depression or cavity on the bone's surface. The question asks for the number of smaller depressions *within* this main recess.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a specific paleontological anatomy question, we must refer to the formal scientific descriptions of the fossil. The primary and most detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper \"The Skull of the Basal Spinosaurid *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David Martill, and Diane Scott.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Description:** Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, we need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone. The authors provide a detailed account of this element.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** The paper describes a large lacrimal recess on the outer (lateral) surface of the bone. Crucially, it provides a specific detail about the internal structure of this recess. The paper states that the lacrimal recess is \"subdivided by a thin vertical septum into an anterior and a posterior fossa.\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Anatomical Terms:** A \"septum\" is a partition or wall. A \"fossa\" (plural: \"fossae\") is a depression or hollow. Therefore, the description indicates that a bony wall divides the single large lacrimal recess into two distinct smaller depressions: one at the front (anterior) and one at the back (posterior).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the most authoritative scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, the lacrimal recess contains two distinct depressions (fossae).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Specimen:** The answer is based on the features observed in the holotype specimen (SMNS 58022), which is the only known skull material for *Irritator*.\n*   **Hierarchical Anatomy:** It is important to distinguish between the single, large \"lacrimal recess\" and the smaller \"depressions\" or \"fossae\" that are located *within* it. The question specifically asks for the number of these internal depressions.\n*   **Reliance on Peer-Reviewed Sources:** The answer relies directly on the peer-reviewed scientific literature that officially described the fossil, not on generalized illustrations or less formal sources.\n*   **Terminology:** Understanding the anatomical terms \"recess,\" \"septum,\" and \"fossa\" is key to correctly interpreting the scientific description.\n\nBased on this analysis, the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* is divided into two fossae.\n\n<<<2>>>"
