    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**1. The Curve and the Valuation**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nWe are working over a 2-adic field, which we can take as $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and the residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**2. Finding a Better Model**\nThe reduction of the given equation modulo 2 is $\\bar{z}^2 = 1$, which is equivalent to $(\\bar{z}-1)^2 = 0$. This is a double line in the special fiber, which is a highly singular and non-reduced model. To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better birational model of the curve.\n\nLet's introduce a change of variables. The equation can be written as $z^2 - 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$.\nFactoring the left side, we get $(z-1)(z+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThe term $z+1$ can be expressed as $(z-1)+2$. Let $u = \\frac{z-1}{2}$. Then $z=2u+1$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$(2u)(2u+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$4u(u+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\nDividing by 2, we get a new model for the curve:\n$2u(u+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\nor $2u^2 + 2u - x^5 - x^3 = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the reduction of this new model. Modulo 2, the equation becomes:\n$\\bar{x}^5 + \\bar{x}^3 = 0$\n$\\bar{x}^3(\\bar{x}^2+1) = 0$\n$\\bar{x}^3(\\bar{x}+1)^2 = 0$\nThe special fiber is composed of two vertical lines in the $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{u})$-plane: the line $\\bar{x}=0$ with multiplicity 3, and the line $\\bar{x}=1$ with multiplicity 2. This model is still not stable, as the components are not reduced and the singularities are not ordinary double points.\n\n**3. Further Transformation to an Artin-Schreier form**\nWe can transform the curve to a simpler form, known as the Artin-Schreier form.\nLet's start from the original equation $z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The reduction $\\bar{z}^2=1$ suggests the point at infinity on the $\\bar{z}$-line is singular. Let's make a substitution to move this singularity to a more manageable position.\nLet $z=1+2W$. Substituting this in:\n$(1+2W)^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$\n$1+4W+4W^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1$\n$4W^2+4W = 2x^5+2x^3$\n$2W^2+2W = x^5+x^3$. This is the same model we found before with $u=W$.\n\nLet's try another transformation involving scaling $x$. Let $x=2X$.\n$2W^2+2W = (2X)^5+(2X)^3 = 32X^5+8X^3$\nDividing by 2, we get:\n$W^2+W = 16X^5+4X^3$\nThis model is of the form $Y^2+Y=F(X)$, which is a standard form for a hyperelliptic curve in characteristic 2.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Stable Reduction of the New Model**\nThe reduction of the model $W^2+W = 16X^5+4X^3$ modulo 2 is:\n$\\bar{W}^2+\\bar{W} = 0$\n$\\bar{W}(\\bar{W}+1)=0$\nThe special fiber consists of two distinct horizontal lines, $\\bar{W}=0$ and $\\bar{W}=1$. In the affine $(\\bar{X}, \\bar{W})$-plane, these lines are disjoint. This means they must intersect at the point(s) at infinity on the $\\bar{X}$-line. A standard stable reduction of this type consists of two rational curves (the projective closures of $\\bar{W}=0$ and $\\bar{W}=1$) intersecting at a single ordinary double point (a node). We need to find the \"thickness\" of this node.\n\n**5. Calculating the Thickness**\nFor a hyperelliptic curve given by an equation of the form $Y^2+Y = F(X)$, the structure of the stable reduction at infinity is determined by the behavior of $F(X)$ as $X \\to \\infty$. Let $F(X)=c_d X^d + c_{d-1} X^{d-1} + ...$. The stable reduction has a node at infinity if the degree $d$ is odd. In our case, $F(X) = 16X^5+4X^3$, so the degree is $d=5$, which is odd. This confirms the stable reduction has a node connecting the two components at infinity.\n\nFor such curves, the thickness of this node is given by the valuation of the leading coefficient of $F(X)$.\nThe leading term of $F(X)$ is $16X^5$.\nThe leading coefficient is $c_5=16$.\nThe valuation of the leading coefficient is $v(16) = v(2^4) = 4$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is therefore 4.\n\nLet's briefly justify this. The node is formed by resolving the singularity at infinity. To analyze the point at infinity, we use the coordinate $T=1/X$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$W^2+W = \\frac{16}{T^5} + \\frac{4}{T^3}$\n$T^5(W^2+W) = 16+4T^2$\nConsider this equation in the local ring at $T=0$. The special fiber has a highly singular point at $T=0$. A node is formed by a process of blowing up. The \"thickness\" of the resulting node is related to the valuation of the constant term in the local equation that creates the singularity. Here, $v(16)=4$. The resolution process for this type of singularity results in a node of thickness 4."
