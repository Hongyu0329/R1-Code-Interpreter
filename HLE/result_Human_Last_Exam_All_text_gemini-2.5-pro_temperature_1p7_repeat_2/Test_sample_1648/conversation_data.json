    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is non-zero.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the mathematical objects and the question**\nWe are asked to find the largest natural number $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ for which the algebraic K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is not the zero group.\nThe ring is $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27$. This is a ring of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$, where $p=3$ is an odd prime and $k=3$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the relevant theorem for the K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$**\nThe computation of the algebraic K-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ is a deep result in mathematics. We need a precise formula for the order of the even K-groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$.\n\nA key result, based on the work of Hesselholt and Madsen on topological cyclic homology and its relation to algebraic K-theory (the cyclotomic trace map), gives the structure of these groups. As summarized by John Rognes in the appendix to a paper with Charles Weibel (JAMS, 2000), the structure for odd primes is as follows:\n\n**Theorem:** Let $p$ be an odd prime and $k \\ge 1$ be an integer. For any integer $i \\ge 1$, the algebraic K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is a finite cyclic $p$-group. Its order is given by $p^j$, where the exponent $j$ is\n$j = k - \\lfloor \\frac{i}{p-1} \\rfloor$.\nThe group is non-zero if and only if the exponent $j$ is positive ($j > 0$). If $j \\le 0$, the group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is the zero group.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the theorem to the specific case**\nWe need to apply this formula to our specific problem.\n*   The ring is $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, so $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n*   We are interested in the $(2n)$-th K-group, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$. Comparing this with the theorem's notation $K_{2i}$, we have $i=n$.\n*   Since we are looking for the largest natural number $n$, we are considering $n \\ge 1$, which corresponds to $i \\ge 1$ in the theorem.\n*   The prime $p=3$ is odd, so the theorem is applicable.\n\n**Step 4: Set up the inequality for the non-vanishing condition**\nThe group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero if and only if the exponent $j$ is greater than 0. We substitute the values $p=3$, $k=3$, and $i=n$ into the formula for $j$:\n\n$j = 3 - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3-1} \\rfloor = 3 - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\nThe condition for the group to be non-zero is $j > 0$:\n$3 - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor > 0$\n\n**Step 5: Solve the inequality for the largest natural number n**\nWe need to find the largest natural number $n$ that satisfies this inequality.\n$3 > \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$\n\nSince $n$ is a natural number ($n \\ge 1$), the term $n/2$ is positive. The floor function $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ can take non-negative integer values: $0, 1, 2, 3, ...$.\nThe inequality $3 > \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ means that $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ can be at most 2.\nSo, we must have:\n$\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor \\le 2$\n\nBy the definition of the floor function, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le c$ is equivalent to $x < c+1$.\nApplying this to our inequality:\n$\\frac{n}{2} < 2+1$\n$\\frac{n}{2} < 3$\n$n < 6$\n\nWe are looking for the largest natural number $n$ that satisfies $n < 6$. The natural numbers satisfying this condition are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The largest among these is 5.\n\n**Step 6: Final Verification**\nLet's check the values of $j$ for a few $n$:\n*   If $n=5$, $j = 3 - \\lfloor 5/2 \\rfloor = 3 - 2 = 1$. Since $j=1 > 0$, $K_{10}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero (its order is $3^1=3$).\n*   If $n=6$, $j = 3 - \\lfloor 6/2 \\rfloor = 3 - 3 = 0$. Since $j=0$, $K_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the zero group.\n*   For any $n > 6$, $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ will be greater than or equal to 3, so $j$ will be less than or equal to 0, and the corresponding K-group will be zero.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero is 5."
