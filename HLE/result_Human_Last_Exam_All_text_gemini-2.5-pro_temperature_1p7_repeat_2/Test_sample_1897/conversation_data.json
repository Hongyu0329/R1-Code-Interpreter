    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in standard form**\n\nLet the infinite product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Since $\\pi > 0$, we have $0 < q < 1$. The product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nIn terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is denoted as $P = (q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to Jacobi Theta Functions**\n\nThe Jacobi theta functions have well-known infinite product representations. We are interested in $\\theta_4(q)$, which is defined as:\n$\\theta_4(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^n q^{n^2} = 1 - 2q + 2q^4 - 2q^9 + \\cdots$\nIts product representation is:\n$\\theta_4(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n}) \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})^2$\nLet's analyze the components of this product:\n1.  $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n}) = (1-q^2)(1-q^4)(1-q^6)\\cdots = (q^2;q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n2.  $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = P$.\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\theta_4(q)$, we get:\n$\\theta_4(q) = (q^2;q^2)_{\\infty} \\cdot P^2$\nFrom this, we can express $P^2$ as:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{(q^2;q^2)_{\\infty}} = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})}$\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the numerator, $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$**\n\nTo evaluate theta functions at specific values of $q$, we use the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms. The argument $q$ of the theta function is related to the elliptic modulus $k$ via the nome $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$, where $\\tau = i \\frac{K'(k)}{K(k)}$. Here, $K(k)$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and $K'(k) = K(\\sqrt{1-k^2})$.\n\nFor our argument $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we have $i\\pi\\tau = -\\pi$, which gives $\\tau = i$.\nFor $\\tau=i$, we have $\\frac{K'(k)}{K(k)} = 1$. This implies $K(k) = K(k')$, which occurs when $k=k'$. From $k^2+k'^2=1$, we get $2k^2=1$, so $k = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. This is known as the singular modulus $k_1$.\n\nNow, we use two standard identities relating theta functions to $k$ and $K(k)$:\n1.  $k'(k) = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\theta_3(q)}\\right)^2$\n2.  $\\theta_3(q)^2 = \\frac{2K(k)}{\\pi}$\n\nFor $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we have $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$. From the first identity:\n$1/\\sqrt{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})}\\right)^2 \\implies \\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})^2$\nSo, $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{1}{2^{1/4}}\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})$.\n\nFor the value of $K(1/\\sqrt{2})$, we use the known result involving the Gamma function:\n$K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}$\nUsing the second identity, we find $\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})$:\n$\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2\\pi^{3/2}}$\n$\\theta_3(e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\nNow, we can find $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$:\n$\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = 2^{-1/4} \\theta_3(e^{-\\pi}) = 2^{-1/4} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi^{3/4}} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the denominator, $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})$**\n\nThe denominator is the product $(e^{-2\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty$. A known value for this infinite product, which can be found in classical texts such as Whittaker and Watson's \"A Course of Modern Analysis\" (p. 484, ex. 2), is:\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results to find P**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the formula for $P^2$:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-2n\\pi})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}$\nWe can cancel the common terms $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{3/4}$:\n$P^2 = \\frac{1/2^{3/4}}{1/2} = \\frac{2}{2^{3/4}} = 2^{1-3/4} = 2^{1/4}$\n\nFinally, taking the square root gives the value of the product $P$. Since all terms $(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ are positive, the product $P$ must be positive.\n$P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/8}$\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correctly identifying the product:** The product is of the form $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$ with $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n*   **Choice of identities:** The calculation relies on several deep identities from the theory of elliptic and theta functions. It is crucial to use a consistent set of definitions, particularly for the nome $q$ which can be $e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ or $e^{2i\\pi\\tau}$. Here we consistently used the nome $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$, for which $q=e^{-\\pi}$ corresponds to $\\tau=i$ and $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   **Known values:** The calculation hinges on two specific known values: $K(1/\\sqrt{2})$ in terms of the Gamma function, and the value of the infinite product $\\prod(1-e^{-2n\\pi})$. These are standard but non-trivial results.\n*   **Algebraic simplification:** The final steps involve careful simplification of fractions involving powers and special functions. It's important to track the exponents correctly.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final closed expression for the infinite product is obtained by the analysis above.\nThe final value is $2^{1/8}$."
