    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two specific conditions simultaneously:\n1.  The element `g` must have a **regular eigenvector**.\n2.  The eigenvalue `λ` corresponding to this regular eigenvector must have an **order of 10**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Context and Definitions\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron (or dodecahedron). Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It is generated by 3 simple reflections.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is given as `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for any integer `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `e^(2πi/10)`).\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of points fixed by a reflection in the group.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Key Theorem of Regular Elements\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the theory of finite reflection groups, established by T.A. Springer and G.I. Lehrer, that directly connects the concepts in the question. The theorem states:\n\n> For a finite Coxeter group `W` with Coxeter number `h`, an element `g ∈ W` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue that is a primitive `h`-th root of unity if and only if `g` is conjugate to a Coxeter element `c` of `W`.\n\nA **Coxeter element** is defined as the product of all simple reflections, taken in some order. All Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other, so they form a single conjugacy class.\n\nApplying this theorem to our problem:\n*   `W` is the group H3.\n*   The Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n*   The question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue has order 10 (i.e., is a primitive 10th root of unity).\n\nThe theorem tells us that the elements satisfying these conditions are precisely those elements that are conjugate to a Coxeter element. Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element in H3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Size of the Conjugacy Class of a Coxeter Element\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of an element `c` in a group `W` is given by the formula:\n`Size(Class(c)) = |W| / |Z_W(c)|`\nwhere `Z_W(c)` is the centralizer of `c` in `W` (the subgroup of elements that commute with `c`).\n\nFor any finite Coxeter group, another key result states that the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself:\n`Z_W(c) = <c>`\n\nThe order of this cyclic group `|<c>|` is simply the order of the element `c`. The order of any Coxeter element is equal to the Coxeter number, `h`.\n\nFor H3, we have:\n*   Order of the group: `|H3| = 120`\n*   Coxeter number: `h = 10`\n*   Order of the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c`: `|Z_H3(c)| = h = 10`\n\nNow, we can calculate the size of the conjugacy class:\n`Size(Class(c)) = |H3| / |Z_H3(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe number of elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 is equal to the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element. As calculated above, this number is 12.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Distinguishing from all elements of order 10:** The group H3 has 24 elements of order 10. These fall into two distinct conjugacy classes of size 12. One class consists of the Coxeter elements (and their conjugates). The other 12 elements also have eigenvalues that are primitive 10th roots of unity, but by the theorem, their corresponding eigenvectors are *not* regular (i.e., they lie on one of the 15 reflection planes of the icosahedron). The \"regular eigenvector\" condition is crucial for selecting only one of these two classes.\n2.  **Correct application of theorems:** The solution relies on two standard but powerful theorems about reflection groups. Understanding that the problem is a direct application of these theorems is the most efficient path to the solution, avoiding complex geometric calculations.\n\nThe final answer is the size of the conjugacy class of the Coxeter elements.\n\n<<<12>>>"
