Yes, the theory can fail. The reversal process is mathematically equivalent to applying the inverse of the system's total transmission matrix. The original reversal process is tailored to the specific matrix of the system *without* the birefringent medium. When the birefringent layer is added, the system's total transmission matrix changes. The core reason for the failure is that the matrix representing the birefringent medium does not commute with the matrix for the random medium. The random medium scrambles the polarization of the beam, and the birefringent plate then alters the phase relationship between the new polarization components. Since the original inverse operation does not account for this alteration, applying it to the output of the new system will not successfully reconstruct the original input beam.
