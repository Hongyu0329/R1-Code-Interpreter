    "Answering the question requires analyzing the properties of Schwartz class functions and their relationship with the Fourier transform. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem Statement:**\n    *   **Function Class:** We are given a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that belongs to the Schwartz space, denoted $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$. A function is in the Schwartz space if it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse power of $|x|$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. This is a very strong condition on the function's smoothness and decay.\n    *   **Condition:** The condition is that all the moments of the function are zero. The $k$-th moment of $f$ is given by $m_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$. So, we have $m_k = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{0\\}$. (Note: The analysis holds even if the condition is restricted to $k \\in \\{1, 2, ...\\}$ as explained in the \"Careful Points\" section below).\n    *   **Question:** We need to determine if these two properties—being a Schwartz function and having all moments equal to zero—are sufficient to prove that the function must be the zero function, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Connecting Moments to the Fourier Transform:**\n    The structure of the condition (integrals against powers of $x$) suggests using the Fourier transform. Let's define the Fourier transform of $f(x)$ as:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\mathcal{F}[f](\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    A fundamental result in Fourier analysis is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function.\n\n3.  **Investigating Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:**\n    Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is a Schwartz function, it is infinitely differentiable. We can find its derivatives by differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible due to the rapid decay of $f(x)$):\n    $$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} = \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\n    Now, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin, $\\xi = 0$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{0} \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\n    This formula establishes a direct link between the moments of $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin.\n\n4.  **Applying the Given Condition:**\n    We are given that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. Substituting this into our formula for the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ gives:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n    This means that $\\hat{f}$ and all of its derivatives vanish at $\\xi=0$.\n\n5.  **Using Properties of the Fourier Transform of a Schwartz Function:**\n    A key property that goes beyond $\\hat{f}$ simply being in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function can be extended to an analytic function over the entire complex plane (an \"entire function\"). Let's call this extension $\\hat{f}(z)$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n    An analytic function is uniquely determined by its Taylor series in its domain of convergence. The Taylor series of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$ is given by:\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n    Since we found that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, every coefficient in this Taylor series is zero. This means the series itself is identically zero.\n    Because $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is analytic, it must be equal to its Taylor series. Therefore:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\n\n6.  **Concluding the Proof:**\n    We have established that the Fourier transform of $f$ is the zero function. The Fourier transform is an invertible map on the Schwartz space. This means that if the transform of a function is zero, the original function must also be zero. We can see this explicitly via the inverse Fourier transform:\n    $$ f(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{f}](x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi $$\n    Since $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$, the integral is zero:\n    $$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0 $$\n    Thus, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **The necessity of the Schwartz condition:** This result is not true for more general classes of functions. The \"problem of moments\" is the question of whether a function is uniquely determined by its moments. There exist non-zero $C^\\infty$ functions (which are not in $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$) all of whose moments are zero. The rapid decay of Schwartz functions is crucial because it ensures that their Fourier transforms are analytic, which is the key property used in Step 5.\n*   **The case $k \\in \\{1, 2, ...\\}$:** If the problem assumed the condition only for positive integers $k$, the conclusion would still hold. The argument would show $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for $k \\ge 1$. The Taylor series would then imply $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\hat{f}(0)$, i.e., $\\hat{f}$ is a constant. But since $\\hat{f} \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$, it must decay to zero at infinity. The only constant function with this property is the zero function. So $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, leading to the same conclusion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the condition that all moments of a Schwartz function are zero is sufficient to conclude that the function is identically zero.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
