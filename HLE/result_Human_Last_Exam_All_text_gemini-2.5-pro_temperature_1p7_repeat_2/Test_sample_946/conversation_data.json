    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about a specific detail in an online cartoon.\n2.  **Identify the Series:** The series is \"Homestar Runner\".\n3.  **Identify the Episode:** The episode is \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n4.  **Identify the Event:** The event within the episode is the \"Junior prom\".\n5.  **Identify the Object in Question:** The object is a \"cardboard cutout\" that is acting as a performer.\n6.  **Identify the Character Type:** The character is a \"fictional singer\".\n7.  **Determine the Goal:** The goal is to find the name of this fictional singer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Episode Specificity:** The answer must come specifically from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", not from any other episode or part of the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   **Fictional Character:** The singer is not a real-world celebrity but a character invented for the cartoon.\n*   **Visual Gag:** The humor comes from the fact that the \"live performance\" at the prom is just a static cardboard cutout, highlighting the low-budget and underwhelming nature of the event. We need to identify how this character is named within the episode.\n*   **Spelling and Capitalization:** The name of the character should be identified as it appears in the cartoon.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  The episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" focuses on the four main girls (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) getting ready for and attending their Junior Prom.\n2.  During the scene set at the prom, the musical entertainment is shown on a stage.\n3.  Instead of a live band or singer, the \"performer\" is a cardboard cutout of a male singer holding a microphone.\n4.  A banner is placed in front of the cutout on the stage. The banner reads: \"Live Performance by SPARROW\".\n5.  Therefore, the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is Sparrow.\n\n<<<Sparrow>>>"
