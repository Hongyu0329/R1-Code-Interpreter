    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice for the given path algebra.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\nThe algebra is $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$, the path algebra of the quiver $Q$ of type $A_3$ with linear orientation. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra over the complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$.\n\nThe indecomposable modules over $A$ can be visualized as intervals $[i, j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$. Let $M(i,j)$ denote the indecomposable module corresponding to the interval $[i, j]$. Its representation is a string of identity maps on $\\mathbb{C}$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and zero spaces/maps elsewhere. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules:\n*   $S_1 = M(1,1): \\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0$\n*   $S_2 = M(2,2): 0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$\n*   $S_3 = M(3,3): 0 \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{C}$\n*   $M(1,2): \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\to 0$\n*   $M(2,3): 0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$\n*   $M(1,3): \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C} \\xrightarrow{1} \\mathbb{C}$\n\nLet's identify the projective and injective indecomposable modules:\n*   The projective modules are $P_i = Ae_i$.\n    *   $P_1 = M(1,3)$\n    *   $P_2 = M(2,3)$\n    *   $P_3 = M(3,3) = S_3$\n*   The injective modules are $I_i = D(e_i A)$.\n    *   $I_1 = M(1,1) = S_1$\n    *   $I_2 = M(1,2)$\n    *   $I_3 = M(1,3) = P_1$\nWe note that $P_1 = I_3$ is both projective and injective.\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules**\n\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module:** For a hereditary algebra like $A$, the concepts of $\\tau$-tilting module and tilting module coincide. A tilting module $T$ is an $A$-module satisfying:\n    1.  $\\text{pd}(T) \\le 1$ (which is always true for hereditary algebras).\n    2.  $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T) = 0$ (the module is rigid).\n    3.  $T$ has $|A|=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable direct summands.\n*   **Slice module:** A slice module is a specific type of tilting module. A key theorem by Ringel states that a tilting module $T$ over a hereditary algebra $A$ is a slice module if and only if the Gabriel quiver of its endomorphism algebra, $\\text{End}_A(T)$, has no oriented cycles.\n\nThe question asks for the unique tilting module $T$ for which the quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ contains an oriented cycle.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Endomorphism Algebras of Tilting Modules**\n\nThe Gabriel quiver of $B = \\text{End}_A(T)$ has vertices corresponding to the indecomposable summands of $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$. There is an arrow from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if there exists a homomorphism $f: T_i \\to T_j$ that is irreducible in the category of modules over $B$ (i.e., it cannot be written as a sum of compositions $T_i \\to T_k \\to T_j$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$). A cycle in this quiver means we have a sequence of such irreducible maps $T_{i_1} \\to T_{i_2} \\to \\dots \\to T_{i_k} \\to T_{i_1}$.\n\nWe need to find a tilting module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ such that we can find cycles of maps between its summands. This requires finding summands $T_i, T_j$ such that both $\\text{Hom}_A(T_i, T_j)$ and $\\text{Hom}_A(T_j, T_i)$ are non-zero.\n\nLet's look for such pairs among the indecomposable modules. A homomorphism from $M(i,j)$ to $M(k,l)$ exists if there is a module map between their representations. This generally restricts the possibilities. For example, $\\text{Hom}_A(M(1,2), M(2,3)) = 0$ and $\\text{Hom}_A(M(2,3), M(1,2)) = 0$.\n\nLet's consider pairs involving the projective-injective module $M(1,3)$:\n*   Consider $T_i = M(1,2)$ and $T_j = M(1,3)$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M(1,2), M(1,3))$ is non-zero. The inclusion map exists (its cokernel is $S_3$).\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M(1,3), M(1,2))$ is non-zero. The projection map exists (its kernel is $S_3$).\n*   Consider $T_i = M(2,3)$ and $T_j = M(1,3)$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M(2,3), M(1,3))$ is non-zero. This is the inclusion of a submodule ($\\text{rad}(M(1,3))$).\n    *   $\\text{Hom}_A(M(1,3), M(2,3))$ is non-zero. This is the projection map with kernel $S_1$. (No, $M(1,3)/S_1$ is not indecomposable. It is the projection map $M(1,3) \\to M(1,3)/M(1,1)$ no... a projection map $M(1,3)\\to M(2,3)$ exists.)\n\nThis suggests that a tilting module containing these modules might have cycles in its endomorphism algebra.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Candidate Module and Verify**\n\nLet's test the module $T = M(1,2) \\oplus M(2,3) \\oplus M(1,3)$.\nLet $T_1 = M(1,2)$, $T_2 = M(2,3)$, $T_3 = M(1,3)$.\n\n1.  **Is $T$ a tilting module?**\n    *   It has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n    *   We check rigidity: $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$.\n        *   $T_1 = I_2$ is injective. So $\\text{Ext}^1_A(X, T_1)=0$ for any $X$.\n        *   $T_2 = P_2$ is projective. So $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_2, X)=0$ for any $X$.\n        *   $T_3 = P_1 = I_3$ is projective and injective. So $\\text{Ext}^1_A(X, T_3)=0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_3, X)=0$ for any $X$.\n    All possible $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T_i, T_j)$ groups are zero. Thus, $T$ is a tilting module.\n\n2.  **Does the quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ have a cycle?**\n    *   We have non-zero homomorphisms:\n        *   $f_{13}: M(1,2) \\to M(1,3)$ (inclusion)\n        *   $f_{31}: M(1,3) \\to M(1,2)$ (projection)\n        *   $f_{23}: M(2,3) \\to M(1,3)$ (inclusion)\n        *   $f_{32}: M(1,3) \\to M(2,3)$ (projection)\n    *   All other Hom spaces between distinct summands are zero.\n    *   Consider the cycle of maps $M(1,2) \\xrightarrow{f_{13}} M(1,3) \\xrightarrow{f_{31}} M(1,2)$. The composition $f_{31} \\circ f_{13}$ is a non-zero endomorphism of $M(1,2)$ which is not an isomorphism, hence it's in the radical. The maps $f_{13}$ and $f_{31}$ cannot be factored through any other summand of $T$ (since $\\text{Hom}(T_1, T_2)=0$, etc.). Therefore, they give rise to arrows $1 \\to 3$ and $3 \\to 1$ in the Gabriel quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$.\n    *   Similarly, the maps $f_{23}$ and $f_{32}$ give rise to arrows $2 \\to 3$ and $3 \\to 2$.\n    *   The Gabriel quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ has cycles (e.g., $1 \\to 3 \\to 1$). Therefore, $T$ is not a slice module.\n\nIt is a known result in the representation theory of hereditary algebras of type $A_n$ that there is a unique (up to isomorphism) tilting module whose endomorphism algebra has an oriented cycle. For $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$, this module is precisely $T = M(1,2) \\oplus M(2,3) \\oplus M(1,3)$."
