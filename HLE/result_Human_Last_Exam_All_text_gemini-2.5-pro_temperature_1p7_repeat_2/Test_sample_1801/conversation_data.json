    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify two specific individuals who meet three criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial was from the year 2000 and featured the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Recall/Research Enron's Advertising:** In 2000, just before its infamous collapse, Enron launched a high-profile corporate image advertising campaign with the theme \"Ask Why.\" The campaign's goal was to portray Enron not just as an energy company, but as a revolutionary, innovative global firm leading the new economy. The ads featured various respected figures.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nobel Laureates:** Research into this specific \"Ask Why\" campaign reveals that two prominent economists, who are also Nobel laureates, participated.\n    *   **Merton Miller:** He was a Nobel laureate at the time of the commercial. He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his work on corporate finance theory. He was a strong proponent of free-market principles, which aligned with Enron's public messaging. Miller passed away in June 2000, shortly after filming the ad.\n    *   **Paul Krugman:** At the time the commercial was filmed in 2000, Krugman was a highly respected economist at MIT but had not yet received his Nobel Prize. He was later awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns. He has since publicly expressed regret for appearing in the ad, often citing it as a personal lesson in skepticism.\n\n4.  **Verify the Details:**\n    *   **Were they Nobel laureates?** Yes. Merton Miller was a laureate in 1990, before the commercial. Paul Krugman became a laureate in 2008, after the commercial. The question asks for two \"Nobel laureates,\" a description that accurately applies to both men, regardless of the timing of the award relative to the commercial.\n    *   **Was it for Enron?** Yes, both appeared in Enron's commercials.\n    *   **Was it the \"Ask Why\" campaign in 2000?** Yes, this was the specific campaign they were part of.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** The key point of nuance is that only one of the two, Merton Miller, was a Nobel laureate *at the time the ad aired*. Paul Krugman received his award eight years later. However, the question is phrased to identify the two individuals who hold this distinction, making both of them correct answers.\n*   **The Irony:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign is now considered \"infamous\" because asking why about Enron's financials would have exposed the massive fraud that led to its bankruptcy in 2001. The participation of respected figures like Miller and Krugman lent the company an unearned veneer of credibility, which makes their appearance particularly notable in retrospect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign were Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Merton Miller and Paul Krugman>>>"
