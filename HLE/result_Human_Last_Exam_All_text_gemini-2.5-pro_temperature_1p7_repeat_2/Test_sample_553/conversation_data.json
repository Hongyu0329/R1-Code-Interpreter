    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n    *   **\"The Beatles\"**: The search is limited to the discography of The Beatles.\n    *   **\"starts with\"**: The chord progression must happen at the very beginning of the song, in the introduction or the first line of the verse.\n    *   **\"Tonic\" (I chord)**: This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. For example, in the key of C Major, the tonic chord is C Major. In G Major, the tonic is G Major.\n    *   **\"Minor fifth chord\" (v chord)**: This is the crucial part.\n        *   The \"fifth\" refers to the fifth note of the key's scale. In the key of G Major, the fifth note is D.\n        *   Normally, in a major key, the chord built on the fifth note is a *major* chord (the V chord, or dominant), which would be D Major in the key of G.\n        *   A \"minor fifth chord\" means this chord is changed to a minor quality. So, in the key of G Major, the minor fifth chord would be **D Minor**. This harmonic choice is often achieved by borrowing from the parallel minor key (G minor in this case).\n    *   **\"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\"**: The song must begin on the I chord and its first chord change must be to the v chord. The progression is **I → v**.\n\n2.  **Search for the Progression (I → v) in Beatles Songs**\n    *   We are looking for a song in a major key that immediately moves to its minor dominant. Let's test this in a common Beatles key, such as G major. In G Major, the progression would be **G Major → D Minor**.\n    *   Let's analyze the song **\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\"** from the album *Help!*.\n        *   **Key**: The song is widely recognized as being in the key of **G Major**.\n        *   **Tonic (I) Chord**: The tonic chord is **G Major**.\n        *   **Start of the Song**: The song begins with John Lennon strumming a **G Major** chord on an acoustic guitar. The first vocal line, \"Here I stand head in hand...\", is sung entirely over this G Major chord.\n        *   **The \"Jump\"**: The first chord change in the song occurs on the next line, \"Turn my face to the wall...\". The chord played here is a **D Minor** chord.\n        *   **Conclusion for this song**: The progression at the very start of \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" is G Major → D Minor, which is a perfect match for the **I → v** progression described in the question.\n\n3.  **Careful Points & Evaluation of Other Candidates**\n    *   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is known for its sophisticated chords. The famous chorus starts in F major (\"Michelle, ma belle...\"), but the verse and intro are in F minor. The intro progression leads from a Cm chord into an Fm chord, which is a v → i progression in the key of F minor. This is the reverse of what is asked.\n    *   **\"Yesterday\"**: The song is in F Major. The opening progression is F (I) → Em7 → A7 → Dm. The second chord, Em7, is built on the 7th degree of the F scale (E), not the 5th degree (C). Therefore, it does not fit the criteria.\n    *   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: The famous opening chord is a complex G11sus4 (or similar), which resolves to C major for the verse. This is not a simple I → v progression.\n\nThe analysis confirms that \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" is the correct answer. The song's structure in G major, its clear start on the tonic G major chord, and its immediate first change to the minor fifth D minor chord precisely match the user's question.\n\n<<<You've Got to Hide Your Love Away>>>"
