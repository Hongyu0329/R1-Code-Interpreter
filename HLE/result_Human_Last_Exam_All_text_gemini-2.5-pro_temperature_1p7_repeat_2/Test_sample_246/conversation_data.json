    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components of the problem**\n\n*   **Knot:** The trefoil knot, denoted $K = 3_1$.\n*   **Knot Group:** The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot in $S^3$, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$, is denoted $G_K$. A standard presentation for the trefoil group is $G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$. This group is isomorphic to the braid group $B_3$.\n*   **Twist-Spun Knot:** We are considering the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which is a 2-sphere $S_{K,5}$ embedded in $S^4$.\n*   **Branched Cover:** We are interested in the 4-manifold $M$ that is the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ over $S_{K,5}$.\n*   **Goal:** Find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$, denoted $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group of the complement of the spun knot**\n\nTo find $\\pi_1(M)$, we first need the fundamental group of the complement of the spun knot, $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{K,5})$. A presentation for this group can be derived from the knot group $G_K$. We need a meridian-longitude pair for $K$.\n\n*   **Meridian and Longitude for the Trefoil:** For the group $G_K = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$, the element $z = a^2 = b^3$ is central. A meridian $\\mu$ is an element whose image in the abelianization $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ is a generator. Let's take $\\mu = ab^{-1}$. In the abelianization $G_K^{ab}$, $2\\bar{a}=3\\bar{b}$, so $\\mathbb{Z}$ is generated by $k$ where $\\bar{a}=3k, \\bar{b}=2k$. The image of $\\mu$ is $\\bar{a}-\\bar{b}=3k-2k=k$, which is a generator. So $\\mu$ is a meridian.\n    A longitude $\\lambda$ is an element whose image in $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ is trivial (i.e., its linking number with the knot is 0). A standard choice for the preferred longitude is $\\lambda = a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}$. Its image in the abelianization is $2\\bar{a}-6(\\bar{a}-\\bar{b}) = -4\\bar{a}+6\\bar{b} = -4(3k)+6(2k)=0$. So $\\lambda$ is a longitude.\n\n*   **Group of the Twist-Spun Knot Complement:** For an $m$-twist-spun knot, the fundamental group of its complement is given by the presentation:\n    $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{K,m}) = \\langle G_K, t \\mid [\\mu, t]=1, \\lambda=t^m \\rangle$.\n    Here, $t$ is a new generator corresponding to a meridian of the spun surface.\n    For our case, $m=5$. So the group, let's call it $G_S$, is:\n    $G_S = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, [ab^{-1}, t]=1, a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}=t^5 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\n\nThe fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover $M$ is obtained by taking the group of the complement $G_S$ and adding the relation that the square of a meridian is trivial.\n$\\pi_1(M) = G_S / \\langle\\langle t^2 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle$.\nLet $\\Pi = \\pi_1(M)$. The presentation for $\\Pi$ is:\n$\\Pi = \\langle a, b, t \\mid a^2=b^3, [ab^{-1}, t]=1, a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}=t^5, t^2=1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the presentation for $\\Pi$**\n\nThe relations are:\n1.  $a^2=b^3$\n2.  $[ab^{-1}, t]=1$\n3.  $a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}=t^5$\n4.  $t^2=1$\n\nFrom (4), we have $t^5 = (t^2)^2 t = 1^2 t = t$.\nSubstituting this into (3), we get $a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6} = t$.\nNow we can eliminate the generator $t$. The group $\\Pi$ can be presented with just generators $a$ and $b$. Let's check the relations.\nRelation (2) becomes $[ab^{-1}, a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}]=1$. Let $g=ab^{-1}$. The relation is $[g, a^2g^{-6}]=1$. Since $a^2$ is central in $G_K$, it commutes with all elements, including $g$. So, $[g, a^2g^{-6}] = [g, g^{-6}]=1$, which is always true. Thus, relation (2) is redundant.\nRelation (4) becomes $(a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6})^2 = 1$. This is the crucial new relation.\n\nSo, the simplified presentation for our group is:\n$\\Pi = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2=b^3, (a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6})^2 = 1 \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators $d(\\Pi)$**\n\nThe number of generators of a group $G$, $d(G)$, must be at least the rank of its abelianization, $d(G_{ab})$.\nLet's compute the abelianization $\\Pi_{ab} = \\Pi / [\\Pi, \\Pi]$.\nIn an abelian group (with additive notation), the relations become:\n1.  $2\\bar{a} - 3\\bar{b} = 0$ (from $a^2=b^3$)\n2.  $2(2\\bar{a} - 6(\\bar{a}-\\bar{b}))=0$ (from $(a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6})^2=1$). This simplifies to $4\\bar{a}-12\\bar{a}+12\\bar{b}=0 \\implies -8\\bar{a}+12\\bar{b}=0 \\implies 2\\bar{a}=3\\bar{b}$.\n\nBoth relations yield the same equation $2\\bar{a}=3\\bar{b}$. So the abelianization is $\\Pi_{ab} = \\langle \\bar{a}, \\bar{b} \\mid 2\\bar{a}=3\\bar{b} \\rangle$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}$ is 1.\nSo, $d(\\Pi_{ab})=1$. This implies $d(\\Pi) \\ge 1$.\n\nIf $d(\\Pi)$ were 1, $\\Pi$ would be a cyclic group, and therefore abelian.\nLet's check if $\\Pi$ is abelian.\nThe trefoil group $B_3 = \\langle a,b | a^2=b^3 \\rangle$ is not abelian (e.g., $ab \\neq ba$). Adding the relation $(a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6})^2=1$ is unlikely to make the group abelian.\nTo prove this, we can find a non-abelian homomorphic image of $\\Pi$. Consider the homomorphism $\\phi: B_3 \\to S_3$ (the symmetric group on 3 elements) defined by $\\phi(a)=(12)$ and $\\phi(b)=(123)$.\n$\\phi(a^2)=(12)^2=e$ (identity).\n$\\phi(b^3)=(123)^3=e$.\nThe relation $a^2=b^3$ is mapped to $e=e$, so this is a valid homomorphism.\nNow let's check the second relation of $\\Pi$: $(a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6})^2=1$.\nThe image of the term inside the parenthesis is $\\phi(a^2(ab^{-1})^{-6}) = \\phi(a^2) (\\phi(ab^{-1}))^{-6} = e \\cdot (\\phi(a)\\phi(b)^{-1})^{-6}$.\n$\\phi(a)\\phi(b)^{-1} = (12)(132) = (23)$.\nSo we check $(\\phi(ab^{-1}))^{-6} = ((23))^{-6} = ((23)^2)^{-3} = e^{-3} = e$.\nThe image of the entire relation is therefore $e=e$. The homomorphism is also well-defined on $\\Pi$.\nSince there is a surjective homomorphism from $\\Pi$ to the non-abelian group $S_3$, $\\Pi$ itself must be non-abelian.\n\nSince $\\Pi$ is not abelian, it cannot be cyclic, so it cannot be generated by a single element. Therefore, $d(\\Pi) > 1$.\nThe presentation $\\Pi = \\langle a, b \\mid \\dots \\rangle$ shows that the group can be generated by two elements, $a$ and $b$. Thus, $d(\\Pi) \\le 2$.\nCombining our findings, $1 < d(\\Pi) \\le 2$. Since the number of generators must be an integer, we conclude that the minimal number of generators is 2."
