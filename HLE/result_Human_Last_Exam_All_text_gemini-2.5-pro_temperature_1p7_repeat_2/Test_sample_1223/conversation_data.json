    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the objects and the question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x$ is a point in $X$.\n\nLet's break down the terms:\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space. Since a continuum is non-empty, if it's non-degenerate (contains more than one point), then $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is also non-empty. We assume $X$ is non-degenerate.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a classic example.\n*   **Composant:** In a continuum $Z$, the composant of a point $p \\in Z$ is the set of all points $q \\in Z$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $Z$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n    *   If $Z$ is decomposable, it has only one composant, which is $Z$ itself.\n    *   If $Z$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it is partitioned into uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) disjoint composants.\n*   **Stone-Cech Compactification:** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, its Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space containing $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech Remainder:** The set of points added to $Y$ to form its compactification, i.e., $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. Let's denote this remainder by $R$.\n\nThe question is to find the maximum possible number of composants of the space $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the topological properties of the remainder $R$\n\nTo count the composants of $R$, we first need to understand its fundamental properties, specifically whether it is a continuum and whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n1.  **Is R a continuum?**\n    $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a connected, locally compact, non-compact space. The remainder $R$ is a closed, and therefore compact, subset of the compact space $\\beta Y$. It is a deep result in continuum theory that the remainder is also connected. So, $R$ is a continuum.\n\n2.  **Is R decomposable or indecomposable?**\n    This is the crucial part of the analysis. A key theorem by David P. Bellamy (1971) states that if $X$ is any indecomposable continuum and $p \\in X$, then the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{p\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{p\\})$ is an indecomposable continuum. Since a hereditary indecomposable continuum is, by definition, indecomposable, this theorem applies directly to our situation.\n    Therefore, the remainder $R$ is an indecomposable continuum.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if the remainder $R$ is non-degenerate\n\nNow that we know $R$ is an indecomposable continuum, we can determine the number of its composants. An indecomposable continuum has one composant if it is degenerate (consists of a single point) and uncountably many ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants if it is non-degenerate.\n\n*   The remainder $R$ consists of a single point if and only if the Stone-Cech compactification $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   The one-point compactification of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is homeomorphic to $X$ itself.\n*   So, $R$ is a single point if and only if $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\cong X$.\n*   For $X$ to be the Stone-Cech compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, it must be that every bounded continuous real-valued function on $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ can be extended continuously to $X$.\n*   However, this is not true for indecomposable continua. Indecomposable continua are known to be nowhere locally connected. For any point $x \\in X$, one can construct a bounded continuous function on $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ that oscillates \"infinitely often\" as it approaches $x$ from different directions within the topological space, making a continuous extension to $x$ impossible.\n*   More formally, let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two distinct composants of $X$. As composants are dense in $X$, the point $x$ is a limit point of both $C_1 \\cap (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ and $C_2 \\cap (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. It's possible to construct a function that is, for instance, 0 on $C_1$ and 1 on $C_2$. Such a function defined on $(C_1 \\cup C_2) \\cap (X\\setminus\\{x\\})$ can be extended to all of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, but it cannot be extended continuously to $x$. This shows that $X$ is not the Stone-Cech compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   Therefore, the remainder $R$ is not a single point; it is a **non-degenerate indecomposable continuum**.\n\n### Step 4: Count the composants of a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory, dating back to Mazurkiewicz, states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants. A more precise result establishes that the number of composants is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n\nThis result holds for metric and non-metric continua alike. The remainder $R$ is not necessarily metrizable (in fact, it isn't, since $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not compact), but it is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, so it must have $2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFor any hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Cech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum. As such, the number of its composants is always $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible number*. Since the number of composants is constant ($2^{\\aleph_0}$) for all choices of $X$ and $x$ that fit the problem description, the maximum possible number is simply this value.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
