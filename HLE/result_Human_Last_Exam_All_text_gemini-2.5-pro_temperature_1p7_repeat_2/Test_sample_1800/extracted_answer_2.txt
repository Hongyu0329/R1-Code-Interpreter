The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the specific application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal molar ratio to maximize catalytic performance is typically around **0.25**. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), a much lower doping level is ideal, with the optimal molar ratio being around **0.053**.
