    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations defined by the functions F, G, and H. The conditions for the existence of such a point are derived from fixed-point theory in metric spaces, most commonly by applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to an operator on the product space `X × Y × Z`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Clarifying the Definitions**\n\nFirst, we must define the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" based on the provided function signatures. The question contains a typo, listing `G` twice. We assume the intended functions are:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z` (assuming the second `G` was meant to be `H`)\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Careful Point:** The order and content of arguments in each function (`(x,y,z)`, `(y,x,y)`, `(z,y,x)`) are crucial and must be handled precisely when formulating the conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrasing as a Standard Fixed-Point Problem**\n\nThe problem of finding a solution to this system of equations can be transformed into a standard fixed-point problem. We define a single operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   Let `T: W → W` be defined as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n*   A fixed point of this operator `T` is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ W` such that `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`.\n*   This is exactly the definition of an FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point to exist are the conditions for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (also known as the Contraction Mapping Principle) provides a powerful set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. The theorem states that a contraction mapping on a non-empty complete metric space has a unique fixed point. Applying this to our operator `T` gives us the conditions.\n\n**Careful Point:** The Banach theorem guarantees both **existence and uniqueness**. Other theorems might guarantee only existence under weaker conditions, but the contraction principle provides the most standard and fundamental answer.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Conditions**\n\nBased on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, we can state two primary conditions.\n\n**Condition 1: Conditions on the Spaces `X, Y, Z`**\nThe underlying spaces must form a complete metric space.\n*   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces.\n*   For the theorem to apply, they must be **non-empty and complete**.\n*   If they are complete, their product space `W = X × Y × Z` is also a non-empty complete metric space under a standard product metric, such as the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n**Careful Point:** Completeness is a critical requirement. A contraction mapping on an incomplete space is not guaranteed to have a fixed point within that space (e.g., `f(x) = x/2` on the space `(0, 1]`).\n\n**Condition 2: Conditions on the Functions `F, G, H` (The Contraction Condition)**\nThe operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping** on `W`. This means there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nSubstituting the definitions of `T` and the metric `d_W`, we get the central condition on `F, G, H`:\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n\n**Step 5: A More Practical (Sufficient) Condition**\nThe single inequality above is the formal condition. A more practical, though more restrictive, sufficient condition can be derived by assuming `F, G, H` are Lipschitz continuous in their arguments.\n\nAssume there exist non-negative Lipschitz constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ` such that:\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ (b₁ + b₃)d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\nSumming these inequalities, we get:\n`LHS ≤ (a₁ + b₂ + c₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (a₂ + b₁ + b₃ + c₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (a₃ + c₁)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nFor the contraction condition to hold, we need the right-hand side to be less than or equal to `k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`. This is satisfied if the coefficients for each metric term are bounded by a value `k < 1`. Therefore, a sufficient condition is:\n`max( a₁ + b₂ + c₃,   a₂ + b₁ + b₃ + c₂,   a₃ + c₁ ) < 1`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, a set of sufficient conditions for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n1.  **Conditions on the Spaces**: The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**.\n\n2.  **Conditions on the Functions**: The functions must collectively satisfy a **contraction property**. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality is satisfied:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n\n<<<The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point, based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, are:\n1.  The sets X, Y, and Z must be **non-empty, complete metric spaces**. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n2.  The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a **contraction condition** on the product space `X × Y × Z`. This means there must exist a single constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`>>>"
