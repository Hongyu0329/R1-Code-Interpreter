    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to find the determinant of a matrix related to the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". The question explicitly provides the matrix in question:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    **Careful Point:** The phrasing \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" might be confusing. However, since the matrix `A` is explicitly defined, the primary task is to compute the determinant of this given matrix `A`. The other information likely serves as context to identify the matrix, or it might be irrelevant to the calculation itself. We should proceed by calculating the determinant of the provided matrix `A`.\n\n2.  **Examine the Matrix Properties:** Before calculating, we can inspect the matrix `A` for special properties that might simplify the computation.\n    *   The matrix is symmetric (\\(A = A^T\\)).\n    *   The sum of the elements in each row is the same:\n        *   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n        *   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n        *   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n    *   Similarly, the sum of the elements in each column is 0.\n    **Careful Point:** A square matrix where the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) is zero is a singular matrix. This means its determinant must be zero. This observation provides the fastest path to the answer.\n\n3.  **Select a Calculation Method:** Several methods can be used to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n    *   **Linear Dependence:** Using the property identified in point 2.\n    *   **Cofactor Expansion:** A standard algorithm for computing determinants.\n    *   **Sarrus' Rule:** A simplified version of the cofactor expansion specific to 3x3 matrices.\n    We will use the linear dependence property for a quick solution and verify it with cofactor expansion.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Method 1: Using the Property of Linearly Dependent Vectors**\n\n1.  Let the column vectors of matrix `A` be \\(c_1, c_2, c_3\\).\n    \\[ c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad c_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n2.  Consider the sum of these column vectors:\n    \\[ c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-1-1 \\\\ -1+2-1 \\\\ -1-1+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n3.  Since there is a non-trivial linear combination of the column vectors that equals the zero vector (specifically, \\(1 \\cdot c_1 + 1 \\cdot c_2 + 1 \\cdot c_3 = 0\\)), the column vectors are linearly dependent.\n4.  A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that the determinant of a matrix is zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent.\n5.  Therefore, we can conclude that \\(\\det(A) = 0\\).\n\n**Method 2: Verification using Cofactor Expansion**\n\n1.  The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n    \\[ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = a(ei-fh) - b(di-fg) + c(dh-eg) \\]\n2.  For our matrix `A`:\n    \\[ a=2, b=-1, c=-1 \\]\n    \\[ d=-1, e=2, f=-1 \\]\n    \\[ g=-1, h=-1, i=2 \\]\n3.  Substitute these values into the formula:\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot ( (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) - (-1) \\cdot ( (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) ) + (-1) \\cdot ( (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) ) \\]\n4.  Simplify the terms:\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 + 2) \\]\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3) \\]\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\]\n5.  Calculate the final result:\n    \\[ \\det(A) = 0 \\]\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
