    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object - The Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces. A key feature is that it shares its 12 vertices with the regular (convex) icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of a set of points (or a geometric object) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet over the vertices of the great icosahedron; the shape this sheet takes is the convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull**\nSince the 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are arranged in the same way as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids and is a convex polyhedron.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Surface of the Outer-Hull (the Regular Icosahedron)**\nThe surface of a regular icosahedron is, by its very definition, composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles. These triangles completely cover the surface of the polyhedron without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n**Step 5: Understand \"Triangulation\"**\nA triangulation of a surface is a partition of that surface into a set of triangles. The question asks for the *minimal* number of triangles needed for this task.\n\n**Step 6: Find the Minimal Number of Triangles**\nThe surface of the regular icosahedron (which is the outer-hull) is already perfectly divided into 20 triangles. This existing structure *is* a triangulation. To cover the entire surface, you cannot use fewer than these 20 faces. Any further division, such as splitting one of the existing triangles, would only increase the total number of triangles. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation is simply the number of faces on the regular icosahedron.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, and each face is a triangle. This is the minimal possible triangulation of its surface. The number of visible triangles from the outside corresponds to the number of faces of this convex hull.\n\n*   Number of vertices of the outer-hull (icosahedron): 12\n*   Number of edges of the outer-hull (icosahedron): 30\n*   Number of faces of the outer-hull (icosahedron): 20\n\nEach of the 20 faces is a triangle. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
