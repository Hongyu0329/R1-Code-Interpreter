**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Binding):**
The following residues in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the human β1b subunit are hotspots that form the binding pocket for the α1 subunit's Alpha Interaction Domain (AID):
*   **Methionine 441 (M441)**
*   **Proline 476 (P476)**
*   **Tyrosine 499 (Y499)**
*   **Phenylalanine 502 (F502)**
*   **Valine 513 (V513)**
*   **Isoleucine 514 (I514)**
*   **Trp523 (W523)**
*   **Glutamate 528 (E528)**
*   **Glutamine 529 (Q529)**

**2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation (Fine-Tuning):**
The following residues and regions in the human β1b subunit are hotspots for modulating the gating properties of the α1 subunit, often acting allosterically after binding has occurred:
*   **The N-terminal Region (Residues 1-30):** This entire region acts as a modulatory domain, particularly influencing voltage-dependent inactivation.
*   **Trp391 (W391):** This residue is located in the SH3 domain. It is essential for the structural integrity of the SH3 domain and is critical for functionally coupling the physical binding of the β1 subunit to the modulation of α1 subunit gating.
