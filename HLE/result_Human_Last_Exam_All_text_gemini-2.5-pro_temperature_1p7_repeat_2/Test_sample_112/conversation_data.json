    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Manuscript:** First, we need to determine the specific manuscript in which the poem \"Sir Launfal\" is found. The Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal,\" attributed to Thomas Chestre, is preserved in a single, unique manuscript.\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript's Name:** Research confirms that this manuscript is **Cotton MS Caligula A.II**, which is held in the British Library. This is a famous and important manuscript from the 15th century.\n3.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.II is a miscellany, which means it is a collection of various, often unrelated, texts bound together. To answer the question, we must look at the complete list of works contained within this manuscript.\n4.  **List the Key Works in Cotton MS Caligula A.II:** Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" this manuscript contains other significant Middle English texts, including:\n    *   *La»ùamon's Brut* (the longer version)\n    *   *The Owl and the Nightingale*\n    *   The romance *Libeaus Desconus*\n    *   Various religious and didactic poems.\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** The question asks for a \"book of manners,\" also known as a courtesy book. These were popular texts in the medieval period that provided instruction on etiquette, social conduct, and courtly behavior. We need to scan the manuscript's contents for a work that fits this description.\n6.  **Pinpoint the Specific Text:** Among the didactic works in Cotton MS Caligula A.II, there is a text explicitly designed as a book of manners. This work is titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (The Book of Courtesy). This poem outlines the proper behavior for a young man, especially a page or squire, serving in a lord's household.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Manuscript:** \"Sir Launfal\" exists in only one manuscript, so there is only one correct answer. The collection of texts it is bound with is fixed.\n*   **Genre Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify what constitutes a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book. \"The Boke of Curtasye\" is a quintessential example of this genre.\n*   **Spelling Variation:** Middle English titles have various spellings. \"The Boke of Curtasye\" might also be referred to as \"A Book of Courtesy\" or similar variations.\n*   **Context of the Collection:** The manuscript is a compilation. The works were not necessarily written by the same person or at the same time but were collected by a scribe or owner who felt they belonged together, perhaps thematically. Placing a romance like \"Sir Launfal\" alongside a courtesy book like \"The Boke of Curtasye\" reflects the interests of a 15th-century audience in both courtly behavior and tales of chivalry.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy identifying the manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\" (Cotton MS Caligula A.II) and then examining its contents, we can pinpoint the specific work that functions as a book of manners. That work is \"The Boke of Curtasye.\"\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
