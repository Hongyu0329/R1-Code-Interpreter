    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Measurement Technology:** The heartbeats are captured using Photoplethysmography (PPG), a common technology in wearables like smartwatches.\n    *   **Measurement Target:** The technology captures \"beat-to-beat intervals.\"\n    *   **Computed Metric:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is calculated from these intervals.\n\n3.  **Identify the Fundamental Unit of Measurement:**\n    *   HRV is not a direct measurement but a calculation of the *variation* in time between successive heartbeats.\n    *   To calculate this variation, one must first measure the time duration of each individual interval between heartbeats. This interval is the fundamental piece of data.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Terms:**\n    *   **ECG Standard (Gold Standard):** In medicine, the gold standard for measuring heart activity is the electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG trace shows a distinct pattern for each heartbeat, with the most prominent peak being the \"R-wave.\" The time measured from one R-wave to the next is called the **R-R interval**. This is the most common and scientifically recognized term for the beat-to-beat interval in the context of HRV.\n    *   **PPG-Specific Terminology:** Since the question specifies PPG, it's worth noting the precise term for this method. PPG measures blood volume pulses. The time between consecutive pulse peaks is technically called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or sometimes the Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI).\n    *   **Connecting ECG and PPG:** While PPG measures IBIs, these measurements are used as a surrogate or estimate for the physiological R-R intervals. In the broader field of HRV analysis, the term **R-R interval** is often used as the standard name for this value, even when it is derived from PPG data. The IBI from PPG is an approximation of the R-R interval from ECG.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Best Term:**\n    *   The question is asking for the name of the *value* used for HRV computation. While \"Inter-beat Interval\" (IBI) is technically more accurate for a PPG device, the standard and most widely used term in all HRV literature (medical, sports science, wellness) is the **R-R interval**. It refers to the underlying physiological event that is being estimated. Therefore, \"R-R interval\" is the most appropriate and recognized answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Metric vs. Raw Data:** Do not confuse the raw data with the calculated HRV metrics. The R-R interval is the raw time data (e.g., 800ms, 815ms, 790ms). HRV metrics like SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) or RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) are statistical calculations performed *on* a series of R-R intervals. The question asks for the name of the raw data point.\n*   **Terminology Precision (IBI vs. R-R Interval):** While IBI is more precise for PPG, the term R-R interval has become the de facto standard for the beat-to-beat interval in the context of HRV, regardless of the capture method.\n*   **Units:** This value is a duration of time, typically measured in milliseconds (ms).\n\nBased on this analysis, the value computed between heartbeats to measure HRV is most commonly and scientifically referred to as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
