    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Hackenbush Values\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, game positions can be assigned values which are surreal numbers. Dyadic rationals (fractions of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$) can be constructed using a finite number of red and blue edges.\n\nThe value of a sum of two games, played side-by-side (i.e., not connected to each other, but both connected to the ground), is the sum of their individual values. This means we can construct a game for a complex number like $\\frac{13}{16}$ by representing it as a sum or difference of simpler numbers and then building the game for each part and placing them next to each other.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Optimal Representation of the Number\nOur goal is to find the representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum/difference of signed powers of two that minimizes the total number of pieces required.\nThe number of pieces for simple base games is as follows:\n*   **Integers:** The game for an integer $n$ is a simple stack of $|n|$ edges of the corresponding color (red for positive, blue for negative). The number of pieces is $|n|$.\n*   **Fractions of the form $\\pm 2^{-k}$:** The game for $2^{-k}$ (for $k>0$) is a stalk made of one red edge topped by a chain of $k$ blue edges. This requires $1+k$ pieces. The game for $-2^{-k}$ is the color-swapped version: one blue edge topped by a chain of $k$ red edges, also requiring $1+k$ pieces.\n\nWe need to find a representation $x = \\sum_{i} c_i 2^i$ (where $c_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$) that minimizes the total piece count. The cost is $\\sum_{i \\ge 0} |c_i|2^i + \\sum_{i < 0} |c_i|(|i|+1)$.\n\nLet's explore the possible representations for $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Representation 1 (Standard Binary)\nFirst, we express $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n$13 = 8 + 4 + 1$, so $13_{10} = 1101_2$.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1101_2}{2^4} = 0.1101_2$\nThis corresponds to the sum:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nNow we calculate the number of pieces for each term in this sum:\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1}$:** Here $k=1$. It requires $k+1 = 1+1 = 2$ pieces.\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{4} = 2^{-2}$:** Here $k=2$. It requires $k+1 = 2+1 = 3$ pieces.\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{16} = 2^{-4}$:** Here $k=4$. It requires $k+1 = 4+1 = 5$ pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces for this representation is the sum of the pieces for each component game:\nTotal Pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Representation 2 (Using Negative Terms)\nWe can often find a more \"economical\" representation using negative terms. This is analogous to the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) for integers. Consider the identity $2^n + 2^{n-1} + \\dots + 2^m = 2^{n+1} - 2^m$.\nWe can represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ as follows:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{16 - 3}{16} = \\frac{16 - 4 + 1}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} - \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}$\nThis corresponds to the sum:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$\n\nNow we calculate the number of pieces for this alternative representation:\n*   **Game for $1$:** This is an integer. It requires $1$ piece (a single red edge).\n*   **Game for $-\\frac{1}{4} = -2^{-2}$:** Here $k=2$. It requires $k+1 = 2+1 = 3$ pieces.\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{16} = 2^{-4}$:** Here $k=4$. It requires $k+1 = 4+1 = 5$ pieces.\n\nThe total number of pieces for this representation is:\nTotal Pieces = $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\n### Step 5: Comparison and Conclusion\nComparing the two representations:\n*   Representation 1 ($1/2 + 1/4 + 1/16$) requires 10 pieces.\n*   Representation 2 ($1 - 1/4 + 1/16$) requires 9 pieces.\n\nThe second representation is more economical. It is generally true that using the Non-Adjacent Form principle to eliminate strings of '1's in the binary representation leads to a minimal or near-minimal number of pieces for this type of cost function. We have found a representation that requires 9 pieces. It is unlikely that another representation would yield a smaller number. For instance, considering $x_0 = -1$ would lead to representing $13/16 - (-1) = 29/16$, which is more complex and leads to more pieces.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pieces needed to represent $\\frac{13}{16}$ is 9.\n\nThe final construction would be the disjoint union of three game components:\n1.  A single red edge (for the value +1).\n2.  A stalk of 1 blue edge topped by 2 red edges (for the value -1/4).\n3.  A stalk of 1 red edge topped by 4 blue edges (for the value +1/16).\n\nTotal pieces = $1 + (1+2) + (1+4) = 1+3+5=9$."
