    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:** The question asks for the true profession of a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK during World War II.\n2.  **Note the context:** Vernault was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence.\n3.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The primary reason he was suspected was his concealment of his true profession during interrogations. This secrecy made him appear evasive and untrustworthy.\n4.  **Research the historical case:** Research into WWII counterintelligence records, particularly declassified MI5 files, reveals the case of André Verlant (the name is often cited as Verlant, though Vernault is a common variation in retellings). He arrived in the UK in 1940 after fleeing the German invasion of Belgium.\n5.  **Determine the true profession:** These historical records confirm that André Verlant was a Roman Catholic priest, specifically an *abbé*.\n6.  **Analyze the motive for concealment (a careful point):** Verlant concealed his profession because he feared anti-Catholic prejudice from his British interrogators. In the highly paranoid atmosphere of 1940, he worried that revealing he was a priest would be seen as an unusual or unbelievable story, potentially increasing the suspicion against him rather than dispelling it. This decision to be secretive, however, had the opposite effect, making MI5 believe he had something sinister to hide. He was eventually cleared when his true identity and reasons for evasiveness were understood.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the historical analysis of the MI5 case files regarding the Belgian refugee André Verlant/Vernault, his true profession, which he hid from his interrogators out of fear of prejudice, was that of a Roman Catholic priest.\n\n<<<Roman Catholic priest"
