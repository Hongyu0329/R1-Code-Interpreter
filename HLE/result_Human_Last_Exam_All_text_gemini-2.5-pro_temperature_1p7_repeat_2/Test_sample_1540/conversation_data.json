    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the problem's constraints and the goal of minimizing memory usage in a C program.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The core task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are given on two separate lines.\n3.  **Guarantees:** The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length, ranging from 1 to 100 characters. They consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Output:** Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller, \"1\" if it's larger, and \"0\" if they are equal after ignoring case.\n5.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". We need to calculate the total memory (`m`) in bytes used for variables in this optimal program.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** The comparison must treat uppercase and lowercase versions of a letter as equivalent (e.g., 'a' == 'A'). The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this. We can convert each character from both strings to lowercase before comparing them.\n2.  **Memory Optimization Strategy:** A naive approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (buffers). For a maximum length of 100, this would require `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, using `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the strings. To be more memory-efficient, we must avoid storing both strings simultaneously if possible.\n3.  **Input Stream Processing:** The input is sequential. The first string appears, followed by a newline character, then the second string. This means we cannot read a character from the first string, then one from the second, and so on. We must read the first string completely before the second one is available in the input stream. This implies that we *must* store the first string in memory to be able to compare it against the second string.\n4.  **Optimal Approach:** The most memory-efficient approach is to:\n    *   Allocate a buffer just large enough to store the first string.\n    *   Read the first string into this buffer.\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time from the input stream.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, immediately compare it (case-insensitively) with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n    *   This eliminates the need for a second buffer.\n5.  **Choosing Data Types:** To minimize memory, we should use the smallest possible data types for any variables.\n    *   For an index that goes from 0 to 99 (for a string of length 100), a standard `int` (usually 4 bytes) is excessive. An `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient.\n    *   For storing a single character read from the input, a `char` variable (1 byte) is appropriate.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient strategy, let's identify every variable required and calculate its size in bytes.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the First String:** We need to store the first string. Its maximum length is 100 characters. In C, a string requires an additional null terminator (`\\0`). Thus, the buffer size must be 101.\n    *   `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory Usage: `101 bytes`\n\n2.  **Index Variable:** We need a variable to keep track of our position in the stored string `s1` as we process the second string. The index will range from 0 to 99. An `unsigned char` is the smallest type that can hold this range.\n    *   `unsigned char i;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `1 byte`\n\n3.  **Input Character Variable:** We need a variable to hold the current character being read from the second string in the input stream. A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   `char ch;`\n    *   Memory Usage: `1 byte`\n\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation:** No other variables are essential. The result of the comparison (-1, 1, or 0) can be printed directly, and the program can terminate without needing to store this result in a separate variable.\n\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these essential variables:\n    `m = (memory for s1) + (memory for i) + (memory for ch)`\n    `m = 101 + 1 + 1`\n    `m = 103` bytes.\n\nThis is the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem under the given constraints.\n\n<<<103>>>"
