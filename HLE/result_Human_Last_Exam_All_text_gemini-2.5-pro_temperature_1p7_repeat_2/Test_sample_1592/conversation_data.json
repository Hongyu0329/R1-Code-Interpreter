    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Locate Waskaganish:** Waskaganish is a Cree First Nation community located in northern Quebec. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographical coordinates are 51.2° N latitude and 78.8° W longitude.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The question asks for the closest province or territory *outside of Quebec*. Looking at a map of Canada, the regions bordering or near this part of Quebec are:\n    *   The province of **Ontario**, which lies to the west and south of Waskaganish.\n    *   The territory of **Nunavut**, which consists of all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n    Other provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador or New Brunswick are significantly farther away to the east and south.\n\n3.  **Analyze Proximity to Ontario:** The land border between Quebec and Ontario runs south from the southern coast of James Bay. Waskaganish is located on the coast, a relatively short distance east of this land border. The nearest point in the province of Ontario is this border, which lies directly to the west along the coastline. The distance from Waskaganish to the Quebec-Ontario border on the coast of James Bay is approximately 65-70 km (about 40-45 miles).\n\n4.  **Analyze Proximity to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all islands in James Bay. To find the closest point of Nunavut, we need to identify the Nunavut-owned island nearest to Waskaganish. While large islands like Akimiski are in James Bay, smaller islands are closer to the Quebec coast. The closest significant island belonging to Nunavut is Charlton Island, which is northwest of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish to Charlton Island is approximately 110-120 km (about 70-75 miles).\n\n5.  **Compare the Distances and Conclude:**\n    *   Distance to the closest point in Ontario: ~65-70 km\n    *   Distance to the closest point in Nunavut: ~110-120 km\n\n    Comparing the two, the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest island belonging to the territory of Nunavut.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   The \"closest\" point refers to the shortest straight-line distance (as the crow flies) to the border of another province or territory.\n*   It is crucial to understand that all islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, while the mainland surrounding the bay is split between Quebec and Ontario.\n*   One might initially think of Moosonee, Ontario, but the provincial border itself is closer than the town of Moosonee. The border is the actual line that defines the start of the province.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the province of Ontario is the closest to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
