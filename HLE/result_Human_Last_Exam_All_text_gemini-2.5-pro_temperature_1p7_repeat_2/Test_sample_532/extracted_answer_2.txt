A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, G = P_2 x P_3 x P_5 x ..., where the Sylow subgroups satisfy the following conditions:
1.  The Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 has order at most 2 (i.e., P_2 is trivial or C_2).
2.  The Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 can be any finite 3-group.
3.  The Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 is either trivial, C_5, or a 5-group with exponent greater than 5.
4.  For any prime p >= 7, the Sylow p-subgroup P_p can be any finite p-group.
