    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S` of `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ∩ S·S = ∅`. A direct consequence of this is that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, because `e·e = e`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPS):** A product-free set `S` is a MIPS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In a finite group, this means for any element `g ∉ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called filled if the union of all its MIPS equals `G \\ {e}`. In other words, every non-identity element of `G` must belong to at least one MIPS. Let `M(G)` be the set of all MIPS in `G`. `G` is filled if `⋃_{S∈M(G)} S = G \\ {e}`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Utilizing Key Theorems\n\nThe problem of classifying filled groups can be complex to tackle from first principles, as direct computation of all MIPS is often intractable. The solution relies on deep theorems from the mathematical literature on this specific topic (primarily from work by Giudici, Hart, and Hegarty).\n\n**Theorem 1:** A finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is filled.\n\nThis theorem is crucial because it allows us to break down the problem from general nilpotent groups to p-groups. We only need to determine which finite p-groups are filled.\n\n**Theorem 2:** A finite group `G` is *not* filled if and only if it possesses a non-trivial normal subgroup `N` (i.e., `N ≠ {e}`) such that `G` and `N` satisfy one of the following five conditions:\n1.  `G/N` is cyclic of even order `2k`, and every element of odd order in `G/N` is the identity coset `N`.\n2.  `|G/N| = 2`, and `N` consists of all the elements of odd order in `G`.\n3.  `|G/N| = 3`, and every element in `G \\ N` is an involution (i.e., has order 2).\n4.  `G/N ≅ C_4`, and every element in the coset `g^2N` is an involution, where `gN` generates `G/N`.\n5.  `|G/N| = 5`, and every element in `G \\ N` has order from the set {2, 3, 5}.\n\nA p-group `G_p` is therefore filled if and only if it avoids these conditions for all its non-trivial normal subgroups.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing p-Groups\n\nWe now analyze which p-groups are filled by checking the conditions of Theorem 2.\n\n**Case 1: p = 2 (2-groups)**\nLet `G_2` be a 2-group.\n*   If `|G_2| > 2`, `G_2` must have a maximal subgroup `N`. In a p-group, a maximal subgroup is always normal and has index `p`. Thus, for `p=2`, `N` is normal and `G_2/N ≅ C_2`.\n*   Let's check this against Theorem 2. We have `N ≠ {e}` (since `|G_2| > 2`) and a quotient `G_2/N ≅ C_2`.\n    *   This fits **Condition 1**: `G_2/N` is cyclic of even order 2. The elements of odd order in `C_2` consist only of the identity, so this part of the condition is satisfied.\n*   Therefore, any 2-group of order greater than 2 is **not filled**.\n*   The group `C_2` has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups, so the conditions of Theorem 2 cannot be met. Thus, `C_2` **is filled**. The trivial group is also trivially filled.\n*   **Conclusion for 2-groups:** The filled 2-groups are `{e}` and `C_2`.\n\n**Case 2: p = 3 (3-groups)**\nLet `G_3` be a 3-group. For `G_3` to be not filled, it must satisfy one of the conditions. The only condition involving a quotient of order a power of 3 is **Condition 3**, which requires `|G_3/N| = 3` and for every element `g ∈ G_3 \\ N` to be an involution (`g^2 = e`). However, in a 3-group, every non-identity element has an order that is a power of 3. No element can have order 2. Thus, Condition 3 can never be satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion for 3-groups:** All finite 3-groups are **filled**.\n\n**Case 3: p = 5 (5-groups)**\nLet `G_5` be a 5-group. The relevant condition is **Condition 5**. `G_5` is not filled if it has a non-trivial normal subgroup `N` such that `|G_5/N| = 5` and every element in `G_5 \\ N` has order from {2, 3, 5}. Since elements in a 5-group can only have orders that are powers of 5, this simplifies to requiring every element in `G_5 \\ N` to have order 5.\n*   This condition is met if and only if the group `G_5` has exponent 5 (meaning `g^5 = e` for all `g ∈ G_5`) and its order is greater than 5. If `exp(G_5) = 5` and `|G_5| > 5`, we can always find a normal subgroup `N` with `G_5/N ≅ C_5`, and all elements in `G_5 \\ N` will have order 5.\n*   If `G_5` has an element of order greater than 5 (i.e., `exp(G_5) > 5`), then it is filled. Also, `C_5` itself is filled as it has no non-trivial normal subgroups.\n*   **Conclusion for 5-groups:** The filled 5-groups are `{e}`, `C_5`, and all finite 5-groups with exponent greater than 5.\n\n**Case 4: p ≥ 7**\nLet `G_p` be a p-group with `p ≥ 7`. None of the five conditions in Theorem 2 involve quotients whose order is a power of `p` for `p ≥ 7`. Therefore, the conditions can never be met.\n*   **Conclusion for p-groups, p ≥ 7:** All finite p-groups for primes `p ≥ 7` are **filled**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Characterization\n\nUsing Theorem 1, a finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if its Sylow p-subgroups `P_p` are filled. Based on the analysis in Step 3, we can characterize these Sylow subgroups.\n\nLet `G` be a finite filled nilpotent group. Then `G` is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, `G ≅ P_2 × P_3 × P_5 × P_7 × ...`, where:\n\n1.  The Sylow 2-subgroup `P_2` must be a filled 2-group, which means `P_2` is either the trivial group `{e}` or is isomorphic to `C_2`. Equivalently, the order of `P_2` must be 1 or 2.\n2.  The Sylow 3-subgroup `P_3` can be any finite 3-group.\n3.  The Sylow 5-subgroup `P_5` must be a filled 5-group. This means `P_5` is trivial, isomorphic to `C_5`, or is any finite 5-group with an exponent greater than 5.\n4.  For any prime `p ≥ 7`, the Sylow p-subgroup `P_p` can be any finite p-group.\n\nThis provides a complete classification of the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups, G = P_2 x P_3 x P_5 x ..., where the Sylow subgroups satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  The Sylow 2-subgroup P_2 has order at most 2 (i.e., P_2 is trivial or C_2).\n2.  The Sylow 3-subgroup P_3 can be any finite 3-group.\n3.  The Sylow 5-subgroup P_5 is either trivial, C_5, or a 5-group with exponent greater than 5.\n4.  For any prime p >= 7, the Sylow p-subgroup P_p can be any finite p-group.>>>"
