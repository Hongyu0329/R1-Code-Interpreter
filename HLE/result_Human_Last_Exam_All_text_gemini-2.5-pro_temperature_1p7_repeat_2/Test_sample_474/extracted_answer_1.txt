No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to provide a consistent warning signal to natural predators (like birds), whose perception drives the evolution of the mimicry ring. The study's methodology is flawed because it substitutes human perception for predator perception. Human visual systems are fundamentally different from those of avian predatorsâ€”most notably, birds can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to humans but is often a component of insect coloration. Therefore, two species that appear similar to humans might be easily distinguished by a bird, and vice versa. The resulting clusters would reflect human-perceived similarity, not the functional mimicry rings that exist in nature.
