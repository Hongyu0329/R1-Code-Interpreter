No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical framework of Gödel's ontological proof are fundamentally incompatible. Gödel's proof is formulated in higher-order modal logic, which assumes the rules of classical logic (such as the distributive law). The propositions within quantum mechanics are governed by a non-classical "quantum logic" where the distributive law does not hold. Since the deductive steps of Gödel's proof rely on a logical structure that is absent from quantum mechanics, the proof cannot be constructed or validated within that framework. Furthermore, the abstract metaphysical concepts in Gödel's proof, such as "positive property" or "essence," have no natural or defined counterparts in the physical language of Hilbert spaces and operators.
