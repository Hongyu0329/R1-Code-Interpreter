    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n1.  **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies a group of size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with $SD_{2^9}$, where $n=9$.\n    Let $G = SD_{512}$. Its presentation is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. The order of the element $r$ is 256.\n\n2.  **Power Subgroup:** For a group $G$ and an integer $k$, the $k$-th power subgroup, denoted $G^k$, is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\n    $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    The question asks for the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way. This is the size of the set $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Problem\n\nWe only need to consider $k$ being powers of 2.\nLet any integer $k$ be written as $k = m \\cdot 2^j$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\nThe map $\\phi_m: G \\to G$ defined by $\\phi_m(g) = g^m$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$. This is because $G$ is a finite group of order $|G|=512=2^9$, and since $m$ is odd, $\\gcd(m, |G|) = 1$. This implies that every element in $G$ is an $m$-th power of some other element in a unique way.\nTherefore, the set of generators for $G^k$ can be expressed as:\n$\\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{g^{m \\cdot 2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nSince $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same set as $G$, we can write:\n$G^k = \\langle (g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle = \\langle h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G \\rangle = G^{2^j}$.\nThis shows that any power subgroup $G^k$ is equal to some $G^{2^j}$. Thus, we only need to find the number of distinct subgroups in the sequence $G^{2^0}, G^{2^1}, G^{2^2}, \\dots$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Power Subgroups $G^{2^j}$\n\nWe need to compute the generators for each $G^{2^j}$ by taking the appropriate powers of all elements in $G$. The elements are of two forms: $r^i$ and $r^i s$.\n\n*   **For $j=0$:**\n    $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is the first distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **For $j=1$:**\n    $G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    -   Powers of elements of the form $r^i$: $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$. These generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    -   Powers of elements of the form $r^i s$: We first compute the square using the group relations. Note that $srs = r^{127} \\implies srs^{-1} = r^{127}$ as $s=s^{-1}$.\n        $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (srs^{-1})^i s^2 = r^i (r^{127})^i (1) = r^{i(1+127)} = r^{128i}$.\n        For various $i$, these powers are either $1$ (if $i$ is even) or $r^{128}$ (if $i$ is odd). These generate the subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$.\n    -   So, $G^2$ is generated by the elements of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ and $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    -   Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$. This is our second distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **For $j \\ge 2$:**\n    $G^{2^j} = \\langle g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    -   Powers of elements of the form $r^i$: $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i \\cdot 2^j}$. These generate the subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    -   Powers of elements of the form $r^i s$: Let's find the fourth power.\n        $(r^i s)^4 = ((r^i s)^2)^2 = (r^{128i})^2 = r^{256i} = (r^{256})^i = 1^i = 1$.\n        Since the fourth power of any element of the form $r^i s$ is the identity, any higher power of 2, $(r^i s)^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 2$, will also be the identity.\n    -   Thus, for $j \\ge 2$, the generators are from $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ and the identity element.\n    -   Therefore, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j \\ge 2$.\n\n### Step 4: List and Count the Distinct Subgroups\n\nNow we list the sequence of distinct power subgroups we have found:\n\n1.  $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G = SD_{512}$. Its order is 512.\n2.  $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 128.\n3.  $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 64.\n4.  $G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 32.\n5.  $G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 16.\n6.  $G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 8.\n7.  $G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 4.\n8.  $G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order 2.\n9.  $G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\nFor any $j > 8$, $G^{2^j}$ will also be the trivial subgroup, as all elements raised to the power $2^j$ will be the identity. The subgroups listed above all have different orders, so they are all distinct. Counting them gives a total of 9 distinct subgroups.\n\nThis gives the chain of proper inclusions:\n$G \\supset \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^8 \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^{16} \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^{32} \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^{64} \\rangle \\supset \\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\supset \\{1\\}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 9 distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<9>>>"
