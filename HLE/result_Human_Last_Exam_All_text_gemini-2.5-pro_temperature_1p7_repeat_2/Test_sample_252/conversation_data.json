    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings for computed tomography imaging spectrometry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A **full spectral volume**, often called a hyperspectral data cube or `(x, y, λ)` cube, contains spatial information (in the x and y dimensions) and spectral information (in the λ, or wavelength, dimension) for a scene. For each pixel `(x, y)`, we want to know its light intensity across a full spectrum of wavelengths.\n    *   \"From a **single image**\" means the entire dataset must be captured in one snapshot by a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera). This rules out any technique that requires moving parts, like scanning a slit across the image or rotating a filter wheel.\n\n2.  **Understand the Technique:** The question refers to \"using computed tomography\" to achieve this. This specific technology is known as **Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**.\n    *   Standard computed tomography (like in medical X-ray CT scanners) reconstructs a 3D object `(x, y, z)` by taking multiple 2D projection images from different angles.\n    *   In CTIS, the \"object\" to be reconstructed is the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`. The \"projections\" are all captured simultaneously on a single 2D sensor.\n\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that disperses light. It splits white light into its constituent colors (wavelengths), similar to a prism. The angle at which light is bent (diffracted) depends on its wavelength.\n\n4.  **How CTIS Works:**\n    *   In a CTIS system, a disperser (the diffraction grating) is placed in the optical path before the sensor.\n    *   This disperser projects multiple, spectrally-smeared copies of the scene onto the 2D sensor. Each copy is a different \"diffraction order\".\n    *   For example, there is a central, undiffracted image (the \"zeroth order\"), which is essentially a regular black-and-white image of the scene.\n    *   Then there are first-order, second-order, etc., diffracted images spread out from the center. Each of these diffracted images is a \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor plane. The key is that in these projections, the spatial position is mixed with wavelength information. For instance, in one diffraction order, a point in the scene might be shifted horizontally by an amount proportional to its wavelength.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Minimum Requirement (The \"Careful Points\"):**\n    *   **Can we use one 1D grating?** A one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along a single axis. This would create a series of diffracted images along a single line on the sensor. In these projections, wavelength information (`λ`) would be confounded with one spatial dimension (e.g., `x`). The other spatial dimension (`y`) would remain separate. This setup provides an insufficient diversity of \"views\" or \"projections.\" The tomographic reconstruction problem is ill-posed; you cannot uniquely reconstruct the 2D spatial information `(x, y)` at each wavelength. It's analogous to trying to reconstruct a 3D object from projections all taken along a single line instead of from all around the object. Therefore, one 1D grating is not sufficient.\n\n    *   **How to solve this?** To make the reconstruction possible, the projections must confound the wavelength information with the spatial information in multiple different ways. The most straightforward way to do this is to disperse the light along two independent (usually orthogonal) axes.\n        *   One dispersion axis confounds `λ` with `x`.\n        *   A second dispersion axis confounds `λ` with `y`.\n\n    *   **How many gratings are needed for two dispersion axes?** To create dispersion along two independent axes, you need the functionality of two 1D gratings, typically oriented at 90 degrees to each other. This can be implemented in two ways:\n        1.  Using two separate 1D grating components placed back-to-back. This uses **two** gratings.\n        2.  Using a single component called a 2D \"crossed\" grating, where two grating patterns are etched onto a single substrate. While this is one physical component, it fundamentally embodies the functionality of two independent gratings.\n\n    *   **Interpreting \"Minimum Number\":** The question is about the *minimum necessary number*. Since a single 1D grating is insufficient, we must have the effect of two. The problem cannot be solved with the functionality of only one grating axis. The tomographic principle requires at least two independent dispersion axes to provide a sufficient set of projections for reconstructing the 3D `(x, y, λ)` volume. Therefore, the minimum *functional* requirement is for two gratings. This is the most critical point for interpreting the question correctly in a physics/engineering context. The fundamental principle requires two axes of dispersion.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe core principle of computed tomography requires multiple projections from different \"viewing angles.\" In CTIS, these projections are the different diffraction orders. A single 1D grating produces all its projections along one axis, which is insufficient for reconstruction. To get a set of projections that are diverse enough, dispersion along at least two independent axes is necessary. This requires the functionality of two separate gratings. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
