No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the calculation. The calculation must use components perpendicular to the local background magnetic field, which follows the non-radial Parker Spiral. Rigorous analysis requires transforming the data into a field-aligned coordinate system before calculating helicity.
