    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to clarify the terms used in the question.\n*   **Cycle of length \\( n \\), \\( C_n \\):** A graph with \\( n \\) vertices and \\( n \\) edges forming a single loop. We assume \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n*   **Sum of graphs:** In graph theory, the \"sum of graphs\" most commonly refers to the **graph join** operation, often denoted by \\( G_1 + G_2 \\).\n    *   **Definition of Graph Join:** Let \\( G_1 = (V_1, E_1) \\) and \\( G_2 = (V_2, E_2) \\) be two graphs with disjoint vertex sets (\\( V_1 \\cap V_2 = \\emptyset \\)). Their join, \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is the graph with vertex set \\( V = V_1 \\cup V_2 \\) and edge set \\( E = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup \\{ (u, v) \\mid u \\in V_1, v \\in V_2 \\} \\). In simpler terms, you take the two graphs, and then you add every possible edge between the vertices of the first graph and the vertices of the second graph.\n*   **The graph G:** The problem states that \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\). Based on the standard definition, this means we have three vertex-disjoint cycles, say \\( C_n^{(1)} \\), \\( C_n^{(2)} \\), and \\( C_n^{(3)} \\), and \\( G = C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Chromatic Number of a Graph Join\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem concerning the chromatic number of a graph join:\n*   **Theorem:** For any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n    \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\)\n\n*   **Proof Sketch:**\n    1.  To show \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) \\ge \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\): In any valid coloring of \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), any vertex in \\( G_1 \\) is connected to every vertex in \\( G_2 \\). Therefore, the set of colors used for \\( G_1 \\) must be completely disjoint from the set of colors used for \\( G_2 \\). This means we need at least \\( \\chi(G_1) \\) colors for the vertices of \\( G_1 \\) and \\( \\chi(G_2) \\) different colors for the vertices of \\( G_2 \\), for a total of at least \\( \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\) colors.\n    2.  To show \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) \\le \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\): We can construct a valid coloring. Use \\( \\chi(G_1) \\) colors to color \\( G_1 \\) and a completely new set of \\( \\chi(G_2) \\) colors to color \\( G_2 \\). This coloring is valid for the subgraphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), and since the color sets are disjoint, any edge between \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\) will also connect vertices of different colors. Thus, we have a valid coloring with \\( \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\) colors.\n\nThis property extends to the sum of more than two graphs. For our graph \\( G \\), we have:\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)} + C_n^{(2)} + C_n^{(3)}) = \\chi(C_n^{(1)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(2)}) + \\chi(C_n^{(3)}) \\)\n\nSince all three cycles have the same length \\( n \\), their chromatic numbers are identical.\n\\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n### Step 3: Chromatic Number of a Cycle \\( C_n \\)\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\):\n*   If \\( n \\) is **even** (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle is a bipartite graph. We can alternate between two colors around the cycle. Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n*   If \\( n \\) is **odd** (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle is not bipartite. Two colors are insufficient, but three colors are always enough (color vertices \\( v_1, ..., v_{n-1} \\) with alternating colors 1 and 2, and color the last vertex \\( v_n \\) with color 3). Therefore, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number\n\nThe question asks for the **maximal** chromatic number of \\( G \\). Our expression for \\( \\chi(G) \\) is \\( 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\). To maximize this value, we must choose the parameter \\( n \\) such that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is maximized.\n\nComparing the two cases for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\):\n*   Maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3.\n*   This maximum is achieved when \\( n \\) is any odd integer (\\( n=3, 5, 7, \\dots \\)).\n\nBy choosing \\( n \\) to be any odd number, we get the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\).\n\n*   Maximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot (\\text{maximal } \\chi(C_n)) \\)\n*   Maximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot 3 \\)\n*   Maximal \\( \\chi(G) = 9 \\)\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify the graph operation:** \"Sum\" of graphs is interpreted as the graph join.\n2.  **Apply the chromatic number formula for join:** \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2 + G_3) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\chi(G_3) \\). For \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), this becomes \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Find the maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) is 2 if \\( n \\) is even and 3 if \\( n \\) is odd. The maximum value is 3.\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** The maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\). This occurs whenever \\( n \\) is an odd integer.\n\n<<<9>>>"
