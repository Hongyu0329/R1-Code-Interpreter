    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is as follows:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Basic Operations:** The algorithm consists of a series of elementary arithmetic operations (assignments, division, multiplication, subtraction) and a `while` loop. In standard computational models, these elementary operations are assumed to take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Control Flow:** The overall complexity is dominated by the `while` loop, as the steps before and after the loop (Step 1 and Step 3) consist of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of times the loop executes multiplied by the time taken for each iteration.\n\n3.  **Analyze a Single Loop Iteration:** Inside the `while` loop (Step 2.1), we have the following operations:\n    *   `i := i + 1`: one increment.\n    *   `x := q`: one assignment.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: one integer division.\n    *   `a_i := x - qc`: one multiplication and one subtraction.\n    All these operations are elementary and take a constant amount of time. So, the work done inside each loop iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Loop Iterations:** The key is to find how many times the loop runs.\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value that `q` depends on. The variable `x` is repeatedly updated.\n    *   Before the loop, `x` is `n`, and the first `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration, `x` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋)/c⌋`.\n    *   Effectively, the value of the variable `x` that is used to calculate the new `q` is divided by `c` in each iteration. The loop stops when this value becomes 0.\n    *   The number of times one can divide `n` by `c` before the result becomes 0 is directly related to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`.\n    *   The number of digits, `d`, in the base `c` representation of a positive integer `n` is `d = ⌊log_c n⌋ + 1`.\n    *   The algorithm computes the digit `a_0` before the loop. The loop is responsible for computing the remaining `d-1` digits (`a_1, ..., a_{d-1}`).\n    *   Therefore, the loop executes `d - 1 = (⌊log_c n⌋ + 1) - 1 = ⌊log_c n⌋` times.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity:**\n    *   Total Time = (Time for initialization) + (Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration) + (Time for return).\n    *   `T(n, c) = O(1) + (⌊log_c n⌋) × O(1) + O(1)`\n    *   `T(n, c) = O(log_c n)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** In complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm does not affect the asymptotic class. This is due to the change of base formula for logarithms: `log_c n = log_b n / log_b c`. For any standard base `b` (like 2 or e), `log_b c` is a constant since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`). Big-O notation ignores constant factors.\n    *   `O(log_c n) = O(log n / log c) = O(log n)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Cost of Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes that arithmetic operations on numbers up to size `n` take constant time. For arbitrarily large numbers, this assumption may not hold. However, in the context of typical algorithm analysis, it's a standard convention. If `n` has `k` bits, the complexity is `O(k)`, meaning it's linear in the size of the input representation.\n*   **Role of `c`:** The base `c` is treated as a constant parameter. If `c` were also a variable input that could grow, the complexity would need to be expressed as a function of both `n` and `c`, and the `log c` term could not be disregarded.\n*   **Edge Case n=0:** If `n = 0`, the initial value of `q` is `⌊0/c⌋ = 0`. The `while` loop condition `q > 0` is immediately false, so the loop does not execute. The algorithm performs only the constant-time operations in Step 1 and Step 3. The complexity is `O(1)`. The `O(log n)` formula applies for `n ≥ 1`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe number of operations is dominated by the `while` loop. The loop iterates approximately `log_c(n)` times, and each iteration performs a constant number of operations. Thus, the total computational time complexity is `O(log_c n)`, which is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
