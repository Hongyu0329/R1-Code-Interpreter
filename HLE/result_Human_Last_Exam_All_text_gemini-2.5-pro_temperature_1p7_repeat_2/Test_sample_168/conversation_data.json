    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of the sound in question.**\nThe question asks about hearing human muscle twitches. When muscles contract, they produce very low-frequency vibrations and sounds. This phenomenon is known as a phonomyogram (PMG). Research indicates that the primary frequency of these sounds is in the infrasound range, typically below 20 Hz. Therefore, to answer the question, we need to find an animal whose hearing range extends down into the infrasound spectrum (below 20 Hz).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the hearing range of each animal listed.**\n\n*   **A. Dog:** Dogs have an excellent sense of hearing, much better than humans for high frequencies. Their typical hearing range is from about 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz (45 kHz). Since the lower limit is 67 Hz, they cannot hear sounds below 20 Hz. Thus, a dog cannot hear a muscle twitch.\n\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are famous for their use of echolocation, which involves producing and hearing extremely high-frequency sounds (ultrasound), often from 20,000 Hz (20 kHz) up to 200,000 Hz (200 kHz). Their hearing is specialized for this high range and they are not known for detecting low-frequency infrasound.\n\n*   **C. Herring:** This may seem surprising, but certain fish, particularly those in the clupeid family like herring, have one of the broadest known hearing ranges in the animal kingdom. They have a specialized structure that connects their swim bladder (which vibrates in response to sound pressure) to their inner ear. This adaptation allows them to hear an incredibly wide range of frequencies, from infrasound (as low as 1 Hz) all the way up to ultrasound (as high as 180,000 Hz). Since muscle twitches fall within the infrasound range (below 20 Hz), the herring is fully capable of hearing them.\n\n*   **D. Whale:** Whales are known for their ability to use and hear low-frequency sounds for long-distance communication. Baleen whales, in particular, can produce and hear sounds in the infrasound range, sometimes as low as 10-20 Hz. This means some whales *might* be able to hear muscle twitches, as they are on the cusp of this range. However, the herring's documented ability to hear well below this range makes it a more certain and stronger candidate.\n\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). Sounds below 20 Hz are classified as infrasound and are inaudible to humans (though we might feel strong vibrations). Therefore, humans cannot hear their own muscle twitches.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the options and conclude.**\nBased on the analysis of hearing ranges:\n- Dog, Bat, and Human are eliminated as their low-frequency hearing limit is above the frequency of a muscle twitch.\n- While some whales can hear low-frequency infrasound, the herring is known for an exceptionally wide auditory range that definitely includes the very low frequencies produced by muscle contractions.\n\nTherefore, the herring is the most fitting answer among the choices.\n\n<<<C>>>"
