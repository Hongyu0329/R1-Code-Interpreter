    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the number of **homeomorphism classes** of **homogeneous planar continua**. Let's break down each term:\n\n1.  **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact and connected metric space. Since we are dealing with planar objects (subsets of the plane R²), which is a metric space, this simply means we are looking for subsets of the plane that are both compact (closed and bounded) and connected.\n2.  **Planar:** This means the continuum can be embedded as a subset in the Euclidean plane, R².\n3.  **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h from X to itself (h: X → X) such that h(x) = y. In simple terms, the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n4.  **Homeomorphism Class:** We are not counting every single possible space, but rather the number of distinct topological \"types\". Two spaces are in the same class if they are homeomorphic to each other (i.e., there is a continuous bijection between them with a continuous inverse). For example, a square and a circle are in the same homeomorphism class because they are both \"simple closed curves\".\n\nSo, the question is: how many fundamentally different types of compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane are there?\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\nThis is a classic problem in the field of point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. The final answer is the result of decades of research by many mathematicians. The classification can be achieved by systematically dividing the possibilities based on key topological properties.\n\n**Step 1: The First Division - Local Connectedness**\n\nA major dividing line for continua is the property of being locally connected. A space is locally connected if every point has a neighborhood base consisting of connected sets.\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum is locally connected.**\n    A fundamental theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that any locally connected homogeneous planar continuum must be a **simple closed curve**. All simple closed curves (like the circle, the boundary of a square, etc.) are homeomorphic to each other.\n    *   This gives us our first homeomorphism class: the **Simple Closed Curve**.\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum is not locally connected.**\n    If the continuum is not locally connected, its structure is much more complex and \"fractal-like\". We need another property to subdivide this case further.\n\n**Step 2: Subdividing the Non-Locally Connected Case - Separation of the Plane**\n\nFor continua that are not locally connected, a crucial property is whether they separate the plane into two or more components. The Jordan Curve Theorem is a classic example of this concept.\n\n*   **Case 2a: The continuum does not separate the plane.**\n    A theorem by F. Burton Jones (1955) completely characterizes this case. He proved that any non-degenerate, homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be homeomorphic to the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a bizarre, snake-like continuum that is path-connected nowhere. A later result by Edwin E. Moise (1949) showed that any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n    *   This gives us our second homeomorphism class: the **Pseudo-arc**.\n\n*   **Case 2b: The continuum separates the plane.**\n    This is the most complex category. R. H. Bing proved in 1960 that all such continua must be **indecomposable** (meaning they cannot be written as the union of two of their own proper subcontinua).\n    For a long time, it was conjectured that this category was empty (the Bing-Jones Conjecture stated that the simple closed curve and the pseudo-arc were the *only* examples). However, this was proven false in the 1970s.\n    *   L. Fearnley and J. T. Rogers, Jr. independently constructed a new example, the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This is a continuum that separates the plane, is homogeneous, and is not locally connected.\n    *   Further work by J. T. Rogers, Jr. and others in the 1980s and 1990s showed that there are actually infinitely many such objects. These continua are known as planar **pseudo-solenoids**. They proved that these objects form a **countably infinite** collection of distinct homeomorphism classes.\n\n**Step 3: Final Tally**\n\nNow we can sum the number of classes from each category:\n\n1.  From the locally connected case: **1 class** (the simple closed curve).\n2.  From the non-locally connected, non-separating case: **1 class** (the pseudo-arc).\n3.  From the non-locally connected, separating case: A **countably infinite** number of classes (the planar pseudo-solenoids).\n\nThe total number of homeomorphism classes is 1 + 1 + ∞.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is countably infinite.\n\n<<<Countably infinite>>>"
