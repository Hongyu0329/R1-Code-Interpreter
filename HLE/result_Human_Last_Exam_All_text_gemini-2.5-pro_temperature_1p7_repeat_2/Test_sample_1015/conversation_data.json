    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Movement - Cambré Derrière\n\n*   **Cambré:** A French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It is a bend of the body from the waist in any direction: forward (en avant), backward (derrière), or to the side (à la seconde).\n*   **Derrière:** A French ballet term meaning \"behind\" or \"back.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend of the torso backwards from the waist, requiring significant back flexibility and core strength.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method Approach\n\nThe Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its precision, strength, and focus on creating a harmonious and expressive whole-body movement.\n\n*   **Initiation:** The bend initiates from the upper back, between the shoulder blades. The chest is lifted and open.\n*   **Hips:** **This is a crucial point.** The hips must remain squarely over the supporting leg(s). They do not push forward. The goal is to create a pure arch in the upper and middle spine without displacing the lower body. This requires immense back and abdominal strength to maintain stability.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the line of the spine. It lifts with the chest, and as the back arches, the focus goes up towards the ceiling and then the head releases to look directly behind the dancer. The chin should not \"crunch\" into the chest upon return; the head is the last to return to the neutral position.\n*   **Arms:** Arms are typically held in a high fifth position (what Vaganova calls Third Port de Bras). They frame the face and remain strong and slightly rounded, not dropping behind the head. The line is controlled and elegant.\n*   **Overall Aesthetic:** The look is one of controlled strength, grace, and a beautiful, clean curve originating from the upper torso while the lower body remains as a stable, solid foundation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method/Style Approach\n\nThe Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine for the New York City Ballet, is known for its speed, musicality, and a distinct aesthetic that often extends or \"breaks\" traditional classical lines for dynamic effect.\n\n*   **Initiation:** The bend is often much deeper and more extreme.\n*   **Hips:** **This is the key differentiator.** In the Balanchine style, the hips are deliberately pushed forward, away from the vertical alignment over the feet. This forward displacement of the hips acts as a counterbalance, allowing the dancer to achieve a much deeper and more dramatic backbend.\n*   **Head:** The head follows the deeper curve of the spine, often going further back.\n*   **Arms:** Arm placement can vary, but often they are more extended or \"broken\" at the wrist (the \"Balanchine hands\") to create a longer, more angular line rather than the rounded shape of the Vaganova method.\n*   **Overall Aesthetic:** The look is dramatic, dynamic, and often slightly \"off-balance.\" The focus is on creating a visually exciting line and extreme range of motion, even at the expense of the pure alignment taught in stricter academic methods like Vaganova. The body creates more of an \"S\" curve from the feet through the hips to the head.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices.\n\nLet's review the differences based on the answer choices provided:\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there is a difference (Vaganova is more rounded, Balanchine can be more angular or \"broken-wrist\"), it is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the mechanics of the movement.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and fundamental difference. Vaganova insists on hips staying over the feet, creating a pure upper-body curve. Balanchine encourages pushing the hips forward to act as a counterbalance, allowing for a deeper backbend and creating a different overall body line. This changes the entire mechanics and visual aesthetic of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is famous for its speed, a cambré is an adagio (slow) movement in both styles. The speed of execution is not the defining difference in the technique of the step itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used, not the cause of the difference. The Balanchine cambré often *looks* deeper precisely *because* of the forward hip placement. D is a consequence of B.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement follows the spine in both methods. While the final position might be different due to the depth of the bend, the principle of how the head moves is similar. It is not the primary point of distinction.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most critical and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the placement of the hips. This single change alters the entire balance, muscular engagement, and visual line of the movement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
