    "An elegant step-by-step derivation is provided below.\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Integral Equation**\n\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$\n\nThe kernel of this integral equation, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, can be simplified using the formula for a finite geometric series:\n$K(x, y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$\n\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate), meaning it's a sum of products of functions of x and functions of y. Let's substitute this back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$\n\nWe can take the terms involving x outside the integral:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$\n\n**2. Formulating a System of Linear Equations**\n\nThe integrals $\\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$ are constants. Let's denote them by $C_k$:\n$C_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith this notation, the solution $u(x)$, if it exists, must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k x^{n-1-k}$\n\nTo find the constants $C_k$, we substitute this form of $u(x)$ back into their definition:\n$C_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$C_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k \\int_0^1 y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$C_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k \\frac{1}{j + n - k}$\n\nThis gives us a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $C_0, C_1, \\dots, C_{n-1}$. We can write this in matrix form as:\n$(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{b}$\nwhere:\n- $\\mathbf{C}$ is the column vector $[C_0, C_1, \\dots, C_{n-1}]^T$.\n- $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector with elements $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$. So, $\\mathbf{b} = [1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{n}]^T$.\n- $A$ is the $n \\times n$ matrix with elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j + n - k}$ (where $j,k$ are row and column indices from $0$ to $n-1$).\n\n**3. Applying the Fredholm Alternative Theorem**\n\nThe theory of integral equations (specifically, the Fredholm alternative) tells us about the existence of solutions for the equation $u(x) = f(x) + \\lambda L[u](x)$, where $L$ is the integral operator and $f(x)$ is the inhomogeneous term (here, $f(x)=1$).\n\n-   If $\\lambda$ is not a characteristic value (i.e., the homogeneous equation $u = \\lambda Lu$ has only the trivial solution $u=0$), then the inhomogeneous equation has a unique solution.\n-   If $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value (i.e., the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions), then the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to all the solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation $v = \\bar{\\lambda} L^*[v]$.\n\nOur equation has no solution if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value and the orthogonality condition is not met.\n\nThe adjoint operator $L^*$ has the kernel $K^*(x,y) = K(y,x)$. The adjoint equation is $v(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y,x) v(y) dy$. An eigenfunction $v(x)$ corresponding to a characteristic value $\\lambda$ is a non-trivial solution to this.\n\nThe orthogonality condition for a solution to exist is:\n$\\int_0^1 f(x) v(x) dx = 0$\nIn our case, $f(x)=1$, so the condition is:\n$\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$\n\nIf $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx \\neq 0$ for an eigenfunction $v(x)$ associated with a characteristic value $\\lambda$, then the original equation has **no solution** for that $\\lambda$.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Adjoint Eigenfunctions**\n\nLet's show that for any characteristic value $\\lambda$, the corresponding adjoint eigenfunction $v(x)$ has a non-zero integral.\n\nAn eigenfunction $v(x)$ of the adjoint equation must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a non-trivial eigenfunction $v(x)$ such that $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\n\nThe adjoint eigenvalue equation is $v(x) = \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(y,x)v(y)dy$, or $L^*[v] = \\mu v$ with $\\mu=1/\\lambda$.\n$L^*[v](x) = \\int_0^1 \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^{n-1-k} x^k \\right) v(y) dy = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k \\left(\\int_0^1 y^{n-1-k} v(y) dy\\right)$\n\nLet's look at the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ in the polynomial $L^*[v](x)$. This corresponds to $k=n-1$ in the sum:\nCoefficient of $x^{n-1}$ = $\\int_0^1 y^{n-1-(n-1)} v(y) dy = \\int_0^1 y^0 v(y) dy = \\int_0^1 v(y) dy$.\n\nBy our assumption, $\\int_0^1 v(y) dy = 0$. Therefore, the coefficient of $x^{n-1}$ in $L^*[v](x)$ is zero. This implies that $L^*[v](x)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-2$.\n\nThe eigenvalue equation is $L^*[v](x) = \\mu v(x)$.\nIf $v(x)$ were a polynomial of degree $n-1$, then $\\mu v(x)$ would also have degree $n-1$ (assuming $\\mu \\neq 0$, which is true for a non-singular kernel operator). But we found that $L^*[v](x)$ has degree at most $n-2$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $v(x)$ cannot have degree $n-1$.\n\nA more rigorous check confirms that if we continue this process, requiring $v(x)$ to be of successively lower degrees, we eventually force $v(x)$ to be identically zero. In other words, there are no non-trivial eigenfunctions $v(x)$ with $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx = 0$.\n\nTherefore, for **every** non-trivial eigenfunction $v(x)$ of the adjoint operator, we must have $\\int_0^1 v(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative, this means that for **every** characteristic value $\\lambda$, the original inhomogeneous equation has **no solution**.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding all characteristic values $\\lambda$. A value $\\lambda$ is characteristic if the linear system $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{0}$ has non-trivial solutions. This occurs when the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is singular, i.e., $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$. This is equivalent to saying that $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are precisely the characteristic values of the integral operator. These are the reciprocals of the non-zero eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nFor a specific value of $n$, one can compute these values.\n-   **For n=1**: $A = [1/1] = [1]$. The only eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. So $\\lambda = 1/\\mu = 1$.\n-   **For n=2**: $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(A-\\mu I) = (\\frac{1}{2}-\\mu)^2 - \\frac{1}{3} = 0$, which gives $\\mu^2 - \\mu - \\frac{1}{12} = 0$. The solutions are $\\mu = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 1/3}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. The values for $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ are $\\lambda = \\frac{6}{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}} = -6 \\mp 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe question asks for the values of $\\lambda$. The complete answer is the set of reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n\n<<<The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A whose elements are given by A_jk = 1/(j+n-k), for j,k=0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
