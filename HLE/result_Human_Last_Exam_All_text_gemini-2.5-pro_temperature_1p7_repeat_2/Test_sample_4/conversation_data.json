    "The user wants to compute the Poincaré polynomial of a given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and definitions\nThe Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the generating function of the dimensions of its cohomology groups with trivial real coefficients:\n$$ P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) x^k $$\nwhere $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$. The cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex.\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is given by the commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets between basis elements are zero.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$\nFirst, we check if the algebra is nilpotent. We compute the lower central series:\n$\\mathcal{C}^1(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathfrak{g}$\n$\\mathcal{C}^2(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathcal{C}^3(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathcal{C}^2(\\mathfrak{g})] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathcal{C}^4(\\mathfrak{g}) = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathcal{C}^3(\\mathfrak{g})] = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}] = \\{0\\}$\nSince the series terminates at $\\{0\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra. All nilpotent Lie algebras are unimodular, which implies that Poincaré duality holds: $b_k = b_{n-k}$ where $n = \\dim \\mathfrak{g} = 6$. The resulting Poincaré polynomial should be palindromic.\n\n### Step 3: Choose a method for computation\nFor nilpotent Lie algebras, the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence is a very effective tool. Let $\\mathfrak{h}$ be an ideal in $\\mathfrak{g}$. The spectral sequence relates the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{g}$ to the cohomologies of $\\mathfrak{h}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{h}$. A canonical choice for the ideal is the center of the Lie algebra, $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the center $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$\nThe center $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$ consists of elements $z \\in \\mathfrak{g}$ such that $[z, x] = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. Let $z = \\sum_{i=1}^6 c_i e_i$.\n$[z, e_1] = -c_2[e_1, e_2] - c_3[e_1, e_3] - c_5[e_1, e_5] = -c_2 e_3 - c_3 e_4 - c_5 e_6$. For this to be zero, we must have $c_2 = c_3 = c_5 = 0$.\nSo $z = c_1 e_1 + c_4 e_4 + c_6 e_6$.\n$[z, e_2] = c_1[e_1, e_2] = c_1 e_3$. For this to be zero, $c_1=0$.\nSo $z = c_4 e_4 + c_6 e_6$. Let's check the remaining brackets: $[c_4 e_4 + c_6 e_6, e_i]$ are all zero for $i=3, 4, 5, 6$.\nThus, the center is $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\text{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\}$. It is a 2-dimensional abelian ideal. Let's call it $\\mathfrak{h}$.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}' = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{h}$\nThe quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}'$ has a basis consisting of the images of the basis vectors of $\\mathfrak{g}$ not in $\\mathfrak{h}$: $\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_5\\}$. The commutation relations in $\\mathfrak{g}'$ are:\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2] = \\overline{[e_1, e_2]} = \\bar{e}_3$\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_3] = \\overline{[e_1, e_3]} = \\bar{e}_4 = \\bar{0}$ (since $e_4 \\in \\mathfrak{h}$)\n$[\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_5] = \\overline{[e_1, e_5]} = \\bar{e}_6 = \\bar{0}$ (since $e_6 \\in \\mathfrak{h}$)\nAll other brackets are zero. The algebra $\\mathfrak{g}'$ is a direct sum of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3 = \\text{span}\\{\\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3\\}$ and a 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}\\bar{e}_5$. So, $\\mathfrak{g}' \\cong \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence\nThe spectral sequence has the $E_2$ term $E_2^{p,q} = H^p(\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{h}, H^q(\\mathfrak{h}))$. Since $\\mathfrak{h}=Z(\\mathfrak{g})$, the adjoint action of $\\mathfrak{g}$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is trivial. This implies that the induced action of $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{h}$ on $H^q(\\mathfrak{h})$ is also trivial. For a central extension, this ensures that all higher differentials $d_r$ ($r \\ge 2$) in the spectral sequence are zero. The sequence collapses at the $E_2$ page.\nThis implies that the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are given by $b_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\sum_{p+q=k} \\dim E_2^{p,q} = \\sum_{p+q=k} \\dim(H^p(\\mathfrak{g}') \\otimes H^q(\\mathfrak{h}))$.\nIn terms of Poincaré polynomials, this means:\n$$ P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) $$\n\n### Step 7: Compute the individual Poincaré polynomials\n1.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{h} = Z(\\mathfrak{g})$:**\n    $\\mathfrak{h}$ is a 2-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, so its cohomology is the exterior algebra on its dual space $\\mathfrak{h}^*$.\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = P_{\\mathbb{R}^2}(x) = (1+x)^2 = 1 + 2x + x^2$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}' = \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$:**\n    By the Künneth formula for Lie algebra cohomology, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$.\n    -   For a 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}$, $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1+x$.\n    -   For the 3D Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$, the Betti numbers are well-known: $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1$.\n        So, $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    -   Therefore, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)(1+x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 + x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4 = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$.\n\n### Step 8: Compute the final Poincaré polynomial\nNow we multiply the polynomials for $\\mathfrak{g}'$ and $\\mathfrak{h}$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + x^2)$.\n\nLet's perform the polynomial multiplication:\n  $1 \\cdot (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$\n $2x \\cdot (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) = \\ \\ \\ \\ 2x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 2x^5$\n$x^2 \\cdot (1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4) = \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nSumming these up coefficient-wise:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (3+2)x + (4+6+1)x^2 + (3+8+3)x^3 + (1+6+4)x^4 + (2+3)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$\n\nThe resulting polynomial is palindromic, as expected from Poincaré duality for nilpotent Lie algebras.\n\nFinal answer is the polynomial calculated.\n\n<<<1 + 5*x + 11*x^2 + 14*x^3 + 11*x^4 + 5*x^5 + x^6>>>"
