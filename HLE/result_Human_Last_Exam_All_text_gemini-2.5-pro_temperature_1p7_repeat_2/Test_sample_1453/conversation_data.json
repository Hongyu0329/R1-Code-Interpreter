    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of coiled-coil structure and stability.**\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their formation and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) are primarily determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the interface between the helices. This packing is dictated by the sequence, which follows a characteristic seven-residue repeat pattern called a heptad, denoted as **(a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n**.\n\n*   Positions **'a'** and **'d'** are the core positions. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. Their side chains form the \"knobs\" that pack into \"holes\" on the adjacent helix/helices. The identity of these residues is the most crucial factor in determining the oligomeric state.\n*   Positions 'e' and 'g' are on the flanks of the hydrophobic core and are often charged, forming stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges).\n*   Positions 'b', 'c', and 'f' are typically polar or charged and are exposed to the solvent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the heptad repeat pattern in the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. To find the correct register (the assignment of each amino acid to an a-g position), we must find a repeating pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall into the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\nLet's test potential registers. The most common large hydrophobic residues that drive coiled-coil formation are Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), and Methionine (M). Alanine (A) is also hydrophobic but small.\n\nLet's try a register where the 'a' position falls on the Alanine (A) at index 4 and the 'd' position falls on the Leucine (L) at index 7. The distance between an 'a' and 'd' position in the same heptad is 3 residues (`d` is at `a`+3). This fits the sequence.\n\nLet's map the entire sequence with this register (`a` at pos 4, 11, 18, 25 and `d` at pos 7, 14, 21, 28):\n\n*   Repeat 1: G E I **A** Q S **L**\n    *   `f g a b c d e` (Incorrect, d should be before f)\n    *   Let's align it correctly: The sequence must have a structure like `...a b c d e f g...`. If `A` is `a`, then `L` must be `d`. `a`->`b`->`c`->`d`. So there are two residues between them.\n    *   Sequence: `...A Q S L...` `A` at position `i`, `L` at `i+3`. This doesn't fit `a-b-c-d`.\n\nLet's re-examine the register. `d` is 3 positions after `a`. The sequence indexes would be `i` and `i+3`. Example: `A(4)` and `L(7)`. My previous check was faulty. Let's write the sequence and register underneath.\n\nSequence:   G E I **A** Q S **L** | K E I **A** K S **L** | K E I **A** W S **L** | K E I **A** Q S **L** | K G\nRegister:   c d e **f** g a **b** (Does not work)\n\nLet's try another register. The most common pattern is `HxxHxxx`, where `H` is a hydrophobic residue at `a` and `d`. A(4) and L(7) are spaced as `AxxL`, which matches the `a` to `d` spacing (`a-b-c-d`). Let's assume this is correct and force the register.\n\n*   Register: ...`e f g a b c d`...\n    Sequence: G E I **A** Q S **L**\n    Position `A` is `a`. Position `L` is `d`.\n    Let's check if this is consistent.\n    **'a' positions:** Residues at positions 4, 11, 18, 25 are **A, A, A, A**.\n    **'d' positions:** Residues at positions 7, 14, 21, 28 are **L, L, L, L**.\n\nThis register is highly consistent and chemically sensible. All 'a' positions are Alanine, and all 'd' positions are Leucine. The very hydrophobic Tryptophan (W) at position 19 falls into a solvent-exposed 'b' position (`...a W S L...` -> `a b c d`), which is unusual but structurally plausible. The core composition is the dominant factor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the packing efficiency of the identified core residues.**\nThe core of this coiled-coil is defined by Alanine at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions (`a=Ala, d=Leu`). We now analyze how this specific combination affects the knobs-into-holes packing for different oligomeric states.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the 'a' knobs from one helix pack against the 'a' knobs of the other, and similarly for the 'd' knobs. The Alanine side chain is just a methyl group, which is very small. The packing between two Alanine residues would be loose and inefficient, creating a poorly packed, unstable core. Therefore, a dimer is unlikely.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a trimer, the helices pack more closely together. The 'a' residues form a central hydrophobic core running down the axis of the super-helix. Having a small residue like Alanine at the 'a' position is highly favorable because it prevents steric clashes in the tight central core. The larger Leucine residues at the 'd' positions are also in the core but slightly more peripheral, where their bulk provides the extensive hydrophobic surface burial required for stability. This `a=Ala, d=Leu` pattern is a well-known, classic motif for forming stable **trimers**.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Canonical tetramers are typically stabilized by the complementary packing of beta-branched (Isoleucine, Valine) and non-beta-branched (Leucine) side chains (e.g., `a=Ile, d=Leu` or `a=Leu, d=Ile`). The `a=Ala, d=Leu` pattern does not fit this rule. The packing of a large Leucine knob into a shallow \"hole\" created by small Alanine residues would be extremely inefficient. Therefore, a tetramer is very unlikely.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the most probable oligomeric state.**\nBased on the analysis of knobs-into-holes packing and known structural motifs, the `a=Ala, d=Leu` pattern strongly disfavors dimers and tetramers but is ideal for forming a stable trimeric coiled-coil.\n\nFinal Answer: The oligomeric state would be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
