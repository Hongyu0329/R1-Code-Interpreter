The best replacement would be to mutate all four residues (Serine-47, Glutamate-48, Glutamate-49, and Aspartate-50) to Alanine. This would change the S-E-E-D sequence to A-A-A-A. This mutation removes the negative charges from glutamate and aspartate, and also eliminates the phosphorylation site at serine, thus completely neutralizing the patch to test its role in autoinhibition.
