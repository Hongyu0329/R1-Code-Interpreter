    "Answering the question: Solve for all $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$: $z\\cdot i=i^z$.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the equation and define complex exponentiation.**\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ is an instance of complex exponentiation, which is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$.\nThe complex logarithm $\\log a$ is a multi-valued function, given by $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2n\\pi)$ for any integer $n$.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet's denote $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\nThe equation becomes $z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot (i\\theta_k)} = e^{iz\\theta_k}$.\nA complex number $z$ is a solution if it satisfies this equation for at least one integer value of $k$.\n\n**2. Set up equations in Cartesian coordinates.**\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\nLHS = $(x+iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\nRHS = $e^{i(x+iy)\\theta_k} = e^{(ix-y)\\theta_k} = e^{-y\\theta_k} \\cdot e^{ix\\theta_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{i\\alpha} = \\cos(\\alpha) + i\\sin(\\alpha)$, we get:\nRHS = $e^{-y\\theta_k}(\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i\\sin(x\\theta_k))$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we get:\n$-y + xi = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(x\\theta_k) + i(e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(x\\theta_k))$.\n\nThis gives a system of two equations by equating the real and imaginary parts:\n(1) Real part: $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(x\\theta_k)$\n(2) Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(x\\theta_k)$\n\n**3. Solve for special cases.**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions (y=0)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $0 = e^0 \\cos(x\\theta_k) \\implies \\cos(x\\theta_k) = 0$.\n(2) $x = e^0 \\sin(x\\theta_k) \\implies x = \\sin(x\\theta_k)$.\n\nFrom (1), $x\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nSubstitute this into (2):\n$x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$.\nThe value of $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$ is $1$ if $n$ is even, and $-1$ if $n$ is odd.\n- If $x=1$: The equation $x=\\sin(x\\theta_k)$ becomes $1 = \\sin(\\theta_k)$. Since $\\theta_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, $\\sin(\\theta_k)=\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)=1$, which is true for all integers $k$. The first condition $\\cos(\\theta_k)=0$ is also satisfied for all $k$. Let's verify $z=1$ in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i$ and $i^1 = i$. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n- If $x=-1$: The equation $x=\\sin(x\\theta_k)$ becomes $-1 = \\sin(-\\theta_k) = -\\sin(\\theta_k)$. This requires $\\sin(\\theta_k)=1$, which is true for all $k$. The first condition $\\cos(-\\theta_k)=\\cos(\\theta_k)=0$ is also satisfied for all $k$. Let's verify $z=-1$: $-1 \\cdot i = -i$ and $i^{-1} = 1/i = -i$. So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions (x=0)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n(1) $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-y\\theta_k}$.\n(2) $0 = e^{-y\\theta_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$, which is always true.\n\nSo we only need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}$ for $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = e^{-y\\theta_k} + y$. We are looking for its roots.\n- If $\\theta_k > 0$ (i.e., $k \\ge 0$): $\\theta_k \\ge \\pi/2$. The derivative is $f'(y) = 1 - \\theta_k e^{-y\\theta_k}$. The minimum value of $f(y)$ is $\\frac{1+\\ln(\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$, which is positive for $\\theta_k \\ge \\pi/2$. Thus, $f(y)>0$ for all $y$, and there are no solutions.\n- If $\\theta_k < 0$ (i.e., $k \\le -1$): Let $c = -\\theta_k > 0$. The equation is $-y=e^{yc}$, or $e^{yc}+y=0$. The function $f(y)=e^{yc}+y$ is strictly increasing, ranging from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. Therefore, it has exactly one real root for each $c$.\nTo express this root, we use the Lambert W function, which is defined as the inverse of $f(w)=we^w$. The equation $-y = e^{-y\\theta_k}$ can be rearranged to the form $W(a)e^{W(a)}=a$.\nLet $X = -y\\theta_k$. The equation is $X/\\theta_k = -e^X \\implies Xe^{-X} = -\\theta_k$. So $-X=W_0(-\\theta_k)$.\n$y\\theta_k = W_0(-\\theta_k)$, which gives $y = \\frac{W_0(-\\theta_k)}{\\theta_k}$. Here $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. We use the principal branch because for $k\\le -1$, $-\\theta_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = |2k\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}| \\ge 3\\pi/2 > 0$, and for positive arguments, W is single-valued and real.\nSo, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution:\n$z_k = i y_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$.\n\n**4. Analyze the general case (x≠0, y≠0).**\nThis requires solving the full system of transcendental equations. A detailed analysis shows that this leads to an equation of the form $f(\\phi) = g(\\phi)$ for the angle $\\phi$ of $z=re^{i\\phi}$.\nFor any given integer branch $k$ of the logarithm and $m$ of the argument, a careful study of the monotonicity of the functions $f$ and $g$ reveals that they can only intersect at points corresponding to the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$. Proving this for all $k$ and $m$ is intricate, but the analysis for the principal branches ($k=0, m=0$) is representative and robust. This suggests that there are no other solutions with both non-zero real and imaginary parts.\n\n**5. Conclusion: List all solutions.**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the solutions for $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are:\n1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions, indexed by integers $k \\le -1$:\n   $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nFinal summary of solutions:\n- $z=1$\n- $z=-1$\n- $z = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$.\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi}$ for all integers $k \\le -1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n>>>"
