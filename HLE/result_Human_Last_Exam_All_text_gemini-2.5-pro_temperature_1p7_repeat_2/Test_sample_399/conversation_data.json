    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can see that the variables $x$ and $t$ can be separated, so it is a **separable differential equation**.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\nTo solve the equation, we group all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ on one side, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ on the other side. We can achieve this by dividing by $x^2$ and multiplying by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n**Careful point:** This step involves dividing by $x^2$, which assumes that $x(t) \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$ for all $t$, then $x'(t)=0$. The original equation becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is indeed a solution (the equilibrium solution). However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. Thus, the particular solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The integral of the left side is:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = -x^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n*   The integral of the right side is:\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\nCombining the results and adding a constant of integration, $C$, to one side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is given as $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution we just found:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n**Careful point:** Be mindful of the signs. A common mistake is to miscalculate $-\\frac{1}{-8}$.\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\nNow, we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to obtain the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo find $x(t)$ explicitly, we first solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$ by multiplying both sides by $-1$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThen, we take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\nThe final step is to evaluate $x(t)$ at $t=1$:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{(1)^2}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{8}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{-4 + 8 - 1}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
