    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde.\n    *   The \"pival-\" part refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group, (CH3)3C-.\n    *   The \"-aldehyde\" suffix indicates the presence of a -CHO functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is (CH3)3C-CHO.\n\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphorus Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a phosphorus atom attached to three phenyl groups (Ph3P). The λ⁵ notation specifies the bonding state of phosphorus, characteristic of an ylide. The ylide is a neutral molecule with adjacent positive and negative charges, often drawn as a double bond (Ph3P=C).\n    *   \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\" describes the organic part attached to the phosphorus. \"ethylidene\" means a two-carbon group attached by a double bond. \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with a chlorine at position 2, ortho) is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Let's construct the ylide: The phosphorus is double-bonded to the first carbon of the ethylidene group (=CH-CH3). The second carbon (-CH3) is substituted with a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    *   Thus, the structure of the ylide is Ph3P=CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl), with the chlorine atom in the ortho position on the phenyl ring.\n\n**2. The Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n*   The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones.\n*   The core of the reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) with the carbon group from the ylide (the one double-bonded to phosphorus).\n*   The reaction forms a new C=C double bond and a byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph3P=O).\n*   The reaction proceeds as follows:\n    *   Aldehyde: `(CH3)3C-CH=O`\n    *   Ylide: `Ph3P=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)`\n    *   The oxygen from the aldehyde combines with the `Ph3P` from the ylide.\n    *   The `(CH3)3C-CH=` part of the aldehyde combines with the `=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)` part of the ylide.\n\n**3. Construct the Product Skeleton**\n*   By combining the specified fragments, we form the alkene product:\n    `(CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)`\n\n**4. Determine the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism)**\n*   The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n    *   **Stabilized ylides**, which have an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, ester) attached to the carbanionic carbon, typically yield the **E-alkene** (trans) as the major product. This is because the initial steps are reversible, allowing the reaction to proceed to the more thermodynamically stable E-product.\n    *   **Non-stabilized ylides**, which have alkyl or hydrogen groups attached to the carbanionic carbon, typically yield the **Z-alkene** (cis) as the major product. This is because the reaction is kinetically controlled and the formation of the cis-oxaphosphetane intermediate is faster.\n*   In our case, the ylide is `Ph3P=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)`. The group attached to the double-bonded carbon is `-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)`, which is an alkyl-type group. It does not stabilize the adjacent negative charge via resonance. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n*   Since we are reacting a non-stabilized ylide with an aldehyde, the major product will be the **Z-isomer**.\n*   To determine the Z configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the groups on the new double bond.\n    *   Carbon 1 of the double bond: Groups are `-H` and `-C(CH3)3` (tert-butyl). Priority: `-C(CH3)3` > `-H`.\n    *   Carbon 2 of the double bond: Groups are `-H` and `-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)` (2-chlorophenylethyl). Priority: `-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)` > `-H`.\n*   The **Z-isomer** has the two higher-priority groups (`-C(CH3)3` and `-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)`) on the **same side** of the double bond.\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n*   The final product is the Z-isomer of the alkene we constructed.\n*   To name it using IUPAC nomenclature, we find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond:\n    `1-(o-ClC6H4)-CH2(2)-CH(3)=CH(4)-C(CH3)3(5)`. This is not correct numbering.\n*   Let's number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number.\n    `C(CH3)3` is attached to C4, `CH` is C3, `CH` is C2, `CH2-(o-ClC6H4)` is attached to C1. This numbering gives the double bond at C2. `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n*   Numbering from the other side would give the double bond a higher number (C3).\n*   Therefore, the correct IUPAC name, including the stereochemistry, is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe reaction of pivalaldehyde ((CH3)3C-CHO) with the non-stabilized Wittig reagent (Ph3P=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)) results in the formation of a C=C double bond, yielding the Z-alkene as the major product. The structure of this product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
