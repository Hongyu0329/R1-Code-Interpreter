    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the User's Question:**\n    The goal is to find the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ whose rational points are considered over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The group of such points is denoted $E(K)$, and its torsion subgroup is $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$.\n\n2.  **Recall General Theory of Torsion Subgroups:**\n    *   The Mordell-Weil theorem states that for an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, the group of $K$-rational points $E(K)$ is a finitely generated abelian group. It has the form $E(K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, where $r$ is the rank and $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is the finite torsion subgroup.\n    *   A finite abelian group is non-cyclic if and only if it is not of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, a non-cyclic group must have at least two factors in its primary decomposition, i.e., it can be written as $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $m, n > 1$ (not necessarily coprime), or more generally $\\mathbb{Z}/d_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/d_k\\mathbb{Z}$ with $k \\ge 2$.\n    *   For elliptic curves, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ can have at most two factors, meaning it is always isomorphic to a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m$ divides $n$.\n\n3.  **Torsion over Quadratic Fields:**\n    The case of elliptic curves over quadratic fields (number fields $K$ with $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2$) has been completely classified by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. This means there is a complete, finite list of all possible torsion subgroup structures that can occur over any quadratic field.\n\n4.  **Specialization to the Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:**\n    The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is a special case. It is the field of Eisenstein integers, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. This is one of the two imaginary quadratic fields (the other being $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$) that is a unique factorization domain (class number 1) and has a unit group of order greater than 2. The units in its ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ are the 6th roots of unity. This allows for elliptic curves with Complex Multiplication (CM) by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ to exist, which often have unusually large torsion subgroups when defined over a field containing $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n5.  **Consulting the Classification List:**\n    We need to refer to the established lists of possible torsion groups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Authoritative sources like the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) or survey papers by experts in the field (e.g., Lozano-Robledo, Najman) provide these lists.\n    The known non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Orders and Finding the Maximum:**\n    We now calculate the order (the number of elements) for each possible non-cyclic group in the list for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and identify the largest one.\n\n    *   For the family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n        *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n        *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n        *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n        *   $N=5$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $2 \\times 10 = 20$.\n\n    *   For the family $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n        *   $N=1$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n        *   $N=2$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n        *   $N=3$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $3 \\times 9 = 27$.\n\n    *   For the special case:\n        *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    Comparing the calculated orders $\\{4, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 27, 36\\}$, the largest value is 36. This corresponds to the torsion subgroup structure $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a known fact that this group does indeed occur as a torsion subgroup for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. An example is the elliptic curve with CM by $\\mathbb{Z}[\\omega]$ given by the equation $y^2 + \\omega xy + \\omega y = x^3$, which has $j$-invariant 0.\n\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
