    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The key detail is that this character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This implies not just missing Earth, but also a sense of embarrassment or inappropriateness about such a simple, sentimental longing while on a complex space mission.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Characters in the Context of the Film's Themes**\nThe film *Solaris* explores themes of memory, humanity, nostalgia, and the limits of science. The characters on the space station are isolated and under immense psychological pressure.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with his deep connection to the nature surrounding his home on Earth. He certainly misses Earth profoundly, and much of the film's imagery reinforces this. However, the specific emotion of being *ashamed* of this feeling is what we need to pinpoint.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is not a human from Earth, but a \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean from Kris's memories. Therefore, she has no personal memories of Earth to miss.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cybernetics specialist who has been on the station for a long time. He often appears cynical, jaded, and philosophical, acting as a guide to Kris about the station's strange phenomena. His cynicism could be a mask for deeper feelings.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist who is portrayed as cold, rigidly scientific, and almost inhumanly focused on his research. He is the least likely character to admit to or even feel such a sentimental emotion.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** A physiologist who commits suicide before Kris arrives. We only see him in a distressed video message. While he clearly suffered from his experiences, the specific line in question is not spoken by him.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question occurs during a philosophical conversation between Kris Kelvin and Dr. Snaut. Snaut is explaining his disillusionment with their mission and the nature of humanity's quest for knowledge. He argues that man doesn't truly seek to conquer the cosmos but rather needs other humans. In a moment of vulnerable confession, he reveals his own homesickness.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Speaker**\nDuring this conversation, it is Dr. Snaut who says the line. He admits his feelings of homesickness and then, almost as an aside, specifies what he misses most and his shame about it. He feels that for a scientist on a grand mission to another world, missing something as simple and mundane as rustling leaves is a weakness or an embarrassing sentiment. This admission reveals the profound human longing beneath his cynical exterior.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who explicitly states he is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
