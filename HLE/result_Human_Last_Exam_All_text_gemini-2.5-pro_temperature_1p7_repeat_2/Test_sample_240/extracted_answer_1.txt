The reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance on a VNA with a pickup loop is that modern coils are complex active systems, not simple passive circuits. There are two primary reasons for this behavior:

1.  **Active Decoupling:** Coils have built-in safety circuits (usually with PIN diodes) to "detune" themselves and become non-resonant when not in receive mode. This protects them from the scanner's powerful transmit pulse. When the coil is on a bench and not connected to the scanner, it defaults to this safe, non-resonant state. Your VNA is correctly measuring this designed lack of resonance.

2.  **Integrated Preamplifiers:** Most coils have preamplifiers built-in, which require DC power from the scanner to operate. The coil's resonant element is specifically tuned and matched to the input impedance of the *powered* preamplifier. Without this power, the preamplifier's impedance is wrong, which detunes the entire system and spoils the resonance.

Therefore, the coil is only "functional" and resonant when it is in its intended operating environmentâ€”powered and controlled by the MRI scanner. Your VNA test does not replicate these conditions.
