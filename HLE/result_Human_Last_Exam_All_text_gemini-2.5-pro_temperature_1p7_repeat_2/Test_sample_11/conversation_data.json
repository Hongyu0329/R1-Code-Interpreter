    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The key elements of the question are:\n    *   **\"First statute\":** This requires a chronological search for the earliest law that meets the other criteria.\n    *   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This limits the search to laws enacted by the Knesset after the state's establishment in 1948. Laws from the British Mandate or Ottoman period are excluded unless they were re-enacted as Israeli statutes.\n    *   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The statute must contain the actual Hebrew term for \"good faith,\" which is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). A law where the concept is merely implied or was read into it later by courts does not qualify.\n    *   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\":** The principle of fair dealing and honesty in transactions or legal relationships.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Common Candidates:**\n    *   Many would immediately think of the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 are famous for establishing \"good faith\" as a foundational and overarching principle in Israeli contract law, applying to both pre-contractual negotiations and the performance of contractual obligations.\n    *   However, while this law gave the principle its broad scope, it was not the *first* to introduce the term into Israeli legislation.\n\n3.  **Searching for Earlier Statutes (Working Backwards):**\n    *   A wave of new civil legislation began in the 1960s to replace the older patchwork of laws. Examining these statutes reveals earlier uses of the term \"good faith.\"\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law, which deals with conflicting transactions, explicitly states that the right of a second purchaser can prevail if the transaction was completed and registered \"in good faith and for consideration.\"\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 34, regarding the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat hashuk*), protects a buyer who acquires property from a merchant in the ordinary course of business, provided the buyer acts \"in good faith.\"\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** Section 14 protects a third party who dealt with an agent \"in good faith\" without knowledge that the agency had terminated.\n    *   These examples from 1969, 1968, and 1965 all predate the Contracts Law of 1973 and explicitly use the term \"good faith.\"\n\n4.  **Identifying the First Statute:**\n    *   The search must go even earlier than 1965. In the 1950s, the Knesset began the process of modernizing and consolidating commercial laws that were inherited from the British Mandate.\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957** is the result of this process. It is a modern Israeli statute, enacted by the Knesset, which replaced the previous mandatory ordinance.\n    *   This statute explicitly uses the term \"good faith.\" For instance, Section 28 defines a \"holder in due course\" as one who took a bill \"in good faith and for value.\" Section 89 provides a specific definition: \"A thing is deemed to be done in good faith, within the meaning of this Ordinance, where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], enacted in 1957, is a statute of the modern State of Israel that explicitly incorporates the concept and terminology of \"good faith.\" Its enactment date of 1957 precedes the other civil laws of the 1960s and the more famous Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973. Therefore, it is the first statute in modern Israel to have explicitly introduced the concept.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
