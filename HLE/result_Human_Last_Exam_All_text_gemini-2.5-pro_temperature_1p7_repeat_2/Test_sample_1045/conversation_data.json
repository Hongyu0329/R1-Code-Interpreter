    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular formula and atomic composition.**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula is C₇H₈.\n*   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are constructed from Gaussian functions.\n*   **The first number (`6`):** This refers to the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **The second part (`31`):** This refers to the valence electrons. The valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions per atomic orbital, providing more flexibility.\n    *   The `3` means the inner part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The `1` means the outer part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 1 PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for each Carbon atom.**\n*   Carbon is in the second row of the periodic table. Its electron configuration is 1s²2s²2p².\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** Represented by **1 CGF** (from the `6` in 6-31G).\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** These are split into an inner and outer part (`31`).\n    *   For the inner valence shell, we have one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂). This requires 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   For the outer valence shell, we again have one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals. This requires another 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total per Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) for each Hydrogen atom.**\n*   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its single 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The `31` split applies directly to the 1s orbital.\n    *   The inner part is represented by **1 CGF**.\n    *   The outer part is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total per Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of CGFs for the entire toluene (C₇H₈) molecule.**\n*   **Total from Carbon atoms:** 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs.\n*   **Total from Hydrogen atoms:** 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs.\n*   **Grand Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions, not the more numerous *primitive* functions they are built from.\n2.  **Meaning of \"Split-Valence\":** Understand that the splitting applies only to the valence shell. Core shells are not split.\n3.  **Hydrogen Exception:** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so its 1s orbital is its valence orbital and is therefore split.\n4.  **p-Orbitals:** Remember that a \"p shell\" consists of three individual orbitals (pₓ, pᵧ, p₂), so for every p-function added to a basis set, three basis functions are actually included in the calculation.\n5.  **Accurate Atom Count:** Always start by correctly identifying the number of each type of atom from the chemical formula.\n\nFollowing this detailed analysis, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<79>>>"
