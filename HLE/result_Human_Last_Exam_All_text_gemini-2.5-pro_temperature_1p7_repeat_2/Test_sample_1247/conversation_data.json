    "To determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) that have exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions and avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}\\).\nAn inversion is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\).\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\). Otherwise, \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324.\n\nA permutation with a small number of inversions is \"close\" to the identity permutation \\((1, 2, \\dots, n)\\). The non-trivial structure of such a permutation is typically localized. If the elements involved in inversions are in the \"middle\" of the permutation (both in terms of position and value), there is a high chance of forming a 1324 pattern with other elements of the permutation. For a large \\(n\\) like 333, elements that are not part of the localized inverted section are readily available to complete the pattern.\n\nA 1324 pattern is of the form \\(a, c, b, d\\) with \\(a<c<b<d\\). Let the permutation subsequence be \\(\\pi(i_1), \\pi(i_2), \\pi(i_3), \\pi(i_4)\\). The requirements are \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3)\\), \\(\\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2)\\), \\(\\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\), for indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\). The core of this is the 132-like pattern \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2)\\) which requires \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3\\). This forms an inversion between \\(\\pi(i_2)\\) and \\(\\pi(i_3)\\).\n\nThis suggests that for a permutation with few inversions to be 1324-avoiding, the inversions must be localized at one of the ends of the permutation. That is, the permuted elements are either among the first few integers or the last few integers, or they are at the beginning or end of the permutation's one-line notation.\nLet's analyze permutations \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\{1, ..., n\\}\\) of the form \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus id_{n-m} = (\\sigma(1), \\dots, \\sigma(m), m+1, \\dots, n)\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) and \\(id_{n-m}\\) is the identity permutation of length \\(n-m\\). The number of inversions in \\(\\pi\\) is simply the number of inversions in \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nFor \\(\\pi = (\\sigma(1), \\dots, \\sigma(m), m+1, \\dots, n)\\) to avoid 1324, a subsequence that could form the pattern must lie entirely within the prefix \\(\\sigma\\) or span across the \\(\\sigma\\) part and the \\(id\\) part.\nIf we pick \\(i_1, i_2, i_3\\) from \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) and \\(i_4 > m\\), we can easily form a 1324 pattern if \\(\\sigma\\) contains a 132 pattern. Let \\(\\sigma(i_1) < \\sigma(i_3) < \\sigma(i_2)\\) with \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3\\). We can choose \\(i_4 = m+1\\). Then \\(\\pi(i_4) = m+1\\), which for sufficiently large m is greater than \\(\\sigma(i_2)\\). This creates a 1324 pattern \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\nTherefore, the prefix \\(\\sigma\\) must be 132-avoiding.\n\nSo, we list permutations \\(\\sigma\\) of length \\(m\\) with 3 inversions which are 132-avoiding.\n\n1.  **Case m=3**: \\(\\sigma \\in S_3\\) with 3 inversions.\n    The only permutation is \\(\\sigma = (3,2,1)\\). This is 132-avoiding.\n    This gives the permutation \\(\\pi_1 = (3,2,1,4,5,\\dots,333)\\). It has 3 inversions and avoids 1324.\n\n2.  **Case m=4**: \\(\\sigma \\in S_4\\) with 3 inversions.\n    The permutations in \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions are 1432, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123.\n    We check which of these are 132-avoiding. A permutation is 132-avoiding if there are no indices \\(i<j<k\\) with \\(\\sigma(i)<\\sigma(k)<\\sigma(j)\\).\n    -   1432: 132-avoiding. (Subsequences of length 3: 143, 142, 132, 432. No 132 pattern)\n    -   2341: 132-avoiding.\n    -   2413: Contains the 132 pattern (2,4,3) using indices 1,2,4, \\(\\sigma(1)=2, \\sigma(2)=4, \\sigma(4)=3\\). Wait, indices must be in order: i<j<k. 1<2<4 gives 2,4,3. OK. Let's recheck. (1,2,4): 2,4,3 -> \\(\\sigma(1)<\\sigma(4)<\\sigma(2)\\). This is a 132. So 2413 is not 132-avoiding.\n    -   3142: Contains the 132 pattern (1,4,2) with indices 2,3,4.\n    -   3214: This is \\((3,2,1)\\oplus id_1\\). It is 132-avoiding.\n    -   4123: 132-avoiding.\n    So, 132-avoiding permutations in \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions are {1432, 2341, 3214, 4123}.\n    Now we check \\(\\pi = (\\sigma, 5, 6, ...)\\) for the 1324 pattern.\n    -   For \\(\\sigma=1432\\), \\(\\pi=(1,4,3,2,5,6,...)\\). Take indices \\(i_1=1, i_2=2, i_3=3, i_4=5\\). The values are \\(\\pi(1)=1, \\pi(2)=4, \\pi(3)=3, \\pi(5)=5\\). We check \\(\\pi(1)<\\pi(3)<\\pi(2)<\\pi(5) \\Rightarrow 1<3<4<5\\). This is a 1324 pattern. So \\(\\pi\\) is not an avoider.\n    -   For \\(\\sigma=2341\\), \\(\\pi=(2,3,4,1,5,6,...)\\). For an inversion \\(\\pi(i_2) > \\pi(i_3)\\), we must have \\(\\pi(i_3)=1\\), which means \\(i_3=4\\). Then we can't find \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3)\\). So this avoids 1324. This gives \\(\\pi_2 = (2,3,4,1,5,\\dots,333)\\).\n    -   For \\(\\sigma=3214\\), this is \\((3,2,1)\\) followed by 4. \\(\\pi=(3,2,1,4,5,...)\\). We already have this as \\(\\pi_1\\).\n    -   For \\(\\sigma=4123\\), \\(\\pi=(4,1,2,3,5,6,...)\\). For an inversion \\(\\pi(i_2) > \\pi(i_3)\\), we must have \\(i_2=1\\), so we can't find \\(i_1 < i_2\\). This avoids 1324. This gives \\(\\pi_3 = (4,1,2,3,5,\\dots,333)\\).\n\n3.  **Case m \\(\\ge\\) 5**: If \\(\\sigma \\in S_m\\) has 3 inversions, it must be very close to the identity. Any inversions in the middle of \\(\\{1,...,m\\}\\) will lead to a 1324 pattern. For instance, \\(\\sigma=(1,4,2,3,5,...) \\in S_5\\) with 2 invs has a 132 pattern. Appending \\(6\\) gives a 1324. Permutations with 3 inversions acting on \\(m \\ge 5\\) elements will be decomposable or have inversions that are not at the ends, which creates 132 patterns.\n\nSo far we have found 3 such permutations where the non-trivial part is at the beginning:\n-   \\(\\pi_1 = (3,2,1,4,5,\\dots,333)\\)\n-   \\(\\pi_2 = (2,3,4,1,5,6,\\dots,333)\\)\n-   \\(\\pi_3 = (4,1,2,3,5,6,\\dots,333)\\)\n\nThe set of 1324-avoiding permutations is closed under the rc-operation (reverse-complement). That is, if \\(\\pi\\) avoids 1324, then \\(\\pi' = rc(\\pi)\\) also avoids 1324, where \\(\\pi'(i) = n+1 - \\pi(n+1-i)\\). The number of inversions is also preserved by this operation.\nApplying the rc-operation to our three permutations will yield three distinct permutations where the non-trivial part is at the end.\n-   \\(\\pi_4 = rc(\\pi_1) = rc(3,2,1,4,...,n) = (1,2,...,n-3,n,n-1,n-2)\\).\n-   \\(\\pi_5 = rc(\\pi_2) = rc(2,3,4,1,5,...,n) = (1,2,...,n-4,n,n-3,n-2,n-1)\\).\n-   \\(\\pi_6 = rc(\\pi_3) = rc(4,1,2,3,5,...,n) = (1,2,...,n-4,n-2,n-1,n,n-3)\\).\n\nThese are 6 distinct 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions. Other cases, like decomposing \\(\\pi\\) into two non-trivial 1324-avoiding parts, or having inversions not at the ends, can be shown to generate 1324 patterns for large \\(n\\).\nFor example, take a permutation with two separated inversions, like \\(\\pi=(2,1,3,5,4,6,...)\\). This has 2 inversions. Take \\((i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4) = (1,4,5,6)\\), \\(\\pi(1)=2, \\pi(4)=5, \\pi(5)=4, \\pi(6)=6\\). Then \\(\\pi(1) < \\pi(5) < \\pi(4) < \\pi(6) \\implies 2<4<5<6\\). This is a 1324. This shows why separated inversions are problematic.\nThus, the permutations we are looking for must have their inversions \"clustered\" at one end. Our list of 6 permutations captures this property.\n\nSo the total number is 6.\n\nFinal check of the list:\n1.  \\((3,2,1,4, ...)\\) invs: (3,2),(3,1),(2,1). OK.\n2.  \\((2,3,4,1, ...)\\) invs: (2,1),(3,1),(4,1). OK.\n3.  \\((4,1,2,3, ...)\\) invs: (4,1),(4,2),(4,3). OK.\n4.  \\(rc(\\pi_1)\\)\n5.  \\(rc(\\pi_2)\\)\n6.  \\(rc(\\pi_3)\\)\n\nAll 6 permutations are distinct and have 3 inversions. The analysis shows they avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\nFinal count is 6."
