    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the scientific name of a specific mushroom *genus*. The key characteristic provided is that it is the *only* genus known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Feature: \"Blue Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a critical tool for mushroom identification, made by placing a mushroom cap gills-down on a surface to collect the microscopic spores. The standard colors for spore prints in mycology are white, cream, yellow, pinkish, rusty brown, dark brown, purple-brown, and black. True, vibrant blue is not a standard, recognized spore print color. This immediately suggests the question might be a trick question or based on a common misconception.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Potential Candidates and Common Misconceptions**\nWe need to examine mushrooms that are famous for the color blue and see if the claim about their spore print holds up.\n\n*   **Candidate A: *Lactarius indigo***\n    *   **Analysis:** This mushroom is famous for its striking indigo-blue color and, most notably, the blue latex (or \"milk\") it bleeds when cut. Because it is so intensely and uniquely blue, it's the first mushroom people think of.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is **not** blue. It is actually creamy white to pale yellow. The popular belief that it has a blue spore print is a widespread myth, likely started because the blue latex can drip onto the paper during spore printing, staining the print and giving a false impression of blue spores. The genus for this mushroom is ***Lactarius***.\n\n*   **Candidate B: *Gyroporus cyanescens***\n    *   **Analysis:** This mushroom is commonly known as the \"Bluing Bolete.\" Its pale flesh turns a dramatic and dark blue almost instantly upon being cut or bruised.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The impressive bluing reaction is a chemical oxidation in the mushroom's flesh, not a property of its spores. The spore print of *Gyroporus cyanescens* is pale yellow. The genus is ***Gyroporus***.\n\n*   **Candidate C: *Entoloma hochstetteri***\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a small, vividly blue mushroom found in New Zealand and India. It is famous for its beauty and is even featured on a New Zealand banknote.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The *Entoloma* genus is defined by its pink, angular spores. Therefore, the spore print of *Entoloma hochstetteri* is pink, not blue. The genus is ***Entoloma***.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings and Determine the Intended Answer**\nSince no mushroom is scientifically recognized as having a true, distinctly blue spore print, the question is based on a flawed premise. It is a classic piece of mycological trivia that plays on a common misconception. The mushroom most directly and famously associated with the color blue is *Lactarius indigo*. Its unique blue latex is the most likely source of the myth about blue spores. Therefore, when this trivia question is asked, the expected answer refers to the genus of this mushroom.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe question refers to a piece of popular, though technically incorrect, mycological lore. The single genus that is famously associated with the color blue in a unique way (its latex) and is the common answer to this trivia question is *Lactarius*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
