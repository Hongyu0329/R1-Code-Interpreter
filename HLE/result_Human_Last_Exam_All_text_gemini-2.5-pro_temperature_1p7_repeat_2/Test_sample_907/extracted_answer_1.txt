The equation for the absorption cross-section $\sigma(\omega_L)$ is derived from first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. It is proportional to the sum over all possible final exciton states $|f\rangle$ of the transition probability from the ground state $|G\rangle$, weighted by the transition energy $\hbar\omega_{fG}$. For an ultrashort Gaussian laser pulse of duration $\tau$, the general form is:
$\sigma(\omega_L) \propto \tau \sum_f \omega_{fG} |\langle f | \vec{\mu}_{tot} | G \rangle \cdot \vec{\epsilon}|^2 \cdot e^{-(\omega_{fG} - \omega_L)^2\tau^2/2}$
where $\omega_{fG}=(E_f-E_G)/\hbar$ is the transition frequency, $\vec{\mu}_{tot}$ is the total dipole moment operator, and $\vec{\epsilon}$ is the laser polarization vector.

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

In this case, the system is a collection of `N` identical, independent molecules. The final states are `N` degenerate states where one molecule is excited.
*   **Final States:** There are `N` degenerate final states, each with the same transition frequency $\omega_{eg}$, the energy of a single molecule excitation.
*   **Transition Dipole Moment:** The transition to each state involves only the dipole moment of that single molecule, $\vec{\mu}_{eg}^{\text{mol}}$.
The equation becomes:
$\sigma_a(\omega_L) = C \cdot N \cdot \omega_{eg} \cdot |\vec{\mu}_{eg}^{\text{mol}}|^2 \cdot e^{-(\omega_{eg} - \omega_L)^2\tau^2/2}$
(assuming all molecules are oriented identically with respect to the laser polarization; $C$ is a constant).
The spectrum is a single Gaussian peak centered at the monomer frequency $\omega_{eg}$, with an intensity proporti
