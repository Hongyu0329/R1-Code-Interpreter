    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the \"rule activation level\" of a fuzzy rule. In the context of fuzzy inference systems, this term refers to the result of the implication step, where the firing strength of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) is used to modify the rule's consequent (the \"THEN\" part).\n\n2.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength ($\\Phi_k(x')$):** This is the degree to which the input data $x'$ matches the condition of the k-th rule. It's given as **0.7**. This value represents how \"true\" the IF part of the rule is for the given input.\n    *   **Consequent Membership ($\\mu_{\\tilde{G}_{k,j}}(y_j)$):** This is the membership degree of a specific output value $y_j$ in the original consequent fuzzy set of the rule, before activation. It's given as **0.9**.\n    *   **Operation:** The operation specified to combine these two values is a **t-norm**. A t-norm is a fuzzy logic operator that models the logical AND. In fuzzy implication (like the common Mamdani method), a t-norm is used to \"clip\" or \"scale\" the consequent fuzzy set.\n\n3.  **Address the Careful Points:**\n    *   **\"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\":** The problem mentions this advanced type of fuzzy set. However, the inputs provided ($\\Phi_k(x')=0.7$ and $\\mu_{\\tilde{G}_{k,j}}(y_j)=0.9$) are single, crisp numbers. This simplifies the problem significantly. In a full interval type-3 system, these values would be complex fuzzy sets themselves. Since we are given scalars, the calculation proceeds as it would in a simpler Type-1 fuzzy system for this specific point. The mention of \"type-3\" provides context but doesn't change the fundamental operation on the given numbers. The values 0.7 and 0.9 can be interpreted as specific bounds (e.g., upper bounds) of the fuzzy membership grades, and the question is asking for the resulting bound of the activated consequent.\n    *   **Choosing the Specific T-norm:** The question specifies using a \"t-norm\" but doesn't state which one (e.g., minimum, product, Łukasiewicz). In the absence of specific instructions, the most common t-norm used for the implication step in fuzzy controllers is the **minimum (min)** operator, which is central to the widely used Mamdani inference method. The second most common is the **product** operator. We will proceed using the most standard choice, the minimum operator.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The rule activation level for the consequent at point $y_j$ is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership value.\n    *   **Formula:** Activated Level = t-norm($\\Phi_k(x')$, $\\mu_{\\tilde{G}_{k,j}}(y_j)$)\n    *   **Applying the minimum t-norm:** Activated Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\n    *   **Calculation:** The minimum of 0.7 and 0.9 is 0.7.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe process is to combine the antecedent firing strength (0.7) and the consequent membership degree (0.9) using a standard t-norm. The most common t-norm for this fuzzy implication step is the `min` operator.\n\n*   `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level at this specific point of the consequent set is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
