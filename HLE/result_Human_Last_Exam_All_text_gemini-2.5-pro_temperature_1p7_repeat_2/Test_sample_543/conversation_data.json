    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction and the determination of the product's IUPAC name.\n\n**1. Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene. This is an aromatic compound with three halogen substituents on a benzene ring.\n    *   A bromine atom is at position 1.\n    *   An iodine atom is at position 2.\n    *   A bromine atom is at position 3.\n*   **Reagent:** Phenyl magnesium bromide (PhMgBr). This is a Grignard reagent, which acts as a source of a nucleophilic phenyl group (Ph⁻).\n*   **Conditions:**\n    *   **Excess Reagent:** The use of \"excess\" phenyl magnesium bromide is a critical point. It implies that the reagent is present in sufficient quantity to react with all possible reactive sites on the substrate.\n    *   **Solvent and Temperature:** Refluxing in THF (tetrahydrofuran) provides the necessary energy and a suitable solvent for the reaction to proceed to completion.\n    *   **Aqueous Work-up:** This is a standard final step in Grignard reactions. It serves to quench any remaining Grignard reagent (PhMgBr + H₂O → C₆H₆ + Mg(OH)Br) and to protonate any magnesium alkoxide or phenoxide salts to yield the neutral final organic product. It does not change the carbon skeleton of the desired product.\n\n**2. Identify the Reaction Type**\n\nThe reaction between an aryl halide (like 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene) and a Grignard reagent (like phenyl magnesium bromide) is a metal-mediated cross-coupling reaction, specifically known as a **Kumada coupling**. In this reaction, the nucleophilic group from the Grignard reagent (the phenyl group) replaces the halogen atom on the aromatic ring.\nGeneral form: Ar-X + R-MgBr → Ar-R + MgXBr\n\n**3. Determine the Reactivity of the Halogen Substituents**\n\nTo predict the product, we must know the relative reactivity of the different carbon-halogen bonds (C-I and C-Br) towards the Grignard reagent. In Kumada coupling and similar cross-coupling reactions, the reactivity order is based on the bond strength of the C-X bond:\nC-I > C-Br > C-Cl > C-F\nThe C-I bond is the weakest and longest, making it the most reactive site for this substitution reaction. The C-Br bonds are less reactive than the C-I bond but will still react, especially with excess reagent and heat.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Formation of the Product**\n\nGiven the reactivity order and the use of excess reagent, all three halogens will be replaced by phenyl groups. The substitution will occur sequentially.\n\n*   **Step 1: First Substitution (Most Reactive Site)**\n    The phenyl group from the first equivalent of PhMgBr will replace the most reactive halogen, which is the iodine at position 2.\n    *   1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene + PhMgBr → **1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene** + MgBrI\n\n*   **Step 2 & 3: Subsequent Substitutions (Less Reactive Sites)**\n    Since excess PhMgBr is present, the reaction will not stop at the first step. The two bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 will be replaced by phenyl groups.\n    *   1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene + 2 (excess) PhMgBr → **Final Product** + 2 MgBr₂\n\n**5. Identify the Final Product Structure**\n\nThe starting material had Br, I, and Br at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. After the reaction is complete, these three positions are now occupied by three phenyl groups. The final product is a central benzene ring connected to three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.\n\n**6. Determine the IUPAC Name of the Final Product**\n\nTo name the final molecule according to IUPAC nomenclature rules:\n*   **Identify the Parent Chain:** The central ring with the most substituents is the benzene ring. So, the parent name is \"benzene\".\n*   **Identify the Substituents:** There are three identical substituents, which are phenyl groups (C₆H₅).\n*   **Use Multiplicative Prefixes:** For three identical substituents, the prefix is \"tri-\". So, we have \"triphenyl\".\n*   **Assign Locants (Positions):** The phenyl groups are located at positions 1, 2, and 3 of the parent benzene ring. We list the locants separated by commas: \"1,2,3-\".\n*   **Combine the Parts:** The full IUPAC name is constructed by combining the locants, the substituent prefix, the substituent name, and the parent name.\n\nThis gives the final name: **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
