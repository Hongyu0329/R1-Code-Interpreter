    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe Large Deviation Theorems, like Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff, provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding why macroscopic systems in equilibrium are overwhelmingly likely to be found in a state that maximizes entropy.\n\n*   **Core Idea:** The probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a certain energy distribution) that deviates from the equilibrium state is exponentially small in the number of particles/degrees of freedom ($N$). This probability is described by a rate function, $I$: $P(\\text{state}) \\approx e^{-N \\cdot I(\\text{state})}$.\n*   **Equilibrium Principle:** The equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable macroscopic state, which is the one that minimizes the rate function $I$.\n*   **Connection to Entropy:** The rate function is fundamentally related to entropy. Specifically, minimizing the rate function subject to system constraints (like fixed total energy) is equivalent to maximizing the statistical entropy, $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates corresponding to the macroscopic state.\n\nTherefore, \"using\" these theorems to find the equilibrium values means we will apply the principle of maximum entropy.\n\n**Step 2: Defining the Entropy for a Bose Gas**\n\nWe consider a system of light quanta (photons), which are bosons. The key is to find the correct expression for the number of microstates, $W$.\n\n*   Let there be a set of energy levels $\\{e_i\\}$, with each level $i$ having $g_i$ degenerate quantum states.\n*   Let $n_i$ be the number of bosons occupying the energy level $e_i$.\n*   Since bosons are indistinguishable, the number of ways to place $n_i$ particles into the $g_i$ available states at energy $e_i$ is given by the combination with repetition formula:\n    $W_i = \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$\n*   The total number of microstates for a given distribution $\\{n_i\\}$ is the product over all energy levels:\n    $W = \\prod_i W_i = \\prod_i \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$\n*   The entropy of the system is given by Boltzmann's formula, $S = k_B \\ln W$.\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\ln \\binom{n_i + g_i - 1}{n_i}$\n*   For large $n_i$ and $g_i$, we use Stirling's approximation ($\\ln k! \\approx k \\ln k - k$), which simplifies the entropy per state $i$ to:\n    $S_i/k_B = g_i [ (\\bar{n}_i+1)\\ln(\\bar{n}_i+1) - \\bar{n}_i\\ln\\bar{n}_i ]$\n    where $\\bar{n}_i = n_i/g_i$ is the average occupation number per state at energy $e_i$.\n\n**Step 3: Maximizing Entropy with System Constraints**\n\nWe find the equilibrium distribution $\\{\\bar{n}_i\\}$ by maximizing the total entropy $S = \\sum_i S_i$ subject to the physical constraints on the system.\n\n*   **Constraint 1: Total Energy.** The total energy of the isolated system is constant: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i n_i e_i = \\text{constant}$.\n*   **Constraint 2: Particle Number.** For photons, the number of particles is not conserved (they can be created and absorbed). This means there is no constraint on the total number of particles $N=\\sum n_i$. This corresponds to a chemical potential $\\mu=0$.\n*   **Method:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S$ with the energy constraint. We maximize the function $\\mathcal{F} = S/k_B - \\beta(\\sum_i n_i e_i - \\langle E \\rangle)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n*   Differentiating with respect to $n_j$ and setting to zero gives:\n    $\\frac{\\partial (S_j/k_B)}{\\partial n_j} - \\beta e_j = 0$\n    $\\ln(1 + \\frac{g_j}{n_j}) - \\beta e_j = 0 \\implies \\ln(1 + \\frac{1}{\\bar{n}_j}) = \\beta e_j$\n*   Solving for $\\bar{n}_j$ gives the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for photons:\n    $\\bar{n}(e_j) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta e_j} - 1}$\n    The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is calculated by integrating the energy of each state multiplied by its equilibrium occupation number over the density of states.\n\n*   **Density of States:** For photons in a 3D volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is $g(e)de = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} e^2 de$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty e \\cdot \\bar{n}(e) \\cdot g(e) de = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e}{e^{\\beta e}-1} \\cdot \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} e^2 de$\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^3}{e^{\\beta e}-1} de$\n    By substituting $x = \\beta e$, the integral becomes a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function:\n    $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8\\pi V}{(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\left( \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} \\right) = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\n    This is the celebrated Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy can be found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula. However, a simpler method is to use the thermodynamic relation for the grand canonical ensemble (with $\\mu=0$): $S = k_B(\\ln Z_{GC} + \\beta \\langle E \\rangle)$, where $Z_{GC}$ is the grand partition function.\n\n*   **Grand Partition Function:**\n    $\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\int_0^\\infty g(e) \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta e}) de = -\\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty e^2 \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta e}) de$\n*   **Calculation:** Evaluating this integral (using integration by parts) shows a direct relationship with the mean energy:\n    $\\ln Z_{GC} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^3}{45 (hc)^3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\beta \\langle E \\rangle$\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:**\n    Substituting this result into the entropy formula:\n    $S = k_B \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\beta\\langle E \\rangle + \\beta \\langle E \\rangle \\right) = \\frac{4}{3} k_B \\beta \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{4\\langle E \\rangle}{3T}$\n    Finally, substituting the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy ($\\langle E \\rangle$):**\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3} $$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy ($S$):**\n$$ S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3} $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $V$ is the volume.\n*   $T$ is the equilibrium temperature.\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $h$ is the Planck constant.\n*   $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (hc)^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 (hc)^3} = \\frac{4\\langle E \\rangle}{3T}$\n>>>"
