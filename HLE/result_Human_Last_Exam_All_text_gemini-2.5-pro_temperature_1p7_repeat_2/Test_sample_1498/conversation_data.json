    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific range of verses (in Arabic, *abyāt*; singular: *bayt*) in the poem *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam* where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, lists the names of the 25 prophets.\n\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** The poem is a summary of Islamic creed. One of its main sections deals with belief in the Prophets and Messengers (*rusul*). This section includes a part where the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are enumerated for memorization.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Verse:** Before the list begins, there is an introductory verse (typically numbered as Bayt 25) that states the obligation to know the names of these 25 prophets, but it does not name them. The verse is:\n    تَفصِيلُ خَمسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *\"The detailed knowledge of twenty-five is a must for every responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity.\"*\n    The actual enumeration of names starts in the verse immediately following this one. **Bayt 26** begins the list:\n    هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *\"They are Adam, Idris, Noah, Hud, along with Salih and Abraham, each to be followed.\"*\n    This is the first verse that mentions the names.\n\n4.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** The list continues sequentially in the subsequent verses:\n    *   **Bayt 27:** Mentions Lut (Lot), Isma'il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac), Ya'qub (Jacob), Yusuf (Joseph), and Ayyub (Job).\n    *   **Bayt 28:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun (Aaron), Musa (Moses), Al-Yasa' (Elisha), Dhul-Kifl, Dawud (David), and Sulayman (Solomon).\n\n5.  **Identify the Ending Verse:** The list of the 25 prophets concludes in the next verse, which is **Bayt 29**. This verse mentions the final names and concludes with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.\n    إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *\"Elias, Yunus (Jonah), Zakariyya (Zechariah), Yahya (John), 'Isa (Jesus), and Taha [Muhammad], the Seal, so abandon misguidance.\"*\n    This verse completes the list of 25 prophets.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The names of the prophets are mentioned starting from Bayt 26 and ending at Bayt 29.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** While the numbering from 26 to 29 is standard in most published editions of *'Aqeedat al-'Awaam*, minor variations can exist. However, the sequence and content of the verses remain consistent.\n*   **Introductory Verse:** It is important not to include Bayt 25 in the answer, as it states the *obligation* to know the names but does not list any of them. The question specifically asks for where the names are *mentioned*.\n*   **The Name 'Taha':** In Bayt 29, the name \"Taha\" (طه) is used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This is a common practice in classical Islamic literature, referencing the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n*   **Completeness:** This set of four verses (26, 27, 28, and 29) comprehensively lists all 25 prophets whose names are obligatory to know according to this creedal text.\n\n***\n\nThe names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from **Bayt 26** to **Bayt 29** in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam.\n\n<<<From Bayt 26 to Bayt 29>>>"
