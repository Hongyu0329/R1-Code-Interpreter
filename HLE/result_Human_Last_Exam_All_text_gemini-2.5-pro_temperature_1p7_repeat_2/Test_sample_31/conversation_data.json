    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Terminology**\n\n*   **Rubik's Cube & CFOP:** We are at the final stage of the CFOP solving method, called PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer).\n*   **PLL Goal:** At this stage, the top face (e.g., all yellow stickers) is already solved (this is called OLL - Orientation of the Last Layer). The goal of PLL is to permute the top layer's four corner pieces and four edge pieces into their correct positions without changing the orientation of the top face.\n*   **PLL Cases:** There are 21 distinct permutations (PLL cases), plus the already solved state.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers (i.e., the stickers on the side faces of the top layer) that one must look at to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL cases is present.\n*   **\"Must be seen\":** This implies the worst-case scenario. We are looking for the smallest number of sticker observations that is sufficient to distinguish any PLL case from all others, particularly the most similar ones.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Information Available**\n\n*   The last layer has 8 pieces: 4 corners and 4 edges.\n*   Each corner has 2 non-top stickers. (4 corners * 2 stickers/corner = 8 stickers)\n*   Each edge has 1 non-top sticker. (4 edges * 1 sticker/edge = 4 stickers)\n*   Total non-top-facing stickers on the last layer: 8 + 4 = 12.\n*   Seeing all 12 stickers would obviously be enough, but we want the *minimum*.\n\n**3. The Strategy: Finding the Hardest Cases to Distinguish**\n\nTo find the minimum number of stickers, we should look for the two PLL cases that are most similar to each other. The number of stickers required to tell these two specific cases apart will define the minimum number needed for the entire set. This is because any recognition system must be able to handle this \"worst-case\" ambiguity.\n\nMany PLL recognition systems rely on identifying patterns like \"blocks\" and \"headlights\":\n*   **Block:** An adjacent corner and edge piece on a side face have matching sticker colors. This requires looking at 2 stickers.\n*   **Headlights:** The two corner pieces on a side face have matching sticker colors. This requires looking at 2 stickers.\n\n**4. Identifying a \"Hard Pair\": Ab-perm and Gc-perm**\n\nLet's analyze two notoriously similar PLL cases: the **Ab-perm** and the **Gc-perm**. Using standard PLL recognition charts (like those from world-class speedcubers), we can see their similarities and differences.\n\n*   **Shared Feature:** Both the Ab-perm and the Gc-perm can be oriented to show a \"block\" on the Right face. To see this block, you need to observe the two stickers involved: the sticker on the right face of the front-right corner, and the sticker on the right face of the right edge.\n    *   *Stickers seen so far: 2*\n\n*   **Distinguishing Feature:** With the block identified on the Right face, the distinguishing information is now on the Back face.\n    *   The **Ab-perm** will have \"headlights\" on the Back face. This means the two corner stickers on the back face are the same color.\n    *   The **Gc-perm** will have a \"block\" on the Back face. This means the back edge sticker and one of its adjacent corner stickers on the back face are the same color.\n\n**5. Counting the Stickers Needed for the Hard Pair**\n\nTo tell the difference between \"headlights on the back\" and a \"block on the back,\" you must get a complete picture of the stickers on that face.\n\n*   Let's count the stickers on the back face's top layer:\n    1.  The sticker on the back face of the back-left corner.\n    2.  The sticker on the back face of the back-right corner.\n    3.  The sticker on the back face of the back edge.\n\n*   By observing these **3 stickers**, you can definitively tell if you have headlights (`corner1 == corner2`), a block (`corner1 == edge` or `corner2 == edge`), or neither. You cannot make this distinction with certainty by looking at only two of these three stickers.\n\n*   **Total Count:** To resolve the ambiguity between an Ab-perm and a Gc-perm, you must:\n    1.  Identify the common feature (the block on the Right face), which requires looking at **2 stickers**.\n    2.  Identify the distinguishing feature on the Back face, which requires looking at **3 stickers**.\n\n    The total minimum number of stickers that must be seen is 2 + 3 = **5**.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nSince we have found a pair of PLL cases that requires observing 5 distinct stickers to be told apart, any system that looks at only 4 stickers would fail in this worst-case scenario. Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify any PLL case is 5. While many cases can be identified with fewer stickers (e.g., by seeing a fully solved bar on one side), the system must be robust enough for all 21 cases."
