  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The primary objective is to calculate the maximum possible length (in characters) of a secret message hidden in the *Ching*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Secret Message's Alphabet:**\n    *   The problem states the message is \"written using the letters in the Shu\".\n    *   It specifies that the *Shu* uses \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   This means the alphabet from which the secret message is constructed consists of 120 unique characters. Let's call the alphabet size `A = 120`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Encoding Medium (The Ching):**\n    *   The message is encrypted using the symbols from the *Ching*.\n    *   The *Ching* contains a total of 9999 symbols. These are the building blocks for the encryption. Let's call the total number of available symbols `S_total = 9999`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Unique Encoding Symbols:**\n    *   The symbols in the *Ching* are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". To find out how many unique types of symbols we have, we must combine the possibilities for each part.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (e.g., water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The total number of unique symbol types is the product: `2 possibilities * 5 possibilities = 10 unique symbol types`.\n    *   This means our encoding system is effectively a base-10 system, where each position can be one of 10 different symbols.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Symbols Needed per Message Character:**\n    *   We need to assign a unique code to each of the `A = 120` characters in our alphabet, using combinations of the `N = 10` unique symbols from the Ching.\n    *   Let `k` be the number of Ching symbols used to represent one message character.\n    *   With `k` symbols, we can create `N^k` (or `10^k`) unique combinations.\n    *   We must find the smallest integer `k` such that the number of combinations is greater than or equal to the alphabet size: `10^k â‰¥ 120`.\n    *   Let's test values of `k`:\n        *   If `k = 1`, `10^1 = 10`. This is less than 120, so it's not enough.\n        *   If `k = 2`, `10^2 = 100`. This is still less than 120, so it's not enough.\n        *   If `k = 3`, `10^3 = 1000`. This is greater than 120, so it is sufficient to give each character a unique code.\n    *   Therefore, we need `k = 3` symbols from the *Ching* to encode each character of the secret message.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   We have a total of `S_total = 9999` symbols available in the *Ching*.\n    *   Each character of the message requires `k = 3` of these symbols.\n    *   The maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols divided by the number of symbols per character.\n    *   Max Length = `Total Symbols / Symbols per Character`\n    *   Max Length = `9999 / 3`\n    *   Max Length = `3333`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The details about computer vision recognition time (12 ms), integer/float operation times (10 ns, 30 ns), and the total number of characters in the *Shu* (around 3000) are irrelevant to the core calculation of message length. They are red herrings designed to complicate the problem. The critical piece of information from the *Shu* is the size of its alphabet (120 characters).\n*   **Encoding Scheme:** The analysis assumes a fixed-length encoding, where every character is represented by the same number of symbols (3). This is the standard approach for finding a guaranteed maximum length when no information about character frequency is given.\n*   **Discrete Units:** The number of symbols per character (`k`) must be an integer. You cannot use a fraction of a symbol, so we must take the ceiling of the logarithm (or test integer powers as done above). The final message length is also an integer, found by integer division or taking the floor.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is derived by dividing the total number of symbols available in the *Ching* (9999) by the number of symbols required to uniquely encode one character from the *Shu*'s alphabet (3).\n\n9999 / 3 = 3333\n\n<<<3333>>>"
