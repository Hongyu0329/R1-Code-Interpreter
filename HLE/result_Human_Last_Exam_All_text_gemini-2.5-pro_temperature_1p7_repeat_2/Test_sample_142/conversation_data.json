    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule and Count the Electrons\n\nThe molecular formula is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We first identify the atoms and count the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$).\n*   **Carbon (C):** 1 atom. Atomic number is 6, so it has 6 electrons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The formula contains $\\mathrm{H}_2$ and H, so there are 3 Hydrogen atoms in total. Each has 1 electron. Total from H = 3 electrons.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 1 atom. Atomic number is 14, so it has 14 electrons.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 1 atom. Atomic number is 9, so it has 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\n$N_{elec} = 6 (\\text{C}) + 3 \\times 1 (\\text{H}) + 14 (\\text{Si}) + 9 (\\text{F}) = 32$ electrons.\n\nSince the molecule has an even number of electrons, its ground state is a singlet state with total spin quantum number $S=0$. For a singlet state, the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_{\\alpha}$) must equal the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_{\\beta}$).\n$N_{\\alpha} + N_{\\beta} = 32$\n$N_{\\alpha} = N_{\\beta}$\nTherefore, $N_{\\alpha} = 16$ and $N_{\\beta} = 16$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Basis Set and Count the Basis Functions\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**. This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set with polarization functions. The `**` notation means that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms. For Pople basis sets, the polarization functions are typically one set of d-functions for heavy atoms and one set of p-functions for hydrogens. In most modern computational chemistry programs, a \"d-shell\" consists of 6 Cartesian d-functions, and a \"p-shell\" consists of 3 Cartesian p-functions. We will use this convention.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   6-31G describes the 1s orbital with two basis functions (one for the core region, one for the valence region). These are two s-type shells. (2 functions)\n    *   The second `*` adds one p-type shell (px, py, pz). (3 functions)\n    *   Total per H atom: 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row heavy atoms):**\n    *   6-31G provides 3 s-type shells and 2 p-type shells. (3*1 (s) + 2*3 (p) = 9 functions).\n    *   The first `*` adds one d-type shell (6 Cartesian d-functions). (6 functions)\n    *   Total per C or F atom: 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   6-31G provides 4 s-type shells and 3 p-type shells. (4*1 (s) + 3*3 (p) = 13 functions).\n    *   The first `*` adds one d-type shell (6 Cartesian d-functions). (6 functions)\n    *   Total per Si atom: 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of basis functions ($N_{basis}$) for the entire molecule. The number of molecular orbitals (MOs), denoted by $K$, is equal to the number of basis functions.\n$K = N_{basis} = (1 \\times N_C) + (3 \\times N_H) + (1 \\times N_{Si}) + (1 \\times N_F)$\n$K = (1 \\times 15) + (3 \\times 5) + (1 \\times 19) + (1 \\times 15)$\n$K = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$ molecular orbitals.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of CSFs\n\nA full CI calculation considers all possible electronic configurations. The number of CSFs for a state with total spin $S$, from distributing $N$ electrons in $K$ spatial orbitals, is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n$N_{CSF}(S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 - S} \\binom{K+1}{N/2 + S + 1}$\n\nWe are calculating this for the singlet ground state, so we use the following parameters:\n*   Number of spatial orbitals, $K = 64$\n*   Number of electrons, $N = 32$\n*   Total spin quantum number, $S = 0$\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{2(0)+1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{32/2 - 0} \\binom{64+1}{32/2 + 0 + 1}$\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Expression\n\nNow we compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16! (65-16)!} = \\frac{65!}{16! 49!} = 45,375,676,500,122,200$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17! (65-17)!} = \\frac{65!}{17! 48!} = 131,231,110,000,355,800$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of CSFs:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{1}{65} \\times (45,375,676,500,122,200) \\times (131,231,110,000,355,800)$\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\frac{5,955,681,467,406,982,468,305,786,103,600,000}{65}$\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = 91,625,868,729,338,191,820,088,923,136,000$\n\nIn scientific notation, this is approximately $9.16 \\times 10^{35}$.\n\n<<<91625868729338191820088923136000>>>"
