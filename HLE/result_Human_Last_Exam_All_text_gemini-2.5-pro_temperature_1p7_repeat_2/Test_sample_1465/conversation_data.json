    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Coiled-Coil Structure and Heptad Repeats**\nCoiled-coils consist of Î±-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These are typically hydrophobic residues. The residues at positions `e` and `g` are often charged and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Heptad Repeat Register**\nAll sequences are 28 amino acids long, which corresponds to exactly four heptad repeats (4 x 7 = 28). To determine the oligomeric state, we must first correctly assign the `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g` positions. The most crucial step is to place hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` core positions.\n\nLet's look for a repeating hydrophobic pattern. A common pattern involves a large hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine (I) or Leucine (L). In all the sequences, `I` appears at positions 2, 9, 16, and 23. This regular spacing strongly suggests `I` occupies a consistent position in the heptad repeat. Let's test the phasing where `I` is at the `a` position. This places the first residue, Glutamic acid (E), at the `g` position of the preceding heptad.\n\nRegister: `g a b c d e f`\nExample from Sequence 1 (`EIAQALK`):\n*   `g`: E\n*   `a`: I\n*   `b`: A\n*   `c`: Q\n*   `d`: A\n*   `e`: L\n*   `f`: K\n\nThis register consistently places hydrophobic residues at the `a` (Isoleucine) and `d` positions across all sequences, which is chemically sound. We will use this register for all sequences.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Sequence Based on its Core (`a`, `d`) Residues**\n\n*   **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   Heptads: `EIAQALK`, `EIAKALK`, `EIAWALK`, `EIAQALK`\n    *   Core pairs (`a`, `d`): (`I`, `A`), (`I`, `A`), (`I`, `A`), (`I`, `A`)\n    *   Analysis: The core is consistently `a=I`, `d=A`. According to established rules (from Harbury et al.), this combination strongly promotes the formation of a **trimer**.\n    *   **Predicted State: 3**\n\n*   **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   Heptads: `EIAALKQ`, `EIAALKK`, `ENAALKQ`, `EIAALKQ`\n    *   Core pairs (`a`, `d`): (`I`, `L`), (`I`, `L`), (`N`, `L`), (`I`, `L`)\n    *   Analysis: Three of the four core layers have the (`I`, `L`) pairing. The `a=I`, `d=L` combination is the canonical motif for a **dimer**. Although the single `a=N` (Asparagine) position often promotes trimerization, the strong preference of the other three layers for a dimer makes dimer the most likely overall state.\n    *   **Predicted State: 2**\n\n*   **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   Heptads: `EIAAIKQ`, `EIAAIKK`, `EIAAIKW`, `EIAAIKQ`\n    *   Core pairs (`a`, `d`): (`I`, `I`), (`I`, `I`), (`I`, `I`), (`I`, `I`)\n    *   Analysis: The core is consistently `a=I`, `d=I`. While computational scoring can give conflicting results, experimental studies on model peptides with this (`I`, `I`) core have shown that they form stable **trimers**.\n    *   **Predicted State: 3**\n\n*   **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   Heptads: `EIQKQLK`, `EIQKQLK`, `EIQWQLK`, `EIQKQLK`\n    *   Core pairs (`a`, `d`): (`I`, `Q`), (`I`, `Q`), (`I`, `Q`), (`I`, `Q`) (Note: In the 3rd heptad `EIQWQLK`, `d` is `Q`, not `W`).\n    *   Analysis: The core is consistently `a=I`, `d=Q`. A `d` position filled with the polar residue Glutamine (Q) is known to drive the formation of pentamers (5-helix bundles), as the polar sidechains can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network in the core. However, looking at the provided answer choices, pentamer is not a viable option if the first three predictions (3, 2, 3) are correct. Some studies have shown that a `d=Q` substitution in a trimeric coiled-coil can be tolerated, resulting in a trimer. Given the constraints of the multiple-choice options, a **trimer** is the only plausible answer.\n    *   **Predicted State: 3**\n\n*   **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   Heptads: `EIAQTLK`, `EIAKTLK`, `EIAWTLK`, `EIAQTLK`\n    *   Core pairs (`a`, `d`): (`I`, `T`), (`I`, `T`), (`I`, `T`), (`I`, `T`)\n    *   Analysis: The core is consistently `a=I`, `d=T`. The residue Threonine (T) is polar and beta-branched. A beta-branched residue at the `d` position is sterically unfavorable for dimers. While it can be found in some trimers, experimental studies on model peptides with `d=T` have shown a strong tendency to form **tetramers**. The four threonine sidechains can form a hydrogen-bonded cluster in the core of the 4-helix bundle.\n    *   **Predicted State: 4**\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the Predictions and Select the Answer**\nThe step-by-step analysis yields the following predicted oligomeric states for the five sequences:\n1.  **3** (Trimer)\n2.  **2** (Dimer)\n3.  **3** (Trimer)\n4.  **3** (Trimer)\n5.  **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThis sequence of numbers is **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
