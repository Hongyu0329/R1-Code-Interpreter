    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question describes a specific interpretation by \"Veronika Campan\" of \"HIS work.\" We need to identify \"HE.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues about \"HIS work\":**\n    *   **Clue A: \"at the end of HIS work, HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"** This strongly points to the Ten Commandments, specifically the final commandment (the 10th). This commandment is \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" It explicitly deals with desiring another person's possessions.\n    *   **Clue B: \"...the prohibition against representation.\"** This is a very clear reference to another of the Ten Commandments, the Second Commandment, which forbids the making of \"graven images\" or any representation of God.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues about the Work:** The work in question contains both the prohibition against making images and a final rule about not coveting material possessions. This work is the Decalogue, or the Ten Commandments.\n\n4.  **Identify \"HE\":** The central human figure associated with receiving and delivering the Ten Commandments in the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) is the prophet Moses. He received the laws from God on Mount Sinai. Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n5.  **Analyze the role of \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\":**\n    *   Veronika Campan is a real scholar who has written on the Bible, specifically focusing on the theme of representation and the figure of Moses.\n    *   Her interpretation, as described, is that Moses (or the text attributed to him) addresses the final commandment in a unique way.\n    *   **The key is this phrase: \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"** How is this done? The Second Commandment forbids *visual representation* of the divine (idols). The Tenth Commandment, however, creates a *verbal representation* by listing concrete, worldly, and imaginable things: a house, a wife, a servant, an ox, a donkey. By creating this vivid mental picture of desirable possessions, the text is engaging in a form of representation, which stands in contrast to the absolute prohibition against representing the divine earlier in the text. This is what is meant by \"naturally ignoring\" the earlier prohibition—it shifts from the divine to the material, where representation through language is natural and necessary.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on all the clues—the content of the work (Ten Commandments), the specific commandments mentioned (prohibition of representation and coveting material possessions), and the figure credited with delivering these laws—the person identified as \"HE\" is Moses. The question asks for his full name. In historical and biblical context, his single name is his full name.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
