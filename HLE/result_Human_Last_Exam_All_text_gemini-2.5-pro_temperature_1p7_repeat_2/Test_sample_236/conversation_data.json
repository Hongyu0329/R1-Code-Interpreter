    "This problem asks for the number of distinct homology cobordism classes of 3-manifolds that can be obtained by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant knots and surgeries\n\nThe homology cobordism group, denoted $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, consists of equivalence classes of integral homology 3-spheres. An integral surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$ results in an integral homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is $n = \\pm 1$. Thus, we need to consider the manifolds $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ for all knots $K$ with at most four crossings.\n\nThe knots with at most four crossings are:\n1.  **The unknot ($0_1$)**: This knot is amphichiral (equivalent to its mirror image).\n2.  **The trefoil knot ($3_1$)**: This knot is chiral. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil and the left-handed trefoil. Let's denote the left-handed trefoil by $3_1$ and its mirror, the right-handed trefoil, by $-3_1$.\n3.  **The figure-eight knot ($4_1$)**: This knot is amphichiral.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze surgeries on the unknot ($0_1$)\n\n*   Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot yield the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   $S^3$ represents the identity element (the trivial class) in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   This gives us **1 class**: the trivial class.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze surgeries on the trefoil knot ($3_1$ and its mirror $-3_1$)\n\nLet's use the standard convention where $3_1$ is the left-handed trefoil.\n*   **$S^3_{+1}(3_1)$**: This surgery results in the Brieskorn homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, also known as the Poincaré homology sphere. This manifold represents a class of order 2 in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, which generates the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$. Let's denote this class by $P$.\n*   **$S^3_{-1}(3_1)$**: This surgery results in $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, the orientation-reversed Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. This manifold is known to represent a class of infinite order in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$. Let's denote this class by $Q$.\n\nNow, we consider the mirror knot, the right-handed trefoil $-3_1$. The surgery manifold $S^3_n(-K)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-n}(K)$.\n*   **$S^3_{+1}(-3_1)$**: This is $-S^3_{-1}(3_1) = -(-\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = \\Sigma(2,3,7)$. Its class is $-Q$. Since $Q$ is of infinite order, $Q \\neq -Q$, so this is a new class.\n*   **$S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$**: This is $-S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Its class is $-P$. Since $P$ has order 2, we have $P = -P$, so this is the same class as the one from $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$.\n\nFrom the trefoil and its mirror, we have found three distinct non-trivial classes:\n1.  **$P = [\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$**: order 2.\n2.  **$Q = [-\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$**: infinite order.\n3.  **$-Q = [\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$**: infinite order, inverse of $Q$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze surgeries on the figure-eight knot ($4_1$)\n\nThe figure-eight knot is amphichiral. This implies that $S^3_n(4_1)$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-n}(4_1)$.\n*   **$S^3_{+1}(4_1)$**: Let's call this manifold $Y_+$. It is known to have infinite order in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$. Let its class be $R = [Y_+]$.\n*   **$S^3_{-1}(4_1)$**: Let's call this manifold $Y_-$. Its class is $S = [Y_-]$.\n*   The amphichirality implies $[Y_+] = -[Y_-]$, so $R = -S$. Since $R$ has infinite order, $R \\neq -R$, so these are two distinct classes.\n\n### Step 5: Distinguish all generated classes\n\nSo far, our list of candidate classes is: $[S^3], P, Q, -Q, R, S$. We need to ensure there are no further equalities between them. We use homology cobordism invariants for this.\n\n*   **Order**: $[S^3]$ has order 1. $P$ has order 2. $Q, -Q, R, S$ all have infinite order. This distinguishes $[S^3]$ and $P$ from all others and each other.\n*   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: The Casson invariant distinguishes $Q$ from $-Q$ and $R$ from $S$. We can compute:\n    *   $\\lambda(Q) = \\lambda(-\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(-Q) = \\lambda(\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(R) = \\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = 1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S) = \\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = -1$.\n*   This shows that the pairs $(Q,S)$ and $(-Q,R)$ cannot be distinguished by the Casson invariant alone. We need a finer invariant.\n*   **Heegaard Floer $d$-invariants**: These are rational-valued homology cobordism invariants. For a homology sphere $M$, they form a set of values $\\{d(M, \\mathfrak{s})\\}$ over all spin-c structures $\\mathfrak{s}$.\n    *   For surgeries on the trefoil: The set of $d$-invariants for $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ is $\\{0, -2\\}$. For $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, it is $\\{0, 2\\}$.\n    *   For surgeries on the figure-eight knot: The set of $d$-invariants for both $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is $\\{0\\}$.\n*   Since the sets of $d$-invariants are different, we can conclude that the classes from the trefoil surgeries are distinct from the classes from the figure-eight surgeries. Specifically:\n    *   $R \\neq -Q$ because $d(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = \\{0\\}$ while $d(\\Sigma(2,3,7))=\\{0,-2\\}$.\n    *   $S \\neq Q$ because $d(S^3_{-1}(4_1)) = \\{0\\}$ while $d(-\\Sigma(2,3,7))=\\{0,2\\}$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Count\n\nLet's list the distinct classes we have found:\n1.  **The trivial class**, $[S^3]$, from surgery on the unknot.\n2.  **The Poincaré sphere class**, $[\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$, from surgery on the trefoil.\n3.  The class $[-\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$, from surgery on the trefoil.\n4.  The class $[\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$, from surgery on the mirror of the trefoil.\n5.  The class $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$, from surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n6.  The class $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$, from surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n\nThese are $1+2+1+2=6$ classes in total, where for the trefoil we have $1$ class of order 2 and 2 of infinite order, and for the figure-eight we have 2 of infinite order.\n\nTotal number of distinct elements is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
