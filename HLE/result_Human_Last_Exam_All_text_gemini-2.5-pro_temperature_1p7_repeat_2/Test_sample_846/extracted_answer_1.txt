The picnic table must change its shape. Specifically, at sunrise, it should bend or contract from a straight, elongated form (*trans* isomer) into a bent, V-shape (*cis* isomer) in response to the sun's UV light. At sunset, as the light disappears, it must relax back to its original straight, elongated form.
