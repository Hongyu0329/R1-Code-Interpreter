    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the initial sequence**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern (arithmetic or geometric)**\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (Differences):** Let's find the difference between consecutive terms.\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not follow a simple pattern.\n*   **Geometric Progression (Ratios):** Let's find the ratio between consecutive terms.\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09\n    The ratios are not constant.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex recurrence relationship**\nLet's try to find a pattern of the form `a_n = k * a_{n-1} + C` or `a_n = k * a_{n-1} - C`, where `a_n` is the n-th term in the sequence. This is a common pattern in these types of puzzles.\n\n*   **Test with k=2:** `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} +/- ...`\n    *   `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n    *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n    The added numbers are 7, 1, 5, 17. It is difficult to find a simple rule for this sequence of added numbers.\n\n*   **Test with k=3:** `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} +/- ...`\n    *   `11 = 3 * 2 + 5`\n    *   `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`\n    *   `51 = 3 * 23 - 18` (since 3 * 23 = 69, and 69 - 18 = 51)\n    *   `119 = 3 * 51 - 34` (since 3 * 51 = 153, and 153 - 34 = 119)\n    This pattern seems much more consistent, especially from the third term onwards. Let's analyze the numbers that are being subtracted.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pattern of the subtracted numbers**\nThe rule, starting from the third term, is `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - k_n`. The sequence of subtracted numbers `k` is:\n*   `k_3 = 10`\n*   `k_4 = 18`\n*   `k_5 = 34`\n\nLet's find the pattern in this new sequence `k = (10, 18, 34, ...)`:\n*   **Find the differences:**\n    *   18 - 10 = 8\n    *   34 - 18 = 16\n*   **Analyze the differences:** The differences themselves (8, 16) are in a geometric progression, with the common ratio being 2 (each difference is twice the previous one). The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next terms and find the final answer**\n*   The next term in the `k` sequence (`k_6`) will be the previous term plus the next difference: `k_6 = 34 + 32 = 66`.\n*   Now we can find the missing term in the original sequence (`a_6`) using the rule we discovered: `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - k_6`.\n*   Substitute the values: `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`.\n*   Calculate the result:\n    *   `3 * 119 = 357`\n    *   `357 - 66 = 291`\n\nThe missing number in the parentheses is 291. This matches option A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Not all sequences follow simple arithmetic or geometric progressions. It's often necessary to check for combined operations (multiplication and addition/subtraction).\n*   Sometimes a pattern doesn't apply to the entire sequence. In this case, the `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - k_n` rule holds consistently from the 3rd term on. The first two terms can be seen as the starting point.\n*   When you find a secondary sequence (like our `k` sequence), you must analyze it carefully to confirm its pattern. Here, we found a simple geometric progression in its differences, which is a strong indicator of a valid pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
