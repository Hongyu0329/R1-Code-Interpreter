    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the statement and define the key terms.**\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS (or Polygenic Risk Score, PRS) is a single numerical score that summarizes an individual's estimated genetic predisposition for a specific trait or disease. It is calculated by summing up the number of risk alleles an individual carries, with each allele's contribution weighted by its effect size. These effect sizes are typically estimated from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (measured by variance explained, R²):** This quantifies how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype (e.g., height, disease status) in a new, independent set of individuals (a \"target\" or \"testing\" sample). It is measured by the R-squared (R²) value from a statistical model where the phenotype is the outcome and the PGS is the predictor. A higher R² means the PGS explains more of the variation in the trait.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype that can be attributed to the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It is a theoretical, population-level parameter that represents the *upper limit* of prediction accuracy achievable using a linear model of these SNPs. It is often estimated using methods like LD Score Regression (LDSC) or GCTA-GREML.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability.**\n\nThink of SNP heritability as the total amount of \"signal\" (phenotypic variance) that is theoretically available to be captured by the SNPs. The polygenic score is our practical attempt to capture that signal using data from a GWAS.\n\nThe core of the question is whether the amount of signal we *actually capture* with a PGS (its R²) is always less than the total signal that is *theoretically available* (the h²_SNP).\n\n**Step 3: Identify the factors that limit the predictive ability of a PGS.**\n\nA PGS will struggle to achieve the theoretical maximum prediction accuracy for several critical reasons:\n\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The effect sizes used to build the PGS are *estimates* from a discovery GWAS with a finite number of participants. This means every effect size has some estimation error. These noisy weights degrade the performance of the PGS. As the GWAS sample size increases, the estimates get more precise, and the PGS gets better, but for any finite sample, there will be error.\n2.  **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** Genes and SNPs are inherited in blocks (LD blocks). A SNP associated with a trait in a GWAS might not be the true causal SNP but is simply correlated with it. The statistical methods used to build a PGS (like clumping and thresholding, or more advanced Bayesian methods) are imperfect at disentangling these complex correlations and correctly assigning weights. This leads to a loss of predictive power.\n3.  **Differences between Discovery and Target Populations:** If the GWAS (discovery) and the prediction (target) cohorts have different genetic ancestries, the allele frequencies and LD patterns can differ. A PGS built in one population will almost always perform worse in another.\n4.  **Assumptions of the Model:** PGS and h²_SNP models typically assume a simple additive genetic architecture. While this is a powerful approximation, other genetic effects (dominance, epistasis) exist, and the models are not designed to capture them.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the analysis and conclude.**\n\nThe SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents a theoretical ceiling. It's the variance explained if we had perfect knowledge of the true effect size of every single SNP and combined them in a perfect linear model.\n\nA polygenic score is a real-world tool built with imperfect information. Its key ingredients—the SNP effect sizes—are estimated with error from finite GWAS samples. This unavoidable estimation error means that the resulting PGS will be a \"noisier\" version of the true, perfect genetic score. When this noisy PGS is used for prediction, it will necessarily explain less variance than the perfect score would.\n\nTherefore, the predictive R² of any practically constructed PGS will be lower than the SNP heritability. The gap between the two can be reduced by using larger GWAS discovery samples, better statistical methods, and well-matched target populations, but it can never be fully closed in practice. The theoretical scenario where PGS R² equals h²_SNP would require an infinitely large discovery GWAS, which is impossible.\n\nThus, the statement that the predictive ability is **necessarily lower** is correct in any real-world application or context.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
