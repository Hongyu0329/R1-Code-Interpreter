    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the components of the question: \"Let $S$ be a schema containing $4$ unary predicates. What is the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$?\"\n\n*   **Schema $S$**: The schema $S$ contains the non-logical symbols that can be used in our formulas. In this case, $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them by $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This denotes a specific fragment of First-Order (FO) logic.\n    *   The formulas are built using only the predicates from schema $S$.\n    *   The allowed logical connectives are conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), and false ($\\bot$). Disjunction ($\\lor$) and negation ($\\neg$) are not allowed.\n    *   The only allowed quantifier is the existential quantifier ($\\exists$). The universal quantifier ($\\forall$) is not allowed.\n*   **VC Dimension**: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the complexity of a class of functions used for classification. In this context, the classifiers are the logical formulas, and they classify elements of a model's domain.\n\nThe question asks for the VC dimension of the concept class defined by this logic fragment over the given schema. A concept is a set of elements defined by a formula with one free variable.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Concept Class\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in the language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n1.  **Atomic Formulas**: The basic building blocks are atomic formulas. Since the schema only has unary predicates, an atomic formula with variable $x$ must be of the form $P_i(x)$ for some $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n2.  **Conjunction**: We can combine formulas using $\\land$. So, we can form formulas like $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n3.  **Existential Quantification**: We can use $\\exists$ to quantify variables other than $x$. For example, $\\exists y (P_2(y) \\land P_4(y))$. This is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). Its truth value is fixed for a given model (it's true if there exists an element satisfying both $P_2$ and $P_4$, and false otherwise).\n4.  **General Form**: Any formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic is a conjunction of simpler formulas. These simpler formulas can either involve the free variable $x$ or be sentences. Due to the properties of quantifiers and conjunction, any formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to a formula of the form:\n    $$ \\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) \\land C $$\n    where $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $C$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables) from the logic.\n\nNow, consider a model (or structure) $M$ with domain $A$ and interpretations $P_i^M \\subseteq A$ for the predicates. A formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a concept, which is the set of elements $a \\in A$ for which $\\phi(a)$ is true in $M$.\n\n*   If the sentence part $C$ is false in the model $M$, then the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for every element $a \\in A$. The concept defined is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If the sentence part $C$ is true in the model $M$, the formula is true for an element $a$ if and only if $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a)$ is true. The concept defined is the set of elements that satisfy all predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in I$. This is the intersection of the interpretations: $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nThis means that for any given model $M$, any formula in our logic can only define concepts that are either the empty set or an intersection of some of the base predicate sets $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$. Such an intersection is called a **monomial**. Our concept class is the class of concepts definable by monomials over 4 predicates.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the VC Dimension of Monomials\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the class of monomials over $k=4$ predicates. Let the number of predicates be $k$.\n\n*   **Definition of VC dimension**: The VC dimension of a concept class is the maximum size $d$ of a set of points $X$ that can be **shattered**. A set $X$ is shattered if, for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there is a concept in the class that corresponds exactly to $Y$.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC dimension $\\ge k$):**\nWe need to show that a set of size $k$ can be shattered. For $k=4$, we must show we can shatter a set of 4 points.\nLet $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to construct a model $M$ where we can realize all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$. Let the domain of $M$ be $X$. We define the interpretations of the predicates as follows:\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, let $P_i^M = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$.\n\nNow, let $Y$ be any subset of $X$. We need to find a monomial that defines exactly $Y$.\nLet $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. Consider the concept formed by the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M$.\nAn element $x_j$ belongs to this intersection if and only if $x_j \\in P_i^M$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\nBy our definition of $P_i^M$, this means $x_j \\neq x_i$ for all $i \\in I_Y$.\nThis is equivalent to saying that the index $j$ is not in $I_Y$, which by definition of $I_Y$ means $x_j \\in Y$.\nSo, $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M = Y$.\nSince we can construct a monomial for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC dimension $\\le k$):**\nWe need to show that no set of size $k+1$ can be shattered. For $k=4$, we must show we cannot shatter any set of 5 points.\nLet $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points.\nIn any model $M$, the concepts we can use to form subsets of $X$ are of the form $C \\cap X$, where $C$ is a concept definable in $M$. As established, these concepts $C$ are either $\\emptyset$ or a monomial $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\nSo, the subsets of $X$ we can possibly form are of the form $(\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M) \\cap X$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, plus the empty set.\n\nThe number of different index sets $I$ is $2^k = 2^4 = 16$. This means we can form at most 16 different monomials. Including the empty set (which might already be definable as a monomial), the total number of distinct concepts we can define is at most $16 + 1 = 17$.\nTo shatter the set $X$ of size 5, we would need to be able to generate all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets.\nSince the number of available concepts (at most 17) is less than the required number of subsets (32), it is impossible to shatter a set of size 5.\nThis holds for any choice of model $M$. Therefore, the VC dimension is less than 5.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds:\n*   We have shown VC dim $\\ge 4$.\n*   We have shown VC dim $< 5$.\n\nSince the VC dimension must be an integer, the only possibility is that the VC dimension is 4.\n\nThe number of unary predicates in the schema determines the VC dimension of this specific logical fragment. For $k$ unary predicates, the VC dimension is $k$. In this problem, $k=4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
