    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core question is to identify the specific US city where the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Entities**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n*   **Information to find:** The name of the US city.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Film's Plot and Characters**\n*   The protagonist of *Ovosodo* is Piero Mansani. Tommaso is his best and oldest friend.\n*   The film contrasts the two friends' life paths. Piero is the \"ovosodo\" (hard-boiled egg) who remains rooted in his working-class life in Livorno, Italy.\n*   Tommaso comes from a wealthy family but is rebellious and dreams of escaping his provincial life. He is passionate about music.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Specific Plot Point**\n*   In the narrative, Tommaso grows disillusioned with his life and family expectations in Livorno.\n*   He decides to leave Italy to pursue his dream of becoming a musician.\n*   His chosen destination is in the United States, a city known for its vibrant arts and music scene, which serves as a symbolic break from his past.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the City**\n*   By examining plot summaries and analyses of the film, we can confirm that Tommaso moves to **New York City**. This move is a pivotal moment that highlights the divergence between his life and Piero's.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important not to confuse the main character, Piero, with his friend, Tommaso. Piero is the one who stays in Livorno, while Tommaso is the one who leaves for the US.\n*   The actor's name, Marco Cocci, correctly identifies the character in question.\n*   The film's title, *Ovosodo*, is a reference to a neighborhood in Livorno and the personality of the protagonist, adding context to why Tommaso's move is so significant.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
