    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 paper on Brownian motion. This requires a few key pieces of information:\n1.  **The specific paper:** Einstein published several groundbreaking papers in 1905. We need to focus only on the one about Brownian motion, officially titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n2.  **The nature of the citation:** We need to find a reference or acknowledgment within that paper.\n3.  **The source of the citation:** The question specifies that the source being cited is someone's \"lectures.\"\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Citation Practices of the Time\nScientific papers from the early 20th century, especially those by Einstein, did not follow the strict, modern format of a bibliography or reference list. His famous 1905 paper on special relativity, for example, contains no citations at all. Therefore, we should not expect a formal citation list. Any reference would likely be mentioned within the text itself.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate the Theoretical Foundations of Einstein's Paper\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion was intended to provide evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules by showing how their random motion could explain the observable jiggling of larger particles (like pollen in water). The entire work is built upon the **molecular-kinetic theory of heat**, also known as statistical mechanics.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the Key Figure behind the Theory\nThe principal architect of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat during that era was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. His work established the statistical foundations that explained thermodynamic properties in terms of the behavior of vast numbers of atoms and molecules.\n\n### Step 5: Connect the Figure to the \"Lectures\"\nWhile Einstein developed many of his statistical arguments independently, he was familiar with Boltzmann's work. Boltzmann's most important and comprehensive work on this subject was a two-volume book published in 1896 and 1898. The title of this foundational text is ***Vorlesungen über Gastheorie***, which translates directly to ***Lectures on Gas Theory***. This book was a compilation and refinement of the lectures he gave on the topic.\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the Analysis\nAlthough Einstein did not include a formal footnote or bibliographic entry citing Boltzmann in his Brownian motion paper, the entire paper is a direct application and verification of the theory that Boltzmann had laid out in his *Lectures on Gas Theory*. By basing his work on the \"molecular-kinetic theory of heat,\" Einstein was implicitly and conceptually citing the ideas presented in Boltzmann's seminal lectures. Therefore, Ludwig Boltzmann is the person whose lectures are considered to have been cited.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
