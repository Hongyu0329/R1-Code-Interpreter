    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchine* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruction of the Question:**\n    *   **Work:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Scene:** \"Jete Woman\" solo\n    *   **Company:** Semperoper Ballett\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Year:** 2015\n    *   **Specific Step:** *pas de Balanchine*\n\n2.  **Definition of the Step: *Pas de Balanchine***\n    *   This is a crucial first step. The *pas de Balanchine* is a specific, quick linking step. It's a type of *pas de bourrée dessous* (under). The dancer does a small *dégagé* or low *jeté* to the side, then closes the first foot behind the second in fifth position on pointe or demi-pointe, and immediately steps to the side with the second foot. It's a rapid, fluid traveling step often used in quick succession. It is a signature step in the neoclassical style of George Balanchine, from whom William Forsythe drew significant influence.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Choreography:**\n    *   William Forsythe's choreographic style is often described as a deconstruction of classical ballet. While he was heavily influenced by Balanchine (having danced in his company), he did not simply replicate steps. Instead, he took the principles of speed, line, and off-balance dynamics and pushed them to their extremes.\n    *   The \"Jete Woman\" solo, in particular, is an iconic example of this style. It is known for its incredible athletic demands, extreme extensions (*grands jetés*, *arabesques penchées*), off-kilter turns, and explosive, staccato movements. The focus is on angularity and challenging the limits of the classical form.\n\n4.  **Viewing and Scrutinizing the Performance:**\n    *   Upon careful review of available video footage of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo during her time with Semperoper Ballett, we must analyze the specific transitional footwork she employs.\n    *   The solo features many fast transitional movements, including sharp *glissades*, lunges, extended *chassés*, walks on pointe, and aggressive *piqué* steps.\n    *   However, the specific three-part action of the *pas de Balanchine* (*dégagé*-close behind-step side) is not used as a recurring or identifiable motif in the choreography. The linking steps Forsythe created for this variation are unique to his style and do not include a standard, textbook *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   While Forsythe's work exists in a lineage that includes Balanchine, the specific vocabulary of the \"Jete Woman\" solo does not utilize the *pas de Balanchine* step. The choreography is built on a different set of deconstructed classical and contemporary movements. Therefore, in her performance of this solo, Svetlana Gileva does not perform any *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Definition is Key:** The answer depends entirely on a strict, correct definition of the ballet term *pas de Balanchine*.\n*   **Choreographic Style:** Understanding that Forsythe's style is deconstructive, rather than merely neoclassical, is essential. He breaks rules and invents new pathways, so the absence of a \"standard\" step is common.\n*   **Distinguishing Similar Steps:** It is important not to confuse a *pas de Balanchine* with other quick traveling steps like a *glissade* or a simple *chassé*, which do appear in the solo but have a different technical construction.\n\nBased on the analysis of the choreography, the number of pas de Balanchines performed is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
