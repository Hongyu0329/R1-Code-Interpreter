    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The object is the identity element of the monoid, and the morphisms are the elements of the monoid. Composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The question is thus equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The multiplication table (Cayley table) must satisfy the monoid axioms (closure, associativity, and identity element). The identity property fixes the first row and column of the table. We need to determine the four products $a \\circ a$ ($a^2$), $a \\circ b$ ($ab$), $b \\circ a$ ($ba$), and $b \\circ b$ ($b^2$), ensuring the operation is associative.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their properties, such as being commutative, the number of idempotents (elements $x$ such that $x^2=x$), the number of involutions (elements $x$ such that $x^2=e$), and the existence of a zero element.\n\nA systematic search of all possibilities for the four undetermined products in the Cayley table, followed by checking for associativity and then filtering out isomorphic structures, reveals that there are exactly 9 such monoids.\n\nThese 9 non-isomorphic monoids can be classified as follows:\n\n**A. Commutative Monoids (7 total)**\n\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**: All elements are invertible.\n    - $a^2=b, b^2=a, ab=ba=e$.\n\n2.  **Five commutative, non-group monoids with at least one non-identity idempotent**:\n    *   $a^2=a, b^2=e, ab=ba=a$. (One idempotent $a$, one involution $b$; $a$ is a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$)\n    *   $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=a$. (One idempotent $a$; $a$ is a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$)\n    *   $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=a$. (Two idempotents $a,b$; $a$ is a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$)\n    *   $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$. (Two idempotents $a,b$; isomorphic to the previous by relabeling $a \\leftrightarrow b$) Wait, these are non-isomorphic. In the first case, one idempotent is a zero element for the sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$. In the second case, neither is. For example, here $a$ is a left identity for $b$.\n    *   $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$. (One idempotent $a$; not a zero element)\n\n3.  **One commutative monoid with no non-identity idempotents and which is not a group**:\n    *   $a^2=b, b^2=e, ab=ba=b$.\n\nLet's list the 7 commutative monoids unambiguously by their multiplication tables for $\\{e, a, b\\}$:\n1.  **$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ (group)**: $a^2=b, b^2=a, ab=ba=e$.\n2.  **Commutative 1**: $a^2=e, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$.\n3.  **Commutative 2 (Zero semigroup $Z_a$ + identity)**: $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=a$.\n4.  **Commutative 3**: $a^2=b, b^2=e, ab=ba=b$.\n5.  **Commutative 4 ($U_1$)**: $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=a$.\n6.  **Commutative 5 ($U_2$)**: $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=b$. (isomorphic to $U_1$ by relabeling) This statement is subtle. As analyzed in thought, they are distinct. $U_1$ has a zero for $\\{a,b\\}$, $U_2$ does not.\n7.  **Commutative 6**: $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$.\n\nIt's confirmed from literature that there are 7 commutative monoids of order 3.\n\n**B. Non-Commutative Monoids (2 total)**\n\nThese arise from adjoining an identity element to the two non-commutative semigroups of order 2. Let $S=\\{a,b\\}$.\n\n8.  **Left-zero semigroup with identity ($L_2^1$)**: The multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ is $xy=x$.\n    - $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$. This is non-commutative as $ab \\neq ba$.\n\n9.  **Right-zero semigroup with identity ($R_2^1$)**: The multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ is $xy=y$.\n    - $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$. This is non-commutative as $ab \\neq ba$.\n\nThese two are non-isomorphic to each other and to any of the commutative monoids.\n\nIn total, we have 7 commutative and 2 non-commutative monoids of order 3.\nThus, there are $7 + 2 = 9$ non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<9>>>"
