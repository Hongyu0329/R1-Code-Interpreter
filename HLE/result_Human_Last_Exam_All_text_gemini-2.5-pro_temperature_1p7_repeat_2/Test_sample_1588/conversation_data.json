    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n    The BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The formula is a series in terms of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n    $Z = X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y] + \\frac{1}{12}([X, [X, Y]] + [Y, [Y, X]]) + \\dots$\n    This can be written as a sum of homogeneous terms:\n    $Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n    where $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree $n$. The degree of a term is the total count of $X$'s and $Y$'s within it. The question asks for the number of non-zero coefficients in the term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n2.  **Relating BCH Terms to Free Lie Algebras**\n    The terms $Z_n(X, Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by the symbols $X$ and $Y$. Let's denote this algebra as $\\mathcal{L}(X, Y)$. This algebra can be decomposed into subspaces of homogeneous elements of degree $n$, denoted $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$. So, $Z_n(X, Y) \\in \\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$.\n\n3.  **Finding the Number of Independent Terms**\n    To count the number of coefficients, we need to express $Z_{10}(X, Y)$ in a basis for the vector space $\\mathcal{L}_{10}(X, Y)$. The number of coefficients corresponds to the number of basis elements needed to represent $Z_{10}(X, Y)$. A crucial result in the theory of free Lie algebras is that for any standard basis (like the Hall basis, which is constructed from Lyndon words), the component of $Z_n(X, Y)$ along each basis vector is non-zero for $n>1$.\n    Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients in $Z_{10}(X, Y)$ is equal to the dimension of the space $\\mathcal{L}_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n4.  **Using Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n    The dimension of $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$, the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$ on two generators ($X$ and $Y$), is given by Witt's formula for the number of Lyndon words of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $k$.\n    The formula is:\n    $\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{L}_n) = L_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n    -   $n$ is the degree (order), so $n=10$.\n    -   $k$ is the number of generators (the size of the alphabet), so $k=2$ (for $X$ and $Y$).\n    -   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n    -   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n5.  **Applying Witt's Formula for n=10 and k=2**\n    We need to calculate $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n\n    *   **Identify the divisors of n=10:** The divisors are $d = 1, 2, 5, 10$.\n\n    *   **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n        -   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n        -   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime factor)\n        -   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime factor)\n        -   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = \\mu(2) \\mu(5) = (-1)(-1) = 1$ (since 10 is the product of two distinct primes)\n\n    *   **Calculate each term in the sum:**\n        -   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n        -   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n        -   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n        -   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n    *   **Sum the terms:**\n        Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$\n\n    *   **Complete the calculation for $L_2(10)$:**\n        $L_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 990 = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 on two generators, which is calculated using Witt's formula to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
