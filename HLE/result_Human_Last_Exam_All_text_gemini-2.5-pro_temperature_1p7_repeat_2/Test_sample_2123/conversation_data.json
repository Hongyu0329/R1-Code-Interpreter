    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the surname of the English poet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The core clues are:\n    *   A Russian literary work (an essay, or a work containing an essayistic description).\n    *   The subject is the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   A description within this work uses the surname of an English poet.\n    *   The goal is to name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify the setting:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" almost certainly refers to the famous Ringstrasse (Ring Road), the grand circular boulevard that encircles the city's historic center.\n\n3.  **Search for the literary source:** The task is to find a well-known Russian text that links the Vienna Ringstrasse with an English poet. The most famous reference of this kind comes from the acclaimed Russian poet and essayist **Osip Mandelstam**.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the specific work and quotation:** The reference is located in Mandelstam's essay **\"Journey to Armenia\"** (\"Путешествие в Армению\"), written in 1931-1932. In this work, while reflecting on European culture, he describes the Viennese Ringstrasse with a striking metaphor.\n\n5.  **Analyze the key phrase:** The Russian sentence reads:\n    > \"Венский 'Ринг' - бульвар, закругленный, как подкова счастья, и обитый **байроновским** панбархатом воздуха...\"\n\n    Translated, this means:\n    > \"The Viennese 'Ring' is a boulevard, curved like a horseshoe of happiness, and upholstered with the **Byronic** crushed velvet of the air...\"\n\n6.  **Extract the surname:** The key word is **\"байроновским\" (bayronovskim)**. This is the adjectival form in Russian, meaning \"of Byron\" or \"Byronic.\" It is derived directly from the surname of the English Romantic poet, Lord **Byron**.\n\n7.  **Final verification:** Lord Byron was a famous English poet, so he fits the description perfectly. His name is used here to evoke a sense of romantic grandeur, luxury, and moody atmosphere, which Mandelstam associated with both the poet and the Viennese boulevard.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The source text:** The question is very specific, pointing to a literary source rather than a common expression. Identifying Mandelstam's \"Journey to Armenia\" is the critical step.\n*   **The Russian adjective:** The answer isn't in the text verbatim as a surname but as an adjective (\"байроновским\"). One must recognize that this is derived from a proper noun.\n*   **Transliteration and Original Name:** The Russian \"Байрон\" transliterates back to the English \"Byron.\"\n*   **The \"translation\" wording:** The phrase \"in the Russian translation of a certain essay\" might be slightly misleading. Mandelstam's essay was written in Russian. The \"translation\" here refers to the linguistic process of adapting the English name \"Byron\" into the Russian language to be used in the text.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the poet's surname.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
