    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Decipher the Title and the Core Question**\nThe title of the haiku is \"The Bays\". The instructions state that \"The title is a question\". \"The Bays\" is a homophone, which sounds identical to \"The B's\". Therefore, the question being asked by the riddle is, \"What are the B's?\". The haiku's lines will provide the clues to identify three words that start with the letter 'B'.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Line: \"An August tempest\"**\n*   **Careful Point:** This line links a time of year (August) with a type of storm (tempest). We need to find a 'B' word that connects these ideas.\n*   **Analysis:** Shakespeare's play, *The Tempest*, is famously believed to have been inspired by the 1609 shipwreck of the Sea Venture, which was caught in a hurricane near **Bermuda**. Bermuda is notorious for its stormy weather, especially during the Atlantic hurricane season which includes August. Therefore, the first 'B' is **Bermuda**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Line: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n*   **Careful Point:** This line involves a calculation and a metaphorical phrase. \"Twice fifteen\" needs to be calculated, and \"winds of change\" suggests a system or scale related to wind.\n*   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15 = 30`. This number is significant in the context of wind measurement. A wind speed of 30 knots falls within Force 7 on the **Beaufort** scale. The scale itself represents \"winds of change\" as it describes the changing force and effect of the wind. Thus, the second 'B' is **Beaufort**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Third Line: \"A divine one yields\"**\n*   **Careful Point:** This line points towards mythology or a god-like figure (\"divine one\") that produces or is associated with the theme of wind and storms (\"yields\").\n*   **Analysis:** In Greek mythology, **Boreas** is the god of the north wind, often depicted as a powerful and tempestuous deity. He is a \"divine one\" who \"yields\" (produces or unleashes) a strong, cold wind. This fits the clue perfectly. The third 'B' is **Boreas**.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate and Order the Final Answer**\n*   **Careful Point:** The question asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\".\n*   **Analysis:** We have identified the three 'B's: Bermuda, Beaufort, and Boreas.\n    Placing them in alphabetical order, we get:\n    1.  Beaufort\n    2.  Bermuda\n    3.  Boreas\n\nThe final answer is the alphabetized list of these three words.\n\n<<<Beaufort, Bermuda, Boreas>>>"
