    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the relationship between three concepts: the \"maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\", the \"covolume ($V$)\", and \"squarefree natural numbers ($N$)\". This problem lies in the mathematical field known as the Geometry of Numbers, which studies lattices and their geometric properties.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Mathematical Setting**: The mention of \"squarefree natural numbers (N)\" points to the context of algebraic number theory, specifically real quadratic fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. Ideals in the ring of integers of such fields can be represented as 2-dimensional lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. However, the core of the problem is about the properties of any 2-dimensional lattice, regardless of its origin.\n2.  **Interpretation of Covolume ($V$)**: In the geometry of numbers, the covolume of a lattice $\\Lambda$ is the volume of its fundamental domain (the volume of the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\Lambda$). For a 2D lattice generated by vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$, the covolume is the area of the parallelogram they span, given by $V = |\\det(v_1, v_2)|$.\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Maximum Norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**: This is the most crucial interpretation. The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ and the context strongly suggest the infinity norm (or max norm), defined for a vector $x=(x_1, x_2)$ as $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} = \\max(|x_1|, |x_2|)$. The question asks for \"the upper bound for the maximum norm\". In lattice theory, this refers to finding an upper bound on the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, measured using this specific norm. We denote this quantity as $\\lambda_{1, \\infty} = \\min_{x \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|x\\|_{\\infty}$. We will assume $k_{k,\\infty} = \\lambda_{1, \\infty}$.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Derivation**\n\nThe problem is to find an upper bound for $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$ in terms of the covolume $V$ for a 2-dimensional lattice $\\Lambda$. The primary tool for this is **Minkowski's First Theorem on Convex Bodies**.\n\n**Step 1: State Minkowski's Theorem**\nLet $\\Lambda$ be a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V = \\det(\\Lambda)$. Let $C$ be a convex, centrally symmetric set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. If the volume of $C$ satisfies $\\text{vol}(C) \\ge 2^n V$, then $C$ must contain at least one non-zero lattice point from $\\Lambda$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Theorem to Our Specific Problem**\n*   **Dimension ($n$)**: We are in dimension $n=2$, as the lattices come from real quadratic fields embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Lattice ($\\Lambda$)**: We have a 2-dimensional lattice $\\Lambda$ with a given covolume (area) $V$.\n*   **Convex Body ($C$)**: We are working with the infinity norm $\\|x\\|_{\\infty}$. The geometric shape defined by $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\le r$ (the \"ball\" of radius $r$ for the infinity norm) is a square centered at the origin, described by $C_r = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid -r \\le x_1 \\le r, -r \\le x_2 \\le r\\}$. This square is both convex and centrally symmetric.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Volume of the Convex Body**\nThe chosen convex body is the square $C_r$ with side length $2r$. Its volume (area) is:\n$\\text{vol}(C_r) = (2r) \\times (2r) = 4r^2$.\n\n**Step 4: Use Minkowski's Condition to Find a Bound**\nAccording to Minkowski's theorem, if $\\text{vol}(C_r) \\ge 2^n V$, then $C_r$ contains a non-zero lattice vector.\nSubstituting our values ($n=2$, $\\text{vol}(C_r) = 4r^2$):\n$4r^2 \\ge 2^2 V$\n$4r^2 \\ge 4V$\n$r^2 \\ge V$\n$r \\ge \\sqrt{V}$\n\n**Step 5: Interpret the Result**\nThe result $r \\ge \\sqrt{V}$ means that if we choose any radius $r$ that satisfies this condition (for instance, $r = \\sqrt{V}$), the corresponding square $C_r$ is guaranteed to contain at least one non-zero lattice vector $x \\in \\Lambda$.\nBy the definition of $C_r$, any vector $x$ inside it has an infinity norm $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\le r$.\nTherefore, there always exists a non-zero lattice vector $x \\in \\Lambda$ such that its infinity norm satisfies $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the Final Answer**\nThe quantity we defined as $k_{k,\\infty}$ is the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, measured by the infinity norm ($k_{k,\\infty} = \\lambda_{1, \\infty} = \\min_{x \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|x\\|_{\\infty}$).\nSince we have shown that there is *always* a non-zero vector $x$ with $\\|x\\|_{\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$, the length of the shortest such vector must also be less than or equal to this value.\nThis gives us the final inequality:\n$k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$\n\nThis bound is known to be sharp (or tight), meaning it cannot be improved. The square lattice generated by the vectors $(\\sqrt{V}, 0)$ and $(0, \\sqrt{V})$ has a covolume of $V$ and its shortest non-zero vectors have an infinity norm of exactly $\\sqrt{V}$.\n\nThe upper bound for the maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$) in relation to the covolume ($V$) is therefore $\\sqrt{V}$.\n\n<<<sqrt(V)>>>"
