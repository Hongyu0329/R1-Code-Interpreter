    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who?** We are looking for the name of a physicist.\n    *   **What is he known for?** Primarily for his work in the field of microscopy.\n    *   **What did he discover?** An optical effect related to \"real imagery\" (images that can be projected onto a screen).\n    *   **What is the origin story of the discovery?** The effect was first accidentally observed by a custodial worker who was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points (Clues):**\n    *   **Physicist & Microscopy:** The person must be a prominent figure in the history of microscopy, likely responsible for a major technical advancement. This narrows the field from all physicists to a specific subset. Candidates might include Ernst Abbe, Frits Zernike, Georges Nomarski, etc.\n    *   **Optical Effect in Real Imagery:** This points to a discovery in physical optics, specifically related to how images are formed. A concave mirror can form a real, inverted image if the object is placed outside the focal point. The effect would be visible in this projected image.\n    *   **Custodial Worker Anecdote:** This is the most specific and unique clue. The initial observation was a serendipitous accident by a non-scientist, which then led to a formal scientific discovery. This story is key to identifying the correct person.\n    *   **Concave Mirrors:** This detail specifies the equipment involved in the accidental observation, which is central to the optical principle at play.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Connecting the Clues:** We need to find the story that links a microscopy pioneer with a cleaner and a concave mirror. Searching for this anecdote in the history of science is the most direct approach.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Effect:** The described effect is a way to see things that are normally invisible. When a custodian cleans a mirror, they might leave behind very thin films of material or slight surface imperfections. These are normally transparent or too subtle to see directly. However, these features cause a slight phase shift in the light that reflects off them. While the human eye cannot detect phase shifts, a specific optical setup—like viewing the real image formed by a concave mirror—can convert these invisible phase shifts into visible differences in brightness (amplitude).\n\n3.  **Identifying the Physicist:** The physicist who discovered, formalized, and applied this principle to microscopy is **Frits Zernike**.\n    *   He developed the **phase-contrast microscope**, a revolutionary invention that allows scientists to view unstained, transparent living cells.\n    *   He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for this discovery.\n    *   The origin story of phase contrast is often linked to the observation of this effect on telescope mirrors. While the observation was first formally reported by others (like A.H. Pfund after it was noted by a technician), Zernike is the one who fully understood the physics, developed the theory, and ingeniously applied it to create a new type of microscope. He is the \"physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\" who is inextricably linked to the discovery of this effect and its foundational story.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Frits Zernike's work on phase-contrast microscopy perfectly matches all the details of the question: he is a Nobel laureate celebrated for his contribution to microscopy, the principle involves converting invisible phase shifts into visible images, and the discovery is famously associated with the accidental observation of this effect on concave mirrors.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
