    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Protagonist:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his large-scale, long-term (`longue durée`), global perspective.\n    *   **Source:** A quote from Paul Morand, a French author.\n    *   **Core Idea:** An unnamed \"conceptual entity\" must be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **Clue:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation is a specific instance or a component part of this larger conceptual entity.\n\n2.  **Locate the Reference:** The reference is found in Fernand Braudel's work, particularly in *A History of Civilizations* (also translated as *On History* or *Grammar of Civilizations* in different contexts). Braudel is discussing the very definition of the main subject of the book.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Quote and its Context:**\n    *   Braudel seeks to define what a \"civilization\" is. He sees it as a large, enduring space and a collection of cultural characteristics.\n    *   To illustrate this, he quotes Paul Morand's aphorism: **\"A nation is a star... but a civilization a nebula.\"**\n    *   This quote directly sets up the relationship described in the question. The \"nation\" (the star) is a distinct, smaller point of light within a much larger, more diffuse, and overarching entity: the \"civilization\" (the nebula).\n    *   Therefore, the \"conceptual entity\" that is exemplified by the symbol of a nation (as a smaller part) is **civilization**.\n\n4.  **Connect to the \"Sphere\":**\n    *   Immediately after presenting Morand's quote, Braudel builds on it with his own metaphor.\n    *   He argues that this entity, civilization, should be contextualized on a global scale. He states that it should be placed \"within a sphere,\" which he explicitly equates with the Earth or the world.\n    *   This act of \"inscribing within a sphere\" is central to Braudel's global historical method – understanding any large entity, like a civilization, not in isolation but in its relationship to the entire world.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   The \"conceptual entity\" is the broader category.\n    *   The \"nation\" is the specific example or component.\n    *   Morand's quote contrasts \"nation\" with \"civilization.\"\n    *   Braudel uses this quote to define **civilization** and then adds his own layer of analysis, stating that this civilization must be inscribed within the \"sphere\" of the world.\n    *   All parts of the question are satisfied: the entity is a **civilization**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Attribution:** The idea of the \"sphere\" is Braudel's own extension or interpretation of Morand's original aphorism. The question correctly attributes the full concept (Morand's assertion plus the sphere) to Braudel's usage.\n*   **Metaphor:** The entire statement is metaphorical. A nation is not literally a star, and a civilization is not literally a nebula to be put inside a physical sphere. The terms refer to scales of human social organization and the intellectual framework (the globe) needed to study them.\n*   **Hierarchy of Concepts:** The question relies on understanding the hierarchy presented: Nation (example) -> Civilization (entity) -> Sphere/World (context).\n\nBased on this analysis, the conceptual entity is a civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
