    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown for a batter in Major League Baseball is an achievement where a player leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list each player who has accomplished this feat in the American League. A key point is to count each player only once, even if they won multiple times.\n\n*   **1901:** Nap Lajoie\n*   **1909:** Ty Cobb\n*   **1933:** Jimmie Foxx\n*   **1934:** Lou Gehrig\n*   **1942:** Ted Williams\n*   **1947:** Ted Williams *(Note: This is the second win for Ted Williams, but we count him as one winner.)*\n*   **1956:** Mickey Mantle\n*   **1966:** Frank Robinson\n*   **1967:** Carl Yastrzemski\n*   **2012:** Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting the unique players from this list, there are **9** American League Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and List National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we will list the players who have won the Triple Crown in the National League. This list also includes winners from predecessor leagues, like the American Association (AA), which are recognized by MLB as major leagues for that era.\n\n*   **1878:** Paul Hines\n*   **1887:** Tip O'Neill (American Association)\n*   **1894:** Hugh Duffy\n*   **1912:** Heinie Zimmerman\n*   **1922:** Rogers Hornsby\n*   **1925:** Rogers Hornsby *(Note: This is the second win for Rogers Hornsby, so he is counted as one winner.)*\n*   **1933:** Chuck Klein\n*   **1937:** Joe Medwick\n\nCounting the unique players from this list, there are **7** National League Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Unique Winners\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we add the number of unique winners from both leagues.\n\n*   Unique AL Winners: 9\n*   Unique NL Winners: 7\n*   **Total Unique Winners:** 9 + 7 = 16\n\n### Final Careful Points Check:\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" not the number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Our analysis correctly counts each player once. (There have been 18 Triple Crown seasons, but only 16 unique players have achieved it).\n*   **Scope:** The scope is \"MLB baseball,\" which correctly includes both the American and National Leagues, as well as their recognized historical predecessor leagues.\n*   **Award Type:** The term \"Triple Crown\" most commonly refers to the batting award, not the pitching Triple Crown. The analysis is correctly based on the batting statistics.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can confidently determine the total number of winners.\n\n<<<16>>>"
