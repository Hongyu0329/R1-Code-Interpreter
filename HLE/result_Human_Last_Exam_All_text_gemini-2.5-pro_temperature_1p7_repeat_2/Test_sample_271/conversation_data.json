    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the possible degrees of the specified normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for a factorization by grouping terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nSo, the polynomial $f(x)$ factors into two polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors**\n\n*   **Factor g(x) = x^2 - 2:** The roots of this polynomial are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $g(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Factor h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3:** We check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    *   The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 3.\n    *   All other coefficients (-9 and 3) are divisible by 3.\n    *   The constant term is 3, which is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n    Thus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of h(x)**\n\nSince $h(x)$ is an irreducible quintic, its Galois group, let's call it $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ where $K_h$ is the splitting field of $h(x)$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To identify which subgroup it is, we can examine the roots of $h(x)$.\nLet's find the number of real roots using calculus:\n$h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$.\nThe critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, so $x = \\pm\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\nLet's evaluate $h(x)$ at these points:\n*   At the local maximum $x = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $h(x)$ is positive.\n*   At the local minimum $x = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $h(x)$ is negative.\nSince a local maximum is positive and a local minimum is negative, the polynomial must cross the x-axis three times. Thus, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n\nA standard result in Galois theory states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here, $p=5$, and we have $5-2=3$ real roots. Therefore, $G_h = \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The order of this group is $|S_5| = 5! = 120$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Galois group of the full splitting field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_g$ and $K_h$, i.e., $K = K_g K_h$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. We have the relation:\n$G \\cong \\{( \\sigma, \\tau ) \\in G_h \\times G_g \\mid \\sigma|_{K_h \\cap K_g} = \\tau|_{K_h \\cap K_g} \\}$.\nThe intersection $K_h \\cap K_g$ is a field extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. So the intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe intersection is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a subfield of $K_h$. The normal subfields of $K_h$ correspond to the normal subgroups of its Galois group, $S_5$. The only non-trivial normal subgroup of $S_5$ is the alternating group $A_5$. The fixed field of $A_5$ is a quadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, namely $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (1-n)^{n-1} a^n)$. For $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_h = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-4)^4 (-9)^5) = 3^4(5^5 - 4^4 \\cdot 3^6) = 81(3125 - 256 \\cdot 729) = 81(3125 - 186624) = 81(-183499)$.\nSo the quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$. This field is not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, $K_h \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group $G$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G \\cong G_h \\times G_g \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $|G| = |S_5| \\times |C_2| = 120 \\times 2 = 240$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the degrees of normal subfields**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe must find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$.\n\n1.  **Product Normal Subgroups:** These are of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd S_5$ and $N_2 \\unlhd C_2$.\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_1|=2$. Index $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2|=60$. Index $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_3 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_3|=120$. Index $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_4 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_4|=120$. Index $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    (The subgroups $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and $S_5 \\times C_2$ correspond to $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ respectively, so we exclude them).\n\n2.  **\"Skew\" Normal Subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors. The non-trivial quotients of $S_5$ are $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/\\{e\\}\\cong S_5$. The non-trivial quotient of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\}\\cong C_2$. The only possible isomorphism between non-trivial quotients is $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2/\\{e\\}$. This gives rise to one additional normal subgroup. Let $\\pi: S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the sign homomorphism (which has kernel $A_5$) and identify $C_2$ with $\\{\\pm 1\\}$.\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(g, c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\pi(g) = c\\}$. This subgroup is isomorphic to $S_5$, so its order is $|H_5|=120$. The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: List the possible degrees**\n\nWe collect the indices calculated for all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups:\n*   From $H_1$, degree = 120.\n*   From $H_2$, degree = 4.\n*   From $H_3, H_4, H_5$, degree = 2.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees for these normal subfields $L$ is {2, 4, 120}."
