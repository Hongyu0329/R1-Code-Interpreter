    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), when the Vietnamese under the leadership of Lê Lợi fought to end the rule of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination).\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question is specifically about Ming General **Mu Sheng** (沐晟). It's important to distinguish his actions and defeats from those of other Ming generals active in Vietnam at the same time, such as Wang Tong (王通) or Liu Sheng (柳升).\n\n3.  **Search for Mu Sheng's Campaigns and Defeats:**\n    *   Mu Sheng was one of the commanders of the initial, successful Ming invasion of Vietnam in 1406-1407. He did not suffer a defeat then.\n    *   During the Lam Sơn Uprising, the Ming forces suffered several major defeats. The most famous include:\n        *   **Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (late 1426):** A catastrophic defeat for the Ming. However, the commander defeated here was Wang Tong, not Mu Sheng.\n        *   **Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (late 1427):** A complete annihilation of a Ming relief army. The commander defeated and killed here was Liu Sheng, not Mu Sheng.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Specific Major Defeat:** In late 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two large relief armies to Vietnam to break Lê Lợi's siege of the capital, Đông Quan (modern Hanoi). One army came from Guangxi, led by Liu Sheng. The second army, led by **Mu Sheng**, came from Yunnan.\n    *   After Liu Sheng's army was destroyed at Chi Lăng, Lê Lợi's forces turned their attention to Mu Sheng's advancing army.\n    *   The Vietnamese commander Phạm Văn Xảo set up a strong defensive line to block Mu Sheng's path. The primary fortified location was at **Cần Trạm**.\n    *   When news of Liu Sheng's total defeat reached Mu Sheng's army, their morale collapsed. Confronted by the fortified and battle-hardened Vietnamese army, Mu Sheng decided to retreat back to Yunnan rather than fight a major battle.\n    *   This retreat, however, turned into a rout. Vietnamese forces under Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả pursued and ambushed Mu Sheng's fleeing army, inflicting tens of thousands of casualties. Mu Sheng himself barely escaped.\n\n5.  **Characterize the Event as His \"First Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng avoided annihilation in a single pitched battle like Liu Sheng, the complete failure of his military expedition and the disastrous rout of his army, which he personally commanded, constitutes his first and only major defeat of the war.\n\n6.  **Identify the Modern Location:** The decisive confrontation and the beginning of the rout occurred at the defensive line centered on **Cần Trạm** and the **Lê Hoa Pass** (ải Lê Hoa). Historical records and geographical analysis place these locations along the Lô River (Sông Lô) in the territory of the modern-day Vietnamese province of **Tuyên Quang**. Mu Sheng's army entered Vietnam from Yunnan (in the northwest) and was stopped in this region before it could reach the Red River Delta.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Specificity of the Commander:** It is crucial to differentiate Mu Sheng's defeat from other significant Ming defeats where he was not the commander in charge.\n*   **Definition of \"Defeat\":** Mu Sheng's defeat was not a single, set-piece battle but a failed campaign culminating in a disorganized and costly retreat (a rout), which is a clear form of military defeat.\n*   **\"First\" Major Defeat:** While he may have been involved in smaller, unsuccessful skirmishes before, the 1427 campaign was his first command of a major field army that ended in catastrophic failure, fitting the description of a \"first major defeat.\"\n*   **Geographical Location:** Tracing the invasion route from Yunnan and the site of the Vietnamese defensive positions is key to identifying the correct modern province.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, Mu Sheng's first major defeat took place during the retreat of his 1427 relief expedition, which began when he was confronted by Vietnamese forces at Cần Trạm. This historical site is located in what is now Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
