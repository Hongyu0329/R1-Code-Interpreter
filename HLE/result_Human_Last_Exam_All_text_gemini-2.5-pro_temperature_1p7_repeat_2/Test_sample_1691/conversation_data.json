    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find an analytical formula for the integral in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Integral and the Integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The integrand is $f(x, \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$.\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for small positive $\\epsilon$ (i.e., $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\n**2. Identify Singular Behavior**\n\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand approaches $\\frac{1}{P(x)}$. If $P(x)=0$ at some point within the integration interval $[0, 15]$, the integrand will become singular at that point in the limit.\nLet's find the roots of $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = x^5 (9 + 5x + 9x^3)$\nThe roots are at $x=0$ (with multiplicity 5) and where the cubic polynomial $Q(x) = 9x^3 + 5x + 9$ is zero.\n\nFor $x > 0$, all terms in $Q(x)$ are positive, so $Q(x) > 0$. Thus, $Q(x)$ has no positive real roots.\nThe only root of $P(x)$ in the integration interval $[0, 15]$ is at $x=0$.\nThe integral is a singular perturbation problem. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand develops an increasingly sharp and tall peak at $x=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral comes from a very small region around this point.\n\n**3. Approximate the Integrand for the Dominant Region**\n\nNear the singularity at $x=0$, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$:\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$ for small $x$.\nThe other terms, $5x^6$ and $9x^8$, become negligible compared to $9x^5$ as $x \\to 0$.\n\nFurthermore, since the integrand decays very rapidly for large $x$ (like $1/x^8$), the contribution from the upper part of the integration range is small. We can extend the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$ without affecting the leading-order asymptotic behavior.\nTherefore, we can approximate the integral as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$\n\n**4. Solve the Approximate Integral**\n\nTo solve this integral, we use a scaling substitution. The denominator terms $\\epsilon$ and $9x^5$ are comparable when $9x^5 \\sim \\epsilon$. This suggests the scale for $x$ is $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. Let's define a new dimensionless variable $u$:\n$u = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon} \\implies x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9} \\implies x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{1/5}$\n\nNow, we find the differential $dx$:\n$dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{1/5 - 1} du = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} du$\n\nSubstitute $x$ and $dx$ back into the approximate integral. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u} \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5}\\right) du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1+u)} \\frac{1}{5} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{-4/5} du$\n\nNow, factor out the terms that do not depend on $u$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5\\epsilon \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n**5. Evaluate the Resulting Standard Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is a representation of the Beta function:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = B(p, 1-p)$\nIn our case, $p-1 = -4/5$, so $p=1/5$. The integral is $B(1/5, 4/5)$.\n\nThe Beta function can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function:\n$B(p, q) = \\frac{\\Gamma(p)\\Gamma(q)}{\\Gamma(p+q)}$\n$B(1/5, 4/5) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{\\Gamma(1/5 + 4/5)} = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)}{\\Gamma(1)}$\nSince $\\Gamma(1) = 1$, this simplifies to $\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(4/5)$.\n\nWe now use Euler's reflection formula, $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$:\n$\\Gamma(1/5)\\Gamma(1-1/5) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\nSo, the integral evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n**6. Final Analytical Formula**\n\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\nRearranging for a cleaner look, the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ is:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Dominant Contribution**: For small $\\epsilon$, the integral's value is overwhelmingly determined by the behavior of the integrand near the singularity at $x=0$.\n2.  **Approximation of P(x)**: Near $x=0$, $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$ is correctly approximated by its lowest order term, $9x^5$.\n3.  **Integration Limits**: Replacing the upper limit of integration 15 with $\\infty$ is a valid approximation for finding the leading-order term because the integrand decays rapidly, making the contribution from large $x$ negligible.\n4.  **Scaling**: The choice of substitution (scaling variable) $u = 9x^5/\\epsilon$ is crucial as it correctly captures the behavior of the integrand peak's width and height dependence on $\\epsilon$.\n5.  **Special Functions**: The evaluation relies on the standard integral representation of the Beta function and Euler's reflection formula for the Gamma function, which are fundamental tools for this type of problem.\n6.  **Higher-Order Terms**: The developed formula is the leading-order term in an asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$. Corrections from the higher-order terms of $P(x)$ and the finite integration limit would result in terms with smaller negative powers of $\\epsilon$ (e.g., $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$) and constant terms, which are neglected in this leading-order approximation.\n\nThe final answer is the derived expression.\n\n<<<\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n>>>"
