    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given SKI combinator expression to find the value of `log_2(n)`.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the SKI Expression\nThe expression is: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`\n\nWe can see some recurring patterns. Let's define some terms for clarity.\nLet `op = S(I)`. The reduction rule for `op` is `op X Y = S I X Y = I Y (X Y) = Y (X Y)`.\nLet `D = S(S(K(S))(K))`. This is a combinator that acts on other terms.\nLet's analyze the structure. SKI expressions are left-associative. The structure is:\n`op (op (op A B)) C`\nWhere:\n*   `C = D(I)`\n*   `B = D(S(I)(I))`\n*   `A = K(C) = K(D(I))`\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Combinators and their Arithmetic Meanings\nTo evaluate this expression, we must understand what the combinators `D` and `S(I)I` represent in the context of Church numerals.\n\n*   **Church Numerals (`c_n`)**: These represent natural numbers. A common representation is `c_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`. In this system, `I` (Identity, `λx.x`) doesn't directly correspond to a Church numeral, but `c_1 = λf.λx. f(x)` behaves like `I` when the argument `f` is provided, i.e., `c_1 f = f = I f`. For this reason, `I` is often used to represent `c_1`.\n\n*   **Combinator `D = S(S(K(S))(K))`**: This structure is very similar to the successor combinator `SUCC = S(S(KS)K) = S(B)`. The difference lies in `K(S)` vs `KS`. This suggests `D` is a related arithmetic operation. By analogy and common patterns in such problems, `D` is interpreted as the `DOUBLE` operator: `DOUBLE c_n = c_{2n}`.\n\n*   **Combinator `S(I)(I)`**: This is the self-application or mockingbird combinator `M`, since `S(I)I x = I x (I x) = x x`. This combinator's action is \"quadratic\" in nature. The Church numeral `c_2` also has a quadratic feel (`f(f(x))`). In the context of these kinds of problems, it's a common and plausible interpretation to equate `S(I)I` with `c_2`.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Components `A`, `B`, and `C`\nUsing the interpretations from Step 2:\n*   `I` represents `c_1`.\n*   `D` represents `DOUBLE`.\n*   `S(I)I` represents `c_2`.\n\nNow we can evaluate `A`, `B`, and `C`:\n*   `C = D(I) = DOUBLE(c_1) = c_{2*1} = c_2`.\n*   `B = D(S(I)I) = DOUBLE(c_2) = c_{2*2} = c_4`.\n*   `A = K(C) = K(c_2)`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Full Expression\nThe structure is `op (op (op A B)) C`. Let's evaluate it from the inside out.\n\n1.  Let `F_1 = op A B = B (A B)`.\n    *   Substitute `A` and `B`: `F_1 = c_4 ( (K c_2) c_4 )`.\n    *   Evaluate `(K c_2) c_4 = c_2`.\n    *   So, `F_1 = c_4 (c_2)`.\n\n2.  Now we must determine the result of applying one Church numeral to another, `c_m(c_n)`.\n    `c_m(c_n)` is `(λf.λx. f^m x)(c_n)`. This applies the lambda abstraction for `c_m` to `c_n` as the argument `f`.\n    The result is `λx. (c_n)^m x`.\n    Let's expand `(c_n)^m`:\n    *   `(c_n)^2(g) = c_n(c_n(g))`.\n    *   `c_n(g) = λy. g^n y`.\n    *   `c_n(c_n(g)) = c_n(λy. g^n y) = λz. (λy. g^n y)^n z = λz. g^{n*n} z = λz. g^{n^2} z`.\n    *   By induction, `(c_n)^m(g) = λz. g^{n^m} z`.\n    This means `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`. Application of Church numerals corresponds to exponentiation, where `c_m` is the exponent.\n\n3.  Continuing the evaluation with `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`:\n    *   `F_1 = c_4(c_2) = c_{2^4} = c_{16}`.\n\n4.  Next level of `op`: Let `F_2 = op F_1 C = C (F_1 C)`.\n    *   Substitute known values: `F_2 = c_2 (c_{16} c_2)`.\n    *   Evaluate the inner part: `c_{16}(c_2) = c_{2^{16}}`.\n    *   So, `F_2 = c_2 (c_{2^{16}})`.\n    *   Evaluate this: `F_2 = c_{(2^{16})^2} = c_{2^{32}}`.\n\n5.  Final level of `op`: The entire expression is `op F_2 C`. This seems incorrect based on the bracketing. Let's re-examine `op (op (op A B)) C`.\n    *   Let `F_1 = op A B = B(AB) = c_4(c_2) = c_{16}`.\n    *   The expression is `op (op F_1) C`. This is invalid SKI syntax.\n    *   The correct left-associative parsing is `((op (op A B)) C)`.\n        *   `op A B = c_{16}` as calculated.\n        *   Now we have `(op c_{16}) C`. `op` needs two arguments. This is `op(c_{16})(C)`.\n        *   `op c_{16} C = C (c_{16} C) = c_2 (c_{16} c_2) = c_2(c_{2^{16}}) = c_{(2^{16})^2} = c_{2^{32}}`.\n    *   The structure is not `op(op(op A B)) C`. It is `op (X) C` where `X = op(op A B)`. This gives `C(XC) = C((op(op A B)) C)`. This gives `C(C((op A B)C)) = C(C(C(ABC)))`. This would involve `op` only once.\n    *   Let's re-parse `op W C` where `W = op X` and `X = op A B`.\n        *   `W = op X = S(I) X = λy. y(Xy)`.\n        *   `WC = C(XC)`.\n        *   `XC = (op A B)C = C((AB)C)`. No. It is `B(AB)`. `XC = C( (B(AB)) C )`. No, `X` applied to `C`. `XC = (B(AB))C`.\n        *   `op WC = C (WC) = C ( (B(AB)) C )`. My initial deep nesting was wrong.\n        *   `C(WC) = c_2( (B(AB))C )`. Let's re-evaluate.\n            *   `AB = c_2`.\n            *   `B(AB) = c_4(c_2) = c_{16}`.\n            *   `(B(AB))C = c_{16}(c_2) = c_{2^{16}}`.\n            *   Final expression: `c_2( c_{2^{16}} ) = c_{(2^{16})^2} = c_{2^{32}}`.\n\nThis seems like the correct parse. Let's try the first parse again carefully. `op(X)(Y)` with `X = op(Z, W)` and `Y=...`\n`S(I) (S(I) (S(I) A B)) C`\nInnermost: `X = S(I) A B = B(AB)`.\nNext: `Y = S(I) X = λq.q(Xq)`.\nThen: `S(I) Y C = C(YC)`.\nLet's evaluate the parts again.\n`A = K(c_2), B=c_4, C=c_2`.\n`X = c_4(K(c_2)c_4) = c_4(c_2) = c_{2^4} = c_{16}`.\n`Y = λq.q(c_{16} q)`.\n`YC = C(c_{16}C) = c_2(c_{16}c_2) = c_2(c_{2^{16}}) = c_{(2^{16})^2} = c_{2^{32}}`.\n`C(YC) = c_2(c_{2^{32}}) = c_{(2^{32})^2} = c_{2^{64}}`.\nYes, this evaluation is consistent. The three nested `S(I)` terms result in three nested exponentiations with base 2.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe expression evaluates to the Church numeral `n = c_{2^{64}}`.\nSo, the integer `n` is `2^64`.\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^64) = 64`."
