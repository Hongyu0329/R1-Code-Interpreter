The product is a bicyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reaction cleaves the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene ring and forms a new bond between C5 of the norbornene and C2' of the cyclopentenyl group. This results in a fused bicyclo[7.3.0]dodecane skeleton. The original alcohol at C2 is converted to a ketone, and the double bond from the norbornene core migrates from the C5-C6 position to the C1-C6 position. The dimethoxy ketal and the TBS ether groups remain intact.
