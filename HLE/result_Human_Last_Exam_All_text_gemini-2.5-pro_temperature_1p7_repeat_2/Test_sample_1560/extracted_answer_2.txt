After applying the gate Q to the first ququint and then measuring the first ququint in the computational basis, the system collapses to one of five possible final states. The final state is described by the following probabilistic outcomes:
1.  With probability **1/5**, the measurement outcome is $|0\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2.  With probability **1/5**, the measurement outcome is $|1\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3.  With probability **3/10**, the measurement outcome is $|2\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4.  With probability **1/5**, the measurement outcome is $|3\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5.  With probability **1/10**, the measurement outcome is $|4\rangle_A$, and the final state of the system is $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
