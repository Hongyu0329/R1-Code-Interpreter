    "To answer this question, we need to understand the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The category $C$ consists of all finite-dimensional indecomposable representations. We are asked for the percentage of these objects that are irreducible (i.e., simple).\n\nThe set of objects in $C$ is infinite in multiple ways (continuous families, infinite discrete series), so a literal calculation of a percentage is not possible. The question must be interpreted as asking for the ratio of the number of \"types\" of irreducible representations to the total number of \"types\" of indecomposable representations. We will therefore classify the indecomposable modules by their fundamental structural properties.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. The Algebra and the Significance of $q$**\n\nThe quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to certain relations. When $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity (here $l=3$), the center of the algebra becomes much larger. Elements like $E^l, F^l, K^l$ become central. A crucial consequence is that the category of finite-dimensional representations is no longer semisimple. This means there exist indecomposable representations that are not irreducible, which is the crux of the problem.\n\n**2. Classification Strategy**\n\nThe finite-dimensional representations can be classified based on the action of the center. An indecomposable representation belongs to a single \"block\" of the category, determined by a character (a set of eigenvalues) of the center. This leads to a natural division of representations into two main kinds:\n\n*   **Nilpotent Representations:** Where the central elements $E^3$ and $F^3$ act as zero. The representation theory of this block is equivalent to that of the \"small quantum group\" $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n*   **Semicyclic (or Regular) Representations:** Where $E^3$ or $F^3$ act non-trivially. These representations form \"tubes\" in the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the category.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct \"types\" of indecomposable modules within each class.\n\n**3. Analyzing Nilpotent Representations**\n\nThis family of representations contains a finite number of distinct types of indecomposable modules. The simple objects (irreducible representations) in this family are the modules $V_d$ of dimension $d$ for $d=1, 2, 3$.\n\n*   **Irreducible Types:**\n    1.  **$V_1$:** A 1-dimensional simple module.\n    2.  **$V_2$:** A 2-dimensional simple module.\n    3.  **$V_3$:** A 3-dimensional simple module (the Steinberg module).\n\n*   **Projectivity and Reducible Indecomposables:**\n    A simple module $L$ is also indecomposable. If $L$ is not projective, its projective cover $P(L)$ is an indecomposable module that is not simple (i.e., it is reducible). For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $l=3$, a simple module $V_d$ (of dimension $d$) is projective if and only if $l$ divides $d$.\n    *   $V_1$ (d=1): Not projective, since 3 does not divide 1.\n    *   $V_2$ (d=2): Not projective, since 3 does not divide 2.\n    *   $V_3$ (d=3): Projective, since 3 divides 3.\n    This gives rise to the following indecomposable but reducible types:\n    4.  **$P(V_1)$:** The projective cover of $V_1$. It is indecomposable and has composition factors $V_1, V_2, V_1$. It is not irreducible.\n    5.  **$P(V_2)$:** The projective cover of $V_2$. It is indecomposable and has composition factors $V_2, V_1, V_1, V_2$. It is not irreducible.\n    Since $V_3$ is projective, its projective cover is itself, so it does not generate a new type of non-simple module.\n\nCounting the types in the nilpotent family: We have **3 types of irreducible modules** ($V_1, V_2, V_3$) and **2 types of reducible indecomposable modules** ($P(V_1), P(V_2)$).\n\n**4. Analyzing Semicyclic (Regular) Representations**\n\nThese representations are organized into structures called tubes. A tube is typically parameterized by a continuous parameter $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{C}^*$ (related to the highest weight). All tubes have the same internal structure.\n\n*   **Irreducible Type:**\n    For each generic parameter $\\lambda$, there is a simple module of dimension $l=3$, which we denote $L_\\lambda$. These simple modules form a continuous family, but they all share the same structural properties, so we count them as a single \"type\".\n    6.  **$L_\\lambda$:** A 3-dimensional simple module in a regular block (a tube). This represents one type of irreducible module.\n\n*   **Reducible Indecomposable Type:**\n    Each simple module $L_\\lambda$ sits at the mouth of a tube. The other modules in the tube are its iterated self-extensions, denoted $M_n(\\lambda)$ for $n=2, 3, \\dots$. These are all indecomposable but not irreducible. The existence of this infinite tower of non-simple modules for each simple $L_\\lambda$ represents a single structural feature.\n    7.  **Self-extensions of $L_\\lambda$:** This class of modules ($M_n(\\lambda)$ for $n>1$) represents one type of reducible indecomposable module.\n\nCounting the types in the semicyclic family: We have **1 type of irreducible module** ($L_\\lambda$) and **1 type of reducible indecomposable module** (the self-extensions).\n\n**5. Calculating the Percentage**\n\nNow we aggregate our findings to determine the overall percentage.\n\n*   **Total number of irreducible types:** 3 (from nilpotent) + 1 (from semicyclic) = 4.\n*   **Total number of reducible indecomposable types:** 2 (from nilpotent) + 1 (from semicyclic) = 3.\n*   **Total number of indecomposable types:** 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nThe percentage of indecomposable types that are irreducible is the ratio of the number of irreducible types to the total number of indecomposable types.\n\nPercentage = (Number of Irreducible Types) / (Total Number of Indecomposable Types) = 4 / 7.\n\nAs a percentage, this is $(4/7) \\times 100 \\approx 57.14\\%$.\n\nFinal answer will be given as a numerical value.\n$400/7 \\approx 57.142857$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{4}{7}$. In percentage it is $\\frac{400}{7}\\% \\approx 57.14\\%$.\nThe format requires a number. I'll provide the fraction converted to a decimal.\n$4/7 \\approx 0.5714...$ Percentage is $57.14...$\n\n<<<400/7>>>"
