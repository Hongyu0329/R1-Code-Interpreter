    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African nations' flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### **Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\n1.  **Visualize the Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross has both vertical and horizontal components.\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** We can imagine the flag as a grid of pixels, forming a matrix. Each color corresponds to a numerical value. To satisfy the condition of \"maximal rank\", we must assign distinct numerical values to each color. Let Red = `r` and White = `w`, where `r ≠ w`.\n3.  **Analyze the Rows:** A matrix's rank is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's examine the different types of horizontal rows in the Danish flag matrix.\n    *   **Type A Rows:** Rows that do *not* pass through the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist mostly of red pixels, with a segment of white pixels where the row intersects the vertical bar of the cross. The pattern is `(r, r, ..., r, w, w, ..., w, r, r, ..., r)`.\n    *   **Type B Rows:** Rows that *do* pass through the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows consist entirely of white pixels. The pattern is `(w, w, w, ..., w, w)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Rank:** We have two distinct types of row vectors. Since we chose `r ≠ w`, Type A rows cannot be created by a scalar multiplication of Type B rows (and vice versa). Therefore, they are linearly independent. The total number of linearly independent rows is 2.\n    *   **The rank of the Danish flag is 2.**\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Goal**\n\nWe need to find flags of African nations that also have a rank of 2. This means we are looking for flags whose designs generate exactly two unique, linearly independent types of horizontal rows.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Flags of African Nations**\n\nWe will now categorize and analyze the designs of various African flags.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Simple Stripe Patterns**\n*   **Vertical Stripes (Rank 1):** A flag with only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria: Green-White-Green; Ivory Coast: Orange-White-Green; Mali: Green-Yellow-Red) has only *one* type of horizontal row. For instance, every single row in the Nigerian flag is a vector of the form `(g, g, ..., w, w, ..., g, g, ...)` where `g` is the value for green and `w` for white. Since all rows are identical, the rank is 1.\n*   **Horizontal Stripes (Rank ≥ 3):** A flag with `n` horizontal stripes of different colors (e.g., Ethiopia, Gabon, Sierra Leone are tricolors) will have `n` distinct types of rows, one for each stripe. The rank of such a flag is `n`. For these tricolors, the rank is 3.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Emblems on Stripes**\n*   An emblem (like a star or crescent) placed on a stripe can create a new type of row, thereby increasing the rank.\n*   For a horizontal tricolor like Ghana (Red-Yellow-Green, with a black star on the central yellow stripe), the rows are: a \"pure red\" type, a \"pure yellow\" type, a \"yellow with a black star\" type, and a \"pure green\" type. This results in a rank of at least 3, and likely 4.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Finding Rank 2 Designs**\nBased on the analysis, a flag will have a rank of 2 if its design creates exactly two distinct types of rows. This happens in a few specific cases:\n\n1.  **Vertical Stripes with a Central Emblem:** A vertical tricolor with an emblem placed in the central stripe.\n    *   **Senegal:** Green-Yellow-Red vertical stripes with a green star on the central yellow stripe.\n        *   Row Type 1 (most rows): `(Green, Yellow, Red)`\n        *   Row Type 2 (rows through the star): `(Green, Green(star), Red)`\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n    *   **Cameroon:** Green-Red-Yellow vertical stripes with a yellow star on the central red stripe.\n        *   Row Type 1: `(Green, Red, Yellow)`\n        *   Row Type 2: `(Green, Yellow(star), Yellow)`\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n\n2.  **Vertically Divided Field with a Central Emblem:** A field split vertically into two colors, with an emblem straddling the central line.\n    *   **Algeria:** Vertically divided green and white, with a red star and crescent in the center.\n        *   Row Type 1 (away from emblem): `(Green, White)`\n        *   Row Type 2 (through emblem): `(Green, Red, White)`\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n\n3.  **Combined Vertical and Horizontal Bands:** A flag with a vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands in the fly.\n    *   **Benin:** A vertical green band with two horizontal bands of yellow and red.\n        *   Row Type 1 (top half): `(Green, Yellow)`\n        *   Row Type 2 (bottom half): `(Green, Red)`\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n    *   **Madagascar:** A vertical white band with two horizontal bands of red and green.\n        *   Row Type 1 (top half): `(White, Red)`\n        *   Row Type 2 (bottom half): `(White, Green)`\n        *   These two row vectors are linearly independent. **Rank = 2.**\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the designs of the flags of all African nations, we find that the following five countries have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   **Algeria**\n*   **Benin**\n*   **Cameroon**\n*   **Madagascar**\n*   **Senegal**\n\n<<<Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Madagascar, Senegal>>>"
