    "This puzzle requires identifying a specific linguistic pattern and applying it to the given words. The pattern is a simplified version of a process called metathesis found in the Rotuman language.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the pattern from the first three words\n\nThe process transforms a \"complete\" word into an \"incomplete\" word. We are asked to \"decode,\" which implies we should perform this transformation. The rule can be deduced from the examples if one is familiar with this type of linguistic puzzle, or it can be derived by recognizing the pattern.\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1.  Divide the word into a `stem` and a `last syllable`. The `last syllable` is generally the final Consonant-Vowel cluster (and any letters that follow).\n2.  Identify the last vowel in the `stem` (let's call it V1) and the vowel in the `last syllable` (let's call it V2).\n3.  The last vowel of the stem, V1, is changed to a new vowel, V1', based on the combination of V1 and V2.\n4.  The `last syllable` is dropped. The resulting word is the `stem` with V1 replaced by V1'.\n\nThe vowel transformation rules are given by this table:\n\n| V1 (Stem Vowel) | + V2 (Final Vowel) | -> V1' (New Stem Vowel) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|   a   |   a   |   a   |\n|   a   | e / i |   e   |\n|   a   | o / u |   o   |\n|   e   |   a   |   a   |\n|   e   | e / i |   e   |\n|   e   | o / u |   o   |\n|   i   |   a   |   e   |\n|   i   | e / i |   i   |\n|   i   | o / u |   u   |\n|   o   |   a   |   a   |\n|   o   | e / i |   e   |\n|   o   | o / u |   o   |\n|   u   |   a   |   o   |\n|   u   | e / i |   i   |\n|   u   | o / u |   u   |\n\n### Step 2: Verify the pattern with the given examples\n\n*   **Word 1:** `utpshtheas`\n    *   **Stem:** `utpshthe`, **Last Syllable:** `as`\n    *   **V1** (from stem): `e`, **V2** (from last syllable): `a`\n    *   **Transformation:** `e` + `a` -> `a`\n    *   **Result:** Replace `e` in `utpshthe` with `a` -> **`utpshtha`**\n\n*   **Word 2:** `fkuhu`\n    *   **Stem:** `fku`, **Last Syllable:** `hu`\n    *   **V1** (from stem): `u`, **V2** (from last syllable): `u`\n    *   **Transformation:** `u` + `u` -> `u`\n    *   **Result:** Replace `u` in `fku` with `u` -> **`fku`**\n\n*   **Word 3:** `numhkatnatu`\n    *   **Stem:** `numhkatna`, **Last Syllable:** `tu`\n    *   **V1** (from stem): `a`, **V2** (from last syllable): `u`\n    *   **Transformation:** `a` + `u` -> `o`\n    *   **Result:** Replace `a` in `numhkatna` with `o` -> **`numhkatno`**\n\nThe pattern holds true for all the examples.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the pattern to decode the last word\n\n*   **Word 4:** `anhaeketn`\n    *   **Stem:** `anhae`, **Last Syllable:** `ketn`\n    *   **V1** (last vowel of the stem `anhae`): `e`\n    *   **V2** (vowel of the last syllable `ketn`): `e`\n    *   **Transformation:** According to the table, `e` + `e` -> `e`.\n    *   **Result:** The vowel `e` in the stem `anhae` is replaced with `e`, so the stem remains unchanged. The decoded word is the modified stem.\n\nFinal decoded word is **`anhae`**.\n\n<<<anhae>>>"
