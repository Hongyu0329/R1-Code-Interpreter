    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. The root vowel is `*e`, followed by a laryngeal `*h₂` (the \"a-coloring\" laryngeal) and a voiced velar stop `*g`.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-`. This is a present tense suffix. Verbs with this suffix typically become Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the 3rd person singular present active indicative ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he’s giving a sign', which is related to perception, seeking, and tracking. This is confirmed by the cognates Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite `sākizzi` ('he/she gives a sign').\n\n### **Step 2: Trace from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe need to apply the characteristic sound changes that separate Proto-Germanic from Proto-Indo-European.\n\n1.  **Vowel Changes:**\n    *   The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` to `*a` and then disappears, lengthening the vowel. Thus, `*seh₂g-` becomes a pre-Germanic `*sāg-`.\n    *   In Proto-Germanic, PIE long `*ā` and PIE long `*ō` merge into a single vowel, PGmc `*ō`. So, pre-Germanic `*sāg-` becomes PGmc `*sōk-`. (Note: The consonant change is explained next).\n\n2.  **Consonant Changes (Grimm's Law):**\n    *   The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k` in Germanic.\n    *   The initial `*s` is unaffected by Grimm's Law.\n    *   Therefore, the root `*sāg-` becomes `*sōk-` in PGmc.\n\n3.  **Verb Class Formation:**\n    *   The PIE `*-ie-` suffix becomes `*-ja-` in Proto-Germanic, forming a Class 1 weak verb.\n    *   The infinitive form in Proto-Germanic for this class ends in `*-ijaną` (or `*-janą`).\n    *   Combining the root and the suffix gives us the infinitive **`*sōkijaną`**. Its meaning evolves from 'to track, perceive' to the more common 'to seek, to look for'.\n\n**Proto-Germanic Result: `*sōkijaną`**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The `*i` or `*j` in the `*-ija-` suffix causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to front and round. In Old Norse, `*ō` becomes `œ`. The stem `*sōk-` becomes `*sœk-`.\n2.  **Palatalization and `j` Retention:** The consonant `*k` is palatalized by the following `*j`, forming a `kj` cluster. In this case, unlike with some other consonants, the `j` is retained in the spelling (`sœkja`).\n3.  **Infinitive Ending:** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a` in Old Norse.\n\n**Old Norse Result: `sœkja`**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the `*j` in the suffix triggers i-umlaut on the root vowel `*ō`. In Old English, the result of i-umlaut on `*ō` is a long front vowel, `ē`. The stem `*sōk-` becomes `sēc-`.\n2.  **Palatalization:** The newly formed front vowel `ē` causes the preceding velar consonant `*k` to become palatalized. In Old English, this palatal `k` becomes the affricate /tʃ/, written as `ċ` or simply `c`. So, `sēc-` becomes `sēċ-` (/seːtʃ-/).\n3.  **Loss of `*j`:** In Old English, the medial `*j` is lost after a \"heavy\" syllable (one with a long vowel or a short vowel followed by two consonants). Since `sōk-` has a long vowel, the `*j` from `*-ijaną` disappears after causing the umlaut.\n4.  **Infinitive Ending:** The `*-aną` ending becomes `-an`.\n\n**Old English Result: `sēcan` (also written `sēċan`)**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **High German Consonant Shift:** The Proto-Germanic voiceless stop `*k` is shifted to a voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /xː/) between vowels.\n2.  **Vowel Changes:** Proto-Germanic `*ō` becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German. The stem `*sōk-` becomes `suohh-`.\n3.  **I-Umlaut and Gemination:** The `*j` from the `*-janą` suffix has two effects in OHG for this class of verb:\n    *   It causes the preceding consonant to lengthen (geminate). This reinforces the shift of `*k` to `hh`.\n    *   It triggers i-umlaut on the root vowel. The diphthong `uo` is fronted to `üe`. However, this umlaut was often not indicated in Old High German spelling, so `uo` is commonly written.\n4.  **Infinitive Ending:** The ending `*-an` is retained.\n\n**Old High German Result: `suohhen`** (pronounced with an umlauted vowel, `/süohhen/`, even if not always spelled that way)\n\n---\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhen>>>"
