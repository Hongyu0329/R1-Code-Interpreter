The appropriate management begins with immediate medical consultation to control her untreated diabetes, followed by local wound care including debridement, antibiotics, and tetanus prophylaxis. Definitive prosthetic treatment should be delayed for 3-6 months until her glycemic control is stable (HbA1c < 7%) and the extraction sites have healed. The key cells of interest are neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts, whose functions are impaired by hyperglycemia, and osteoblasts, critical for bone healing. If a removable denture is chosen, the ideal option is a cast Cobalt-Chromium framework removable partial denture with acrylic saddles and teeth. The primary abutment teeth would be the left second premolar and the left central incisor. To ensure stability, secondary abutments on the contralateral side, such as the right first and second premolars, must be included in the design for cross-arch stabilization and in
