    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to count the number of times Anton Chekhov uses the description of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing state of mind in the short story \"The Chameleon\". The question explicitly links the descriptions to his \"fearful mentality and its shifts.\" This means we are not just looking for the word \"coat,\" but for instances where the coat is described in a way that reflects his internal turmoil and changing allegiances.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolic Action:** In the story, Otchumyelov's internal state is externalized by his physical reaction to the changing social status of the dog's potential owner. When he believes the dog belongs to someone powerful (like General Zhigalov), he becomes subservient, fawning, and metaphorically \"hot under the collar.\" When he believes the dog is a stray or belongs to someone insignificant, he becomes arrogant, authoritative, and feels a \"chill\" of command. His actions with his overcoat—taking it off when he's \"hot\" and putting it on when he's \"cold\"—are the primary descriptions we need to count.\n\n3.  **Chronological Walkthrough of the Story to Count the Descriptions:**\n\n    *   **Description 1: The Initial State.** At the beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks through the market square, he is described as being \"in a new overcoat.\" This establishes his initial appearance of authority and officialdom before the conflict begins. This is the baseline from which all shifts occur.\n\n    *   **Description 2: The First Shift (Subservience).** A voice in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov immediately changes his tone. He feels hot and says, \"**Take my coat off**, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" This action of removing the coat symbolizes him shedding his harsh authority in the presence of perceived power.\n\n    *   **Description 3: The Second Shift (Authority).** It is then suggested that the General doesn't own such dogs. Otchumyelov's authority returns. He feels a sudden chill and commands his assistant, \"Yeldyrin, my good fellow... **help me on with my coat**... I feel a draught.\" He puts the mantle of authority back on.\n\n    *   **Description 4: The Third Shift (Subservience).** The policeman Yeldyrin speculates that he has seen a similar dog at the General's. Doubt creeps in again, and so does the heat. Otchumyelov once more demands, \"**Help me off with my coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad... I'm very hot!\" His authority is shed again.\n\n    *   **Description 5: The Fourth Shift (Authority).** The General's cook, Prokhor, arrives and states definitively that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov becomes firm and dismissive. He feels the \"wind\" of authority and says, \"**Put on my coat**, brother Yeldyrin... something seems to have blown on me.\"\n\n    *   **Description 6: The Final Shift (Resolved Position).** Prokhor clarifies that the dog actually belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov's face lights up with a sycophantic smile. He has found the \"correct\" side to be on. At the end of the story, as he walks away, Chekhov provides the final description: Otchumyelov, \"**wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him**, goes on his way.\" This final action signifies that he has settled on his position and is now securely wrapped in the comfort of his restored—and correctly aligned—authority.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   The count must include not only the taking off and putting on, but also the initial description and the final action of wrapping the coat. All these instances are purposeful descriptions used by Chekhov to illustrate character.\n*   Different translations might use \"overcoat\" or \"greatcoat,\" but the object and the actions remain consistent.\n*   The question links the description to the \"shifts\" in mentality. Each of the six identified instances directly correlates with a specific mental state or a shift between states. The initial description sets the stage for the shifts, and the final one concludes them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically tracking Otchumyelov's reactions and Chekhov's corresponding descriptions of his coat, we can count six distinct instances where the coat is described to symbolize his character's chameleon-like changes.\n\n<<<6>>>"
