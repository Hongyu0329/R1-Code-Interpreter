    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The user wants to know what object the artist Curt Querner is holding in his 1933 self-portrait and what its symbolic meaning is, specifically in the context of resistance.\n\n2.  **Identify the Artwork and Artist:** The painting is a self-portrait by the German artist Curt Querner, created in 1933. The German title is \"Selbstbildnis mit Distel.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Historical Context:** The year 1933 is critical. It was the year Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, and the Nazi regime began its consolidation of power. The Gestapo (Secret State Police) was established and began targeting political opponents, including communists. Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and was indeed arrested and briefly imprisoned by the Gestapo in Dresden in 1933. This self-portrait was painted immediately after his release.\n\n4.  **Identify the Object:** Upon viewing the painting, we can see that Querner is holding a plant in his right hand. The plant has a spiky stem and leaves, with a distinct purplish flower head. This plant is a **thistle** (German: *Distel*).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Symbolism (Careful Points):**\n    *   **The Nature of the Thistle:** A thistle is known for being a tough, hardy, and prickly weed. It is difficult to handle without getting hurt and very hard to eradicate once it takes root. It thrives in harsh and unforgiving environments.\n    *   **Connection to the Artist's State:** Querner had just been persecuted by a brutal political regime. By depicting himself holding a thistle, he connects his own identity with the plant's characteristics.\n    *   **Symbol of Resistance and Defiance:** The thistle symbolizes resilience and endurance in the face of adversity. Its prickly nature represents a defense mechanism and a defiant \"do not touch\" attitude. By holding it, Querner is making a bold, non-verbal statement of his unbroken spirit and his refusal to be silenced or crushed by the Nazi regime.\n    *   **Contrast and Self-Image:** He presents himself not as a broken victim, but as a steadfast and prickly individual who will endure, much like the weed he holds. His gaze is direct and challenging. The thistle is not just an object; it is an extension of his own defiant personality in that moment.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\nBased on the analysis, the object Curt Querner holds in his hand is a thistle. It serves as a potent symbol of his personal resilience, defiance, and resistance against the persecution he faced from the Gestapo and the rising Nazi regime.\n\n<<<a thistle>>>"
