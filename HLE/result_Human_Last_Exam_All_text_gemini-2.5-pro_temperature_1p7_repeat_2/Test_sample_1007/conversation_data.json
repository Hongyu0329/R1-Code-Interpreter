    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify which of the given classical ballet steps has the same starting and ending leg configuration. For steps starting and ending in a position like the fifth, this means asking: \"Which step starts with one foot in front and ends with the very same foot in front?\"\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice:**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Definition:** An *entrechat* is a jump straight up from fifth position during which the dancer's legs cross and beat multiple times. The number indicates the number of movements (crossings and openings).\n    *   **Careful Point:** A key rule in ballet terminology distinguishes even-numbered entrechats from odd-numbered ones. Even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) always land back in fifth position *with the same foot in front* as the starting position. Odd-numbered entrechats (trois, cinq) land on one foot.\n    *   **Conclusion:** An *entrechat six* starts in fifth position and ends in the exact same fifth position. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Definition:** This is a compound step. *Échappé* means \"to escape,\" typically from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second). *Battu* means \"beaten.\" *Changé* means \"changed.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word *changé* is the critical piece of information. It explicitly tells us that the feet change position. A dancer starting with the right foot in front will end with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Definition:** Meaning \"to assemble.\" It's a jump where the working leg brushes out, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing on both feet in fifth position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** In a standard *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), the feet change position. For example, in an *assemblé dessous* starting with the right foot in front, the right foot will brush out and land in the back. The starting and ending positions are different. While there are variations, the standard form of the step changes the feet.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is typically different from the starting position. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Definition:** *Glissade* is a gliding, traveling step. *Derrière* means \"behind,\" indicating that the second leg closes behind the first one.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Whether the feet change depends on the direction of travel relative to the starting position.\n        *   **Scenario 1 (No change):** Start with the right foot in front. Glide to the right. The right foot leads, and the left foot closes *derrière* (behind) the right. The position ends with the right foot still in front.\n        *   **Scenario 2 (Change):** Start with the right foot in front. Glide to the left. The left (back) foot leads, and the right foot must close *derrière* the left. The position ends with the left foot now in front. The feet have changed.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Since a *glissade derrière* can result in a change of feet depending on its execution, it does not *always* have the same starting and ending position. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Definition:** A complex decorative step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (rond de jambe) from each leg in the air.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A *pas de chat* (cat's step) inherently changes feet; the foot that starts in the back comes to land in the front. A *gargouillade* follows this same pattern. The leg that initiates the step will typically land first, with the second leg closing in front of it, reversing the original fifth position.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The ending position is different from the starting position. This is incorrect.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all the options, the only step that, by its fundamental definition, concludes with the exact same leg position as it began is the **Entrechat six**, due to the rule for even-numbered entrechats.\n\n<<<A>>>"
