    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A *proper* subcontinuum of X is a subcontinuum K such that K ≠ X.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum X that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Composant:** The composant of a point `p` in a continuum X, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in X for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both `p` and `q`. The collection of all distinct composants forms a partition of X.\n*   **Key Distinction:** The problem explicitly notes we are considering general continua (\"not necessarily metric\") and \"composants\" (not \"components\").\n\n### Step 2: Relate indecomposability to the number of composants\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly one composant (which is the entire space). The contrapositive of this theorem is:\n*   A continuum is **indecomposable** if and only if it has **more than one** composant.\n\nThis means the number of composants we are looking for must be an integer greater than 1, or an infinite cardinal. So, the smallest possible number is at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Rule out a finite or countably infinite number of composants\nThis step relies on two important topological theorems that hold for general (not necessarily metric) continua:\n1.  **Composants are Fσ sets:** Every composant of a continuum is an Fσ set (a countable union of closed sets). This is because a composant is a union of subcontinua, and it can be shown that a countable collection of them suffices.\n2.  **Mazurkiewicz's Theorem:** In any continuum, there can be **at most one** composant that is a Gδ set (a countable intersection of open sets).\n\nLet's use these facts to test the hypothesis that an indecomposable continuum X could have a countable number of composants.\n*   Assume X has a finite number `n > 1` of composants: `X = C₁ ∪ C₂ ∪ ... ∪ Cₙ`.\n*   Consider any composant `Cᵢ`. Its complement is `X \\ Cᵢ = C₁ ∪ ... ∪ Cᵢ₋₁ ∪ Cᵢ₊₁ ∪ ... ∪ Cₙ`.\n*   Since each `Cⱼ` is an Fσ set, their finite union `X \\ Cᵢ` is also an Fσ set.\n*   A set is a Gδ set if and only if its complement is an Fσ set. Therefore, `Cᵢ` must be a Gδ set.\n*   This argument applies to every `Cᵢ` for `i = 1, ..., n`. This would mean we have `n > 1` Gδ composants. This directly contradicts Mazurkiewicz's Theorem.\n*   Therefore, an indecomposable continuum cannot have a finite number of composants.\n\nThe same logic applies if we assume a countably infinite number of composants, `{C₁, C₂, C₃, ...}`. The complement of any `Cᵢ` is a countable union of other composants, which is a countable union of Fσ sets, and thus is an Fσ set. This implies every `Cᵢ` would be a Gδ set, again contradicting Mazurkiewicz's Theorem.\n\n### Step 4: Establish a lower bound for the number of composants\nFrom Step 3, we have proven that the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum must be **uncountable**.\n\nIn set theory, cardinal numbers are used to measure the size of sets. The smallest uncountable cardinal number is denoted by **Aleph-1** (or `ℵ₁`). Therefore, the number of composants must be at least `Aleph-1`.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if the lower bound is achievable\nThe question asks for the *smallest number a continuum can have*, which is the minimum possible value. We've established that the number must be ≥ `Aleph-1`. To show that `Aleph-1` is the minimum, we must confirm that it is possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly `Aleph-1` composants.\n\n*   **Metric Case:** For the familiar class of *metric* indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc or the Knaster bucket-handle), a famous theorem by Mazurkiewicz states that the number of composants is exactly **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, `2^ℵ₀`).\n*   **Non-Metric Case:** The problem explicitly allows for non-metric continua. The relationship between `Aleph-1` and `c` is not fixed by the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC).\n    *   If we assume the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), then `c = Aleph-1`, so the metric case already provides an example achieving the `Aleph-1` lower bound.\n    *   If we do not assume CH (`c > Aleph-1`), we must look for a non-metric example. Within set-theoretic topology, it is known to be consistent with ZFC that there exist indecomposable continua (such as certain \"Suslin continua\") whose cardinality is `Aleph-1`. The number of composants of a space cannot exceed its total cardinality. Since the number of composants for such a space must be uncountable (≥ `Aleph-1`) and cannot be more than its cardinality (`Aleph-1`), it must have exactly `Aleph-1` composants.\n\nSince there are models of set theory in which continua with `Aleph-1` composants exist, `Aleph-1` is a possible value.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\n1.  The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be uncountable.\n2.  The smallest uncountable cardinal is `Aleph-1`, setting a strict lower bound.\n3.  This lower bound is achievable (i.e., it is possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly `Aleph-1` composants).\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is `Aleph-1`.\n\n<<<Aleph_1>>>"
