    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Feynman Diagram**\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram in a perturbative expansion. Let's break down its components:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's label them V1 and V2. In a perturbative expansion, these vertices originate from interaction terms in the Lagrangian, e.g., from a term like `(λ/k!)φ^k`. Since there are two vertices, this diagram contributes to a second-order process.\n*   **Four field contractions:** A field contraction corresponds to a propagator, which is represented as a line in the diagram.\n*   **Topology:** For a connected diagram with two vertices and four lines, the only possible structure is that all four lines connect vertex V1 to vertex V2. This is sometimes called a \"setting-sun\" or \"watermelon\" diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor (S)**\nThe symmetry factor `S` is a combinatorial number that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams that arise during the application of Wick's theorem. It is the number of permutations of the internal lines and vertices of the diagram that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. The overall contribution of a diagram to a physical quantity is weighted by `1/S`.\n\n**Step 3: List the Careful Points and Identify Symmetries**\nTo find the total symmetry factor, we must identify all possible transformations (permutations) of the diagram's components that leave it invariant.\n\n1.  **Permutation of Internal Lines:**\n    *   The diagram has four internal lines (propagators) connecting the same two vertices, V1 and V2.\n    *   Assuming these propagators are for the same field, they are indistinguishable from one another.\n    *   We can swap any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram will look exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute four identical items is `4!` (4 factorial).\n    *   `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This symmetry arises because the lines are topologically equivalent—they start at V1 and end at V2.\n\n2.  **Permutation of Vertices:**\n    *   The diagram has two vertices, V1 and V2. These vertices arise from the second-order term `(1/2!) * (i∫L_int)²` in the Dyson series, which means they are identical.\n    *   We can swap the position of vertex V1 with vertex V2, and the diagram remains topologically identical. This is equivalent to flipping the diagram horizontally.\n    *   The number of ways to permute two identical items is `2!`.\n    *   `2! = 2 × 1 = 2`.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This symmetry exists because both vertices are of the same type and are connected in a symmetric way.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor**\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the symmetry factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n\n*   `S = (Symmetry from permuting lines) × (Symmetry from permuting vertices)`\n*   `S = 4! × 2!`\n*   `S = 24 × 2`\n*   `S = 48`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of permutations of the four identical lines (`4!`) and the number of permutations of the two identical vertices (`2!`).\nS = 4! * 2! = 24 * 2 = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
