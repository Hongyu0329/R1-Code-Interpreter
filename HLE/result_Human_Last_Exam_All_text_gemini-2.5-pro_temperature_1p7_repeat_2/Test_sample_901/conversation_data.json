    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are on the same side of the ring, making it a *cis* isomer.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base and favors elimination reactions.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The reaction conditions (secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base) strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton to be eliminated (β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be **trans-diaxial** (one axial-up and the other axial-down).\n\n3.  **Draw the Chair Conformations of the Reactant:**\n    *   The substrate is cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. It exists in equilibrium between two chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformer A:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial. Let's assume Br is axial-up; then CH₃ is equatorial-up.\n    *   **Conformer B:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial. Let's assume Br is equatorial-up; then CH₃ is axial-up.\n    *   Bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). The methyl group (A-value ~1.7 kcal/mol) is significantly bulkier than bromine (A-value ~0.4-0.6 kcal/mol). Therefore, **Conformer A (Br-axial, CH₃-equatorial) is the more stable and more populated conformer.**\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways:**\n    *   For the E2 reaction to occur, the bromine atom must be in an **axial** position. This means the reaction proceeds through the more stable Conformer A.\n    *   We need to find β-hydrogens that are axial and anti (opposite face) to the axial bromine. In Conformer A, the Br is axial-up. We need to find hydrogens that are axial-down on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has the equatorial-up methyl group. Therefore, its hydrogen must be **axial-down**. This hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the bromine. Elimination of this H would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens, one equatorial-up and one **axial-down**. The axial-down hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the bromine. Elimination of this H would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule):**\n    *   Since both elimination pathways are stereochemically allowed from the major conformer, we must consider the nature of the base to determine the major product.\n    *   **Zaitsev's Rule:** Predicts the more substituted (and thus more stable) alkene will be the major product. This is favored by small, strong bases (e.g., NaOEt). 1-methylcyclohexene is a trisubstituted alkene (more stable).\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule:** Predicts the less substituted alkene will be the major product. This is favored when a bulky base is used, as the base will abstract the most sterically accessible proton. 3-methylcyclohexene is a disubstituted alkene (less stable).\n    *   In this reaction, the base is potassium tert-butoxide, which is a classic **bulky base**. Due to its large size, it will preferentially abstract the less sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is on a -CH₂- group and is more accessible than the proton on C2, which is adjacent to the equatorial methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n    *   It proceeds through the more stable conformer where Br is axial and CH₃ is equatorial.\n    *   The bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) preferentially removes the most accessible anti-periplanar proton, which is on C6.\n    *   The resulting product is the less substituted alkene.\n    *   The name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
