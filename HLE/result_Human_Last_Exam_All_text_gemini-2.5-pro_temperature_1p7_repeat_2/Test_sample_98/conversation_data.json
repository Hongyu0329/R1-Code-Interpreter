    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical faces, where each face is an equilateral triangle. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n*   **The Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Water Level**\n*   The water surface will always be a horizontal plane. We need to find the height of this plane.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a highly symmetrical object. When it rests on a face, it has a corresponding parallel face at the very top.\n*   A horizontal plane that passes exactly through the center of the icosahedron will be equidistant from the top face and the bottom face. Due to the perfect symmetry of the shape, this central plane will divide the icosahedron's volume into two equal halves.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must coincide with this central, horizontal plane of symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Shape of the Cross-Section**\n*   The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with this central horizontal plane.\n*   To figure out this shape, we can consider the arrangement of the icosahedron's vertices relative to the base.\n    *   There are 3 vertices forming the bottom triangular face.\n    *   There are 3 vertices forming the parallel top triangular face.\n    *   The remaining 6 vertices are arranged in a \"belt\" around the middle of the icosahedron, exactly on the central horizontal plane that bisects the volume.\n\n*   An alternative way to think about this is by considering the edges cut by the central plane.\n    *   The central plane separates the icosahedron into a top half and a bottom half. The 6 vertices of the top half are a mirror image of the 6 vertices of the bottom half.\n    *   The plane will intersect any edge that connects a vertex in the top half to a vertex in the bottom half.\n    *   Let's analyze the connectivity. The icosahedron can be seen as a top \"cap\" of 5 triangles meeting at a vertex (if stood on a vertex), a bottom cap, and a middle belt. When stood on a face, the structure is different: it has a top triangular face, a bottom triangular face, and a \"belt\" of 18 other triangles wrapped around the middle.\n    *   The central slicing plane will cut through a ring of faces around the middle of the icosahedron.\n    *   Let's focus on symmetry. The icosahedron, when standing on a face, has a 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis passing through the center of the top and bottom faces.\n    *   This means the cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   Furthermore, there are vertical mirror planes of symmetry passing through the vertices of the base triangle. The cross-section must also be symmetric with respect to these planes.\n    *   If we count the number of edges that are cut by this central plane, we find there are 6 such edges. These edges form a zigzag pattern around the equator of the icosahedron.\n    *   The points where the plane cuts these 6 edges form the vertices of the water surface shape.\n    *   A 6-sided polygon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and mirror planes of symmetry must be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe water surface is a horizontal plane that bisects the icosahedron's volume. This plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron to form the perimeter of the surface shape. Due to the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron in this orientation, the resulting cross-section is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<Regular hexagon>>>"
