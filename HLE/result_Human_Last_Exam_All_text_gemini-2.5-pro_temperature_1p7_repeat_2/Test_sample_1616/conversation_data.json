    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (TSL) is a historical sound change in English where a long vowel in a stressed syllable becomes short when that syllable becomes the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word), usually due to the addition of a suffix.\n\nKey conditions for TSL to apply:\n1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n2.  The vowel in question must have been long in an earlier stage of English (e.g., Middle English).\n3.  This long vowel must be in the antepenultimate (third-to-last) syllable.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word against the TSL criteria.**\n\n*   **derivative**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables). This meets the syllable count requirement.\n    2.  **Related word & Vowel History:** The base word is `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel sound /aɪ/ developed from the Middle English long vowel /iː/.\n    3.  **Application of TSL:** In `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/), the syllable `-riv-` is now the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel sound of `derive` has become the short vowel /ɪ/.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** `derivative` is a classic example of a word that **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables). This meets the syllable count requirement.\n    2.  **Related word & Vowel History:** The base word is `serene` (/səˈriːn/). The vowel sound /iː/ corresponds to the Middle English long vowel /eː/.\n    3.  **Application of TSL:** In `serenity` (/səˈrɛnɪti/), the syllable `-ren-` is now the antepenultimate syllable. The long vowel sound of `serene` has become the short vowel /ɛ/.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** `serenity` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables). This meets the syllable count requirement.\n    2.  **Related word & Vowel History:** Consider the related word `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), which preserves the long vowel sound /eɪ/. This long vowel is derived from Latin `grātus` (with a long 'ā').\n    3.  **Application of TSL:** In `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/), the first syllable `grat-` is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel has been shortened to /æ/.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** `gratitude` **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **southern**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    2.  **Conclusion:** The word is disyllabic (has only two syllables), so it cannot undergo **tri**syllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    2.  **Conclusion:** The word is disyllabic, so it cannot undergo **tri**syllabic laxing. (While the vowel is short /ɛ/ compared to the long /iː/ in the related word `please`, this shortening is due to a different phonological process, not TSL).\n\n*   **shadow**\n    1.  **Syllables:** `shad-ow` (2 syllables). The word is disyllabic and cannot undergo TSL.\n    2.  **Vowel History:** More importantly, this word comes from Old English *sceadu*, where the first vowel ('ea') was already short. It was never a long vowel that needed shortening. The related word `shade` comes from a different form of the same Old English word where the vowel was long.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** `shadow` has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it is not a trisyllabic word, and more fundamentally, its vowel was historically short, meaning there was no long vowel to be laxed in the first place.\n\n**Step 3: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nThe words `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` are all examples that *did* undergo trisyllabic laxing.\n\nThe words `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` did not undergo trisyllabic laxing, primarily because they are not trisyllabic. However, `shadow` is the strongest answer because its vowel was *never long* in its direct line of development, so no shortening process (laxing) could have applied to it. The other two (`southern`, `pleasant`) show vowel shortening relative to their root words (`south`, `please`), but via a mechanism other than TSL. `Shadow` inherited its short vowel directly. Therefore, it is the clearest case of a word that has not undergone this process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
