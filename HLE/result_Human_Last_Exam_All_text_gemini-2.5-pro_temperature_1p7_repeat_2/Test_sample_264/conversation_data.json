    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Set up a Coordinate System and Define the First Cube**\nTo make the problem easy to analyze, we can place the first cube in a coordinate system. The most convenient placement is to have one of its corners at the origin (0, 0, 0) and its edges aligned with the coordinate axes.\n\n*   Let the first cube, C1, occupy the region in space where:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n*   The side length of this cube is 1, and its volume is `1 × 1 × 1 = 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Shift and Define the Second Cube**\nThe problem states the cubes are \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other\".\n\n*   **Careful Point: Interpreting the Shift.** The \"main diagonal\" of our first cube C1 connects the origin corner (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **d** = (1, 1, 1). A shift \"along the main diagonal\" means the shift vector is parallel to **d**. The phrase \"by 1/2\" is most commonly interpreted in this context to mean a shift by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This is a simple and elegant interpretation where the corner of the second cube is moved to the exact center of the first cube.\n\n*   The second cube, C2, is a copy of C1 shifted by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). We find the coordinates of C2 by adding 1/2 to the bounds of C1:\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n    *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Region of Intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the conditions for *both* C1 and C2. We find the intersecting intervals for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must have an x-value that is in `[0, 1]` (from C1) AND in `[1/2, 3/2]` (from C2). The overlap of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, the y-value must be in `[0, 1]` AND in `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The z-value must be in `[0, 1]` AND in `[1/2, 3/2]`. The overlap is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nSo, the intersection forms a smaller cube defined by:\n`1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n`1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe intersection is a cube. We can calculate its side length from the coordinate bounds.\n\n*   Side length = (upper bound) - (lower bound) = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n*   Volume of intersection = `(1/2) × (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
