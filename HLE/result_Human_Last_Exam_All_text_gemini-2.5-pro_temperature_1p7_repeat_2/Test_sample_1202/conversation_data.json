    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most probable (i.e., \"most likely\") molecular mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n    *   **Retention:** Both the original gene and its new copy are kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than one being lost.\n    *   **Divergence:** The DNA sequences of the two gene copies change and become different from each other.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. This process makes the two gene copies *more similar* or even identical. Therefore, it works directly *against* divergence. This choice is incorrect.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where one copy accumulates harmful mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). While this involves sequence divergence, it fails the \"retention\" criterion because a functional copy of the gene is lost, not retained. The organism is left with only one functional version, just as before the duplication. This choice is incorrect.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one duplicate gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations, one of which eventually confers a completely new, beneficial function.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, both copies are retained because one performs the original essential function and the other provides a new advantage.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the gene copy must diverge to acquire a new function.\n        *   This is a valid and important mechanism.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, this theory proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions (it was pleiotropic). After duplication, degenerative mutations occur in both copies. One copy might lose function 'X' but keep function 'Y', while the other copy loses function 'Y' but keeps 'X'. As a result, both gene copies are now required to carry out the full set of the original ancestral functions.\n        *   **Retention:** Yes, both copies are retained because they complement each other, and losing either one would result in the loss of an essential function.\n        *   **Divergence:** Yes, the accumulation of different degenerative mutations in each copy causes their sequences to diverge.\n        *   This is also a valid and important mechanism.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern concerning the rapid diversification of species, not a molecular mechanism acting on individual genes within a genome. While gene duplication can provide the raw material for adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism of retention itself. This choice is on the wrong biological scale and is incorrect.\n\n3.  **Compare Neofunctionalization (C) vs. Subfunctionalization (D):**\n    *   The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. This requires comparing the probability of these two valid pathways.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** depends on a rare event: a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation. Before such a rare mutation occurs, the duplicate gene is redundant and has no selective advantage, making it highly susceptible to being lost through pseudogenization.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** depends on much more common events: degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. A mutation that impairs one of a gene's several functions is far more probable than a mutation that creates a new one. This model provides a quick and robust path to preserving both gene copies, as they rapidly become co-dependent.\n    *   Because the mutations required for subfunctionalization are more frequent than those required for neofunctionalization, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more common, and thus \"more likely,\" mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, based on the relative probabilities of the underlying mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered the more likely pathway for preserving a new gene duplicate from being lost, thus making it the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
