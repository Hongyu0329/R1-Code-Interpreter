    "This is a 3D packing problem. We want to find the maximum number of `9 x 1 x 1` blocks that can fit into a `15 x 15 x 15` cube.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Dimensions\n\n*   **Cube Dimensions:** 15 units x 15 units x 15 units.\n*   **Block Dimensions:** 9 units x 1 unit x 1 unit.\n\nThe key to packing problems is understanding how the dimensions of the object to be packed (the block) relate to the dimensions of the container (the cube). Here, the block's length is 9, which does not evenly divide the cube's edge length of 15.\n`15 = 1 * 9 + 6`. This means that if we align the 9-unit length of the blocks along any axis of the cube, there will be a leftover space of 6 units along that axis.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Volume-Based Upper Bound\n\nA simple first step is to compare volumes. This will give us a theoretical maximum, although it may not be achievable due to geometric constraints.\n\n*   **Volume of the cube:** `15 * 15 * 15 = 3375` cubic units.\n*   **Volume of one block:** `9 * 1 * 1 = 9` cubic units.\n*   **Theoretical maximum number of blocks:** `Volume of Cube / Volume of Block = 3375 / 9 = 375`.\n\nSo, we know that we can fit at most 375 blocks. Now we need to see if a physical arrangement allows for this number.\n\n### Step 3: Develop a Greedy Packing Strategy\n\nA common and effective method for such problems is a \"greedy\" strategy, where we fill the space in layers or sections, maximizing the number of blocks at each step.\n\n1.  **First Section:** Let's align the 9-unit length of the blocks with one of the cube's axes, say the X-axis.\n    *   Along the X-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the Y-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   This creates a packed section of size `9 x 15 x 15`.\n    *   **Number of blocks in this section:** `1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n\n2.  **Remaining Space after First Section:** After filling the `9 x 15 x 15` section, we are left with a smaller rectangular prism of space.\n    *   **Remaining space dimensions:** `(15 - 9) x 15 x 15 = 6 x 15 x 15`.\n\n3.  **Second Section:** Now, we must pack blocks into this `6 x 15 x 15` space. We can't align the 9-unit length along the 6-unit dimension. We must use one of the 15-unit dimensions. Let's align the 9-unit length with the Y-axis.\n    *   Along the X-axis (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Y-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   This creates a packed section of size `6 x 9 x 15`.\n    *   **Number of blocks in this section:** `6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n\n4.  **Remaining Space after Second Section:** This second packing leaves an even smaller block of space.\n    *   **Remaining space dimensions:** `6 x (15 - 9) x 15 = 6 x 6 x 15`.\n\n5.  **Third Section:** We repeat the process for the `6 x 6 x 15` space. The only dimension that can accommodate the 9-unit length is the 15-unit one (the Z-axis).\n    *   Along the X-axis (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Y-axis (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   This creates a packed section of size `6 x 6 x 9`.\n    *   **Number of blocks in this section:** `6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n\n6.  **Final Remaining Space:** The last packing leaves a final small cube of space.\n    *   **Remaining space dimensions:** `6 x 6 x (15 - 9) = 6 x 6 x 6`.\n\n7.  **Waste Space:** Can we fit any `9 x 1 x 1` blocks into a `6 x 6 x 6` cube? No, because the block's longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the remaining space (6). This space is wasted.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Blocks\n\nTo get the final answer, we sum the number of blocks from each section of our packing.\n*   Total blocks = (Blocks from section 1) + (Blocks from section 2) + (Blocks from section 3)\n*   Total blocks = `225 + 90 + 36 = 351`.\n\n### Step 5: Verification (Careful Points)\n*   **Is this arrangement optimal?** The greedy layering strategy is generally optimal for packing identical rectangular bricks into a larger rectangular box.\n*   **Does the wasted volume match?** The wasted space is a `6x6x6` cube, which has a volume of `216` cubic units. The volume of our 351 blocks is `351 * 9 = 3159`. The total volume of the large cube is `3375`. The unaccounted for volume is `3375 - 3159 = 216`. This matches the volume of our leftover `6x6x6` cube, confirming our calculation.\n*   **Could the wasted space be rearranged to fit more blocks?** No, because this specific layered packing method systematically reduces the problem size, and at each stage, it packs a rectangular sub-region perfectly. The final leftover region (`6x6x6`) is demonstrably too small to fit any more blocks. Any other packing arrangement would have to find a way to utilize this `216` unit volume, which is not possible in `9x1x1` chunks if it's shaped as a `6x6x6` cube. It is not possible to leave the waste in a different shape, such as `24x9x1`, because the geometry is constrained by the `15 = 9+6` relationship.\n\nThe analysis shows that this construction is valid and accounts for all the available space, thus 351 is the maximum number of blocks that will fit.\n\n<<<351>>>"
