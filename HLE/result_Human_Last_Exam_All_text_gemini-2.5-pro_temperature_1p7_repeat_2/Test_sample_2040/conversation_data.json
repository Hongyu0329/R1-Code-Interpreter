    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to understand the key terms in the question:\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). The key takeaway is that this is a **second-order nonlinear optical process**.\n*   **Boron Nanosheets:** These are two-dimensional (2D), single-atom-thick sheets of boron, also known as **borophene**. They are the boron analogue to carbon's graphene.\n*   **Free-standing:** This specifies that the nanosheet is not on a substrate. It exists in isolation, so we only need to consider the properties of the boron sheet itself, not the combined system of a sheet and a substrate.\n*   **Excited by incident light:** This provides the \"pump\" photons required to initiate a process like SPDC.\n\nThe core of the question is: Does borophene possess the necessary properties for a second-order nonlinear optical process like SPDC?\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Material Property Required for SPDC\n\nThe efficiency of any second-order nonlinear optical process, including SPDC and the more commonly discussed Second-Harmonic Generation (SHG), is governed by the material's **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$** (chi-two).\n*   If $\\chi^{(2)} = 0$, the material cannot exhibit SPDC.\n*   If $\\chi^{(2)} \\neq 0$, the material can, in principle, exhibit SPDC.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Material Property ($\\chi^{(2)}$) to Crystal Symmetry\n\nThere is a fundamental rule in physics that links a material's properties to its crystal structure symmetry.\n*   For the bulk electric dipole contribution to the second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) to be non-zero, the material's crystal lattice **must lack a center of inversion** (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n*   In a centrosymmetric material, applying an electric field $\\vec{E}$ and an inverted field $-\\vec{E}$ must lead to an inverted polarization vector $\\vec{P}$. The second-order polarization is proportional to $E^2$. Since $(-E)^2 = E^2$, the polarization would not invert, which creates a contradiction. To resolve this, the response must be zero. Therefore, in any material with inversion symmetry, the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Crystal Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets\n\nThe crucial step is to determine if free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n*   Unlike graphene's single, perfect hexagonal lattice, borophene can exist in several different structural phases (polymorphs).\n*   The most commonly studied and synthesized stable phases of borophene, such as the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ phases, are based on a triangular boron lattice with a periodic arrangement of hexagonal vacancies.\n*   Let's examine the symmetry of these ideal, flat, pristine structures. Both the $\\beta_{12}$ sheet (space group *Pmmn*) and the $\\chi_3$ sheet (space group *Cmmm*) **possess a center of inversion**. You can pick a point (e.g., the center of a hexagonal hole) and find that for every atom at a position $(x, y, z)$ relative to that point, there is an identical atom at $(-x, -y, -z)$.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize and Draw the Primary Conclusion\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process requiring a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets in their common stable phases are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on fundamental symmetry principles, ideal, pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets would **not** be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### Step 6: List Careful Points and Nuances\n\nWhile the primary conclusion is \"no,\" a complete analysis must consider deviations from the ideal case. SPDC *could* potentially occur, albeit very weakly, if the inversion symmetry is broken. Here are the careful points to consider:\n\n1.  **Edges and Finite Size:** A real nanosheet is finite. The edges of the sheet inherently break the inversion symmetry. This can lead to a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ response, but it would be localized at the edges and likely a very small overall effect for a large sheet.\n2.  **Defects and Doping:** Point defects (like vacancies or interstitials) or the introduction of dopant atoms can break the local symmetry of the lattice, leading to a weak, localized $\\chi^{(2)}$ response.\n3.  **Strain and Wrinkles:** The term \"free-standing\" does not guarantee \"perfectly flat.\" Real 2D materials often have ripples, wrinkles, or are subject to non-uniform strain. This curvature breaks the perfect 2D inversion symmetry and can induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n4.  **External Fields:** Applying a strong, static DC electric field across the nanosheet can artificially break the inversion symmetry and induce a second-order response. This is a well-known effect (Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic Generation, or EFISH).\n5.  **Higher-Order Contributions:** Even with a zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$, there can be extremely weak second-order effects arising from electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions, which have different symmetry selection rules. For 2D materials, these \"surface\" effects are relevant across the entire sheet but are generally several orders of magnitude weaker than a typical bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ response.\n\n### Final Answer Summary\n\nTo summarize the analysis: The fundamental, ideal crystal structure of common borophene phases is centrosymmetric. This property forbids second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC. Therefore, as an intrinsic property, borophene is not expected to exhibit SPDC. However, real-world effects such as edges, defects, and wrinkles break this perfect symmetry and could permit a very weak, non-intrinsic SPDC effect.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero. While real-world effects like edges, defects, or wrinkles could break this symmetry and permit a very weak response, it is not an expected intrinsic property of the material.>>>"
