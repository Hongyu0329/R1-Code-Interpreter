No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). A non-zero $\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their intrinsic bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ is zero. While real-world effects like edges, defects, or wrinkles could break this symmetry and permit a very weak response, it is not an expected intrinsic property of the material.
