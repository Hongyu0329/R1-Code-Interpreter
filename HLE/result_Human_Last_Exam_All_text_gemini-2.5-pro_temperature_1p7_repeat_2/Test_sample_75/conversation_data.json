    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: The Second Great War is the central conflict portrayed throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*) and its epilogue, *Into the Void*. It encompasses multiple interconnected conflicts, including the Zerg's renewed invasion, the Terran Dominion civil war, Kerrigan's campaign against Mengsk, and the ultimate war against the dark god Amon and his forces.\n\n2.  **Establish the Start Date**: The war is universally considered to have begun with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, specifically their attacks on Dominion fringe worlds like Mar Sara. This marks the beginning of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, these events start in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Establish the End Date**: The war's climax and conclusion are not the defeat of Arcturus Mengsk, but the final defeat of the ultimate antagonist, Amon. This final confrontation happens in the epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*, where the combined forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss assault Amon in his home dimension. The timeline places the events of the *Into the Void* epilogue, and thus the end of the war, in the year **2508**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**:\n    *   Start Year: 2504\n    *   End Year: 2508\n    *   The war's events span across the years 2504, 2505 (*Heart of the Swarm*), 2506 (*Legacy of the Void* begins), and 2508 (*Into the Void*).\n    *   This means the conflict lasted for a duration that started in 2504 and ended in 2508. The minimum possible time would be if it started on December 31st, 2504, and ended on January 1st, 2508, which is 3 years and 1 day.\n    *   Since the campaigns themselves take several weeks or months, the total time elapsed is certainly greater than 3 full years. Subtracting the start year from the end year (2508 - 2504) gives a rough span of 4 years.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule**: The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since the calculated duration is greater than 3 years (e.g., 3 years and some number of months), rounding it up to the next whole year results in 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"War\"**: It's important to consider the entire story arc of *StarCraft II* as a single, overarching conflict (The Second Great War), rather than separate, isolated campaigns. The events are directly sequential and causally linked.\n*   **Timeline Specificity**: StarCraft lore provides years for major events but rarely gives specific months or days. This necessitates an estimation based on the start and end years.\n*   **Rounding Direction**: The instruction to \"round up\" is crucial. Any duration that is not an exact whole number of years (e.g., 3.1 years) must be rounded to the next highest integer. Given the war starts in one year and ends four years later, its duration is guaranteed to be greater than 3 years, so rounding up leads to 4.\n\nBy following this analysis, we can confidently determine the war's length as requested.\n\n<<<4>>>"
