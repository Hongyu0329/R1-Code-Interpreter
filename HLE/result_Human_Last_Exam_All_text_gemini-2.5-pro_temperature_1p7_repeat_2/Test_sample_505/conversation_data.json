    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **System:** Surface Code. This is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code.\n    *   **Components:** \"Two patches\". This means we have two separate, independent areas of physical qubits, each implementing a surface code. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n    *   **Features:** \"Two holes\". Holes are defects intentionally created within a patch of surface code to increase its capacity for storing logical qubits. We have a total of two holes to distribute across the two patches.\n\n2.  **How Logical Qubits are Encoded in a Surface Code Patch:**\n    *   A single, standard, planar patch of surface code (with no holes) is designed to encode **one** logical qubit. This is the baseline.\n    *   Each time a hole is introduced into a patch, it creates a new internal boundary. This new boundary can be paired with an existing boundary (either the outer edge or another hole's boundary) to define a new, independent logical qubit.\n    *   Therefore, the number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single patch with `h` holes follows the formula:\n        `k = 1 + h`\n        (1 for the base patch + 1 for each hole).\n\n3.  **Analyze Possible Configurations:**\n    We have two patches (let's call them Patch A and Patch B) and two holes to distribute among them. We need to find the configuration that maximizes the total number of logical qubits. The total is `k_total = k_A + k_B`.\n\n    There are two possible ways to distribute the two holes:\n\n    *   **Configuration 1: Both holes in one patch.**\n        *   Patch A is given 2 holes (`h_A = 2`).\n        *   Patch B is given 0 holes (`h_B = 0`).\n        *   **Calculation:**\n            *   Logical qubits in Patch A: `k_A = 1 + h_A = 1 + 2 = 3`\n            *   Logical qubits in Patch B: `k_B = 1 + h_B = 1 + 0 = 1`\n            *   **Total logical qubits = `k_A + k_B = 3 + 1 = 4`**\n\n    *   **Configuration 2: One hole in each patch.**\n        *   Patch A is given 1 hole (`h_A = 1`).\n        *   Patch B is given 1 hole (`h_B = 1`).\n        *   **Calculation:**\n            *   Logical qubits in Patch A: `k_A = 1 + h_A = 1 + 1 = 2`\n            *   Logical qubits in Patch B: `k_B = 1 + h_B = 1 + 1 = 2`\n            *   **Total logical qubits = `k_A + k_B = 2 + 2 = 4`**\n\n4.  **Determine the Maximum:**\n    Both possible configurations for distributing the two holes result in the same total number of logical qubits: 4. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Patches vs. Holes:** It is crucial to distinguish between the number of patches and the number of holes. We start with two base units (the patches), each capable of holding at least one qubit.\n*   **Independence:** The patches are separate, so their logical qubit capacities are simply added together.\n*   **Counting Formula:** The core of the problem is knowing the rule `k = 1 + h` for a single patch. A common mistake is to assume a patch with `h` holes only stores `h` qubits, forgetting the one qubit encoded by the patch itself.\n*   **\"At Most\":** The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\"). This requires checking all possible distributions of the given resources (the holes) and selecting the largest outcome. In this particular case, all valid distributions yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the maximum number of logical qubits is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
