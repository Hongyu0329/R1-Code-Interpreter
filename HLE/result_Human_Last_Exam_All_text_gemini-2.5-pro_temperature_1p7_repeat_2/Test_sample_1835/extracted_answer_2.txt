Yes. According to the Generality Constraint, understanding the proposition `Fa` means you possess a general, reusable concept of the predicate `F` that is not fused to the concept of the object `a`. The second premise states you also possess the conceptual resource for universal quantification (`∀x...`). The core principle of the Generality Constraint is that thought is systematic and compositional. Therefore, if you possess the distinct conceptual parts—the predicate `F` and the logical structure of universal quantification—you must be able to combine them to understand the well-formed proposition `∀x Fx`. To deny this would be to impose an arbitrary limit on the recombinability of concepts, undermining the very spirit of the Constraint.
