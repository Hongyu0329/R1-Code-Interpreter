    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1**: Butadiene (specifically buta-1,3-diene), with the structure CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This is a conjugated diene.\n*   **Reactant 2**: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, with the structure CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile rearrange in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Mechanism and Basic Product Structure**\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, a cyclohexene ring is formed.\n*   The diene (butadiene) must adopt an s-cis conformation for the reaction to occur.\n*   New single bonds form between the terminal carbons of the diene (C1 and C4) and the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n*   The double bond in the new cyclohexene ring is formed between the central carbons of the original diene (C2 and C3).\n*   The double bond of the dienophile is converted into a single bond.\n\nThe basic transformation is:\n(Diene) + (Dienophile) → (Cyclohexene derivative)\n\n**Step 3: Consider Regioselectivity**\n*   Regioselectivity determines which way the reactants add to each other when one or both are unsymmetrical.\n*   **Butadiene**: This diene is symmetrical. C1 is equivalent to C4.\n*   **1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**: This dienophile is unsymmetrical. The two carbons of the double bond are different; one is bonded to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n*   Since the dienophile is unsymmetrical, there are two possible ways it can add to the symmetrical diene, leading to two possible constitutional isomers (regioisomers). We need to predict which one is the major product.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the Major Regioisomer**\n*   The regioselectivity of the Diels-Alder reaction is governed by electronic effects, which can be understood using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory. The reaction involves the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of one reactant and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the other.\n*   This is a \"normal electron demand\" Diels-Alder reaction, where the electron-rich diene (HOMO) reacts with the electron-poor dienophile (LUMO).\n*   The dienophile is electron-poor due to the electron-withdrawing halogen atoms.\n*   To predict the orientation, we identify the most electrophilic (electron-poor) carbon in the dienophile.\n*   Both fluorine and chlorine are highly electronegative and withdraw electron density inductively. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine. Therefore, the inductive pull from the two fluorine atoms is stronger than that from the two chlorine atoms.\n*   This polarizes the double bond, making the CF₂ carbon more electron-deficient (more δ+) and the CCl₂ carbon less electron-deficient (more δ-).\n*   The reaction will be fastest when the most nucleophilic carbon of the diene (a terminal carbon, C1 or C4) attacks the most electrophilic carbon of the dienophile (the CF₂ carbon).\n*   Therefore, the major product will be formed by the following alignment:\n    *   A bond forms between a terminal carbon of butadiene and the CF₂ carbon.\n    *   A bond forms between the other terminal carbon of butadiene and the CCl₂ carbon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Structure and Name of the Final Product**\n*   Let's draw the formation of the major product:\n    `CH₂(1)=CH(2)−CH(3)=CH₂(4)` + `CF₂(a)=CCl₂(b)`\n    The new bonds are C(1)–C(a) and C(4)–C(b).\n*   This results in a cyclohexene ring with the following connectivity: `–CH₂(1)–CH(2)=CH(3)–CH₂(4)–CCl₂(b)–CF₂(a)–`\n*   **Structure:**\n    ```\n             CH=CH\n            /     \\\n    H₂C          CH₂\n     |            |\n    F₂C----------CCl₂\n    ```\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  Number the carbons of the double bond as 1 and 2.\n    3.  Number the rest of the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers (locants).\n    4.  Let's number the double bond so that the carbon attached to the CH₂-CCl₂ side is C3. This gives the lowest locant set.\n    ```\n            CH(1)=CH(2)\n           /       \\\n    H₂C(6)          CH₂(3)\n     \\               /\n     F₂C(5)-------CCl₂(4)\n    ```\n    5.  This numbering scheme gives the chloro groups the locant 4 and the fluoro groups the locant 5. The locant set is (4,4,5,5).\n    6.  If we numbered in the opposite direction (C=C as 1,2 but C3 is the CH₂-CF₂ side), the chloro groups would be at 5 and the fluoro groups at 4. The locant set is still (4,4,5,5).\n    7.  When there is a tie in locant sets, alphabetical order determines the numbering. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\". Therefore, the chloro group should receive the lower number.\n    8.  The correct name assigns C4 to the CCl₂ group.\n\nThe final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
