    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main elements of the question.**\n*   **Book Title:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Question:** What is the name of the character that the main character marries?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who is resurrected in the far future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot to find the marriage event.**\nThe novel's plot revolves around Adam's adaptation to a post-human universe. A central figure in his journey is a highly advanced post-human entity (a \"phoebe\") who is his guide, owner, and mentor. Her name is Angelika.\n\n**Step 4: Understand the nature of the \"marriage\".**\nThe concept of \"marriage\" in this far-future setting is not a traditional human ceremony. The relationship between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika evolves throughout the story. Initially, it's a relationship of a primitive being (Adam) and a superior one (Angelika). However, their bond deepens significantly.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the climactic union.**\nTowards the end of the novel, Adam undergoes massive transformations and \"upgrades\" to reach a level of existence comparable to Angelika's. Their relationship culminates in a permanent, symbiotic union where they essentially merge into a single, more powerful entity to confront the ultimate cosmic threat in the story. This transcendent merging is the novel's equivalent of a marriage—a final, unbreakable bond.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's crucial to recognize that the term \"marries\" should be interpreted within the context of the book's complex, science-fiction world. A literal, 21st-century-style wedding does not occur.\n*   The character in question is the central female figure with whom the protagonist forms the most profound and permanent connection.\n*   Confirming the character's name is essential. The character who guides and ultimately joins with Adam Zamoyski is consistently referred to as Angelika.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a permanent, transformative union, which is the conceptual equivalent of marriage in the novel's context, with the character named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
