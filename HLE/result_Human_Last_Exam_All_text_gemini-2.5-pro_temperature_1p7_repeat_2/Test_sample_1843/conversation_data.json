    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of primitive Dirichlet characters\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$. Let the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$. Then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be written as:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r $$\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nTwo key properties of this decomposition are:\n1.  **Primitivity:** The character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$, denoted $o(\\chi)$, is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $o(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), o(\\chi_2), \\dots, o(\\chi_r))$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of such characters $\\chi$ where the conductor is $N=36036$ and the order is $k=6$.\n\n### Step 2: Prime Factorization of the Conductor N\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$$ N = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) $$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\nAny primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N$ must be of the form $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character with conductor $p^a$.\n\n### Step 3: Count Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\n\nWe need to determine the number of primitive characters for each factor, and their possible orders. Let $\\psi_k(m)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $k$.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There are $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The trivial character is not primitive (its conductor is 1). The other character is primitive. Its order is 2.\n    -   Possible orders for primitive characters: {2}.\n    -   Number of choices: $\\psi_2(4) = 1$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. There are $\\phi(9)=6$ characters. The characters that are not primitive mod 9 are those induced from characters mod 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters (of order 1 and 2).\n    Therefore, the primitive characters mod 9 are the remaining $6-2=4$ characters. Their orders cannot be 1 or 2. Since the character group is $C_6$, the available orders are 3 and 6.\n    -   Number of characters of order 3 in $C_6$: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    -   Number of characters of order 6 in $C_6$: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    -   Possible orders for primitive characters: {3, 6}.\n    -   Number of choices: $\\psi_3(9) = 2$, $\\psi_6(9) = 2$. Total = 4.\n\n*   **Conductor 7:**\n    For a prime $p$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$.\n    -   Possible orders: {2, 3, 6}.\n    -   Number of choices: $\\psi_2(7)=\\phi(2)=1$, $\\psi_3(7)=\\phi(3)=2$, $\\psi_6(7)=\\phi(6)=2$. Total = 5.\n\n*   **Conductor 11:**\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    -   Possible orders: {2, 5, 10}.\n    -   Number of choices: $\\psi_2(11)=\\phi(2)=1$, $\\psi_5(11)=\\phi(5)=4$, $\\psi_{10}(11)=\\phi(10)=4$. Total = 9.\n\n*   **Conductor 13:**\n    The character group is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive.\n    -   Possible orders: {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n    -   Number of choices: $\\psi_2(13)=1$, $\\psi_3(13)=2$, $\\psi_4(13)=2$, $\\psi_6(13)=2$, $\\psi_{12}(13)=4$. Total = 11.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results to find Characters of Order 6\n\nWe need to choose a primitive character for each factor such that the least common multiple of their orders is 6.\n$$ \\operatorname{lcm}(o(\\chi_4), o(\\chi_9), o(\\chi_7), o(\\chi_{11}), o(\\chi_{13})) = 6 $$\nA necessary condition for the lcm to be 6 is that the order of each component character, $o(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6. Let's filter the choices from Step 3 based on this condition.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: The only possible order is 2, which divides 6.\n    - Number of choices: 1 (the one of order 2).\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: Possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6.\n    - Number of choices: $2+2=4$.\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: Possible orders are 2, 3, 6. All divide 6.\n    - Number of choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: Possible orders are 2, 5, 10. Only 2 divides 6.\n    - Number of choices: 1 (the one of order 2).\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: Possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6.\n    - Number of choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n\nNow, let's consider any character $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ formed by selecting one character for each component from these filtered lists. Let $k_i = o(\\chi_i)$.\n1.  Since every $k_i$ is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. So $o(\\chi) | 6$.\n2.  The choice for $\\chi_4$ is fixed: $o(\\chi_4)=2$. Therefore, $o(\\chi)$ must be a multiple of 2.\n3.  The choices for $\\chi_9$ have orders 3 or 6. In either case, $o(\\chi_9)$ is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $o(\\chi)$ must be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince $o(\\chi)$ is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\operatorname{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\nCombining this with $o(\\chi)|6$, we conclude that the order of any character constructed this way must be exactly 6.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product of the number of available choices for each component character.\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = (\\text{Choices for } \\chi_4) \\times (\\text{Choices for } \\chi_9) \\times (\\text{Choices for } \\chi_7) \\times (\\text{Choices for } \\chi_{11}) \\times (\\text{Choices for } \\chi_{13}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = 1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 $$\n$$ \\text{Total Number} = 100 $$\n\nThere are 100 such characters."
