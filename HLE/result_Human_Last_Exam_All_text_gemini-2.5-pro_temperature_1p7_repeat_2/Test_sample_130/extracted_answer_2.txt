The edges of the image will be progressively smoothed, rounding off sharp corners and reducing jaggedness. This process is driven by local curvature; convex shapes will shrink and concave regions will be filled in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, any bounded shapes will eventually be eliminated (either shrinking to disappearance or being completely filled). Consequently, the edges that define these shapes will retreat, simplify, and ultimately vanish, causing the image to converge to a monochrome state (all black or all white) unless the initial state is a trivial case like a perfect half-black, half-white image separated by a straight line.
