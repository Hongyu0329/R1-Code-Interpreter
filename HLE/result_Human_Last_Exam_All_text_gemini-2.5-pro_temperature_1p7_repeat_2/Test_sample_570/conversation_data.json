    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the condition on the convex domain\n\nLet `D` be a convex domain in the plane. We are given that `D` must intersect every line `L` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\nThe condition that `D` intersects the line `L: px + qy = 1` means that the set `D ∩ L` is not empty.\nFor a convex set `D`, this is equivalent to stating that `D` is not entirely contained in either of the open half-planes defined by the line `L`. Mathematically, this means:\n`sup_{ (x,y) ∈ D } (px + qy) ≥ 1` and `inf_{ (x,y) ∈ D } (px + qy) ≤ 1`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing specific lines to find constraints on the domain's size\n\nThe condition must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`. Let's test some simple pairs:\n\n1.  **Pair (p,q) = (1,0):** `gcd(1,0) = 1`. The line is `1*x + 0*y = 1`, which simplifies to `x = 1`.\n    For `D` to intersect the line `x = 1`, we must have:\n    `sup_{ (x,y) ∈ D } x ≥ 1` and `inf_{ (x,y) ∈ D } x ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Pair (p,q) = (-1,0):** `gcd(-1,0) = 1`. The line is `-1*x + 0*y = 1`, which simplifies to `x = -1`.\n    For `D` to intersect the line `x = -1`, we must have:\n    `sup_{ (x,y) ∈ D } x ≥ -1` and `inf_{ (x,y) ∈ D } x ≤ -1`.\n\n3.  **Pair (p,q) = (0,1):** `gcd(0,1) = 1`. The line is `0*x + 1*y = 1`, which simplifies to `y = 1`.\n    For `D` to intersect the line `y = 1`, we must have:\n    `sup_{ (x,y) ∈ D } y ≥ 1` and `inf_{ (x,y) ∈ D } y ≤ 1`.\n\n4.  **Pair (p,q) = (0,-1):** `gcd(0,-1) = 1`. The line is `0*x - 1*y = 1`, which simplifies to `y = -1`.\n    For `D` to intersect the line `y = -1`, we must have:\n    `sup_{ (x,y) ∈ D } y ≥ -1` and `inf_{ (x,y) ∈ D } y ≤ -1`.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the minimal widths of the domain\n\nLet's combine the constraints derived in Step 2.\nFrom the lines `x=1` and `x=-1`, we get:\n- `sup_D x ≥ 1`\n- `inf_D x ≤ -1`\nThe width of the domain `D` in the x-direction, `W_x`, is given by `W_x = sup_D x - inf_D x`. Therefore, `W_x ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nFrom the lines `y=1` and `y=-1`, we get:\n- `sup_D y ≥ 1`\n- `inf_D y ≤ -1`\nThe width of the domain `D` in the y-direction, `W_y`, is given by `W_y = sup_D y - inf_D y`. Therefore, `W_y ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n### Step 4: Establishing a lower bound for the area\n\nFor any convex set `D`, its area is bounded by its widths in orthogonal directions. A known geometric result states that the area of a convex set is at least half the area of its minimal bounding rectangle.\nThe minimal bounding rectangle of `D` aligned with the axes has dimensions `W_x` and `W_y`.\nArea(`D`) ≥ (1/2) * `W_x` * `W_y`.\nUsing the minimal widths we found in Step 3:\nArea(`D`) ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2.\nThis establishes that the minimal area of such a convex domain must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing a candidate domain with the minimal area\n\nNow we need to check if an area of 2 is achievable. Let's propose a candidate domain `D_0` and verify if it satisfies all the conditions.\nA simple convex set that has widths `W_x=2` and `W_y=2` and an area of exactly 2 is the rhombus (a square rotated by 45°) with vertices at (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), and (0,-1). This domain can be described by the inequality:\n`D_0 = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1 }`.\nThe area of this rhombus is `(1/2) * d_1 * d_2`, where `d_1` and `d_2` are the lengths of the diagonals. The diagonals are the segments from (-1,0) to (1,0) and from (0,-1) to (0,1), so their lengths are `d_1=2` and `d_2=2`.\nArea(`D_0`) = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2.\n\n### Step 6: Verifying the candidate domain\n\nWe must check if `D_0` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\nA line `f(x,y) = c` intersects a compact convex set `K` if and only if `c` is between the minimum and maximum values of `f(x,y)` on `K`.\nLet `f(x,y) = px + qy`. We need to find the minimum and maximum of `f` on `D_0`. Since `D_0` is a convex polygon, the extrema will occur at its vertices: (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1).\n- `f(1, 0) = p`\n- `f(-1, 0) = -p`\n- `f(0, 1) = q`\n- `f(0, -1) = -q`\nSo, `max_{D_0} (px+qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nAnd `min_{D_0} (px+qy) = min(p, -p, q, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\nFor the line `px+qy=1` to intersect `D_0`, we need:\n`-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`\nThe first part of the inequality, `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1`, is always true because `max(|p|, |q|)` is non-negative for integers `p, q`.\nThe second part is the crucial condition: `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nWe are given that `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This implies that `p` and `q` cannot both be zero.\n- If `p ≠ 0`, then `|p| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n- If `q ≠ 0`, then `|q| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nSince at least one of `p` or `q` must be non-zero, the condition `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always satisfied for coprime integers `(p, q)`.\nTherefore, the domain `D_0 = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1 }` intersects all the given lines.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that any such convex domain must have an area of at least 2. We have also found a specific convex domain that satisfies the condition and has an area of exactly 2.\nThus, the minimal area is 2."
