    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, which represent a continuous-time Markov chain model (Kolmogorov-Chapman equations). The functions $P_i(t)$ are the probabilities of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The goal is to find the sum of the steady-state probabilities $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe system is defined as:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith the constraint:\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\nAnd the given rate constants:\n$$\n\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Check the Consistency of the System**\n\nFor a system describing probabilities, the sum of probabilities must be conserved, i.e., constant. This means the sum of their time derivatives must be zero: $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's sum the right-hand sides of the given equations:\nSum = $[-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3] + [\\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2] + [\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3]$\nCollecting terms for each $P_i(t)$:\nFor $P_0(t)$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\nFor $P_1(t)$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\nFor $P_2(t)$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\nFor $P_3(t)$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\nSo, $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\nSince $\\sum P_i'(t)$ must be 0 and $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this implies $P_0(t)=0$ for all time $t$. This would lead to a trivial steady-state solution $p_0=p_1=p_2=p_3=0$, which contradicts the condition $\\sum p_i = 1$.\nThis indicates a typographical error in the problem statement. The term for flow from state 0 to state 1 in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be positive. The corrected equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be:\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)\n$$\nWith this correction, the sum of the derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Set up the Steady-State Equations**\n\nIn the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. This means their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_0 + \\lambda_{10}p_1$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_1 + \\lambda_{21}p_2 + \\lambda_{31}p_3$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_2$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_2 - \\lambda_{31}p_3$\n5. $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nNote that the first four equations are linearly dependent. We can use equations 1, 3, 4, and 5 to solve for the four unknown probabilities.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nLet's express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n\nFrom equation 3, substituting the given values:\n$0 = 0.4 \\cdot p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\cdot p_2$\n$0 = 0.4 \\cdot p_1 - 0.4 \\cdot p_2$\nThis simplifies to $p_2 = p_1$.\n\nFrom equation 4:\n$0 = 0.008 \\cdot p_2 - 0.008 \\cdot p_3$\nThis simplifies to $p_3 = p_2$.\nCombining these results, we get $p_2 = p_3 = p_1$.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n$0 = -0.019 \\cdot p_0 + 0.65 \\cdot p_1$\n$0.019 \\cdot p_0 = 0.65 \\cdot p_1$\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1$.\n\nNow, use the normalization condition (equation 5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\nSubstitute the expressions in terms of $p_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} p_1\\right) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) p_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) p_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) p_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$.\n\nNow we can find $p_0$:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\left(\\frac{19}{707}\\right) = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal value:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the answer is 0.946252."
