    "This is a fascinating problem that combines geometry and combinatorics. The key is to define what constitutes a \"standard\" origami crane and its corresponding crease pattern, then systematically count the regions this pattern creates on the unfolded square paper.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Crease Pattern (CP) of a Standard Crane\n\nA \"standard\" origami crane involves several sets of folds. When unfolded, these leave a specific pattern of creases. We will build this pattern step-by-step.\n\n1.  **The Bird Base:** This is the foundation for the crane and many other origami models. Its crease pattern consists of:\n    *   The two main diagonals.\n    *   The horizontal and vertical midlines.\n    *   A set of 8 creases that form a smaller, central diamond. These result from the \"squash folds\" used to create the base.\n\n2.  **Narrowing Folds:** To create the distinct neck and tail, the \"legs\" of the bird base are made narrower. This adds two creases for the neck and two creases for the tail.\n\n3.  **Head Fold:** The crane's head is made with an \"inside reverse fold.\" On the flat paper, this creates a small V-shaped set of two creases on the neck portion.\n\n4.  **Shaping Folds:** To give the crane its final shape, creases are often added to the base of the wings and across the back. The most common and elegant way to do this is to add the four creases that connect the main vertices of the bird base's central diamond, forming an \"inner square.\"\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Regions using Euler's Formula for Planar Graphs\n\nFor any connected planar graph, the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) are related by Euler's formula: `V - E + F = 1`. In our case, the \"faces\" (F) are the regions we want to count. We can rearrange this to `F = E - V + 1`.\n\nWe will calculate the number of vertices and edges for the complete crease pattern on the square paper and use the formula to find the number of regions. The \"vertices\" are the crease intersections and the points where creases meet the edge of the paper. The \"edges\" are the segments of creases or paper edges between these vertices.\n\nLet's calculate the result incrementally. We'll use the change in regions, `ΔF = ΔE - ΔV`, where `ΔE` is the number of new edge segments added and `ΔV` is the number of new vertices added.\n\n1.  **Start with the Bird Base CP:**\n    *   A detailed analysis shows that the standard bird base crease pattern has 13 vertices (1 center, 4 corners, 4 mid-points, 4 inner diamond points) and 28 edge segments (8 on the boundary, 20 internal creases).\n    *   Number of regions `F = E - V + 1 = 28 - 13 + 1 = 16`.\n    *   So, the bird base alone divides the paper into **16 regions**.\n\n2.  **Add the Narrowing Folds:**\n    *   We add 4 new crease segments (2 for the neck, 2 for the tail). These connect existing vertices on the CP.\n    *   New vertices (`ΔV`) = 0.\n    *   New edges (`ΔE`) = 4.\n    *   Change in regions (`ΔF`) = 4 - 0 = 4.\n    *   Total regions = 16 + 4 = **20 regions**.\n\n3.  **Add the Head Fold:**\n    *   The V-shaped head fold introduces 3 new vertices (the point of the V and the two points where its arms meet other creases).\n    *   It adds 5 new edge segments (the two segments of the V, plus it splits three existing edge segments into two each).\n    *   New vertices (`ΔV`) = 3.\n    *   New edges (`ΔE`) = 5.\n    *   Change in regions (`ΔF`) = 5 - 3 = 2.\n    *   Total regions = 20 + 2 = **22 regions**.\n\n4.  **Add the Final Shaping Folds:**\n    *   These are the 4 creases that connect the four main vertices of the central diamond, forming an inner square. These folds form the base of the wings and the top/bottom of the crane's body.\n    *   These 4 creases connect existing vertices.\n    *   New vertices (`ΔV`) = 0.\n    *   New edges (`ΔE`) = 4.\n    *   Change in regions (`ΔF`) = 4 - 0 = 4.\n    *   Total regions = 22 + 4 = **26 regions**.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBy carefully constructing the crease pattern for a standard, well-formed origami crane and applying Euler's formula for planar graphs, we find that the creases divide the paper into 26 distinct regions.\n\n<<<26>>>"
