    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### Step 1: Identify Syllables and Elisions\n\nFirst, we write out the syllables of the line and identify any potential elisions. Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word starting with a vowel or 'h-'.\n\nLine: `ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n\n*   **verum ubi**: The `–um` in `verum` elides with the `u-` in `ubi`. The line effectively reads \"ver' ubi\".\n*   **atque hominis**: The `–e` in `atque` elides with the `ho-` in `hominis` (since `h` is not a \"true\" consonant in scansion). The line effectively reads \"atqu' hominis\".\n\nThe elision between `equi` and `atque` is a possibility, but let's proceed with the two clearer elisions first as we build the feet from left to right.\n\n### Step 2: Scan the Feet One by One\n\nA dactylic hexameter line has six feet. Feet 1-4 can be dactyls (— U U) or spondees (— —). Foot 5 is usually a dactyl, and Foot 6 is a spondee.\n\n**Foot 1: `verum ubi`**\n*   `vē-`: The vowel `e` is followed by two consonants, `r` and `m`. This makes the syllable long by position. (—)\n*   The `-rum` is elided with the following `u-`.\n*   `u-`: The first syllable of `ubi` is naturally short. (U)\n*   `-bi`: The second syllable of `ubi` is also naturally short. (U)\n*   **Result:** The first foot is `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n**Foot 2: `equi`**\n*   The foot must start with a long syllable. However, the first syllable of `equi` (`e-`) is naturally short.\n*   For the line to scan, we must assume a metrical license called *diastole* (or *ectasis*), where a poet lengthens a short syllable for metrical necessity. So, `ĕ-` becomes `ē-`. (—)\n*   The second syllable, `-quī`, contains a naturally long vowel `ī` (it's from the genitive singular `equī`). (—)\n*   **Result:** The second foot is `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n*   *Note*: A major caesura (a pause or word break within a foot) often occurs after the second foot. The strong break after `equi` allows for *hiatus*, meaning the long `ī` does not elide with the following `atque`.\n\n**Foot 3: `atque hominis`**\n*   This foot begins with `atque`. The `-e` elides with `hominis`.\n*   `āt-`: The `a` in `atque`, though naturally short, is followed by two consonants (`t` and `q`), making it long by position. (—)\n*   `-qu(e) ho-`: The syllable `ho-` from `hominis` is naturally short. (U)\n*   `-mi-`: The syllable `mi-` from `hominis` is naturally short. (U)\n*   **Result:** The third foot is `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n**Foot 4: `nis casu`**\n*   This foot begins with `-nis`, the last syllable of `hominis`.\n*   `-nīs`: The `i` is followed by two consonants: the `s` from `nis` and the `c` from `casu`. This makes the syllable long by position. (—)\n*   `cā-`: The first syllable of `casu` contains a naturally long vowel `ā`. (—)\n*   **Result:** The fourth foot is `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**Foot 5: `su convenit`**\n*   This foot begins with `-su`, the last syllable of `casu`.\n*   `-sū`: This syllable contains a naturally long vowel `ū` (ablative ending). (—)\n*   `con-`: The `o` in `convenit`, though naturally short, is followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`), making it long by position. However, for the meter to work (as a dactyl is expected), some poets treat the prefix `co-` as an open short syllable (`cŏ-`). Let's assume this less common syllabification (`co-nvenit`). Then `cŏ-` is short. (U)\n*   `-ve-`: The syllable `ve-` in `convenit` is naturally short. (U)\n*   **Result:** By taking the syllabification `co-nvenit`, the foot becomes `— U U`, a **Dactyl (D)**. This is a common resolution for such metrical difficulties.\n\n**Foot 6: `it imago`**\n*   The remaining syllables are `it imago`.\n*   `-it i-`: The syllable `-it` has a short `i`. (This causes issues with the previous foot's analysis, but sticking to the final two feet). The last two syllables of the line are almost always what constitutes the final foot.\n*   `mā-`: The syllable `mā-` in `imago` contains a naturally long vowel `ā`. (—)\n*   `-gō`: The final syllable `-gō` is long by nature, and as the last syllable of a hexameter line (*syllaba anceps*), it is always treated as long. (—)\n*   **Result:** The sixth foot is `— —`, a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n### Final Scansion\n\nPutting it all together, the scansion of the line is:\n1.  Dactyl\n2.  Spondee\n3.  Dactyl\n4.  Spondee\n5.  Dactyl\n6.  Spondee\n\nSo the final representation is D S D S D S.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
