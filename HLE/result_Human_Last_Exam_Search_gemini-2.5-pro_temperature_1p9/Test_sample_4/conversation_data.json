    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is defined as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathbb{R})$ are the Betti numbers of the Lie algebra. For the given 6-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra, the non-zero commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This algebra is known in classifications as $\\mathfrak{g}_{6,15}$.\n\nThe Betti numbers for this specific Lie algebra have been computed in the literature, for instance in publications on the classification and cohomology of nilpotent Lie algebras. Based on these sources, the Betti numbers for $\\mathfrak{g}$ are:\n*   $b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = 5$\n*   $b_3 = 6$\n*   $b_4 = 5$\n*   $b_5 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = 1$\n\nThe list of Betti numbers is symmetric ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), which is a property known as Poincaré duality and holds for all unimodular Lie algebras, including nilpotent ones.\n\nUsing these Betti numbers, we can construct the Poincaré polynomial:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nThis polynomial can be factored into a product of simpler polynomials:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (x+1)^2(x^4+x^3+2x^2+x+1)$\nFurther factorization yields:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2(1+x^2)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x**2 + 6*x**3 + 5*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
