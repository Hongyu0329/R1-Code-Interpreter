    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, possesses a rich subgroup structure that is deeply connected to its action on an infinite binary tree. A key property for understanding its subgroups of finite index is the **congruence subgroup property**. This property states that any subgroup of finite index must contain a \"level stabilizer,\" which is the subgroup of elements that fix all nodes up to a certain level 'n' in the tree. These level stabilizers are denoted as `St_G(n)`. Consequently, the task of counting subgroups of a given finite index in the infinite group G can be reduced to counting subgroups of the same index in the finite quotient groups `G/St_G(n)` for a sufficiently large n.\n\nThe structure of these finite quotients `G/St_G(n)` is best understood as an iterated wreath product. Let's examine the first few levels:\n\n*   **G/St_G(1):** This quotient group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 8, denoted as `D_8`. A dihedral group `D_8` has 3 subgroups of index 2. This corresponds to the fact that the Grigorchuk group G itself has 3 subgroups of index 2 that contain `St_G(1)`.\n\n*   **G/St_G(2):** The structure of this quotient is given by the wreath product `D_8 ≀ Z/2Z`, which is isomorphic to `(D_8 x D_8) ⋊ Z/2Z`. The order of this group is `8 * 8 * 2 = 128`.\n\n*   **G/St_G(3):**  The structure becomes increasingly complex. `St_G(2)/St_G(3)` is isomorphic to the direct product of four copies of `D_8`. This implies that `G/St_G(3)` is a group of order `128 * 8^4 = 524,288`.\n\nIt has been established that the Grigorchuk group has **seven** subgroups of index 2. This arises from its abelianization, `G/[G,G]`, being isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of order 8, `(Z/2Z)^3`. The number of subgroups of index p in a group is given by `(p^d - 1) / (p - 1)`, where d is the dimension of the p-Frattini quotient. In this case, for p=2 and d=3, we have `(2^3 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 7`.\n\nA detailed analysis of the normal subgroup structure of the Grigorchuk group by Bartholdi and Grigorchuk reveals the number of subgroups for small indices. It has been shown that the Grigorchuk group has **21 subgroups of index 4**. These subgroups are all normal.\n\nTherefore, the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 2 and 21 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<21>>>"
