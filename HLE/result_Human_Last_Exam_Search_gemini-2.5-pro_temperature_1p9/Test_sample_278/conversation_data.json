    "The search results confirm that my initial approach is correct. The smallest square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes a figure is determined by the figure's bounding box. I need to find the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of the curve. The side length of the smallest circumscribing square will be the maximum of the width (difference between max and min x) and the height (difference between max and min y) of the figure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n**Part 1: Analyze the curve for t ∈ [0, π]**\n*   The equations are x = cos(t) and y = sin(t). This represents the upper semi-unit circle.\n*   The x-values range from cos(0) = 1 to cos(π) = -1.\n*   The y-values range from sin(0) = 0 to sin(π/2) = 1 and back to sin(π) = 0.\n*   For this part: X_max = 1, X_min = -1, Y_max = 1, Y_min = 0.\n\n**Part 2: Analyze the curve for t ∈ (π, 2π)**\n*   The equations are x = cos(t) and y = 5sin(t). This represents the lower half of an ellipse.\n*   The x-values range from cos(π) = -1 to cos(2π) = 1.\n*   The y-values range from 5sin(π) = 0 down to 5sin(3π/2) = -5 and back up to 5sin(2π) = 0.\n*   For this part: X_max = 1, X_min = -1, Y_max < 0, Y_min = -5.\n\n**Part 3: Determine the overall bounding box**\n*   Combining both parts, we find the overall maximum and minimum values.\n*   Overall X_max = max(1, 1) = 1.\n*   Overall X_min = min(-1, -1) = -1.\n*   Overall Y_max = max(1, 0) = 1.\n*   Overall Y_min = min(0, -5) = -5.\n\n**Part 4: Calculate the dimensions and area of the smallest circumscribing square**\n*   The width of the figure is X_max - X_min = 1 - (-1) = 2.\n*   The height of the figure is Y_max - Y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6.\n*   The side length of the smallest square that can contain the figure must be at least as large as the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6.\n*   The area of this square is side length squared.\n*   Area = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n<<<36>>>"
