    "According to the health scaling mechanics of Terraria in Expert Mode, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu increases with each player in a multiplayer session. For a small number of players, the health increase per additional player grows. For 10 or more players, a different formula is applied to the health multiplier which moderates this increase, but the health still continues to increase with each additional player.\n\nBased on an analysis of the game's source code by a user on the Terraria Community Forums, the health multiplier for bosses in Expert Mode is calculated as follows:\n*   The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n*   For the second player, a health boost of 35% of the base health is added.\n*   For each subsequent player up to the 9th, the health boost for that player is calculated based on the previous player's boost.\n*   For 10 or more players, the health multiplier is adjusted by a new formula.\n\nCrucially, the formula for the health multiplier, both for under 10 players and for 10 or more players, does not have a cap. The health multiplier continues to increase as more players are added. As the number of players approaches infinity, the health multiplier also approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is infinite.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
