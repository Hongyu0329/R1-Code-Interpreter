    "The specific Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride cannot be definitively identified. The common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its bright, fluorescent pink or reddish-violet color.\n\nCrayola crayons are primarily made of paraffin wax and color pigments. However, the precise composition of the pigments used in Crayola crayons is proprietary information and not publicly disclosed. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for Crayola products confirm that the crayons are non-toxic under normal use but do not list the specific pigments for each color.\n\nWhile some online discussions and inferences can be found, there is no official confirmation from Crayola or a reliable third-party chemical analysis that directly links Rhodamine B to a specific Crayola crayon. A safety data sheet for a non-Crayola brand of repair crayons does mention \"rhodamine b\" as a potential ingredient depending on the color, but this information is not applicable to Crayola's products.\n\nRegulations in various countries, including the United States, have raised concerns about the use of Rhodamine B in consumable products due to potential health risks.\n\nTherefore, without explicit disclosure from the manufacturer, it is not possible to name a specific Crayola crayon that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n<<<It is not possible to definitively identify a specific Crayola crayon color containing 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride based on publicly available information.>>>"
