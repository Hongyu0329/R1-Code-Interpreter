    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and blue.\n\nThe primary and most well-known allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, and black.\n\n*   **White phosphorus** is a translucent, waxy solid. In its pure form, it is colorless or white. However, it often appears yellowish due to the presence of trace impurities of red phosphorus that form upon exposure to light, and for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red phosphorus** has a characteristic deep red color. It can also be found as a reddish-violet powder. Some forms may exhibit an iron-grey luster.\n*   **Black phosphorus** is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and appears black and flaky, with a structure similar to graphite. It can also be described as having a grey, metallic appearance.\n*   **Violet phosphorus**, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is another distinct allotrope. It can be seen as red-purple crystals or a reddish-brown powder with a metallic luster. Some sources describe its appearance as yellowish-red plates.\n*   **Blue phosphorus** is a more recently synthesized allotrope, first created in its single-layer form in 2016. Its name is derived from its wider band gap compared to black phosphorus, and while less common in bulk form, it represents a distinct allotropic form with a blue hue.\n\nTherefore, across its various pure allotropic forms, phosphorus displays a palette of five colors.\n\n<<<5>>>"
