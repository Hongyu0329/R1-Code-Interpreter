    "The given initial value problem is:\n$x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$, with the initial condition $x(0) = -8$.\n\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can separate the variables by moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side:\n$\\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt$\n\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation:\n$\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt$\n\nThe integration yields:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTo find the value of C, we use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n$-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$\n$\\frac{1}{8} = C$\n\nNow we substitute the value of C back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution:\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTo combine the fractions on the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}$\n$-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1, we get:\n$\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}$\n\nFinally, solving for $x(1)$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
