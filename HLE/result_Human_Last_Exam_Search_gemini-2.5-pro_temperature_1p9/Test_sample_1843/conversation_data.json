    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor $N$\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the properties of primitive Dirichlet characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character with conductor $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be $6$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the component characters\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. Let's find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor, whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo $2^2 = 4$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a possible component. So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_{4}$, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo $3^2 = 9$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The non-primitive characters are induced from modulo 3, and their orders are 1 and 2. Therefore, the primitive characters are those with orders 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So there are $2 + 2 = 4$ choices for $\\chi_9$. The possible orders are 3 and 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 7**: The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The only non-primitive character is the principal character of order 1. The orders of the primitive characters are 2, 3, and 6. All these divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11**: The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. A primitive character's order must divide 6. The only divisor of 10 that also divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    So there is 1 choice for $\\chi_{11}$, and its order is 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 13**: The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. A primitive character's order must divide 6. The divisors of 12 that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    So there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ choices for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total number of characters\nWe need to find the number of combinations of these component characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\nLet the orders of the component characters be $o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}$.\nWe need $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\n\nThis requires two conditions:\n1.  The order of every component character must divide 6. We have already ensured this by our selection of characters.\n2.  The set of orders must contain a factor of 2 and a factor of 3.\n    *   **Factor of 2**: The character $\\chi_4$ must be chosen, and its order is 2. Thus, the lcm will always be a multiple of 2.\n    *   **Factor of 3**: For $\\chi_9$, the possible orders are 3 and 6. Both are multiples of 3. Therefore, any choice for $\\chi_9$ ensures that the lcm will be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince any valid combination of component characters will result in an order that is a multiple of both 2 and 3, and since all component orders divide 6, the final order must be exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
