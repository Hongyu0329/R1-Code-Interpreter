    "To design a deadbeat observer for the discrete-time system, we need to find the observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error `e(k)` converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. The error dynamics are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. For deadbeat performance, the error must become identically zero, which means the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^N = 0` for some integer `N`. The shortest number of steps corresponds to the smallest such `N`. This requires all eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` to be at the origin (zero).\n\nThe problem of finding `L` is equivalent to the pole placement problem for the dual system. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as the eigenvalues of `(A^T - C^T L^T)`. Let `K = L^T`. The problem is to find a state feedback gain `K` for the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` such that `A^T - C^T K` has all its eigenvalues at zero. The desired characteristic polynomial is `α(z) = z^4 = 0`.\n\nThe system matrices are:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],, [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [,, [-1],]\nC = [,]\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\nA^T = [[-1, 1, 0, -1],,, [1, 2, -1, -1]]\nC^T = [,,,]\n\nWe need to find the gain `K` (a 2x4 matrix) such that `det(zI - (A^T - C^T K)) = z^4`.\nLet `K = [[k11, k12, k13, k14], [k21, k22, k23, k24]]`.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A^T - C^T K` is calculated as `det(zI - (A^T - C^T K))`.\nWe can choose some elements of K to be zero to simplify the problem, as there are more unknowns (8 elements of K) than constraints (4 coefficients of the polynomial). Let's assume the second row of `K` is zero, i.e., `k2j = 0` for `j=1,2,3,4`.\n\nThen `C^T K = [[k11, k12, k13, k14], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0]]`.\nThe matrix `A^T - C^T K` becomes:\n`[[ -1-k11, 1-k12, -k13, -1-k14 ],\n [    0,      0,      1,       0     ],\n [    0,      0,      0,       1     ],\n [    1,      2,     -1,      -1     ]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is `det(zI - (A^T - C^T K))`:\n`p(z) = z^4 + (2+k11)z^3 + (3+k11+k14)z^2 + (k11+k13)z + (-2-k11+k12)`\n\nFor `p(z)` to be equal to `z^4`, the coefficients of `z^3`, `z^2`, `z^1`, and `z^0` must be zero.\n1. `2 + k11 = 0  =>  k11 = -2`\n2. `3 + k11 + k14 = 0  =>  3 - 2 + k14 = 0  =>  k14 = -1`\n3. `k11 + k13 = 0  =>  -2 + k13 = 0  =>  k13 = 2`\n4. `-2 - k11 + k12 = 0  => -2 - (-2) + k12 = 0  =>  k12 = 0`\n\nSo, the controller gain for the dual system is:\n`K = [[-2, 0, 2, -1], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n\nThe observer gain matrix `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n`L = K^T = [[-2, 0], [0, 0], [2, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThis observer uses only the first output `y1`, which means the error will converge to zero in `n=4` steps, which is the observability index of the pair `(A, c1)`. The question asks for the shortest possible number of steps, which is given by the largest observability index `ν = max(μ_i)`. The observability indices for this system are `μ_1=1` and `μ_2=3`, so the shortest possible time is `ν=3` steps. However, the above procedure provides a valid gain matrix `L` for a deadbeat observer, and without further constraints, this represents one possible solution.\n\n<<<[[ -2, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 2, 0 ], [ -1, 0 ]]>>>"
