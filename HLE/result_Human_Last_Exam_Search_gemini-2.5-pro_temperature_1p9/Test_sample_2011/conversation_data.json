    "The user wants to find the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nMy initial thought process was:\n1.  A clique is an induced subgraph.\n2.  The size of a clique `k` in a graph with `n=128` vertices must be between 1 and 128.\n3.  This means there are at most 128 possible integer values for the clique size.\n4.  Can we construct a graph that achieves all these 128 sizes?\n5.  Yes, the complete graph K_128. Any subset of `k` vertices in K_128 induces a clique of size `k`.\n6.  Therefore, K_128 contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n7.  The maximum number is 128.\n\nNow I need to review the search results to see if there is any nuance I'm missing.\nThe search results talk a lot about \"maximal cliques\". Let me clarify the difference between a clique and a maximal clique.\n- A **clique** is a subset of vertices where every two vertices are adjacent.\n- A **maximal clique** is a clique that cannot be extended by adding any other vertex from the graph.\n\nThe user's question is \"different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs\". A clique as an induced subgraph means a subset of vertices that forms a complete graph. The standard definition of a clique is that the induced subgraph on that set of vertices is complete. So there's no ambiguity there.\n\nThe question does *not* mention \"maximal\" cliques. This is a crucial distinction.\n\n- Search result discusses the \"maximum number of **maximal clique cardinalities**\". This is a different, harder problem. It even shows that the answer for maximal cliques is n - Θ(log n). This confirms my suspicion that my problem is simpler because it doesn't have the \"maximal\" constraint.\n- Search result also discusses the number of different sizes of **maximal cliques**, stating \"g(n)~ n- [log2 n]\". This again confirms that the problem for maximal cliques is different and more complex.\n\nThe question asks for the number of different sizes of cliques that are induced subgraphs. As I reasoned, any subset of k vertices from a complete graph K_n forms an induced k-clique. For K_128, any k-subset of vertices induces a k-clique. We can choose any k from 1 to 128. This means that K_128 contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., 128.\n\nFor example, in K_128, is a clique of size 5 maximal? No. If you take any 5 vertices, they form a clique. But you can always add any of the remaining 123 vertices to this set and it's still a clique. In K_128, the only maximal clique is the set of all 128 vertices itself. So K_128 would only have one size of maximal clique (128). This illustrates the difference.\n\nBut the question is not about maximal cliques. It's about induced cliques.\nLet G be a graph on n vertices. Let C be the set of possible clique sizes `k`. We want to maximize |C|.\nThe size of a clique `k` must satisfy `1 <= k <= n`.\nSo, |C| can be at most `n`.\nFor n=128, |C| <= 128.\n\nConsider the graph G = K_128.\nLet `k` be any integer from 1 to 128.\nTake any subset of `k` vertices from G.\nThe subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a complete graph of size `k` (a K_k).\nTherefore, for every `k` in {1, 2, ..., 128}, there exists an induced clique of size `k` in K_128.\nThis means the set of clique sizes for K_128 is {1, 2, ..., 128}.\nThe number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nSince the maximum possible number is 128, and we have a graph that achieves it, the answer must be 128. The search results, by highlighting the much more complex \"maximal clique\" version of the problem, actually give me more confidence in my simple answer to the user's specific question. The user did not ask for maximal cliques.\n\nThe logic is sound.\n1. The question is about the number of different values `k` such that a graph on 128 vertices has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size `k`.\n2. The size `k` of such a clique must be an integer between 1 and 128, inclusive.\n3. Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n4. The complete graph on 128 vertices, K_128, serves as an example that achieves this maximum. In K_128, any subset of `k` vertices induces a clique of size `k`. Since this is true for all integers `k` from 1 to 128, the graph K_128 contains induced cliques of 128 different sizes.\n5. The maximum is therefore 128.\n\nI'm confident in this answer. It's a direct consequence of the definitions.\nThe final answer should be just the number.\n<<<128>>>The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n = 128 vertices is 128.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terminology:**\n    *   A **graph on exactly n = 128 vertices** is a set of 128 points (vertices) and a collection of lines (edges) connecting pairs of these points.\n    *   A **clique** is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. In other words, it's a complete subgraph.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** for a given subset of vertices consists of those vertices and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect them. When the question asks for a clique to appear as an induced subgraph, it means there is a set of `k` vertices that, along with all the edges between them in the original graph, form a complete graph of size `k` (a K_k).\n    *   A **clique size** is simply the number of vertices in a clique.\n\n2.  **Establishing an Upper Bound:**\n    For any graph with 128 vertices, the size of any clique must be an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 128. This is because a clique is a subset of the graph's vertices, so its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices. Consequently, the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}. This means it is impossible to have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n\n3.  **Constructing a Graph to Achieve the Maximum:**\n    To show that 128 is achievable, we need to provide an example of a graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all possible sizes from 1 to 128. The **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as K_128, serves this purpose.\n    *   In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   Consider any integer `k` from 1 to 128. If we select any subset of `k` vertices from K_128, the subgraph induced by this subset will have all possible edges between its vertices, simply because all edges are present in K_128.\n    *   This means that for any `k` from 1 to 128, the K_128 graph contains an induced clique of size `k`.\n    *   Therefore, the complete graph K_128 has induced cliques of sizes {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}, which amounts to 128 different sizes.\n\nSince the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128, and the complete graph K_128 achieves exactly 128, the maximum possible number is 128. It's important to note that the question is about *cliques*, not *maximal cliques*, which would result in a different and more complex problem.\n\n<<<128>>>"
