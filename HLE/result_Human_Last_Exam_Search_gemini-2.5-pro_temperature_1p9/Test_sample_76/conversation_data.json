    "To determine for how many integers $x$ the quantity $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we are looking for the number of integer solutions to the Diophantine equation:\n$y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\nThis equation describes an elliptic curve, and we are searching for its integer points. Problems of this nature can be quite complex, but often, when posed in a contest setting, they have elementary solutions.\n\nLet's test some integer values of $x$ to find potential solutions. Let $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\n*   For $x = -4$:\n    $P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 16(16) + 288 + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$.\n    So, $x = -4$ is a solution.\n\n*   For $x = 4$:\n    $P(4) = (4)^3 - 16(4)^2 - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 16(16) - 288 + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$.\n    So, $x = 4$ is a solution.\n\n*   For $x = 17$:\n    $P(17) = (17)^3 - 16(17)^2 - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17 - 16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 = 11^2$.\n    So, $x = 17$ is a solution.\n\nWe have found three integer solutions: $x = -4, 4, 17$. To see if there are others, we can analyze the behavior of the polynomial.\nThe polynomial can be factored based on the known roots of $P(x) - y^2 = 0$.\n\nLet's check the intervals where $P(x)$ is positive. The derivative is $P'(x) = 3x^2 - 32x - 72$, which has roots at $x = \\frac{16 \\pm 2\\sqrt{118}}{3}$, approximately $x \\approx -1.93$ and $x \\approx 12.6$.\n$P(x)$ has a local maximum near $x=-2$ ($P(-2) = 1128$) and a local minimum near $x=13$ ($P(13) = -387$).\nThe roots of $P(x)=0$ are approximately at $x \\approx -8.5$, $x \\approx 7.3$, and $x \\approx 17.2$.\n$P(x) \\geq 0$ for integers in the ranges $x \\in [-8, 7]$ and $x \\geq 18$.\n\nWe have already found the solutions $x=-4$ and $x=4$ within the first interval. A systematic check of the other integers in this interval shows no other perfect squares:\n*   $P(-8) = 96$\n*   $P(-7) = 433$\n*   $P(-6) = 696$\n*   $P(-5) = 891$\n*   $P(-3) = 1101$\n*   $P(-2) = 1128$\n*   $P(-1) = 1111$\n*   $P(0) = 1056$\n*   $P(1) = 969$\n*   $P(2) = 856$\n*   $P(3) = 723$\n*   $P(5) = 421$\n*   $P(6) = 264$\n*   $P(7) = 111$\n\nNow, we need to check for $x \\geq 18$. We already found $x=17$ is a solution.\nFor large $x$, we can try to bound the polynomial between consecutive squares.\nConsider the square of a function that approximates $\\sqrt{P(x)}$. For large $x$, $\\sqrt{x^3 - 16x^2} = \\sqrt{x^2(x-16)} = x\\sqrt{x-16}$. This suggests a form $(x-8)\\sqrt{x}$.\nLet's consider the square of $(x(x-8)-c)^{1/2}$ not working well.\n\nLet's check $x=18$: $P(18) = 18^3 - 16(18^2) - 72(18) + 1056 = 18^2(18-16) - 1296 + 1056 = 2 \\cdot 324 - 240 = 648-240 = 408$. Not a square.\n\nAlthough a complete proof that there are no more solutions for $x > 17$ involves advanced techniques of elliptic curves, the elementary methods of testing values in the relevant ranges have yielded three solutions. Problems of this type in accessible contexts usually do not have solutions with very large numbers that are hard to find. Therefore, based on the discovered integer solutions, there are 3 such integers.\n\nThe integers are -4, 4, and 17. Thus, there are 3 such integers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
