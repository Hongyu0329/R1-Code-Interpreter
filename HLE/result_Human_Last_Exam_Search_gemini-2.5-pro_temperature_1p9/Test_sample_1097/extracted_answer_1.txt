The set M that should be defined to apply the Banach fixed-point theorem is a closed ball in the space of continuous functions on, C(), with the supremum norm. Specifically, M = {u ∈ C() | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}, where the radius R must be chosen to be a positive constant that satisfies the conditions R < ln(8) and exp(R)/8 ≤ R. For example, R=1 is a valid choice.
