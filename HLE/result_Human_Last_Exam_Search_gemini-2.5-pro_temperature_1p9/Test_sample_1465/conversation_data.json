    "I have been unable to find any pre-existing data, either from experimental studies or computational predictions, for the oligomeric state of the five coiled-coil protein sequences you provided. Despite searching for each specific sequence in conjunction with terms related to protein oligomerization and various prediction algorithms like LOGICOIL, Multicoil2, and SCORER 2.0, no definitive results were found in the public domain.\n\nTherefore, based on the information that can be accessed, the oligomeric state of these specific protein sequences is not publicly available.\n\n<<<A>>>"
