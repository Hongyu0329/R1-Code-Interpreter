    "Radon was the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\nOf the stable noble gases, xenon is the rarest. However, radon, a radioactive element, is significantly rarer. Due to its short half-life of only 3.8 days for its most stable isotope, radon does not accumulate in significant quantities in any of a key terrestrial reservoir.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the abundances in different parts of the Earth:\n\n*   **Atmosphere:** The concentration of radon in the atmosphere is estimated to be about 1x10<sup>-19</sup>%. In comparison, xenon, the rarest stable noble gas in the atmosphere, has a concentration of approximately 0.0000087% (8.7 parts per billion).\n*   **Earth's Crust:** In the Earth's crust, the abundance of radon is estimated to be about 4 x 10<sup>-13</sup> milligrams per kilogram. For comparison, the crustal abundance of xenon is roughly 1.5 x 10<sup>-3</sup> milligrams per kilogram. This makes radon many orders of magnitude rarer than xenon in the solid Earth. Radon is formed from the radioactive decay of radium, which is itself a trace element in the crust.\n*   **Oceans:** Radon is present in seawater, primarily from the decay of radium in the water and sediments. However, because of its short half-life, its concentration is extremely low.\n\nThe fundamental properties of radon, specifically its radioactivity and rapid decay, ensure that its presence in any part of the terrestrial environment is fleeting and in extremely minute quantities compared to all other noble gases. The abundances of these elements are not subject to significant change over a short period, so the situation in 2002 would be the same as it is today.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
