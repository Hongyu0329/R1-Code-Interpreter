    "Under the assumption that the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve defined over a valuation field has good reduction, there are 11 types of stable reductions.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves states that the Jacobian of a curve `C` has good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of `C` is a curve of \"compact type\". This means the dual graph of the stable reduction is a tree. The stable reduction is a nodal curve whose components and singularities satisfy certain stability conditions.\n\nThe process to determine the number of types involves a combinatorial enumeration of all possible stable curves of arithmetic genus 4 that have a tree-like dual graph. The genus `g` of a nodal curve is given by the formula `g = h¹(Γ) + Σ(gᵥ - 1) + |V|`, where `h¹(Γ)` is the first Betti number of the dual graph Γ (the number of loops), `gᵥ` are the genera of the irreducible components (vertices `V`), and `|V|` is the number of components. For a tree, `h¹(Γ) = 0`, so the formula simplifies to `g = Σgᵥ`.\n\nFor a genus 4 curve, we must find all partitions of the number 4 into the genera of the components, such that the resulting configuration forms a stable curve whose dual graph is a tree. A component is stable if `2gᵥ - 2 + nᵥ > 0`, where `nᵥ` is the number of nodes on that component (the degree of the vertex in the dual graph). This condition notably requires that any genus 0 component must connect to at least three other components (`nᵥ ≥ 3`).\n\nThe 11 types of stable reductions are classified by the genera of their components and the structure of their dual graph (which must be a tree):\n\n*   **One component:**\n    1.  A single smooth curve of genus 4. This is the case where the curve itself has good reduction. (1 type)\n\n*   **Two components:** The dual graph is a single edge.\n    2.  One component of genus 3 and one of genus 1. (1 type)\n    3.  Two components of genus 2. (1 type)\n\n*   **Three components:** The dual graph is a path.\n    4.  Components of genera 2, 1, and 1. There are two distinct arrangements: `(g=1)--(g=2)--(g=1)` and `(g=2)--(g=1)--(g=1)`. (2 types)\n\n*   **Four components:** The dual graph is either a path or a star-shaped graph.\n    5.  Four components of genus 1. Both the path and star arrangements are possible. (2 types)\n    6.  Components of genera 2, 1, 1, and 0. The genus 0 component must have at least 3 connections, so the dual graph must be a star with the genus 0 component at the center. (1 type)\n\n*   **Five components:**\n    7.  Four components of genus 1 and one of genus 0. The genus 0 component must be at a vertex of degree 3 or more. There are two such tree structures on 5 vertices. (2 types)\n\n*   **Six components:**\n    8.  Four components of genus 1 and two of genus 0. This requires a tree with two vertices of degree 3 or more. A unique such configuration exists for 6 vertices. (1 type)\n\nSumming these up (`1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1`) yields a total of 11 distinct types of stable reductions.\n\n<<<11>>>"
