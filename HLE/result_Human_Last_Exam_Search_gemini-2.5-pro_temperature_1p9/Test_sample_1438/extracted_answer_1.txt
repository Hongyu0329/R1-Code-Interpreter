The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a single number but is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, specifically: the integral of 1 over a Grassmann variable is 0, and the integral of the Grassmann variable itself is 1. These rules, in conjunction with the property that the square of a Grassmann variable is zero, enforce the Pauli exclusion principle in the path integral formalism.
