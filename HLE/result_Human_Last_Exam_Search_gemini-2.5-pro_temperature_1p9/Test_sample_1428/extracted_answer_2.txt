The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is $p_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{2} p_{i-1}(t) + \frac{1}{2} p_{i+1}(t)$, where indices are modulo N. The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ is a circulant matrix with $A_{i, i+1} = A_{i, i-1} = 1/2$ (indices mod N) and other entries being zero. The eigenvectors are of the form $e^{ijk_n}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_n = \cos(k_n) = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n}{N}\right)$ for $n=0, 1, ..., N-1$. The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0 = 1$. The second-largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_1 = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}\right)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the spectral gap, which is $1 - \lambda_1 = 1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}\right)$.
