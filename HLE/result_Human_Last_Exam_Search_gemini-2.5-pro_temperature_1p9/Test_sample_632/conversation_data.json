    "After a thorough investigation into the history of Rome's Piazza della Rotonda, no record of a unique architectural feature being removed in 1950 has been found. It is possible the query is based on a misunderstanding of the date or the specific feature in question.\n\nHowever, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous significant architectural transformations throughout its long history. One of the most notable changes to the skyline of the square was the removal of the twin bell towers from the Pantheon itself in the late 19th century. These baroque towers, often attributed to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, were added in the 17th century and were popularly known as \"the ass's ears.\" Their demolition in 1883 significantly altered the appearance of the famous church that dominates the square.\n\nOver the centuries, the piazza has been reshaped by various clearance and construction projects. During the 15th century, medieval sheds and shops that had encroached upon the Pantheon were removed to create a more open space. In the 19th century, under the direction of Popes Pius VII and Pius IX, several structures at the northern end of the square were demolished to further enlarge it.\n\nAnother significant event in the piazza's history was the period of major urban demolitions in Rome carried out by the Fascist regime between 1924 and 1940. While these \"eviscerations\" dramatically altered many parts of the city to reveal ancient Roman structures, there is no specific evidence that a unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda during this time or in the year 1950.\n\nThe central fountain, a prominent feature of the piazza, was also subject to alterations. Originally designed by Giacomo della Porta in 1575, the Egyptian obelisk was added to its center in 1711.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Piazza della Rotonda has evolved considerably since its inception, the removal of a specific, unique architectural feature in 1950 is not documented in historical records. The most significant architectural removal from the immediate vicinity of the square was that of the Pantheon's bell towers in the late 19th century.\n\n<<<No documented unique architectural feature was removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950. The most significant architectural alteration in the area was the removal of the Pantheon's twin bell towers in 1883.>>>"
