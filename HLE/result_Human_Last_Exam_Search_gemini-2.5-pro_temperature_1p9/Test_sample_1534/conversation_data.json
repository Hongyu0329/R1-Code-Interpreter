    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass, which is a collection of lobes in the back of the cuttlefish brain. This region of the brain controls various motor actions in the posterior part of the animal's body. For example, the palliovisceral lobe is involved in escape responses and inking.\n\nStudies and diagrams of the *Sepia* brain show that several lobes are situated in close proximity within the posterior subesophageal mass. The posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores on the mantle for camouflage, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins, are located posteriorly within this cluster, adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe. The pallial nerve, a major nerve, exits from the posterior-most side of the brain, and the posterior chromatophore lobe is located immediately next to this nerve exit, highlighting its posterior position.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
