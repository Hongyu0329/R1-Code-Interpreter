    "While UK counterintelligence in World War II did not have a record of a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault, the details of your query strongly correspond to the case of **André Joseph Scheinmann**, a German-Jewish refugee who became a British spy. It is highly likely that \"Andre Vernault\" is an alias or a misremembered name for Scheinmann.\n\nCounterintelligence suspected Scheinmann of being a German spy because he concealed his true role as an agent for the British while working as a **translator and liaison for the German High Command at the French National Railroads headquarters in Brittany**.\n\nBorn in Germany, Joseph Scheinmann fled to France to escape the Nazis. At the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the French army and was given the alias \"André Peulevey\" to hide his German and Jewish origins. After escaping a prisoner-of-war camp, he was recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6).\n\nHis undercover work as a translator and liaison with the Germans was his true, but concealed, profession from those who were not aware of his espionage activities. This position gave him access to valuable intelligence which he passed on to the Allies. This close association with the German command would naturally have made him a subject of suspicion for counterintelligence services unaware of his allegiance to the British.\n\n<<<translator and liaison for the German High Command at the French National Railroads headquarters in Brittany>>>"
