    "A single patch of surface code with `b` holes can encode `k = b` logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch with two holes encodes two logical qubits.\n\nWhen using multiple patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch, assuming they are operated on as distinct logical units. The use of multiple patches is a standard method for increasing the number of logical qubits in a quantum computer. Operations between these logical qubits, encoded in separate patches, can be performed using techniques like lattice surgery, which involves the temporary merging and splitting of the patches.\n\nGiven two separate patches of surface code, each with two holes, the total number of logical qubits would be the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n*   Patch 1: 2 holes = 2 logical qubits\n*   Patch 2: 2 holes = 2 logical qubits\n\nTherefore, two patches of surface code with two holes each can encode a maximum of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
