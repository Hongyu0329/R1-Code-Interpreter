    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group, or plane crystallographic group, is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the rotation and reflection symmetries of the pattern that keep a single point fixed.\n\nDue to the crystallographic restriction theorem, the only possible orders for the rotational symmetries in a wallpaper group are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. This limits the possible point groups to the cyclic groups C<sub>n</sub> and the dihedral groups D<sub>n</sub>, where n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\nThe order of a cyclic group C<sub>n</sub> is n, and the order of a dihedral group D<sub>n</sub> is 2n. Therefore, a point group of order 2 can be either the cyclic group C<sub>2</sub> or the dihedral group D<sub>1</sub>.\n\nBy examining the 17 wallpaper groups, we can identify those with these specific point groups:\n\n*   **Point Group C<sub>2</sub>:** The only wallpaper group with this point group is **p2**. This group has 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **Point Group D<sub>1</sub>:** There are three wallpaper groups with this point group: **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**. These groups contain reflections and glide reflections but no rotational symmetries.\n\nIn summary, there is one wallpaper group with point group C<sub>2</sub> and three wallpaper groups with point group D<sub>1</sub>, making a total of four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
