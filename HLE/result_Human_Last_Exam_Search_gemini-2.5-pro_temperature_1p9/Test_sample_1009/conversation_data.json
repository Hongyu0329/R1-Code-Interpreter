    "The largest possible weight of a compact, first-countable topological group $G$ with cardinality $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$ is $\\frak c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this answer:\n\n### 1. The Weight of a Compact Group and Its Quotients\n\nA crucial theorem in the theory of topological groups states that the weight of any compact group $G$, denoted $w(G)$, is equal to the supremum of the weights of its Hausdorff quotients. A Hausdorff quotient is a group of the form $G/N$, where $N$ is a closed normal subgroup of $G$.\n\nSo, we have the relation:\n$w(G) = \\sup \\{ w(H) \\mid H \\text{ is a Hausdorff quotient of } G \\}$\n\n### 2. Properties of the Hausdorff Quotients\n\nLet $H$ be any Hausdorff quotient of $G$. Since $G$ is compact and first-countable, and the quotient map from $G$ to $H$ is continuous and open, the group $H$ must also be compact and first-countable. Therefore, any Hausdorff quotient $H$ of our group $G$ is a **compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group**.\n\n### 3. Cardinality of the Quotients\n\nA fundamental result by the topologist A.V. Arhangel'skii states that the cardinality of any compact, first-countable, Hausdorff space is at most the cardinality of the continuum, $\\frak c$. Since our Hausdorff quotients $H$ fit this description, their cardinality is bounded:\n$|H| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$\n\n### 4. Bounding the Weight of the Quotients\n\nFor any Hausdorff topological space $X$, its weight is less than or equal to its cardinality, i.e., $w(X) \\le |X|$ (provided $X$ has more than one point). Applying this to our Hausdorff quotients $H$, we get:\n$w(H) \\le |H|$\n\nCombining this with the result from the previous step, we find that the weight of any Hausdorff quotient of $G$ is bounded by $\\frak c$:\n$w(H) \\le \\frak c$\n\n### 5. An Upper Bound for the Weight of G\n\nUsing the theorem from Step 1, we can now establish an upper bound for the weight of the original group $G$:\n$w(G) = \\sup \\{ w(H) \\} \\le \\frak c$\n\nThis shows that no matter how large the cardinality of such a group is, its weight cannot exceed $\\frak c$. The given cardinality of $2^{2^\\frak c}$ is largely a distractor, designed to mislead one into thinking the weight could be much larger.\n\n### 6. Attaining the Upper Bound\n\nTo show that $\\frak c$ is the *largest possible* weight, we need to construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of exactly $\\frak c$. We can do this with a product construction:\n\n1.  **Let $H_1$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $w(H_1) = \\frak c$**. Such groups exist. For example, a compact metrizable group whose topology is not separable will have weight $\\mathfrak{c}$. The existence of such groups is a standard result in the theory of topological groups.\n2.  **Let $K$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the indiscrete topology** (where the only open sets are the empty set and the group $K$ itself).\n    *   The indiscrete topology is compact.\n    *   It is first-countable because the set $\\{K\\}$ forms a countable local base at the identity.\n    *   It is not Hausdorff.\n3.  **Define the group $G$ as the direct product $G = H_1 \\times K$ with the product topology.**\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |H_1| \\times |K|$. Since $|H_1| \\le \\frak c$ and $|K| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, the product has cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Compactness:** $G$ is compact because it is the product of two compact spaces.\n    *   **First-countability:** $G$ is first-countable because it is the product of two first-countable spaces.\n    *   **Hausdorff Property:** $G$ is not Hausdorff because one of its factor spaces, $K$, is not Hausdorff.\n    *   **Weight:** The weight of a product of non-trivial spaces is the sum of their individual weights. The weight of $K$ with the indiscrete topology is 1. Therefore, $w(G) = w(H_1) + w(K) = \\frak c + 1 = \\frak c$.\n\nThis construction yields a group with all the required properties and a weight of $\\frak c$. Since we have shown that the weight can be no larger than $\\frak c$ and have constructed an example where the weight is equal to $\\frak c$, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<c>>>"
