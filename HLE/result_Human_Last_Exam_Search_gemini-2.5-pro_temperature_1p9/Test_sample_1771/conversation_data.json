    "Based on the principles of historical linguistics, the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb **\\*seh₂gieti**, meaning \"'(s)he’s giving a sign'\", and related to Latin *sāgīre* ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite *sākizzi* ('(s)he gives a sign'), develops into the following forms in the Germanic languages:\n\nThe reconstruction proceeds through several key sound changes that mark the transition from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic and its subsequent evolution into the older Germanic dialects.\n\n### **1. From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic**\n\nFirst, the PIE form undergoes changes that define the Proto-Germanic language:\n*   **Vowel and Laryngeal change**: The PIE laryngeal **\\*h₂** colors the adjacent vowel **\\*e** to **\\*a**. This **\\*a** then develops into the long vowel **\\*ō** in Proto-Germanic, a common evolution in this context.\n*   **Grimm's Law**: This fundamental law of Germanic phonology alters the consonants. The voiced stop **\\*g** becomes a voiceless stop **\\*k**, and the voiceless stop **\\*t** becomes a voiceless dental fricative **\\*þ** (the \"th\" sound in \"thin\").\n*   **Suffix development**: The PIE present tense suffix **\\*-ieti** corresponds to the first class of weak verbs in Proto-Germanic. The Proto-Germanic third-person singular present indicative form of the verb *sōkijaną* (to seek) is reconstructed as **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n### **2. From Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages**\n\nFrom the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkiþ**, the verb evolves according to the specific sound laws of each descendant language.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: ***sōkiþ*** (meaning '(s)he seeks')\n\n*   **Old Norse**: ***sǿkir***\n    *   **I-Umlaut**: The long vowel **\\*ō** is fronted to **\\*ǿ** due to the influence of the following /i/.\n    *   **Ending Change**: The dental fricative ending **\\*-þ** becomes **\\*-r** in the third-person singular present indicative in Old Norse.\n\n*   **Old English**: ***sēċþ***\n    *   **I-Umlaut**: In Old English, the **\\*ō** undergoes i-mutation to become **\\*ē**.\n    *   **Palatalization**: Before the new front vowel **\\*ē**, the velar consonant **\\*k** is palatalized, becoming the affricate **ċ** (pronounced /tʃ/, as in \"church\").\n\n*   **Old High German**: ***suohhit***\n    *   **Vowel Breaking**: Proto-Germanic **\\*ō** diphthongizes, or \"breaks,\" into **\\*uo** in Old High German.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift**: The Proto-Germanic **\\*k** shifts to the voiceless fricative **hh** (pronounced /x/, like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\") when it appears after a vowel.\n    *   **Ending Change**: The ending **\\*-iþ** becomes **\\*-it**.\n\n**<<<**\n*   **Proto-Germanic**: *sōkiþ*\n*   **Old Norse**: *sǿkir*\n*   **Old English**: *sēċþ*\n*   **Old High German**: *suohhit*\n**>>>**"
