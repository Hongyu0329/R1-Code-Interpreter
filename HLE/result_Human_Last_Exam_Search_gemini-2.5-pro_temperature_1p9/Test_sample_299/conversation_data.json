    "The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in that set. We are asked to determine the number of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's establish some properties of any such function $f$. The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing and its range is the set of positive real numbers.\nIf $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$, and therefore $x_1 = x_2$. This shows that $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function. A continuous injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotone (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\nIf $f$ were strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ would be strictly increasing. This is consistent with the right-hand side, $\\exp(x)$, which is strictly increasing. However, a strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point, say $x_0$, such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. Thus, for this fixed point, the equation becomes $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. The equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions, which can be seen by observing that $\\exp(x) > x$ for all real $x$. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions.\n\nConsequently, any solution must be a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\nThe existence and number of such functions can be determined by a construction method:\n1.  Any solution $f$ must have a unique real root $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$. This is because the range of $f$ must be an interval, and to produce the range $(0, \\infty)$ for $f \\circ f$, the function $f$ must take on values that, when $f$ is applied to them, yield all positive numbers. A careful analysis shows that there exists a unique $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for which $f(c)=0$.\n\n2.  From $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we can substitute $x=c$, which gives $f(f(c)) = \\exp(c)$. Since $f(c)=0$, we get $f(0) = \\exp(c)$.\n\n3.  Since $f$ is strictly increasing, and we have $c$ and $0$ as inputs, we can compare their outputs. If $c < 0$, then $f(c) < f(0)$, which means $0 < \\exp(c)$. This is always true. If $c=0$, then $f(0)=0$ and $f(0)=\\exp(0)=1$, a contradiction. If $c>0$, then $f(c)>f(0)$, which means $0 > \\exp(c)$, which is impossible. So, we must have $c < 0$.\n\n4.  The construction of a solution begins by choosing a value for $c \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. Then, one defines $f$ on the interval $[c, 0]$. We need $f$ to be a continuous and strictly increasing function that maps $[c, 0]$ to $[f(c), f(0)]$, which is $[0, \\exp(c)]$. Let's call such a function $h$.\n\n5.  The number of such functions $h$ for a fixed $c$ is the set of continuous, strictly increasing bijections between the two intervals. This set has the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$. This is because for any number $y$ between $0$ and $\\exp(c)$, we can choose $f(c/2)$ to be $y$, and construct a piecewise linear function, showing there are at least as many such functions as there are real numbers.\n\n6.  Once $f$ is defined on $[c, 0]$, its definition can be extended uniquely to the entire real line by repeatedly using the original equation. For instance, for $x \\in [0, \\exp(c)]$, $x$ is the image of some $t \\in [c,0]$ under $f$. We then define $f(x) = f(f(t)) = \\exp(t)$. This process can be continued indefinitely.\n\n7.  A unique solution $f$ is generated for each pair $(c, h)$, where $c \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and $h$ is a strictly increasing homeomorphism from $[c,0]$ to $[0, \\exp(c)]$.\n\nThe number of choices for $c$ is the cardinality of the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$, which is $\\mathfrak{c}$. For each choice of $c$, the number of possible functions $h$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since different choices of $(c,h)$ lead to distinct solutions, the total number of solutions is the product of these cardinalities: $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$, or $2^{\\aleph_0}$)>>>"
