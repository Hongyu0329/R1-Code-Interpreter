    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a hypothesis class is the size of the largest set of points that the class can \"shatter\". A class shatters a set of points if, for every possible way of labeling the points as positive (1) or negative (0), there is a hypothesis in the class that can produce that exact labeling.\n\nThe hypothesis class in question is $H_{z-ones} = \\{h:X \\to \\{0,1\\}: |\\{x: h(x)=1\\}|=z\\}$. This is the set of all binary classifiers on a domain `X` of size `T` that label exactly `z` points as positive.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension, we must find the largest integer `d` such that there exists a set of `d` points that can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$.\n\n### Lower Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nLet `d = min(z, T - z)`. We will show that any set of points `S` with size `d` can be shattered by $H_{z-ones}$. This establishes that the VC dimension is at least `d`.\n\nConsider an arbitrary set `S ⊆ X` with `|S| = d`. To shatter `S`, for any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of the points in `S`, we must be able to find a hypothesis `h` in $H_{z-ones}$ that agrees with that labeling.\n\nLet's take an arbitrary labeling for `S`, and let `k` be the number of points in `S` labeled as 1. So, `0 ≤ k ≤ d`. For a hypothesis `h` to produce this labeling, it must satisfy:\n1.  `h(x) = 1` for the `k` points in `S` labeled as 1.\n2.  `h(x) = 0` for the `d-k` points in `S` labeled as 0.\n\nFor this hypothesis `h` to be in the class $H_{z-ones}$, it must label a total of exactly `z` points in `X` as 1. It has already assigned `k` ones within `S`, so it must assign the remaining `z - k` ones to points outside of `S`, in the set `X \\ S`.\n\nThe number of points available outside of `S` is `|X \\ S| = T - d`. This is possible if and only if we can choose `z - k` points from the `T - d` available points. This requires:\n*   `z - k ≥ 0`  (We cannot choose a negative number of points).\n*   `z - k ≤ T - d` (We cannot choose more points than are available).\n\nLet's check these two conditions:\n1.  **Is `z - k ≥ 0`?**\n    We know `k ≤ d`. By our definition of `d`, `d = min(z, T - z)`, which implies `d ≤ z`. Therefore, `k ≤ z`, which confirms `z - k ≥ 0`.\n2.  **Is `z - k ≤ T - d`?**\n    This is equivalent to `d - k ≤ T - z`. We know `k ≥ 0`, so the maximum value of `d - k` is `d` (when `k=0`). So we need to check if `d ≤ T - z`. By our definition of `d`, `d = min(z, T - z)`, which implies `d ≤ T - z`. The condition holds.\n\nSince both conditions are met for any `k` (from 0 to `d`), we can always construct a valid hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ for any of the $2^d$ possible labelings of the set `S`. Thus, $H_{z-ones}$ shatters any set of size `d = min(z, T - z)`. This implies that the VC dimension is at least `d`.\n\n### Upper Bound for the VC Dimension\n\nNow, we will show that no set of size `d + 1` can be shattered. This establishes that the VC dimension is at most `d`. Let `d = min(z, T - z)`. Consider any set `S` of size `d + 1`. We analyze two cases:\n\n**Case 1: `z ≤ T - z`**\nIn this case, `d = z`. Consider a set `S` of size `d + 1 = z + 1`. Let's examine the labeling where all `z + 1` points in `S` are labeled as 1. To create this labeling, a hypothesis `h` would need to assign `h(x) = 1` for at least `z + 1` points. However, every hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ must assign 1 to *exactly* `z` points. Therefore, this labeling cannot be generated, and the set `S` cannot be shattered.\n\n**Case 2: `z > T - z`**\nIn this case, `d = T - z`. Consider a set `S` of size `d + 1 = T - z + 1`. Let's examine the labeling where all `d + 1` points in `S` are labeled as 0. For a hypothesis `h` to produce this labeling, it must assign `h(x) = 0` for all `x` in `S`. To be in the class $H_{z-ones}`, this `h` must still assign 1 to exactly `z` points in the entire domain `X`. Since all points in `S` are labeled 0, these `z` points must all come from the set `X \\ S`. The size of this set is `|X \\ S| = T - |S| = T - (T - z + 1) = z - 1`. It is impossible to choose `z` points to label as 1 from a set containing only `z - 1` points. Therefore, this labeling cannot be generated, and the set `S` cannot be shattered. [15]\n\nIn both cases, any set of size `d + 1` cannot be shattered.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the VC dimension of the class $H_{z-ones}$ is exactly `d`.\n\n<<<min(z, T - z)>>>"
