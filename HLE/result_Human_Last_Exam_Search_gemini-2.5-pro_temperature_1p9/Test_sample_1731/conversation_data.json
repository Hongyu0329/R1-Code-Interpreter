    "Using Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chenoff large deviation theorems, the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photon gas) are determined. These theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework for statistical mechanics, affirming that the state of thermodynamic equilibrium is the most probable state, with deviations being exponentially unlikely. The application of this framework to a photon gas reproduces the foundational results of Bose and Planck.\n\nA key feature of a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (black-body radiation) is that the number of photons is not conserved; they are absorbed and emitted by the walls of the container. This leads to a chemical potential of zero, which simplifies the statistical analysis.\n\nThe equilibrium properties are derived within this context:\n\n### Mean Energy\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem, applied to the energy of the photon gas, helps in understanding the probability distribution of the total energy. The mean energy of the photon gas in a volume *V* at an equilibrium temperature *T* is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is an integration of Planck's radiation law over all frequencies:\n\n***E*** = (8π⁵k⁴V / 15h³c³) T⁴\n\nwhere:\n*   ***V*** is the volume.\n*   ***k*** is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   ***h*** is the Planck constant.\n*   ***c*** is the speed of light.\n*   ***T*** is the absolute temperature.\n\n### Entropy\nSanov's theorem concerns the probability of the empirical distribution of particles across different states deviating from the true equilibrium distribution. For a photon gas, this corresponds to the distribution of photons among various energy levels. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy. The entropy, *S*, of a photon gas at equilibrium is:\n\n***S*** = (32π⁵k⁴V / 45h³c³) T³\n\nThe large deviation approach shows that the thermodynamic entropy is directly related to the large deviation rate function, and the maximization of entropy corresponds to finding the most probable macroscopic state of the system.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (E):**\n\n*E* = (8π⁵k⁴V / 15h³c³) T⁴\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n\n*S* = (32π⁵k⁴V / 45h³c³) T³\n>>>"
