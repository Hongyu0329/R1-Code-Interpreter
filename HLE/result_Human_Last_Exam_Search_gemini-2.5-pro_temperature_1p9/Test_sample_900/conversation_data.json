    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene from the Forsythe production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nA video recording of this specific performance, dated November 9, 2015, was located on YouTube, but the content is no longer available for viewing. Without access to this visual record, a precise count of the ballet steps is impossible.\n\nReviews and official ballet repertoires confirm that Svetlana Gileva, a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, has performed in William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\". The choreography is known for its deconstruction and evolution of classical ballet technique, which was heavily influenced by the work of George Balanchine. However, an analysis of the specific steps performed in the \"Jete Woman solo\" requires direct observation.\n\nSearches for detailed choreographic notes or reviews of the 2015 Semperoper Ballett production that might enumerate the specific steps of this solo were unsuccessful. While some reviews mention the production in general terms, they do not provide a move-by-move breakdown. The identification of a \"pas de Balanchine\" itself can be complex, as it is a specific stylistic movement rather than a universally codified step, further complicating a count without visual reference.\n\nDue to the lack of available visual evidence of the performance, a factual and accurate answer to your question cannot be provided.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
