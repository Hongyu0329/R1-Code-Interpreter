    "The integral to evaluate is `V = ∫[0, 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`.\nThis is a standard integral of the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, which evaluates to `ln|f(x)| + C`.\nFor a definite integral from 0 to 1, the value is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated between 0 and 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\nFirst, let's determine `F₃(x)`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration:\n*   At `x = 1`: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n*   At `x = 0`: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\nFor the given interval `x ∈ [0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is always non-negative. Therefore, `e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to 1. This means `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to 2, and `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always greater than or equal to `ln(2)`, which is positive. Thus, the absolute value signs can be omitted.\n\nThe value of the integral `V` is:\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2))`\n\nTo find the final answer, we need to compute the numerical value of `V` and then multiply it by 10000.\n\nUsing a calculator:\n*   `sin(1)` (with 1 in radians) ≈ 0.84147\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.3197\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.3197\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ ln(3.3197) ≈ 1.200\n*   `ln(2)` ≈ 0.6931\n*   `V` ≈ `ln(1.200 / 0.6931)` ≈ `ln(1.7314)` ≈ 0.5489\n\nNow, we calculate `10000 * V`:\n`10000 * 0.5489 = 5489`\n\nThe closest integer to `10000 * V` is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
