    "To determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we first identify the space in question. The space of $3$-dimensional subspaces of a $5$-dimensional real vector space is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, also denoted as $G(3, 5)$.\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of real Grassmannians, $H^*(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n); \\mathbb{Z})$, can have a non-trivial torsion subgroup, which is always 2-torsion. This means that every torsion element has order 2. The rank of any finite group, including the torsion subgroup of an abelian group, is 0. However, the phrase \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" can be interpreted as asking for a description of the structure of the torsion part of the cohomology.\n\nThe dimension of the manifold $G(3, 5)$ is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. Therefore, the cohomology groups $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ are trivial for $i>6$. The non-trivial cohomology groups are listed below.\n\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an abelian group is the subgroup of all elements of finite order. For the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, the torsion subgroup is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^i$.\n\nLet's find the torsion subgroup for each degree $i$:\n*   $T(H^0) = 0$\n*   $T(H^1) = 0$\n*   $T(H^2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^3) = 0$\n*   $T(H^4) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^5) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of these subgroups:\n$T(H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThis can also be written as $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$. The question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup\". The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of free generators, which for a finite group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
