    "Based on the scientific literature, the peptide RGDSPSS is a variation of the well-studied integrin-binding peptide sequence RGDSP. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif is a primary recognition site for many integrin receptors. The amino acids that flank this core motif are known to modulate the binding affinity and specificity to different integrin subtypes.\n\nSeveral studies confirm the binding of peptides containing the RGDSP sequence to integrins:\n*   The peptide GRGDSP has been used as an integrin ligand-mimetic in studies with primary cortical neurons, where it was shown to induce intracellular signaling, confirming its binding to integrin receptors.\n*   A commercially available product, G4RGDSP, is specifically described as an integrin-binding peptide that targets integrin receptors.\n*   The similar peptide RGDS has been shown to bind to integrin homologs in amphibian oocytes.\n\nWhile other peptides in the list contain the RGD motif, the RGDSP sequence has been more directly documented as participating in integrin binding in in vitro assays. For instance, a thesis identified the peptide RGDLTTP as a promising candidate from a screening assay, indicating a high likelihood of binding. However, the evidence for the RGDSP sequence is more established in the referenced literature for direct integrin interaction in functional assays. The other peptides (RGDMAA, RGDQVSK, RGDARGG) did not appear in the search results as known integrin-binding sequences.\n\nTherefore, RGDSPSS is the peptide among the choices with the strongest evidence of being found to bind to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<B>>>"
