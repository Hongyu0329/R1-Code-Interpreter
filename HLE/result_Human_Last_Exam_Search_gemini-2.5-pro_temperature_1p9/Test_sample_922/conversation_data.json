    "The integer value that completes the sequence is 5.\n\nThe sequence `24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296` is part of a counterexample to the Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture. This conjecture posits that for any positive integers `k`, `m`, and `n` where `k > 3` and `m, n >= 1`, if the sum of `m` k-th powers is equal to the sum of `n` k-th powers, then `m + n >= k`.\n\nIn August 2022, a new counterexample to this conjecture was announced. The sequence provided by the user represents six of the integers in an equation where the sum of seven 5th powers equals a 5th power. The complete equation is:\n\n24663⁵ + 35005⁵ + 119261⁵ + 196219⁵ + 211770⁵ + 227296⁵ + 90369⁵ = 237473⁵\n\nThis finding is significant as it provides a new instance of a \"sum of like powers\" that violates the conjecture. The integer that \"completes\" the sequence by defining the power to which all the numbers are raised is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
