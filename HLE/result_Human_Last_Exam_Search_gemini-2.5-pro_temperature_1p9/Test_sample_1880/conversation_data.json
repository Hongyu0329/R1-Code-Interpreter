    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: The polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion. For the prime $p=2$, 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1, and $2^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. Because the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant**: The discriminant of a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n    The Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. We check if 591872 is a perfect square: $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: For a quartic polynomial $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - by^2 + (ac-4d)y - (a^2d - 4bd + c^2)$. For $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14$.\n    Substituting these values, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $R(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 \\cdot 8 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (0^2 \\cdot 14 - 4 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 14 + 8^2)$\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: The Galois group of the quartic is related to the reducibility of its resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $S_4$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n    We test for rational roots of $R(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64=0$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Potential rational roots must be divisors of -64. Testing the integer divisors, we find:\n    $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n    Since $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not $S_4$. The options are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n5.  **Distinguish between D4 and C4**: To differentiate between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = 591872 = 544^2 \\cdot 2$, so the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n    *   If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n\n    A test for reducibility involves checking if any of the roots of the resolvent cubic are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The roots of the resolvent cubic $y^3-56y-64=0$ are $y=8$ and the roots of the quadratic factor $(y^3-56y-64)/(y-8) = y^2+8y+8$. The roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$ are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n    So, the roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. We check if any of these can be written as the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. An element $a=u+v\\sqrt{2}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ has a square $a^2 = (u^2+2v^2) + 2uv\\sqrt{2}$. We check the root $y=8$. It is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ since $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\n    Since one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This confirms the Galois group is $D_4$. The order of the dihedral group $D_4$ is 8.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
