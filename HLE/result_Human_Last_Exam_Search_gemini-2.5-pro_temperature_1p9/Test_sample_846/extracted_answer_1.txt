To be functionally accurate, the azobenzene-shaped picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, the table should bend or fold from a flatter, elongated shape (the *trans* isomer) into a bent, V-shape (the *cis* isomer) due to the presence of UV light. At sunset, the table should return to its original flatter shape as the molecule relaxes back to the *trans* form in the dark.
