    "The VC dimension of a set of hypotheses, or a concept class, measures the complexity of that class. It is defined as the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the class. A set of points is \"shattered\" if for every possible labeling of the points, there is a hypothesis in the class that produces that labeling.\n\nTo determine the VC dimension of the logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with 4 unary predicates, we first need to characterize the \"concepts\" or sets that can be defined by its formulas.\n\n### 1. Characterizing the Definable Sets\n\nThe schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3,$ and $P_4$. The logical formulas can use these predicates, along with existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants top ($\\top$, true) and bottom ($\\bot$, false). The goal is to define sets of elements, so we are interested in formulas with one free variable, say $x$.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic can be written in prenex normal form, where all existential quantifiers are at the front: $\\exists y_1, ..., \\exists y_k. \\psi(x, y_1, ..., y_k)$. The quantifier-free part, $\\psi$, is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since the predicates are all unary, these atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, ..., y_k\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the atoms involving the free variable $x$ from those that do not:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists \\vec{y} . \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\land \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} Q_j(\\vec{y}) \\right)$\nwhere $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and each $Q_j$ is an atom involving only the existentially quantified variables $\\vec{y}$. This is logically equivalent to:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists \\vec{y} . \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} Q_j(\\vec{y}) \\right)$\n\nThe second part of this formula, $\\exists \\vec{y} . \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} Q_j(\\vec{y})$, is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given model (a universe of elements and interpretations for the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set ($\\emptyset$).\n*   If the sentence is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This defines the set of all elements $x$ that satisfy all predicates $P_i$ for $i \\in I$. This corresponds to the intersection of the extensions of these predicates.\n\nTherefore, for any given model, the collection of sets definable by formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is the collection of all possible intersections of the extensions of the four predicates, $\\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\}$. This is a concept class formed by the intersections of 4 base sets.\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of a concept class formed by all intersections of $k=4$ given sets.\n\n**Lower Bound (VC dimension $\\ge 4$):**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a model with a set of 4 elements that can be shattered. Let the universe of our model be the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to define the extensions of the predicates $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ as subsets of $X$ such that any subset of $X$ can be formed by their intersection.\n\nLet's define the extension of predicate $P_i$ to be $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. So:\n*   $S_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow, for any desired subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can obtain it by choosing the concept $C_I = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ where $I = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y \\}$. An element $x_j$ belongs to this intersection if and only if $x_j \\in S_i$ for all $i \\in I$. By our definition of $S_i$, this means $x_j \\neq x_i$ for all $i \\in I$. This is equivalent to saying that $j \\notin I$. The set of such $x_j$ is exactly $X \\setminus \\{x_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$, which is $Y$.\nFor example, to obtain the subset $\\{x_1, x_3\\}$, we choose the index set $I=\\{2, 4\\}$. The resulting set is $S_2 \\cap S_4 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$.\nSince we can generate all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$ this way, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Upper Bound (VC dimension $\\le 4$):**\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, one must be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. The concept class we are considering is formed by taking intersections of 4 base sets. The index set for the intersection can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. There are $2^4 = 16$ such index sets. This means our concept class can define at most 16 distinct sets.\nNow, suppose we want to shatter a set of 5 elements. This would require generating all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets. Since our concept class can produce at most 16 distinct sets, it is impossible to shatter a set of 5 elements. Therefore, the VC dimension cannot be greater than 4.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
