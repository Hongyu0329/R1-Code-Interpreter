    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides trajectories with different long-term behaviors. These are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe find the equilibrium points by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. This yields the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This yields the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point.\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   At **(1, 0)**, the Jacobian is $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node**.\n*   At **(1, -1)**, the Jacobian is $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point at (1, -1) act as separatrices. We look for a specific trajectory that could form a separatrix, particularly one connecting equilibrium points.\n\nBy testing for a simple polynomial solution, we can verify that the curve **d = -uÂ²** is an exact solution to the system.\n\nTo verify, we substitute $d = -u^2$ and its time derivative $d' = -2uu'$ into the first differential equation:\n*   Left-hand side (LHS): $d' = -2u \\cdot u^2(u-1) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n*   Right-hand side (RHS):\n    $2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n    $= 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n    $= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the relation $d = -u^2$ describes a trajectory of the system for all $u$.\n\nThis trajectory passes through the equilibrium points (0, 0) (since $d=-(0)^2=0$) and (1, -1) (since $d=-(1)^2=-1$). A trajectory connecting two equilibria, where one is a saddle point, must lie on an unstable or stable manifold of that saddle.\n\nThe slope of this curve at the saddle point (1, -1) is given by $\\frac{d(d)}{du} = -2u$, which is -2 at u=1. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ of the Jacobian at (1, -1). Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThis curve is the separatrix for the system in the upper half-plane $u \\ge 0$. For $0 \\le u < 1$, it separates the basin of attraction of the origin from the region of trajectories where $d \\to \\infty$.\n\nThus, the separatrix of the system is the parabola given by the equation:\n$$d = -u^2$$\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
