    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can utilize the theory of Jacobi theta functions and q-series.\n\nLet the product be denoted by $P$. We can write it using the q-Pochhammer symbol notation. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product is then:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots$\nIn terms of the q-Pochhammer symbol, this is denoted as $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n\nThis product is related to the Jacobi theta functions. The four theta functions are commonly denoted as $\\vartheta_1(z,q)$, $\\vartheta_2(z,q)$, $\\vartheta_3(z,q)$, and $\\vartheta_4(z,q)$. When the first argument $z$ is zero, we write them as $\\vartheta_i(q)$. Their infinite product representations are fundamental.\n\nA convenient notation for certain products related to theta functions was introduced by the Borwein brothers, where $b(q) = (q;q^2)_\\infty$. Thus, we want to find the value of $b(e^{-\\pi})$.\n\nThere is a known identity that relates $b(q)$ to the theta functions:\n$b(q)^3 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(q)^2}{\\vartheta_2(q)\\vartheta_3(q)}$\n\nWe need to evaluate this expression for $q = e^{-\\pi}$. This value of $q$ is special in the theory of elliptic functions and corresponds to the case where the nome is $e^{-\\pi}$, which implies that the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind, $K$ and $K'$, are equal. This leads to the singular value of the elliptic modulus $k$ being $k = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor this specific value of $q$, there is a key relationship between the theta constants:\n$\\vartheta_2(e^{-\\pi}) = \\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})$\n\nSubstituting this into the identity for $b(q)^3$, we get:\n$P^3 = b(e^{-\\pi})^3 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2}{\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})\\vartheta_3(e^{-\\pi})} = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\vartheta_3(e^{-\\pi})}$\n\nThe ratio of these two theta constants is related to the complementary elliptic modulus $k' = \\sqrt{1-k^2}$. The identity is:\n$\\frac{\\vartheta_4(q)}{\\vartheta_3(q)} = \\sqrt{k'}$\n\nFor $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we have $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$, so the complementary modulus is:\n$k' = \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 1/2} = \\sqrt{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the theta constants is:\n$\\frac{\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\vartheta_3(e^{-\\pi})} = \\sqrt{1/\\sqrt{2}} = (2^{-1/2})^{1/2} = 2^{-1/4}$.\n\nNow we can find the value of $P^3$:\n$P^3 = 2^{-1/4}$.\n\nFinally, taking the cube root of both sides gives the closed expression for the infinite product:\n$P = (2^{-1/4})^{1/3} = 2^{-1/12}$.\n\n<<<2^(-1/12)>>>"
