    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which occurred on November 8, 1917, during the First World War.\n\nLady Elizabeth Butler, a prominent British painter of military scenes, captured this engagement in a watercolour painting titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj, 8th November 1917*. The battle was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and is considered one of the last significant British cavalry charges in history. The charge was made against a rearguard of German, Austrian, and Turkish artillery and infantry.\n\nWhile Lady Butler painted scenes from numerous conflicts throughout her career, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the Anglo-Zulu War, her works from the First World War depict the most recent historical events. Among her known World War I paintings are:\n\n*   ***The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons***, depicting events of 1914.\n*   A painting of the London Irish Rifles at the Battle of Loos in September 1915.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916***, showing a charge against Senussi forces in Egypt.\n*   ***A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders***, her last oil painting, was completed in 1929 but portrays a scene from the First World War without a specific date attached.\n\nComparing these, the Charge at Huj in November 1917 is the latest specific historical battle that Lady Butler depicted.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
