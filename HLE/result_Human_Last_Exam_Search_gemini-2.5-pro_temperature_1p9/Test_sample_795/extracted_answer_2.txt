**Final Answer:** The analytical expression for the initial magnetization curve of the superconducting bar in the limit b<<a is given by:

*   **For `0 ≤ H ≤ Jc * b`:**
    `M(H) = -H * (1 - H / (2 * Jc * b))`

*   **For `H > Jc * b`:**
    `M(H) = - (Jc * b) / 2`

where:
*   `M` is the magnetization.
*   `H` is the applied magnetic field.
*   `Jc` is the constant critical-current density.
*   `b` is half the thickness of the bar.
