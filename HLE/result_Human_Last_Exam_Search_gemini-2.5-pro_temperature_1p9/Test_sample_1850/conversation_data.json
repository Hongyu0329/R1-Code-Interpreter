    "John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions at least eight historical saints by name. These figures, recognized as saints within various Christian traditions, play roles ranging from central characters to significant allusions within the text.\n\nThe saints named in *Paradise Lost* are:\n\n*   **The Archangels:** Four archangels who are prominent characters in the poem are also venerated as saints.\n    *   **Michael:** The leader of God's army, who is revered as a saint in numerous Christian denominations.\n    *   **Gabriel:** An archangel who guards the Garden of Eden and is also venerated as a saint.\n    *   **Raphael:** The archangel sent to warn Adam and Eve, he is also recognized as a saint.\n    *   **Uriel:** An archangel tricked by Satan, Uriel is considered a saint in Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, and some other traditions.\n\n*   **The First Humans:**\n    *   **Adam and Eve:** The progenitors of humanity are central to the poem's narrative. Both are venerated as saints in Eastern Christian traditions and are recognized in some Catholic liturgical calendars.\n\n*   **Old Testament Prophets and Leaders:**\n    *   **Enoch and Elijah:** Milton refers to \"translated Saints,\" a direct allusion to Enoch and Elijah, who, according to the Old Testament, were taken into heaven without experiencing death. They are regarded as saints in many Christian traditions.\n    *   **Joshua:** The successor to Moses is mentioned by name in the poem. He is recognized as a saint in the Catholic and Orthodox churches.\n\nWhile the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is a central figure whose future sacrifice is foretold, he is generally not referred to by the title of \"saint\" in the same way as his followers. Therefore, he is not included in this count. The named characters in the poem include Adam, Eve, and the angels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel. The text also makes specific reference to other biblical figures who are considered saints, allowing for a comprehensive list.\n\n<<<8>>>"
