    "A finite group G is called a **filled group** if the union of all its maximum by inclusion product-free sets is equal to the group G itself. A set S is **product-free** if for any two elements x and y in S (not necessarily distinct), their product xy is not in S. This means every element of a filled group must belong to at least one product-free set that is maximal by inclusion.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups has been established in research building upon the initial work of Street and Whitehead, who first defined the concept. A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is a p-group for some prime p.\n\nThe complete classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is as follows:\n\n*   **For odd primes p:** A nilpotent group of odd order is filled if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the cyclic groups **C₃** or **C₅**.\n\n*   **For the prime p = 2:** A 2-group is filled if it is one of the following:\n    *   **Elementary abelian 2-groups:** These are groups of the form (C₂)ⁿ for some integer n ≥ 1, which is the direct product of n copies of the cyclic group of order 2.\n    *   **Specific non-abelian 2-groups:** There are four known non-abelian filled 2-groups:\n        *   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted **D₈**.\n        *   The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted **D₈ × C₂**.\n        *   The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8, denoted **D₈ ∗ Q₈**.\n        *   The direct product of the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈ and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted **(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂**.\n\nIn summary, a finite group G is a filled nilpotent group if and only if it is isomorphic to one of the groups listed above. No other finite nilpotent groups satisfy the condition of being filled.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the elementary abelian 2-groups, the cyclic groups C₃ and C₅, and the non-abelian 2-groups D₈, D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, and (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
