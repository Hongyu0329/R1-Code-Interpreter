    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we need to consider the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then sum them up for the entire molecule.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** Each carbon atom is described by 9 contracted Gaussian functions. The core (1s) is represented by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians. The valence shell (2s and 2p) is split into two parts (a \"double zeta\" representation). The inner part of the valence shell (2s and 2p) is described by one set of s and p functions, each contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians. The outer part is described by another set of s and p functions, each consisting of a single primitive Gaussian. This gives a total of 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for the inner 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) + 4 (for the outer 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz) = 9 functions per carbon atom.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom is described by 2 contracted Gaussian functions. Its valence shell (1s) is also split. The inner part is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the outer part is a single primitive Gaussian. This results in 1 + 1 = 2 functions per hydrogen atom.\n\nNow, for toluene (C7H8):\n\n*   Total functions for Carbon = 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   Total functions for Hydrogen = 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum of the functions for all the atoms in the molecule:\n\nTotal functions = 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
