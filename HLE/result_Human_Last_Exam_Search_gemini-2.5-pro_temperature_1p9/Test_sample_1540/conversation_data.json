    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be as memory-efficient as possible.\n *\n * Input: Two strings on separate lines, each with a length between 1 and 100.\n * Output:\n *  - \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller.\n *  - \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger.\n *  - \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n *\n * Memory Efficiency Strategy:\n * 1.  The first string must be buffered because it's read entirely before the second string.\n *     A character array `s1` of size 101 (100 for characters + 1 for the null terminator) is allocated.\n * 2.  The second string is not stored in an array. Instead, it is read character by character\n *     from the input stream and immediately compared with the corresponding character from the first string.\n * 3.  The loop counter `i` for the strings' index only needs to go up to 99. An `unsigned char`\n *     is the smallest standard integer type that can hold this range (0-255), using only 1 byte.\n * 4.  A single `char` variable `c2` is used to temporarily store each character read from the second string.\n *\n * By following this approach, we avoid allocating a 101-byte buffer for the second string,\n * saving a significant amount of memory compared to a more straightforward implementation.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer is necessary for the first string. Maximum length is 100,\n    // plus one byte for the null terminator '\\0'.\n    // Memory usage: 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input. `scanf` stops at whitespace.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // After `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` reads the first string, the newline character `\\n`\n    // remains in the input buffer. We must consume it before reading the second string.\n    getchar();\n\n    // A loop index is needed. Since the string length is at most 100, the index\n    // will be in the range 0-99. `unsigned char` is sufficient (range 0-255)\n    // and is the most memory-efficient type for this.\n    // Memory usage: 1 byte.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to hold the current character from the second string.\n    // Memory usage: 1 byte.\n    char c2;\n\n    // Iterate through the first string (s1) and compare each character with a\n    // character read from the second string (stdin).\n    // The loop continues until the end of the first string. The problem guarantees\n    // both strings are the same length.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read the next character from standard input (the second string).\n        c2 = getchar();\n\n        // Compare the characters, ignoring their case.\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) < tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            puts(\"-1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower((unsigned char)s1[i]) > tolower((unsigned char)c2)) {\n            puts(\"1\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next index.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, it means all characters were equal.\n    puts(\"0\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe total memory `m` in bytes used for variables in the `main` function is calculated as follows:\n*   `char s1[101]`: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n*   `unsigned char i`: `1 * sizeof(unsigned char)` = 1 byte.\n*   `char c2`: `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
