In the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ (denoted by d) approaches zero, the generating function H(s,s′) for a planar Birkhoff billiard has the following leading-order behavior: H(s,s') ≈ -d + (κ(s)² / 24) * d³, where κ(s) is the local curvature of the boundary at the point s. This result shows that the leading deviation from the simple chord length `-d` is a third-order term that is quadratically dependent on the boundary's curvature.
