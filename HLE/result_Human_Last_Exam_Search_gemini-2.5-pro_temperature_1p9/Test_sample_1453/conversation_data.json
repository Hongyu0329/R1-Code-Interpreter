    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG, we must first identify the pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids that defines a coiled-coil structure. This pattern is known as a heptad repeat, which is a sequence of seven amino acids labeled `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, held together by \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given amino acid sequence:\n`GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to align this sequence to the heptad repeat to identify which amino acids occupy the crucial 'a' and 'd' positions. A common feature is a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues. The key hydrophobic residues in this sequence are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Tryptophan (W).\n\nLooking for a repeating pattern, we can assign the heptad positions. A highly plausible registration for this sequence, which places hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, is as follows:\n\n`g a b c d e f`\n`G E **I A** Q S **L**` (start of the repeating pattern seems to be offset)\n\nA better alignment is achieved by recognizing the repeating motifs and assigning the `abcdefg` register accordingly. The pattern that best fits the hydrophobic requirements for positions 'a' and 'd' is:\n\nSequence: `G E I` **A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L** `K G`\nRegister: `e f g` **a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d** `e f g`\n\nLet's organize this into a table for the four complete heptads:\n\n| Heptad Number | Position 'a' | Position 'd' |\n|:--- |:--- |:--- |\n| 1 | A | L |\n| 2 | A | L |\n| 3 | A | L |\n| 4 | A | L |\n*(Note: In the third heptad, residue 'W' (Tryptophan) is at position 'b')*\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern where the **'a' position is always occupied by Alanine (A)** and the **'d' position is always occupied by Leucine (L)**.\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is strongly determined by the identity and packing of the amino acid side chains at the 'a' and 'd' positions, a concept known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing. Seminal studies, particularly on the GCN4 leucine zipper, have established predictive rules based on these residues.\n\n*   **Dimer:** Favored by Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' (I-L). This packing is very stable in a two-helix bundle.\n*   **Trimer:** Favored by Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' (I-I). The branched side-chains of isoleucine pack efficiently in the core of a three-helix bundle.\n*   **Tetramer:** Favored by Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' (L-I).\n\nIn our sequence, we have an Alanine-Leucine (A-L) pattern. Alanine is a small hydrophobic residue. Its presence at the 'a' position, combined with Leucine at the 'd' position, creates a hydrophobic core that is most sterically and thermodynamically favorable for a **dimeric (2-helix)** coiled-coil. The small size of the Alanine side chains allows for the tight packing characteristic of a dimer without the steric hindrance that might force a higher-order oligomer.\n\nTherefore, based on the principles of knobs-into-holes interactions and packing efficiency determined by the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions, the protein sequence is predicted to form a dimer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
