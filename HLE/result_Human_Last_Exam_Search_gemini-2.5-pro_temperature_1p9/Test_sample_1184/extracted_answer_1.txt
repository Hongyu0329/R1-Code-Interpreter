**1) For interaction with the alpha-1 subunit, the key hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit (UniProt Q02641-1) are Leucine 205 (L205), Leucine 308 (L308), Leucine 342 (L342), and Leucine 347 (L347) located in the guanylate kinase (GK) domain. 2) For fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit, the hotspots are more complex and involve the interplay between the Src homology 3 (SH3) and GK domains. Specific residues that act as hotspots for modulation through post-translational modification include Serine 193 (S193) and Threonine 205 (T205) within the HOOK domain.**
