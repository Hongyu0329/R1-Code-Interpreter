    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, you can profitably open a very wide range of hands from the button due to your positional advantage and the absence of rake. The worst suited jack that should be opened is a matter of referring to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop charts for this specific scenario.\n\nModern GTO solvers indicate that from the button in a rake-free, 100 big blind deep game, the opening range is extensive. Analysis of such ranges shows that you should be opening all suited jack hands. Therefore, the weakest of these, and thus the worst one to open, is J2s.\n\nWhile some simplified charts might suggest a tighter range, detailed GTO solutions capitalize on the playability and bluffing potential of all suited hands in this highly advantageous position, especially without rake encouraging you to fight for the blinds. For instance, some strategy guides note that even very weak hands are viable opens from the button. Given that all suited hands are generally considered part of a GTO button-opening range in a rake-free environment, the one with the lowest kicker would be the worst.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
