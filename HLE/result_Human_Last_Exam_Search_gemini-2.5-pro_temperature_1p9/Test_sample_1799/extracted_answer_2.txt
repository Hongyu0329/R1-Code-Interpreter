It is not true that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. While applying the principle of relativity to Maxwell's equations implies the constancy of the speed of light, this approach relies on the assumption that Maxwell's equations are fundamental and universally applicable in all inertial frames, a notion that was not universally accepted before Einstein and implicitly contains the core of the second postulate. From a more fundamental standpoint, the first postulate alone, even with assumptions about the symmetry of spacetime, allows for different possible space-time structures (like Galilean or Minkowskian), and the second postulate is necessary to specify the correct one for our universe.
