    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor** in the nuclear criticality community, often denoted as *S(q, ω)*. It is also frequently referred to as the **scattering law**, represented in nuclear data libraries as *S(α, β)*.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position *r* at time *t*, given that another particle was at the origin at time *t* = 0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the energy and momentum transfer during scattering events.\n\nThis transformed function is fundamental in nuclear criticality safety analysis because it is directly proportional to the double-differential scattering cross-section. This cross-section data is essential for accurately modeling neutron transport and behavior in materials. Neutron transport codes, such as MCNP, use the scattering law, *S(α, β)*, which is derived from the dynamic structure factor, to perform criticality calculations. The dynamic structure factor contains information about the collective motions and correlations of atoms within a material.\n\nThe relationship between the generalized pair correlation function, also known as the Van Hove correlation function, and the dynamic structure factor is well-established in the field of neutron scattering. The dynamic structure factor essentially provides the same information as the generalized pair correlation function but in the frequency-wavevector domain, which is more directly applicable to the analysis of scattering experiments and transport simulations.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
