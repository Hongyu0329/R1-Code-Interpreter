    "The essay in question is \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" (\"Путеводитель по переименованному городу\") by the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. The essay is part of his 1986 collection \"Less Than One\".\n\nIn the essay, Brodsky reflects on the cityscape and architecture, drawing comparisons between his native Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and other European cities. After being expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972, he briefly stayed in Vienna.\n\nThe specific passage describes a person standing on Vienna's Ringstrasse, one of its famous wide boulevards. The person's gaze falls on a street sign for \"Luegerring\" (named after the former mayor of Vienna, Karl Lueger). Brodsky writes that to a Russian ear, this German name sounds peculiar. He notes that a Russian might pronounce it to themselves as \"Луиджерринг\" (\"Luijerring\") and whimsically think it must be the name of an English poet.\n\nThe mention of an \"English poet\" is a subtle literary puzzle based on a phonetic pun. While there is no definitive answer provided by Brodsky himself, literary analysis points to the poet whose name sounds most like the Russian rendering of \"Lueger\". The Russian \"Луиджер\" (Luijer) has a distinct \"дж\" [dzh] sound.\n\nThis sound strongly corresponds to the \"dg\" in the surname of the English poet Samuel **Rogers**. The syllables \"dger\" in \"Lueger\" (as imagined by Brodsky's Russian observer) and \"Rogers\" are phonetically very close.\n\n<<<Rogers>>>"
