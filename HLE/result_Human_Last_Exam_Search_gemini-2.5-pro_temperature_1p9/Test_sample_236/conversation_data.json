    "The number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is six.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how these elements are obtained:\n\nThe knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot. To obtain an integral homology 3-sphere from Dehn surgery on a knot, the surgery coefficient must be +1 or -1.\n\n1.  **The Unknot (0 crossings):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot result in the 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere represents the identity or **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group. This accounts for one element.\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot (3 crossings):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it exists in two non-equivalent mirror-image forms: the right-handed and left-handed trefoil.\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:**\n        *   +1 surgery yields the Poincaré homology sphere (also known as the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,5)). This manifold represents a **non-trivial element** of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n        *   -1 surgery produces the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7). This represents another **distinct non-trivial element**, also of infinite order.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:**\n        *   Performing surgery on the left-handed trefoil produces the mirror images of the manifolds obtained from the right-handed trefoil. In the homology cobordism group, the class of a mirror manifold is the inverse of the original manifold's class.\n        *   +1 surgery yields the mirror Poincaré sphere, -Σ(2,3,5). Since the Poincaré sphere's class has infinite order, this is a **new, distinct element**.\n        *   -1 surgery yields -Σ(2,3,7). This is also a **distinct element** from the others.\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot (4 crossings):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image.\n    *   Both +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot yield homology spheres that are mirror images of each other. Due to the knot's amphichirality, these two manifolds represent the **same element** in the homology cobordism group. This element is known to be non-trivial and has order 2. It is distinct from the elements generated by the trefoil knot surgeries and the trivial element.\n\nIn total, we have found:\n*   One element from the unknot (the trivial element).\n*   Four distinct, non-trivial elements from the two trefoil knots.\n*   One additional, distinct, non-trivial element from the figure-eight knot.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 distinct elements.\n\n<<<6>>>"
