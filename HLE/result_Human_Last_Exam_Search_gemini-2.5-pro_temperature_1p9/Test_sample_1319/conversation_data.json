    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in the epic poem, serving as settings for divine intervention and as geographical landmarks. While Mount Olympus stands as the preeminent home of the gods, other notable peaks are mentioned. A comparison of their heights reveals Mount Parnassus to be the tallest among them.\n\nThe elevations of the key mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* are as follows:\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** This mountain in central Greece reaches an elevation of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet). In mythology, it was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** The highest peak on the island of Crete, it stands at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (Anatolia/Turkey):** Also known as Kaz Dağı, this mountain near the site of ancient Troy has an elevation of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). It is from this mountain that the gods are said to have watched the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** Located in central Greece, its highest summit is 1,726 meters (5,663 feet). In mythology, it was the stronghold of the Titans.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Situated in southeastern Thessaly, its highest point is 1,651 meters (5,417 feet). It was known as the home of the Centaurs.\n\nBased on these elevations, Mount Parnassus is the tallest of these historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, apart from Mount Olympus itself which is the highest in Greece at 2,917 meters.\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
