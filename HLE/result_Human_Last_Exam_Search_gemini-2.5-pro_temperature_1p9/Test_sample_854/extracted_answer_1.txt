The laboratory made a critical error in believing Batch 3 of the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was safe to use due to a fundamentally flawed Quality Control (QC) process combined with an incorrect media preparation method. The misleading evidence was the result of their own QC check, which they misinterpreted as a success.

Here are the specific mistakes that led to this error:

1.  **Incorrect Preparation of Batch 3:** Person B prepared Batch 3 by adding the antibiotic chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving it at 121°C for 25 minutes. Chloramphenicol is known to be heat-labile and degrades at high temperatures. Autoclaving destroyed the antibiotic, rendering the PDA non-selective and allowing bacteria to grow freely. The standard and correct procedure is to autoclave the agar medium first, cool it to a safe temperature (around 50-60°C), and then aseptically add the filter-sterilized antibiotic. Batches 1 and 2, which did not show bacterial growth, were likely prepared using this correct method.

2.  **Flawed Quality Control Protocol:** The laboratory's quality check was destined to mislead them. They used *Bacillus subtilis*, a bacterium, to test a medium (PDA with chloramphenicol) that is specifically designed to *inhibit* bacterial growth.

3.  **Misinterpretation of QC Results:** The statement that "The control plates gave the expected results" reveals the core of the laboratory's mistake. For a properly prepared batch of selective media, the "expected result" of inoculating it with a susceptible bacterium like *Bacillus subtilis* should be **no growth**. However, the laboratory likely had the opposite expectation; they probably thought growth indicated the media was nutritious and "good," not realizing their test was proving the *failure* of the antibiotic. When the *Bacillus subtilis* grew on the plate from Batch 3 (because the chloramphenicol was inactive), they mistakenly believed the batch was of good quality and safe to use.

The subsequent appearance of "medium-sized gram-positive rods with spores" in the final experiment is consistent with contamination by a *Bacillus* species, which can survive as spores in the environment and would have easily entered the bottles left open to the air for six hours. This contamination was only able to flourish in Batch 3 because it lacked the active antibacterial agent that was still present in Batches 1 and 2.
