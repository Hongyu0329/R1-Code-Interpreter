In scalar field theoretical frameworks, for spatial dimensionalities *d* below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, quantitatively scales with *d* to the first order in ε = 4 - *d* according to the formula:

**α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n+8))] * (4 - *d*)**

Here, *n* represents the number of components of the order parameter in the O(n) symmetric model. This linear relationship shows that α is directly proportional to the deviation of the dimensionality from four.
