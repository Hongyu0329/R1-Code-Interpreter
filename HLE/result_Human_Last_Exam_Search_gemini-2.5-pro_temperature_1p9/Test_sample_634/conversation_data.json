    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] and P2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1],\nwe can use a method based on row-reducing a compound matrix.\n\nFirst, we form the compound matrix M by stacking P1 and P2 vertically:\nM =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n[s,        0]\n[-s - 1,   1]\n\nThe goal of this process is to perform elementary row operations on M, which are equivalent to left-multiplying M by unimodular matrices, in order to transform it into a simpler form [G; 0], where G is the GCRD. The row space of G will be the same as the row space of M.\n\nLet the rows of M be R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n1.  **Simplify using R3 and R4:**\n    *   Replace R1 with R1 - s*R3:\n        ( [s^2 + s, -s] ) - s * ( [s, 0] ) = ( [s, -s] )\n    *   Replace R2 with R2 + s*R3:\n        ( [-s^2 - 1, s^2] ) + s * ( [s, 0] ) = ( [-1, s^2] )\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M' =\n    [s,      -s]\n    [-1,     s^2]\n    [s,       0]\n    [-s - 1,  1]\n\n2.  **Continue simplifying:** Let the new rows be R'1, R'2, R'3, R'4.\n    *   Replace R'3 with R'3 - R'1:\n        ( [s, 0] ) - ( [s, -s] ) = ( [0, s] )\n    *   Replace R'4 with R'4 + R'1:\n        ( [-s-1, 1] ) + ( [s, -s] ) = ( [-1, 1-s] )\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M'' =\n    [s,      -s]\n    [-1,     s^2]\n    [0,       s]\n    [-1,     1-s]\n\n3.  **Further row operations:** Let the new rows be R''1, R''2, R''3, R''4.\n    *   Replace R''1 with R''1 + R''3:\n        ( [s, -s] ) + ( [0, s] ) = ( [s, 0] )\n    *   Replace R''2 with R''2 - R''4:\n        ( [-1, s^2] ) - ( [-1, 1-s] ) = ( [0, s^2 - (1-s)] ) = ( [0, s^2 + s - 1] )\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M''' =\n    [s,       0]\n    [0,  s^2+s-1]\n    [0,       s]\n    [-1,    1-s]\n\n4.  **Final reduction steps:**\n    *   Swap rows to bring constant terms to pivot positions. Let's use the row [-1, 1-s].\n    *   Add s times R''4 to R''1:\n        ( [s, 0] ) + s * ( [-1, 1-s] ) = ( [0, s-s^2] )\n    *   We now have the set of rows (not in order): {[0, s-s^2], [0, s^2+s-1], [0, s], [-1, 1-s]}.\n    *   The row space can be further simplified. Notice that [0, s^2+s-1] can be reduced by [0,s]:\n        ( [0, s^2+s-1] ) - s * ( [0,s] ) = ( [0, s-1] )\n    *   Now our generating set of rows includes {[0, s], [0, s-1], [-1, 1-s]}.\n    *   We can use [0, s] and [0, s-1] to get a constant:\n        ( [0, s] ) - ( [0, s-1] ) = ( )\n    *   With the row, we can eliminate the polynomial parts of the second column in all other basis vectors. For example:\n        [-1, 1-s] - (1-s) * = [-1, 0]\n    *   So, the row space is generated by {, [-1, 0]}. This can be written in matrix form as:\n        [ -1, 0 ]\n        [  0, 1 ]\n    *   Multiplying the first row by -1 (which is a unimodular operation) gives:\n        [ 1, 0 ]\n        [ 0, 1 ]\n\nThis final matrix is the identity matrix, I. Since the identity matrix is unimodular (its determinant is 1, a non-zero constant), the original matrices P1 and P2 are right co-prime. The greatest common right divisor is any unimodular 2x2 matrix. By convention, the simplest form is chosen.\n\n<<<\n[,]\n>>>"
