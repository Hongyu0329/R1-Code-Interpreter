    "After a gene duplication event, the resulting two gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that there isn't immediate selective pressure to maintain both copies, and one copy is often lost through deleterious mutations, a process known as pseudogenization, or by being deleted from the genome entirely. In fact, pseudogenization is the most common fate for duplicated genes.\n\nHowever, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and subsequent divergence of these duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes. These include neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** occurs when one copy of the gene retains its original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This process is a significant source of evolutionary novelty.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** describes a scenario where the ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions), and the two duplicate copies specialize to perform distinct subsets of these original functions. According to the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, each copy might accumulate degenerative mutations that knock out different subfunctions. As a result, both genes become essential to carry out the complete set of functions of the ancestral gene, ensuring their mutual retention.\n\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the evolution of new gene functions, subfunctionalization is often considered a more probable mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes. This is because it can occur through the accumulation of common, neutral, or slightly deleterious mutations that partition existing functions, whereas neofunctionalization requires the rarer occurrence of a beneficial mutation to create a novel function. Some evolutionary models suggest that subfunctionalization can act as an intermediate step, preserving the duplicated gene from being lost and thereby providing an opportunity for neofunctionalization to occur over a longer evolutionary timescale.\n\nOther options presented are less likely to be the primary mechanism for both retention and divergence:\n\n*   **Gene conversion** is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange that tends to homogenize the sequences of duplicated genes, working against their divergence.\n*   **Pseudogenization** results in the loss of function of one copy, which is a form of retention of DNA but not the retention of two functional, diverging genes.\n*   **Adaptive radiation** is a large-scale evolutionary process where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material for such radiations, it is not a direct mechanism for retaining individual duplicate genes.\n\nConsidering the alternatives, subfunctionalization provides a highly plausible and common route for both preserving duplicated genes from elimination and initiating their functional divergence.\n\n<<<D>>>"
