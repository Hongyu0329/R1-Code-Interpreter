    "When two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger topological system. The Chern number, being a topological invariant, is an additive quantity in such cases. This means that the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\nTherefore, for a junction of two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, the total Chern number of the system is:\n\nC_total = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nIt is important to distinguish the Chern number of the overall system from the number of chiral edge states at the interface between the two materials. The number of conducting edge states at the boundary between two topological domains is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers. In this specific case, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0, meaning there are no new conducting channels at the junction itself. However, the combined system, now characterized by a Chern number of 2, will exhibit two chiral edge states on its outer boundaries.\n\n<<<2>>>"
