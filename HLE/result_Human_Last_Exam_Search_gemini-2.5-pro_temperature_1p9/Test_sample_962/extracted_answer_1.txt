A comprehensive design for a tightly secure, two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme would likely be based on the FROST protocol for its two-round structure, leveraging a Schnorr-like signature scheme. The design must include a secure distributed key generation phase to create and distribute the secret shares without a central point of failure. The two-round signing protocol would consist of a commitment round and a signature share generation and aggregation round, managed by a coordinator. To achieve tight security, the scheme would need a rigorous security proof demonstrating a close relationship between its security and a hard underlying mathematical problem, a challenging but crucial aspect for ensuring high confidence in its robustness.
