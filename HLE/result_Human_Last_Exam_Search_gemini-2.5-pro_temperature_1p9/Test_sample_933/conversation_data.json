    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. This synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a sealed nickel vessel. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride, which prevents corrosion from the highly reactive fluorine gas.\n\nMultiple scientific sources and patents state that the optimal temperature for this reaction is approximately 400°C. This process is conducted at elevated pressures, typically around 6 atmospheres. Under these conditions, the reaction proceeds efficiently, with some methods reporting essentially quantitative yields of XeF₄.\n\nWhile other synthesis methods exist, they are generally less efficient or produce a mixture of xenon fluorides. For instance, flow methods are described with a temperature range of 300-500°C, but these can result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF₂). Synthesis using an electric discharge can be performed at lower temperatures, such as between -80°C and 0°C, but this also tends to produce impure products. The most reliable and efficient synthesis occurs at a higher temperature. A patent for the process specifies a temperature range between 350 and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature.\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, 400°C represents the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently by the most common method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
