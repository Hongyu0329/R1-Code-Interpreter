    "### Product of Favorskii Rearrangement Identified, but Böttcher Molecular Complexity Value Undetermined\n\nThe product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone when treated with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. This organic reaction is characterized by the conversion of an α-halo ketone to a carboxylic acid derivative, often involving a ring contraction, as is the case here with the transformation of a six-membered cyclohexanone ring into a five-membered cyclopentane ring.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity is a metric derived from information theory that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on the information content of the chemical microenvironments of its individual atoms. This index is sensitive to various structural features, including stereochemistry, heteroatoms, and molecular symmetry. The calculation can be performed using specialized software or web tools, such as the Böttcher Score calculator provided by the Forli Lab.\n\nDespite a thorough search of available resources, a pre-calculated Böttcher Molecular Complexity score for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate could not be found.\n\nHowever, the PubChem database provides a \"Complexity\" value of 114 for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (CID 79550). This value is computed using the Cactvs 3.4.8.18 software. It is important to note that this is a distinct metric and should not be confused with the Böttcher Molecular Complexity index, as the underlying calculation methods differ.\n\nIn summary, while the product of the specified Favorskii rearrangement is well-established as ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, its Böttcher Molecular Complexity value is not publicly available in the searched literature. A distinct complexity score of 114 is provided by PubChem based on the Cactvs computational method.\n\n<<<The Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is not found in the available search results.>>>"
