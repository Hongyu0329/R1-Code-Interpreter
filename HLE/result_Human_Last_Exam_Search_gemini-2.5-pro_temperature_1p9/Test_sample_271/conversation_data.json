    "To find the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L / \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$, we first need to determine the Galois group of the splitting field $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted by $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ contained in $K$ correspond to normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n\n**1. Analyze the polynomial and its Galois group**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to find factors by rearranging terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nSo the polynomial $f(x)$ is a product of two polynomials: $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nLet $K_1$ be the splitting field of $f_1(x)$ and $K_2$ be the splitting field of $f_2(x)$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of $K_1$ and $K_2$, i.e., $K = K_1K_2$.\n\n*   **Galois group of $f_1(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Galois group of $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    First, we check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    - 3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3.\n    - 3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    - $3^2 = 9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n    Thus, $f_2(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    To determine the Galois group, we check the number of real roots. The derivative is $f_2'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $f_2'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt{9/5}$.\n    - $f_2(\\sqrt{9/5}) = (\\sqrt{9/5})^5 - 9(\\sqrt{9/5}) + 3 = (9/5)\\sqrt{9/5} - 9\\sqrt{9/5} + 3 = 3 - \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5}$. Since $(\\frac{36}{5})^4 > 3^4$, this value is negative.\n    - $f_2(-\\sqrt{9/5}) = 3 + \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt{9/5}$, which is positive.\n    A local maximum above the x-axis and a local minimum below the x-axis for a polynomial of degree 5 imply there are exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots. An irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly three real roots has the symmetric group $S_5$ as its Galois group. Thus, $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$.\n\n*   **The Galois group of K:**\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $K=K_1K_2$, the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The group $G$ is equal to the direct product if the intersection of the fields is trivial, i.e., $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    The only quadratic subfield of $K_2$ (the splitting field of a quintic with Galois group $S_5$) is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the polynomial $f_2(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. The discriminant of a polynomial of the form $x^5+px+q$ is $256p^5+3125q^4$. Here $p=-9$ and $q=3$.\n    $D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\n    The quadratic subfield of $K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is not equal to $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus, the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This means the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$. The order of this group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**2. Normal subgroups and field extension degrees**\n\nThe normal subfields $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to the proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $A \\times B$ are not always of the form $N_A \\times N_B$. A complete analysis reveals the following proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$:\n1.  $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ (where $\\{e\\}$ is the trivial subgroup of $S_5$). $|H_1| = 2$.\n2.  $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$ (where $A_5$ is the alternating group, the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $S_5$). $|H_2| = |A_5| = 60$.\n3.  $H_3 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_3| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$.\n4.  $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_4| = |S_5| = 120$.\n5.  $H_5$, a \"diagonal\" subgroup defined by the sign homomorphism on $S_5$. Let the generator of $C_2$ be $c$. Then $H_5 = \\{(e, \\pi) \\mid \\pi \\in A_5\\} \\cup \\{(c, \\pi) \\mid \\pi \\notin A_5\\}$. $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n\n**3. Calculate the degrees**\n\nNow we compute the indices for these normal subgroups to find the possible degrees of the normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$:\n1.  For $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_1| = 240/2 = 120$.\n2.  For $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_2| = 240/60 = 4$.\n3.  For $H_3 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_3| = 240/120 = 2$.\n4.  For $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_4| = 240/120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5 = N_{diag}$: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H_5| = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThe distinct possible degrees for these normal subfields are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe list of all possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ is 2, 4, 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
