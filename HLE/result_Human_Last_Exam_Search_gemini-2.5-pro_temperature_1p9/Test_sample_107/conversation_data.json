    "The task is to find the smallest single IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches two specific networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. An ACL entry is defined by a network address and a corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nFirst, let's determine the IP address range for each network. A `/19` subnet mask corresponds to `255.255.224.0`, which provides a block of 8,192 addresses (`32 - 19 = 13` host bits, so 2^13 addresses).\n\n1.  **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n2.  **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n    *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two network ranges are contiguous, meaning one ends right where the next one begins. To cover both with a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary route (supernet) that encompasses the entire range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nLet's analyze the third octet in binary to find the summary:\n*   Starting address's third octet: `96` is `01100000`\n*   Ending address's third octet: `159` is `10011111`\n\nThe total number of addresses in this combined range spans 64 values in the third octet (from 96 to 159, inclusive), and each of those has 256 addresses in the fourth octet. This gives a total of `64 * 256 = 16,384` addresses. A block of 16,384 addresses corresponds to a `/18` network (since 2^14 = 16,384, and `32 - 14 = 18`).\n\nA `/18` network has a subnet mask of `255.255.192.0`. The corresponding wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   Wildcard Mask = `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.192.0` = `0.0.63.255`\n\nThe network address for the ACL should be the starting address of the combined block. Therefore, the smallest appropriate single ACL entry is composed of the starting network address and the calculated wildcard mask.\n\n**Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n**Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.63.255`\n\nThis gives the final ACL entry.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
