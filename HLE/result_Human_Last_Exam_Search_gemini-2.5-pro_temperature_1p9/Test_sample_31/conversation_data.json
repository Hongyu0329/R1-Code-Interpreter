    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a minimum of **five** non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nThis is based on the concept of 2-side PLL recognition, where a solver identifies the case by looking at the stickers on two adjacent faces of the last layer. These two faces show a total of six stickers on the last layer, excluding the top-facing ones. However, not all six are necessary for unique identification.\n\nIt has been established that looking at just five specific stickers is sufficient to distinguish between all 21 possible PLL cases. One example of a set of five stickers that can be used for recognition includes those on the front and right faces of the upper layer: the sticker on the front-left corner piece (UFL), the front edge piece (UF), the front-right corner piece (UFR), the right edge piece (UR), and the back-right corner piece (UBR).\n\nWhile it is possible to recognize every PLL case by observing the six stickers on two adjacent sides, one of those stickers is redundant. Therefore, with careful observation of a specific set of five stickers, a solver can have enough information to execute the correct PLL algorithm without needing to look at any other part of the cube.\n\n<<<5>>>"
