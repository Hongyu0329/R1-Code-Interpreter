    "Of the classical ballet steps provided, assemblé is the one where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\nAn assemblé begins in fifth position with the dancer in a plié. One leg brushes out to the side while the other pushes off the floor. The legs \"assemble\" or come together in the air and land simultaneously in the fifth position. While there are variations of assemblé, the fundamental step starts and concludes in the same fifth position.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the other options:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times, and the dancer lands in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front from where they started.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé involves the legs \"escaping\" from a closed position to an open one. The term \"changé\" specifically indicates that the feet have changed their position from the start upon closing.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This gliding step starts with the back leg and also ends with the same leg in the back, so it does maintain the same starting and ending position. However, the name \"assemblé\" itself means to assemble, highlighting the return to the initial position as a core component of the step.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that, while starting and ending in fifth position, often functions like an embellished *pas de chat*, which typically involves a change of which foot is in front.\n\nWhile a *glissade derrière* also finishes in the same position it starts, the most definitive answer among the choices, whose very name implies returning to the starting position, is the assemblé.\n\n<<<C>>>"
