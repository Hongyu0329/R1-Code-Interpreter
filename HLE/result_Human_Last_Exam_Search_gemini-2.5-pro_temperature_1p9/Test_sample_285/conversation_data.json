    "This problem asks for the largest value of $p$ for which the function $I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$. This is equivalent to finding the supremum of the set of $p$ such that the $L^p$-norm $\\|I\\|_p = \\left( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(a)|^p da \\right)^{1/p}$ is infinite.\n\nThe behavior of the integral for large values of the parameters $a = (a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ determines its integrability. The integral $I(a)$ is an oscillatory integral. Its decay rate as $\\|a\\| \\to \\infty$ depends on the structure of the stationary points of the phase function $\\phi(x,y; a)$. The slowest decay rate will determine the integrability threshold.\n\nThe phase is a cubic polynomial in $x$ and $y$:\n$\\phi(x,y;a) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$.\n\nThe decay rate of $I(a)$ is governed by the most degenerate critical point of the phase $\\phi(x,y;a)$ that can be created by varying the parameters $a_j$ within the integration domain $^2$. The slower the decay of $|I(a)|$ and the larger the dimension of the parameter subspace that produces this slow decay, the smaller the resulting $L^p$ space will be. The condition for the integral of $|I(a)|^p$ to diverge is typically of the form $p \\le d/\\sigma$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter subspace under consideration and $\\sigma$ is the decay exponent of the integral, i.e., $|I(a)| \\sim C \\|a\\|^{-\\sigma}$ for large $\\|a\\|$ in this subspace. We want to maximize $d/\\sigma$.\n\nLet's analyze the decay for different types of degeneracies. We can simplify by considering critical points at the origin $(0,0)$ and assuming the integration domain is a neighborhood of the origin. The specific domain $^2$ does not change the decay rate as long as the critical point is in its interior.\n\n**Case 1: Critical points with non-degenerate quadratic part (Fold catastrophe, $A_2$ singularity type)**\nIf the phase has a critical point where the Hessian is non-zero (non-degenerate), the decay is fast. To get slower decay, we need the Hessian to be degenerate. This happens, for example, if the phase depends only on one variable, creating a line of critical points. Let's assume the phase only depends on $x$, by setting the coefficients of terms containing $y$ to zero: $a_2 = a_4 = a_5 = a_7 = a_8 = a_9 = 0$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$I(a_1, 0, a_3, 0, 0, a_6, 0, 0, 0) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i (a_1 x + a_3 x^2 + a_6 x^3)} dy dx = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i (a_1 x + a_3 x^2 + a_6 x^3)} dx$.\nThis is a one-dimensional oscillatory integral. The phase is a cubic polynomial $P(x) = a_1 x + a_3 x^2 + a_6 x^3$. The asymptotic behavior for large parameters $a' = (a_1, a_3, a_6)$ is determined by the stationary points of $P(x)$, i.e., the roots of $P'(x) = a_1 + 2a_3 x + 3a_6 x^2 = 0$.\nFor a generic choice of $(a_1, a_3, a_6)$, the quadratic equation $P'(x)=0$ has two distinct roots. If these roots are real and in $$, they are non-degenerate stationary points (since $P''(x) \\ne 0$). An integral with a non-degenerate stationary point decays like $\\|a'\\|^{-1/2}$. Here, the dimension of the parameter space is $d=3$ and the decay exponent is $\\sigma=1/2$. The condition for non-integrability is $p \\le d/\\sigma = 3/(1/2) = 6$.\nThe decay is slower when the stationary point is degenerate, i.e., when $P''(x)=0$ as well. This corresponds to the discriminant of the quadratic $P'(x)$ being zero: $(2a_3)^2 - 4(a_1)(3a_6) = 0$, or $a_3^2 = 3a_1a_6$. This defines a surface of co-dimension 1 in the 3D parameter space. On this surface, the decay is slower, with an exponent $\\sigma=1/3$. However, the integrability over the whole 3D space is governed by the generic decay exponent $\\sigma=1/2$.\n\n**Case 2: Isolated critical point with degenerate quadratic part ($D_4$ singularity type)**\nTo create a more degenerate isolated critical point, we can enforce that the phase begins with cubic terms. We choose parameters such that the constant, linear, and quadratic terms of the Taylor series of $\\phi$ around a point (say, the origin) vanish.\nThis can be achieved by setting $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=0$.\nThe integral is then:\n$I(0,0,0,0,0, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3)} dxdy$.\nLet $a''=(a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$ and let $a''=\\lambda b$ for a fixed vector $b$ and large $\\lambda$. The phase is $\\lambda \\phi_b(x,y)$, where $\\phi_b$ is a homogeneous cubic polynomial. By a change of variables $u = \\lambda^{1/3}x, v=\\lambda^{1/3}y$, we have $dxdy = \\lambda^{-2/3} du dv$.\n$I(\\lambda b) = \\lambda^{-2/3} \\int_{[0, \\lambda^{1/3}]^2} e^{2\\pi i \\phi_b(u,v)} dudv$.\nFor a generic cubic polynomial $\\phi_b$, the integral converges as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$. Thus, $|I(a'')| \\sim C\\|a''\\|^{-2/3}$.\nThe decay exponent is $\\sigma=2/3$. The dimension of this parameter subspace is $d=4$.\nWe test the integrability of $|I|^p$ over this 4D subspace. Using polar coordinates, the integral behaves like:\n$\\int_R^\\infty (r^{-2/3})^p r^{4-1} dr = \\int_R^\\infty r^{3-2p/3} dr$.\nThis integral diverges if the exponent is greater than or equal to -1:\n$3 - 2p/3 \\ge -1 \\implies 4 \\ge 2p/3 \\implies 12 \\ge 2p \\implies p \\le 6$.\n\nBoth scenarios, which represent the \"worst\" possible decay rates over parameter subspaces of maximal possible dimension, lead to the same condition $p \\le 6$. The set of $p$ for which $I(a)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is therefore $(-\\infty, 6]$. The largest value in this set is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
