    "While direct visual confirmation is elusive in available online resources, the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was likely **The Life of Emile Zola (1937)**.\n\nThe biographical film, which won the Oscar for Outstanding Production, is set almost entirely in Paris and chronicles the life of the renowned French author Ã‰mile Zola. The movie extensively portrays 19th-century Paris, a period during which the Luxor Obelisk was a prominent landmark in the Place de la Concorde. Given the film's detailed depiction of Parisian life and historical events such as the Dreyfus affair, it is highly probable that the obelisk was included in establishing shots of the city.\n\nAn examination of earlier Best Picture winners reveals no logical opportunity for the obelisk to have been shown. These films were primarily set in locations such as the American West (*Cimarron*, 1930/31), World War I battlefields (*Wings*, 1927/28; *All Quiet on the Western Front*, 1929/30), or other locales outside of Paris and Luxor. While *Wings* did feature a brief scene in a Parisian nightclub, there is no indication that it included broader scenic shots of the city.\n\nLater Best Picture winners that were set in Paris, such as *An American in Paris* (1951) and *Gigi* (1958), came well after *The Life of Emile Zola*. Furthermore, *An American in Paris* was largely filmed on Hollywood backlots, and while *Gigi* had on-location filming, there is no evidence of it featuring the Place de la Concorde.\n\nTherefore, based on chronological elimination and the strong contextual evidence of its Parisian setting and historical narrative, *The Life of Emile Zola* stands as the most probable first Best Picture winner to feature the iconic Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola (1937)>>>"
