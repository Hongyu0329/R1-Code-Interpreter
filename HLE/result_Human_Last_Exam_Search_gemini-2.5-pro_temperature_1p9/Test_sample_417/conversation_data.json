    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a detailed analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required.\n\nThe molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions. The key to determining the number of signals is the molecule's symmetry.\n\n1.  **Central Core Symmetry**: The central ring is 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexasubstituted benzene. The substitution pattern is symmetrical, with identical methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6, and identical, large chiral substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry, meaning that a 120Â° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the center of the ring results in an identical molecule. Because of this symmetry, the three large substituents are chemically equivalent, as are the three methyl groups on the central ring and the three methylene (`CH2`) linker groups.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Non-Equivalent Protons**: We only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons in one of the three identical \"arms\" of the molecule and add the signals from the central core. The term \"peak\" in this context refers to a distinct signal or resonance, not the individual lines of a multiplet.\n\n    *   **Central Mesitylene Core Protons**:\n        *   The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry and will produce a single signal. (**1 peak**)\n        *   There are no aromatic protons on the central ring.\n\n    *   **Methylene Linker (`-CH2-`) Protons**:\n        *   The three `CH2` groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n        *   However, each `CH2` group is bonded to a chiral substituent (the camphor-indazole moiety). This makes the two protons within each `CH2` group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are not chemically equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. Thus, they will give rise to two separate signals. (**2 peaks**)\n\n    *   **Protons of One Chiral Substituent (`(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`)**: This substituent is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. Its asymmetry means that nearly all of its protons are in unique chemical environments.\n        *   **Indazole Ring Proton**: There is one proton on the pyrazole portion of the indazole ring (at position C3). (**1 peak**)\n        *   **Camphor Framework Methyl Protons**: The structure has three methyl groups. The two methyls at position C8 are diastereotopic due to the molecule's overall chirality and are therefore non-equivalent. The methyl group at C7 is in a unique environment as well. This results in three distinct signals for the three methyl groups. (**3 peaks**)\n        *   **Camphor Framework Methine and Methylene Protons**: The rigid, bicyclic structure removes any free rotation that might make protons equivalent.\n            *   The bridgehead proton at C4 is unique. (**1 peak**)\n            *   The two protons on C5 are diastereotopic (endo and exo). (**2 peaks**)\n            *   The two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic. (**2 peaks**)\n\n3.  **Total Count**: Summing the peaks from all distinct proton environments:\n    *   From the central methyl groups: 1\n    *   From the linker CH2 groups: 2\n    *   From the substituent's indazole ring: 1\n    *   From the substituent's camphor framework protons (H4, H5, H6): 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n    *   From the substituent's methyl groups: 3\n    *   **Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 = 12 peaks**\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 distinct peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
