    "The dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the **European Tango**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **European Tango Technique:** The European Tango is characterized by its sharp, staccato movements and a lack of the continuous, flowing rotation seen in dances like the Waltz or Foxtrot. The technique emphasizes precise foot placements and controlled, punctuated actions. The lead and follow are sharp and clear, often described as a \"dialogue of the feet\".\n\n*   **The Reverse Turn in Tango:** The Reverse Turn in Tango is a specific figure with a defined amount of turn. Overturning the man's body on the second step of an Open Reverse Turn would lead into a different figure entirely, known as a Fallaway. This demonstrates that a simple \"overturn\" is not a variation of the Reverse Turn but a technical deviation that changes the figure.\n\n*   **Contrast with other dances:**\n    *   In the **Viennese Waltz**, while difficult, a reverse turn can be overturned to curve and navigate the dance floor, even though under-turning a natural turn is more common for corners.\n    *   In the **English Waltz**, **Slow Foxtrot**, and **Quickstep**, while standard figures have prescribed amounts of turn, overturned versions of figures like the \"Overturned Spin Turn\" are recognized and danced at higher levels, indicating that overturning is a valid, albeit advanced, technical variation.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental technique of the European Tango, with its non-continuous and staccato nature, makes it impossible to simply overturn a standard Reverse Turn without fundamentally altering the figure and thus disregarding its core technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
