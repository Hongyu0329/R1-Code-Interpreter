    "While other theologians have discussed miracles and the laws of nature, **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD) was the first Christian theologian to develop specialized terminology that describes changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\n\nIn a Christmas sermon, Augustine explicitly stated, \"My brethren, what miracles! What prodigies! The laws of nature are changed in the case of man. God is born. A virgin becomes pregnant with man\". This demonstrates his view that the Incarnation involved a direct alteration of the natural order.\n\nFurthermore, Augustine's doctrine of the Fall of Man details a fundamental shift in the state of nature. He contended that as a result of Adam's sin, human nature became corrupted, leading to the introduction of disease, death, and a disharmonious relationship between humanity and the natural world. This corruption, inherited by all of humanity through what he termed \"original sin,\" implies a change in the very fabric of natural laws as they were originally established by God. According to Augustine, humanity was \"seminally present\" in Adam, and thus the consequences of the Fall, including changes in nature, were passed down to all subsequent generations.\n\nAugustine also put forward the concept of \"seminal reasons\" (rationes seminales), the idea that God embedded the potential for all things, including future miracles, into creation from the very beginning. This framework allowed for unique events like the virgin birth to occur not as a violation of nature, but as the unfolding of a potentiality hidden within God's original design, a concept that can also be applied to the changes in nature following the Fall.\n\nWhile the term \"fiat,\" a divine command that brings about a change in reality, is used in theological discourse concerning creation and Mary's assent to God's will (Mary's Fiat), it is Augustine who most directly and comprehensively developed a vocabulary to describe alterations in the laws of nature in the contexts of both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
