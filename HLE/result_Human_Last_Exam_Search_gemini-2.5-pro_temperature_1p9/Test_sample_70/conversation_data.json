    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. The concept of \"maximal rank\" implies that we assign distinct numerical values to each color in a flag's design to maximize the number of linearly independent rows or columns in its matrix representation.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, known as the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. When represented as a matrix, the rows of the flag will fall into two categories:\n1.  Rows that are entirely within the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will be monochromatic (all white).\n2.  Rows that are above or below the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows will have a pattern of red and white (e.g., red, red, white, red, red).\n\nSince all rows in the first category are identical to each other, and all rows in the second category are also identical to each other, there are only two unique row patterns. Assuming the values for red and white are chosen to be distinct (to achieve maximal rank), these two row patterns are linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\nThe task is now to identify which African flags also have a maximal rank of 2. A flag's design will result in a rank of 2 if it is composed of exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns. This is typically true for flags with simple geometric designs, such as bicolors or specific tricolors. After analyzing the flags of all 54 sovereign nations in Africa, the following have a maximal rank of 2:\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin features a vertical green band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. When viewed as a matrix, it has two distinct row patterns: one corresponding to the top half ([green, ..., green, yellow, ..., yellow]) and another for the bottom half ([green, ..., green, red, ..., red]). These two patterns are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a design structurally identical to that of Benin, with a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands of red and green. Consequently, it also has two unique and linearly independent row patterns, giving it a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The flag of Nigeria is a vertical tricolor with green, white, and green stripes. Because the two outer stripes are the same color, its matrix representation has only two distinct column patterns: an all-green column and an all-white column. These two patterns are linearly independent, which means the rank of the flag is 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
