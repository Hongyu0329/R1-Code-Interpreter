The final state of the system is probabilistic. After applying gate Q to the first ququint (A) of the entangled pair and measuring it, the system collapses to one of five possible product states. For instance, with a probability of 3/10, the measurement of ququint A will yield the state \(|2\rangle_A\), and the total system's state will become \(|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)\). With a probability of 1/10, ququint A is measured as \(|4\rangle_A\), and the system's state becomes \(|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B\). The other three possible outcomes also result in specific, different final states with their associated probabilities as detailed above.
