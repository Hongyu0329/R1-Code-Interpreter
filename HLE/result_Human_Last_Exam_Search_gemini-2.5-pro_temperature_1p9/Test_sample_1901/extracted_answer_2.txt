The proposed design is fundamentally flawed and will not produce the desired material. The core assumption that a single-benzene-ring molecule can be a room-temperature nematic liquid crystal is incorrect, as it misinterprets the structure of the reference compound 5CB and underestimates the molecular anisotropy required for mesophase formation.
