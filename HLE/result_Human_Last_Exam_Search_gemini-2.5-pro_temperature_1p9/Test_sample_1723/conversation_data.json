    "Contrary to the premise of the question, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration of their cap or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nNotable examples of blue-colored mushrooms include:\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: Known as the blue pinkgill, this New Zealand native is a vibrant blue color but has a pink spore print.\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: The indigo milk cap is another blue mushroom, but it produces a yellowish-cream spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea***: Commonly called the blue roundhead, this mushroom has a purple-black spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus***: This elegant blue webcap has a reddish-brown spore print.\n\nSome mushrooms can also bruise blue, but this is a chemical reaction and is not related to their spore color. For instance, many species in the ***Psilocybe*** and ***Panaeolus*** genera bruise blue but have dark purple to black spore prints.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
