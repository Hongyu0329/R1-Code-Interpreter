    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic, the *Aeneid*, the three longest are the Aras (also known by its classical name, Araxes), the Tiber, and the Alpheus. These rivers exist in the real world and are notable for their considerable lengths.\n\nThe longest among them is the **Aras River**, referred to in the *Aeneid* as the Araxes. This major river of the Caucasus region has a remarkable length of approximately 1,072 kilometers (about 666 miles). Virgil mentions it in Book VIII, alluding to its power and the Roman effort to bridge it, symbolizing its conquest.\n\nThe second longest is the **Tiber River**, central to the geography of the *Aeneid* and the founding of Rome. The Tiber flows for about 406 kilometers (approximately 252 miles) through Italy. In the epic, the river god Tiberinus appears to Aeneas in a dream, confirming his destiny in Italy.\n\nThe third longest is the **Alpheus River** located in the Peloponnese peninsula of Greece, with a length of about 110 to 112 kilometers (around 70 miles). Virgil references the Alpheus in Book III, noting the mythological tale of the river flowing under the sea to mingle with the fountain of Arethusa in Sicily.\n\nOther rivers are mentioned in the *Aeneid*, such as the Gela in Sicily, but they are significantly shorter than these three. The epic also features mythological rivers of the underworld, including the Styx and Acheron, which do not have measurable physical lengths.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Aras (Araxes), the Tiber, and the Alpheus.>>>"
