    "The moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, denoted by $X$, is diffeomorphic to the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe first homology group of a topological space $X$ with integer coefficients, denoted $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is isomorphic to the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. For a connected Lie group $G$ and a discrete subgroup $\\Gamma$, the fundamental group of the quotient space $G/\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $\\Gamma$. Since $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a connected Lie group and $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete subgroup, the fundamental group of $X$ is $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, we have:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)_{\\text{ab}} \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})_{\\text{ab}}$\nwhere $G_{\\text{ab}} = G/[G, G]$ is the abelianization of the group $G$.\n\nThe group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices:\n$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\nA presentation for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of these generators is given by the relations $S^4 = I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$. An alternative presentation is $\\langle S, T \\mid S^4 = e, (TS)^3 = e, S^2 (TS) = (TS)S^2 \\rangle$.\n\nTo find the abelianization of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, we add the relation that the generators commute, i.e., $ST = TS$.\nUsing the presentation $\\langle S, T \\mid S^4 = I, (ST)^3 = S^2 \\rangle$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $S^4 = I$\n    \\item Since $S$ and $T$ commute, $(ST)^3 = S^3T^3 = S^2$\n\\end{enumerate}\nFrom the second relation, we can multiply by $S^{-2}$ on the left. As $S^4 = I$, the inverse of $S^2$ is $S^2$. So, $S^{-2} = S^2$.\n$S^2(S^3T^3) = S^2(S^2) \\implies S^5T^3 = S^4 = I$. Since $S^4=I$, we have $S^5=S$. Thus, $ST^3=I$, which implies $S = T^{-3}$.\n\nNow, substituting $S = T^{-3}$ into the first relation, $S^4=I$:\n$(T^{-3})^4 = T^{-12} = I$.\nThis implies that the group is generated by the element $T$ with the relation $T^{12}=I$. The abelianized group is therefore the cyclic group of order 12.\n\nThis result is confirmed by sources that directly compute the homology of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The first homology group of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with integer coefficients, $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$, is $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$>>>"
