    "To determine the coordinates of the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, a step-by-step calculation is performed. This algorithm is a foundational technique in computer graphics for drawing lines on a pixel grid.\n\nBresenham's algorithm efficiently determines which pixels to illuminate to approximate a straight line between two points, using only integer arithmetic. For the given line, the starting point is (1,1) and the ending point is (11,5). The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Initialize the decision parameter:** This parameter helps decide the next pixel to plot. The initial decision parameter is calculated as p = 2 * Δy - Δx.\n    *   p = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and plot the pixels:** Starting from (1,1), we iterate from x = 1 to x = 11. In each step, we determine whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated by the algorithm is:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 4)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the sixth one in this sequence.\n\nThe coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
