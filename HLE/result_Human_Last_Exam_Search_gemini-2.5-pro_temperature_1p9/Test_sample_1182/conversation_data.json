    "The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is a complex topic in arithmetic geometry, particularly when the reduction is over a prime like 2. The process involves finding a new model of the curve that has the simplest possible singularities after reduction. The number of double points (also called nodes) is a key feature of this stable model.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis for the given curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$:\n\n1.  **Genus of the Curve:** The equation is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5. The genus, a fundamental invariant of the curve, is calculated as $g = \\lfloor(\\text{degree of } f - 1)/2\\rfloor$. In this case, $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. So, this is a genus 2 curve.\n\n2.  **Bad Reduction:** The curve is defined over the rational numbers, and we are interested in its properties over the 2-adic numbers. A key indicator of the nature of the reduction is the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The 2-adic valuation (the power of 2 dividing the discriminant) is non-zero, which indicates that the curve has \"bad reduction\" at the prime 2. This means the reduced curve has singularities more complex than simple double points.\n\n3.  **Finding a Better Model:** To understand the stable reduction, one must perform transformations on the curve's equation. A standard technique is to change variables to find a \"better\" model of the curve. By applying specific transformations to the given equation, a new model can be derived whose reduction modulo 2 is a rational curve (a curve of genus 0) with two ordinary double points.\n\n4.  **Arithmetic Genus:** The stable reduction must preserve the arithmetic genus of the original curve, which is 2. The arithmetic genus of a reduced curve made of a single component is calculated based on its own genus and the number of its singularities. For a rational curve (genus 0) to have an arithmetic genus of 2, it must have two double points.\n\nBased on this analysis, the stable reduction of the given curve has a special fiber consisting of a single rational component with two double points.\n\nTherefore, the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
