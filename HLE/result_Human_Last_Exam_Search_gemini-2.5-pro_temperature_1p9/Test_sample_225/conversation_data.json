    "The problem asks for the number of self-intersection points of the parametric curve given by x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t). This type of curve is known as a Lissajous curve.\n\nA self-intersection occurs when two different values of the parameter *t*, let's say *t₁* and *t₂*, produce the same (x, y) point. The curve is defined over the interval [0, 2π) because the period of cos(9t) is 2π/9 and the period of sin(5t) is 2π/5, and the least common multiple of these periods is 2π.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, there are established formulas to determine the number of self-intersections. When 'a' and 'b' are both odd integers, as in this case with a = 9 and b = 5, the number of self-intersection points can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\n\nIn this specific case, with a = 9 and b = 5, both of which are odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is:\n\n(9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2 = (8)(4) / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16.\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>The problem asks for the number of self-intersection points of the parametric curve given by x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).
