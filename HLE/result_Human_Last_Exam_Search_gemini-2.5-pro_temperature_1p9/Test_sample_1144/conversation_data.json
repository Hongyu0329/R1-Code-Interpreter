    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will perform the following calculations:\n1.  Determine the uncertainty in the electron's momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n2.  Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n3.  Compute the ratio of these two values.\n\n**1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The common form of the principle is:\nΔx * Δp ≥ h / (4π)\n\nWhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n*   h is Planck's constant ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp):\nΔp ≈ h / (4π * Δx)\nΔp ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (4 * π * 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp ≈ 5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**2. Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)**\n\nAccording to Bohr's model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit is quantized:\nL = n * (h / 2π) = n * ħ\n\nWhere:\n*   n is the principal quantum number (for the first orbit, n=1).\n*   ħ is the reduced Planck constant ≈ 1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is L = ħ. The angular momentum is also given by L = p * r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n\n*   a₀ ≈ 5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nTherefore, the momentum (p) of the electron is:\np = L / a₀ = ħ / a₀\np ≈ (1.055 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.993 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**3. Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum**\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio ≈ (5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.993 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.646\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
