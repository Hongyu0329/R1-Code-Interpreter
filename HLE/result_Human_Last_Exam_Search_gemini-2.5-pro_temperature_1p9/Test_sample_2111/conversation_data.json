    "In his emphasis on a global historical perspective, Fernand Braudel referenced Paul Morand's assertion that **geography** is the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere, exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\n\nBraudel, in his work *Grammaire des civilisations* (A History of Civilizations), explores the foundational elements that shape civilizations. When discussing the political dimensions of a civilization, he turns to the insight of Paul Morand. While the exact phrase \"inscribed within a sphere\" is a metaphorical interpretation of the concept, the core idea is found in Morand's statement, which Braudel highlights: \"Toute grande politique est une géographie\" (\"All great politics is geography\").\n\nThis assertion posits that the geographical realities of a nation—its physical boundaries, its climate, its topography, and its spatial relationship to other regions—fundamentally contain and define the scope and nature of its political existence and possibilities. The \"sphere\" represents this bounded, geographical space in which a nation's history and political actions unfold. For Braudel, this aligns with his own analytical framework, which heavily emphasizes the role of space and the environment—what he termed \"geohistory\"—in shaping the long-term destinies of civilizations. He was interested in these \"cultural areas\" or *aires culturelles*, which are defined by shared geographical and cultural characteristics. Therefore, the entity in question, which dictates the 'sphere' of a nation, is its geography.\n\n<<<geography>>>"
