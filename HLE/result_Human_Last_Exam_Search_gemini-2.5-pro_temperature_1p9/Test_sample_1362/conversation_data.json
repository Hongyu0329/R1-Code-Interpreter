    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for primes `p > 2`, we first need to understand the conditions for a hyperelliptic curve `z^2 = f(x)` to have \"good reduction\" and then to be \"ordinary\" at such a prime.\n\n1.  **Good Reduction**: A curve has good reduction at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a smooth (non-singular) curve. For a hyperelliptic curve of the form `z^2 = f(x)` where the characteristic of the field is not 2, this is equivalent to the condition that the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. This, in turn, means that the polynomial `f(x)` when considered modulo `p` does not have any repeated roots.\n\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: A curve with good reduction at `p` is called \"ordinary\" if its Jacobian has the largest possible number of `p`-torsion points over the algebraic closure of `F_p`. An equivalent condition for an elliptic curve (genus 1) is that the trace `a_p` of the Frobenius endomorphism is not divisible by `p`. More generally, for a hyperelliptic curve, ordinarity is determined by the non-vanishing of its Hasse invariant or, relatedly, the rank of its Cartier-Manin matrix being maximal.\n\nA key piece of information comes from the theory of Complex Multiplication (CM). If the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve has complex multiplication by an order in a number field `K`, then it has good ordinary reduction at all primes `p` of good reduction that split completely in the field `K`.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n*   **A. `z^2 = x^5 + 3`**: The discriminant of `x^5 + 3` is `3125 * 3^4`, so the curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`. This is a generic curve, not known to have complex multiplication. While it is expected to have good ordinary reduction for many primes (in fact, for a set of primes of density 1), there is no simple arithmetic progression of such primes.\n\n*   **B. `z^2 = x^5 - 1`**: The polynomial `f(x) = x^5 - 1` has discriminant `3125 = 5^5`. The curve has bad reduction only at `p=5`. For all primes `p > 5`, it has good reduction. The Jacobian of this curve is known to have complex multiplication by the ring of integers `Z[ζ_5]` in the cyclotomic field `K = Q(ζ_5)`. A prime `p` splits completely in `Q(ζ_5)` if and only if `p ≡ 1 (mod 5)`. Therefore, for all primes `p ≡ 1 (mod 5)`, the curve `z^2 = x^5 - 1` has good ordinary reduction. Since there are infinitely many such primes (e.g., 11, 31, 41, etc.), this curve demonstrably has good ordinary reduction for primes greater than 2.\n\n*   **C. `z^2 = x^6 - 1`**: The discriminant of `x^6 - 1` is `-46656 = -2^6 * 3^6`. The curve has bad reduction at `p=3` (and `p=2`). For `p > 3`, it has good reduction. The Jacobian of this curve is isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves which themselves have complex multiplication, one by `Z[i]` and the other by `Z[ζ_3]`. Thus, its Jacobian has good ordinary reduction at primes `p` that are of good reduction for both elliptic curves and split in both `Q(i)` and `Q(ζ_3)`. This corresponds to primes `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` and `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)`, which means `p ≡ 1 (mod 12)`. So, this curve also has good ordinary reduction for an infinite set of primes above 2.\n\n*   **D. `z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`**: The discriminant is non-zero, and it is another generic curve without complex multiplication.\n\n*   **E. `z^2 = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x`**: This is also a generic-looking curve without complex multiplication.\n\nBoth curves B and C have the property of having good ordinary reduction for an infinite set of primes. However, curve B, `z^2 = x^5 - 1`, is a canonical example of a hyperelliptic curve whose Jacobian is a simple abelian variety (i.e., not a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties) with complex multiplication by a field. This makes the condition for ordinary reduction particularly clear. The Jacobians of curves like `y^2=x^n-1` are fundamental in the study of complex multiplication. Given the options, curve B provides the most direct and classic example of a curve for which the property of having good ordinary reduction can be easily established through the theory of complex multiplication.\n\n<<<B>>>"
