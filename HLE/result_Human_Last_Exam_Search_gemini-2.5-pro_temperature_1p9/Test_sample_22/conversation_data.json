    "The statement posits that the predictive ability of a polygenic score, as measured by the variance explained (R²), is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the same phenotype. The overwhelming consensus in the field of statistical genetics confirms this to be true under standard assumptions and ideal conditions.\n\nSNP heritability (h²<sub>snp</sub>) is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be attributed to the additive effects of all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It represents the theoretical maximum amount of variance that can be explained by a linear model using all common SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a tool designed to estimate an individual's genetic predisposition for a trait. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many genetic variants, with each variant's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size, typically derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The predictive ability of a PGS is most commonly assessed by its R², the proportion of variance in the phenotype that it can account for in an independent target sample.\n\nIn principle, because a polygenic score is constructed from the estimated effects of SNPs, its predictive power is capped by the total variance those SNPs collectively explain, which is the SNP heritability. In practice, the R² of a polygenic score is almost always substantially lower than the SNP heritability for several key reasons:\n\n*   **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** The SNP effect sizes used to build the score are estimated from GWAS samples of finite size. This leads to statistical error in the estimates, introducing noise that diminishes the score's predictive accuracy.\n*   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** The genetic architecture of populations differs. Variations in the correlation structure between SNPs (LD) between the GWAS population and the target population for the PGS can reduce its predictive power.\n*   **Incomplete Tagging of Causal Variants:** The SNPs included in a genotyping array or used to build a PGS may not be the causal variants themselves but are instead correlated with them. If this correlation (\"tagging\") is imperfect, the score will not capture the full genetic effect.\n*   **Population Differences:** The accuracy of a PGS is known to decline when applied to populations of different ancestries from the one in which the initial GWAS was conducted. This is due to differences in allele frequencies, LD patterns, and potentially gene-environment interactions.\n\nWhile SNP heritability is considered the theoretical upper bound, some research has highlighted specific scenarios where a PGS R² might appear to exceed the estimated SNP heritability. This can occur if the SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of very diverse cohorts, which can lead to an underestimation of the true heritability within a more homogenous target sample. However, this is considered an issue with the estimation of the upper bound itself, rather than a violation of the principle that the true SNP heritability of the target population is the limit.\n\nTherefore, based on the fundamental definitions and the practical limitations of constructing polygenic scores, the predictive variance they explain is inherently capped by the total variance attributable to the SNPs they are built from.\n\n<<<True>>>"
