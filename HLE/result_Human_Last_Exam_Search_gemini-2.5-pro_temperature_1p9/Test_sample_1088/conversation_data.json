    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom in question. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides a recipe for constructing the basis set, which can be broken down for different types of atoms.\n\nThe notation is interpreted as follows:\n*   **6-**: The core atomic orbitals are represented by a single contracted basis function, which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGs).\n*   **-311**: The valence atomic orbitals are described by three contracted basis functions. The first is a combination of **3** PGs, while the second and third are single PGs each. This is known as a triple-zeta valence representation.\n*   **G**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n*   __**__: The two asterisks indicate the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first asterisk adds a set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms.\n    *   The second asterisk adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this, the number of primitive Gaussians for each type of atom can be calculated:\n\n### For Heavy Atoms (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen)\n\n1.  **Core Orbitals (1s):** These are described by a contraction of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n2.  **Valence Orbitals (e.g., 2s and 2p):** In Pople basis sets, the same primitive functions are typically used for both s and p valence orbitals to improve efficiency. The \"311\" split means the valence shell is represented by functions composed of 3, 1, and 1 PGs. This results in a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians for the valence shell (s and p functions).\n3.  **Polarization Functions (`*`):** A single set of d-type polarization functions is added. In most computational chemistry software, this corresponds to 6 Cartesian d-functions (d<sub>xx</sub>, d<sub>yy</sub>, d<sub>zz</sub>, d<sub>xy</sub>, d<sub>xz</sub>, d<sub>yz</sub>), where each is a single primitive Gaussian. This adds **6** PGs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive Gaussians for a heavy atom is 6 (core) + 5 (valence) + 6 (polarization) = **17**.\n\n### For Hydrogen Atoms\n\n1.  **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n2.  **Valence Orbitals (1s):** The \"311\" split applies to the 1s orbital, so it is described by functions composed of 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitive Gaussians.\n3.  **Polarization Functions (`*` on H):** A single set of p-type polarization functions (p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub>) is added. Each of these is a single primitive Gaussian, adding **3** PGs.\n\nTherefore, the total number of primitive Gaussians for a hydrogen atom is 5 (valence) + 3 (polarization) = **8**.\n\n### Example Calculation: Methane (CH₄)\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you sum the totals for each atom:\n*   **Carbon:** 17 PGs\n*   **Hydrogen:** 8 PGs per atom\n*   **Total for CH₄:** 1 (Carbon) × 17 + 4 (Hydrogens) × 8 = 17 + 32 = **49 primitive Gaussians**.\n\n<<<The 6-311G** basis set contains **17** primitive Gaussian functions for each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom and **8** primitive Gaussian functions for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
