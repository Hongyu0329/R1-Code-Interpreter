    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the conventionally calculated vaccine efficacy, `1 - incidence rate ratio`, correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Action:** This type of vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest receive no protection at all. For instance, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would make 80% of vaccinated individuals perfectly immune and leave the other 20% just as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate:** The incidence rate measures how quickly new cases of a disease arise in a population.\n    *   In the unvaccinated group, let's call the incidence rate *I_u*.\n    *   In the vaccinated group, only the fraction of people who are not protected can get sick. If the vaccine protects a proportion *'p'* of individuals, then the proportion *(1-p)* remains susceptible. This susceptible subgroup will get sick at the same rate as the unvaccinated group, *I_u*. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group (*I_v*) is *(1-p) x I_u*.\n\n*   **Calculating Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** The standard formula for vaccine efficacy is based on the incidence rate ratio (IRR), which is *I_v / I_u*.\n    *   VE = 1 - IRR\n    *   VE = 1 - ( *I_v* / *I_u* )\n    *   Substituting our value for *I_v*: VE = 1 - ( [(1-p) x *I_u*] / *I_u* )\n    *   This simplifies to: VE = 1 - (1-p) = p.\n\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This term describes the reduction in risk for a single exposure to the pathogen. In an all-or-nothing model, an individual is either fully protected (100% per-exposure efficacy) or not protected at all (0% per-exposure efficacy). The average per-exposure efficacy across the entire vaccinated group is the proportion of people who are fully protected, which is *'p'*.\n\nSince both the `1 - incidence rate ratio` and the average `per-exposure vaccine efficacy` are equal to *'p'* in an all-or-nothing model, the first correctly estimates the second.\n\n<<<C>>>"
