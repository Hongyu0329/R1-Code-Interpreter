1. The relativity of simultaneity: Not True
2. Relativity of lengths: Not True
3. Relativity of time: Not True
4. Invariance of the speed of light: Not True
5. Non-Newtonian addition of speeds: Not True
6. Give the formulas for #2: There would be no length contraction in this model. The transformation would be a 4D rotation.
7. Give the formulas for #3: Δt' = Δt
8. Give the formulas for #5: w = u + v (for collinear motion)
