    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of the system.\n\nWhen expressed in the energy-momentum basis, which diagonalizes the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) for a fermionic system at zero temperature is given by:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))***\n\nHere:\n*   **k** represents the momentum of the single-particle state.\n*   **ω** is the frequency or energy variable.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state with momentum k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which sets the Fermi energy.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal quantity that ensures the correct causal behavior of the Green's function.\n*   **sgn** is the sign function, which is +1 for positive arguments and -1 for negative arguments.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function G₀ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is therefore an inverse relationship. Specifically, the poles of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane correspond to the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle states.\n\nIn the context of a fermionic path integral evaluated in imaginary time (Matsubara formalism), the bare Green's function takes a similar form:\n\n***G₀(k, iωₙ) = 1 / (iωₙ - (ϵ_k - μ))***\n\nIn this expression, **iωₙ** are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies, given by i(2n+1)π/β, where n is an integer and β is the inverse temperature. Again, the denominator directly contains the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nTherefore, the bare Green's function has a direct and crucial dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, being inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable (ω or iωₙ) and the eigenvalue ϵ_k."
