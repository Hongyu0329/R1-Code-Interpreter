    "A search for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle reveals that the best-known arrangement has a symmetry group of C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This is listed in a comprehensive table of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle.\n\nIn the context of circle packings, the symmetry group describes the set of rotations and reflections that leave the arrangement of the circles unchanged. The Schoenflies notation is a common system for labeling these point groups. A C₁ symmetry group indicates that the packing has no rotational or reflectional symmetry; it is asymmetric.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
