    "The value of the integral in question is found by first simplifying the integrand and then evaluating the resulting integral.\n\nThe integrand is the infinite sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. Using the property of logarithms that the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product, this can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThere is a well-known infinite product identity in trigonometry which states that for any real number $x \\neq 0$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\nThis identity can be proven using the half-angle formula for sine, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$, which gives $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2\\sin\\theta}$. Applying this repeatedly to a finite product yields a telescoping series that simplifies to $\\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)}$, and taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ gives $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n\nSubstituting this closed-form expression back into the integrand, the original integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe evaluation of this definite integral is a known result in mathematical analysis. While its derivation is non-trivial, often requiring methods from complex analysis or other advanced techniques, the value of the integral is established in mathematical literature.\n\nThe value of the integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n<<<-\\frac{\\pi}{2}>>>"
