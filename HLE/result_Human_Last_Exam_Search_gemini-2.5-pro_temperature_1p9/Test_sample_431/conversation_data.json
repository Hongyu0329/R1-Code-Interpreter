    "There are three Cysteine residues located in the TM3-TM4 linker domains of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 subunit is encoded by the *GABRR1* gene and its protein sequence is available in the UniProt database under the accession number P24046. The structure of this receptor subunit includes four transmembrane (TM) domains.\n\nBased on the annotation in UniProt, the transmembrane domains of the human GABAAρ1 subunit are located at the following amino acid positions:\n*   TM1: 254-274\n*   TM2: 283-306\n*   TM3: 326-348\n*   TM4: 454-474\n\nThe linker region between TM3 and TM4 spans from amino acid position 349 to 453. The amino acid sequence for this linker is:\n\n`FANMVYWHITNYLWLKGPPSSNGPVSRHPPAPHCGAPSPRRGPLSSSPCSSAQLCAHSLNARASRASGGRMLAREAGSRAHLAEAGSLRLLARALSGYPVSYIIKATVLYSVAWFWSWLLFGAPYLLSAARVALGITLVLLSLAVGFSTNRYRLQ`\n\nWithin this sequence, there are three cysteine (C) residues.\n\n<<<3>>>"
