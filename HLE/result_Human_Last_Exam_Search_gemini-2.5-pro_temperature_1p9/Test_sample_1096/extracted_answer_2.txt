The optimal choices for the step sizes $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ are the reciprocals of the roots of the shifted Chebyshev polynomial of degree 2. With the normalization $\mu=1$ and $M=\kappa$, these are given by:
$\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\frac{\kappa+1}{2} - \frac{\kappa-1}{2\sqrt{2}}}$
$\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\frac{\kappa+1}{2} + \frac{\kappa-1}{2\sqrt{2}}}$
The order of the step sizes is interchangeable.
