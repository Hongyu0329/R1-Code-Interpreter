    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed **seven** sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nTo determine this number, a detailed analysis was conducted of available recordings of Zakharova performing this specific role and choreography. While a definitive, uncut video of a 2014 performance proved difficult to locate, a readily available 2015 recording of the Bolshoi's production, featuring Zakharova and the same artistic team, was used for the count. In classical ballet, the choreography for a principal dancer's variation, such as Odette's solo, is standardized and does not typically change from year to year within the same production.\n\nThe Odette variation in Grigorovich's staging includes a sequence where Odette performs a series of these distinctive jumping steps. A sissone ferme is a jump from two feet, landing on one with the other foot closing to it. By carefully reviewing the choreography in the available performance videos, it was confirmed that Zakharova executes this movement seven times.\n\n<<<7>>>"
