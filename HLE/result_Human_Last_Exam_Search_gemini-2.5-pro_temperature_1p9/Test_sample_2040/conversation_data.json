    "### Propensity of Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) only if they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, a property that is highly dependent on the specific allotrope and external influences.** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, and a material's ability to facilitate it is contingent on having a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is intrinsically linked to the absence of inversion symmetry in its crystal lattice.\n\nThe two most common forms of boron nanosheets are borophene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). Whether they can exhibit SPDC is nuanced and varies between them.\n\n#### Borophene: A Promising Candidate\n\nCertain allotropes of borophene, such as the δ₆ phase, naturally possess a buckled, non-centrosymmetric structure. This inherent lack of inversion symmetry makes them strong candidates for exhibiting second-order nonlinear optical effects, including SPDC. Research has highlighted the non-centrosymmetric nature of few-layered borophene nanosheets, further supporting their potential for such applications. However, it is crucial to note that not all forms of borophene lack inversion symmetry. For instance, a theoretically proposed 3D monoclinic borophene crystal does possess inversion symmetry, and would therefore not exhibit SPDC. Thus, the specific atomic arrangement of the borophene allotrope is the determining factor.\n\n#### Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN): Inducing Non-Symmetry\n\nIn its pristine, free-standing monolayer form, hexagonal boron nitride is centrosymmetric, meaning it has a center of inversion symmetry. Consequently, it would not be expected to exhibit second-order nonlinear phenomena like SPDC.\n\nHowever, the inversion symmetry in h-BN can be broken through several methods, thereby inducing a second-order nonlinear response:\n\n*   **Layering:** In multilayer h-BN, flakes with an odd number of layers can exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), a related second-order effect, while those with an even number of layers do not. Studies have reported SHG in thick h-BN flakes, containing over 100 layers.\n*   **Strain and Defects:** The application of strain or the introduction of defects into the crystal lattice can disrupt the material's symmetry.\n*   **Heterostructures:** Forming a heterostructure by placing the h-BN nanosheet on a substrate or another 2D material, like graphene, can break the inversion symmetry.\n\nIn conclusion, while some free-standing borophene nanosheets are inherently non-centrosymmetric and thus prime candidates for exhibiting SPDC, pristine h-BN nanosheets require external manipulation to break their symmetry. Therefore, the potential for SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets is not universal and depends critically on the material's specific structural and environmental conditions."
