The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the formula:

$D = \frac{v_0 c}{g} \arctan\left(\sqrt{e^{\frac{2gh}{c^2}} - 1}\right)$

where:
*   $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity.
*   $h$ is the initial height of the cliff.
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $c$ is the speed of light.

The distance $D$ is independent of the mass $m$ of the particle.
