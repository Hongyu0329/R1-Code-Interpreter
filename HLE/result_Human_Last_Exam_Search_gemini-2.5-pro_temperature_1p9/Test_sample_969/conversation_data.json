    "The pattern in this sequence can be understood by breaking it down into parts.\n\n1.  The sequence begins with an initial, symmetrical flourish: `3 2 1 2 3`.\n2.  Following this, the pattern becomes a series of groups of repeating digits. The number of repetitions in each group is three. These groups are in descending numerical order.\n    *   The first group consists of three 3s: `3 3 3`.\n    *   The next group should consist of three 2s. The given sequence ends with `2 2`, which are the first two elements of this group.\n\nTo complete the next four elements of the sequence, we follow this established pattern:\n\n1.  First, we must complete the group of 2s by adding one more `2`. This makes the group `2 2 2`.\n2.  Next, we begin the following group, which will be three 1s: `1 1 1`.\n\nSo, the four elements that follow the given sequence are a `2` (to complete the group of twos) followed by `1, 1, 1`.\n\nThe next four elements are: **2 1 1 1**.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
