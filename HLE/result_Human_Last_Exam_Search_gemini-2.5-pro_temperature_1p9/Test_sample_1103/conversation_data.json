    "### A Definitive Count: 242 Negative Fundamental Discriminants Have Class Number 48\n\nIn the realm of number theory, the Gauss class number problem has long intrigued mathematicians, seeking to classify imaginary quadratic fields by their class number. For a class number of 48, it has been determined that there are precisely **242** negative fundamental discriminants.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in essence, asks for a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number. A fundamental discriminant is a key integer that defines a quadratic number field. For each negative fundamental discriminant, there is a corresponding imaginary quadratic field, and the class number is a crucial invariant of this field.\n\nThe determination of the number of fundamental discriminants for a specific class number is a computationally intensive task. This has been the subject of extensive research and calculation. A notable contribution in this area is the work of Mark Watkins, whose paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields\" provides a comprehensive table of the number of negative fundamental discriminants for class numbers up to 100. According to this work, the count of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 242.\n\nThis result is a significant piece of the larger puzzle of the Gauss class number problem, which has a rich history. While the problem for class number one was solved independently by Baker, Heegner, and Stark, determining the exact number of discriminants for higher class numbers has required sophisticated computational algorithms.\n\n<<<242>>>"
