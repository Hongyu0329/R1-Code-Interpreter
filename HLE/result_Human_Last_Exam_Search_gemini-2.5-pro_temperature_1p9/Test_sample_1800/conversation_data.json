    "The ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is highly dependent on the specific application—be it the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting—as well as the catalyst's morphology and the presence of other promoting elements.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, research indicates a range of optimal Ni concentrations rather than a single definitive ratio. The catalytic activity is influenced by factors such as nickel loading, the interaction between nickel and ceria, and the specific reaction conditions.\n\n-  Studies have shown that Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt% exhibit similarly high levels of CO conversion, suggesting a broad optimal window. At 400°C, CO conversion rates for catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni were nearly identical at 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively.\n-  In a study involving tungsten as a co-dopant, a catalyst with the composition Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ displayed the highest catalytic activity. This corresponds to a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 0.28.\n-  For the related reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar has been reported. Another study focusing on CO₂ splitting identified a 2% Ni loading on CeO₂ rods as the most effective.\n-  The addition of promoters can also influence the ideal composition. For instance, a catalyst composed of 4% (w/w) Ni and 3% (w/w) CeO₂ on an alumina support demonstrated high activity. Additives like samarium (Sm) and rhenium (Re) have also been shown to enhance WGS activity. For example, a 1% Re and 4% Ni on a ceria support doped with 5% samarium (1% Re 4% Ni/Ce-5% Sm-O) showed a maximum CO conversion of 97% at 350°C.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio can differ for the two half-reactions: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\n-   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** Research on Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts grown on nickel foam revealed that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (or a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5) delivered the best HER performance.\n\n-   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, studies on a series of NiᵧCe₁₀₀₋ᵧOₓ catalysts found that those with Ni/Ce molar ratios of 3 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ) exhibited the highest activities. These catalysts showed lower Tafel slopes and larger electrochemical surface areas, contributing to their enhanced performance. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst also demonstrated long-term stability for over 100 hours.\n\n-   **Overall Water Splitting:** When considering both HER and OER, a study on Ni and Fe co-doped CeO₂ found that a high level of 20 mol% doping (with a 1:1 Ni:Fe ratio) resulted in excellent overall water splitting activity. This equates to a 10 mol% Ni doping in the ceria nanostructure. Similarly, another electrocatalyst designed with a Ni:Fe:Ce molar ratio of 1:1:1 has been noted for its potential in water electrolysis.\n\nIn summary, there is no single ideal Ni/Ce ratio that universally maximizes performance for both the WGS reaction and water splitting. The optimal ratio is contingent upon the specific reaction, the presence of other dopants or supports, and the desired catalytic outcome (e.g., HER vs. OER). For the WGS reaction, a broader range of 5-12.5 wt% Ni appears effective, while for water splitting, specific ratios such as a Ni/Ce of 0.5 for HER and 1 to 3 for OER have shown promise.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but depends on the specific reaction and catalyst formulation. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a Ni loading of 5-12.5 wt% on ceria provides high activity. For water splitting, a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5 is optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, while ratios of 1 and 3 are favorable for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction.>>>"
