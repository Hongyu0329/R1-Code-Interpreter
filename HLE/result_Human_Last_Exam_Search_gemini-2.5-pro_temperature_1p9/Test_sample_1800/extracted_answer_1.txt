The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but depends on the specific reaction and catalyst formulation. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a Ni loading of 5-12.5 wt% on ceria provides high activity. For water splitting, a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.5 is optimal for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction, while ratios of 1 and 3 are favorable for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction.
