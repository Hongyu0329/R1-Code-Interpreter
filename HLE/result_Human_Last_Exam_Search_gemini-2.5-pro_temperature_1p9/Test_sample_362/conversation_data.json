    "The Wittig reaction is a versatile method in organic chemistry for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, which reacts with a carbonyl compound to form a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe specific reaction in question involves pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane.\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO. It features a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide with the structure Ph₃P=CHCH₂(o-ClC₆H₄). The reactive part of the ylide is the carbon atom that is double-bonded to the phosphorus.\n\n**Reaction Mechanism and Product Formation:**\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group is swapped with the carbon group of the ylide. This results in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nFor this specific reaction, the C=O group of pivalaldehyde is replaced by the =CHCH₂(o-ClC₆H₄) group from the ylide. This leads to the formation of a new alkene with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CHCH₂(o-ClC₆H₄).\n\nThe systematic name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism):**\nThe stereochemistry of the alkene product (whether it is the E or Z isomer) depends on the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups on the ylidic carbon) typically yield E-alkenes.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides** (with alkyl or hydrogen groups) usually favor the formation of Z-alkenes.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, Ph₃P=CHCH₂(o-ClC₆H₄), has an alkyl group (-CH₂C₆H₄Cl) attached to the ylidic carbon, classifying it as a non-stabilized ylide. Generally, this would suggest the Z-isomer as the major product. However, the steric bulk of the reactants plays a crucial role. Pivalaldehyde contains a very bulky tert-butyl group. The significant steric hindrance between this tert-butyl group and the rest of the molecule in the transition state leading to the Z-isomer makes its formation less favorable. The transition state leading to the E-isomer, where the two large groups are on opposite sides of the forming double bond, is sterically preferred.\n\nTherefore, despite the use of a non-stabilized ylide, the presence of the bulky pivalaldehyde will drive the reaction to form the more thermodynamically stable **(E)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene** as the major product.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene}$."
