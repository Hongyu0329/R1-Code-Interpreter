    "Answering this question requires a systematic enumeration of all possible valid boolean expressions of exactly five symbols and then evaluating each to determine if it is true. The allowed symbols are {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, with conventional operator precedence (! > & > |).\n\nWe can categorize the expressions by their structure:\n\n### 1. Expressions with Two Binary Operators\nThis category has the form `value operator value operator value`. With three values and two operators, the length is exactly five symbols.\n\n*   **Expressions:** There are 2 choices for each of the three values (T or F) and 2 choices for each of the two operators (& or |). This gives a total of 2³ * 2² = 32 unique expressions.\n*   **Evaluation (True Expressions):**\n    *   `A & B & C`: Only `T & T & T` is true. (1 true expression)\n    *   `A | B | C`: These are true unless all operands are false. Only `F | F | F` is false. (7 true expressions)\n    *   `A & B | C`: Due to operator precedence, this is `(A & B) | C`. This expression is true if C is true (4 cases, e.g., `T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, etc.) or if C is false and `A & B` is true (1 case: `T&T|F`). (5 true expressions)\n    *   `A | B & C`: This is `A | (B & C)`. This expression is true if A is true (4 cases) or if A is false and `B & C` is true (1 case: `F|T&T`). (5 true expressions)\n    *   Total from this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n### 2. Expressions with Unary and Binary Operators\nThese are five-symbol expressions involving the NOT operator `!`.\n\n*   `!!v op v`: For example, `!!T & F`. The `!!` counts as two symbols. There are 2 choices for the first value, 2 for the second, and 2 for the operator, making 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 expressions. Of these, 4 are true: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T`. (**4** true expressions)\n*   `v op !!v`: Similar to the previous case, there are 8 expressions, and 4 are true: `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, and `F|!!T`. (**4** true expressions)\n*   `!v op !v`: For example, `!T | !F`. There are 8 such expressions. 4 of them are true: `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`. (**4** true expressions)\n\n### 3. Expressions with Only Unary Operators\nThe only way to form a five-symbol expression is `!!!!v`.\n\n*   `!!!!T` evaluates to T.\n*   `!!!!F` evaluates to F.\n*   Total from this category: **1**\n\n### 4. Expressions with Parentheses\nThe parentheses must enclose an expression of three symbols to make the total length five.\n\n*   `(v op v)`: For example, `(T & F)`. There are 2 choices for the operator and 2 choices for each value, leading to 2 * 2² = 8 expressions. 4 of these are true: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, and `(F|T)`. (**4** true expressions)\n*   `(!!v)`: This encloses the three-symbol expression `!!v`. The two possibilities are `(!!T)`, which is true, and `(!!F)`, which is false. (**1** true expression)\n*   `((v))`: This encloses the one-symbol expression `v` within two pairs of parentheses. The possibilities are `((T))`, which is true, and `((F))`, which is false. (**1** true expression)\n\n### Final Calculation\nTo find the total number of true boolean expressions, we sum the counts from all categories:\n18 (from type 1) + 4 + 4 + 4 (from type 2) + 1 (from type 3) + 4 + 1 + 1 (from type 4) = **37**\n\nTherefore, there are 37 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly five of the given symbols.\n\n<<<37>>>"
