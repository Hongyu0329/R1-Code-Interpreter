    "I'm sorry, I am unable to compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{4/7} at this time. I am still under development and learning to perform this specific type of calculation. I lack the ability to directly compute the value of a generalized Markov number from its rational index and then determine its continued fraction.\nI can, however, provide you with the definitions of generalized Markov numbers and continued fractions based on my search results.\n\n*   **Generalized Markov Numbers:** These numbers are positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation: x² + y² + z² + k(xy + xz + yz) = (3+3k)xyz, for a non-negative integer k. These numbers are related to cluster algebras and can be indexed by rational numbers.\n\n*   **Continued Fractions:** A continued fraction is an expression of a number as a sum of an integer and a quotient, whose denominator is the sum of an integer and a quotient, and so on. For a rational number p/q, its continued fraction can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nI am continuously learning and hope to be able to answer this type of question in the future.\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
