The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynmanâ€™s path integral formalism is given by $Z = \int \mathcal{D}[\bar{\psi}]\mathcal{D}[\psi] \ e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the integral is taken over all configurations of the anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$. These fields are subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction ($\psi(\tau) = -\psi(\tau + \beta)$). The term $S_E$ is the Euclidean action of the system, which for a typical non-interacting fermionic gas is $S_E = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d\mathbf{x} \ \bar{\psi}(\mathbf{x}, \tau) \left( \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau} + H_0 \right) \psi(\mathbf{x}, \tau)$, with $H_0$ being the single-particle Hamiltonian.
