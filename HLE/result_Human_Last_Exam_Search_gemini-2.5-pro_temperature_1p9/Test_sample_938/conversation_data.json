    "The problem asks for the integer part of the value $10^4 \\cdot \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\ln(s_n)}{n}$. To find this, we must first understand the asymptotic behavior of the sequence $a_n$ and then of the sum $s_n$.\n\n### Asymptotic Behavior of the sequence $a_n$\nThe sequence is defined by the linear homogeneous recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$. The asymptotic behavior of such a sequence is determined by the roots of its characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for this recurrence is:\n$r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$\n\nTo find the roots, we can try to factor the polynomial. By testing integer divisors of -57, and then rational roots, we can find that there are no rational roots. However, the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials:\n$(x^2 - 4x - 3)(x^2 + 4x + 19) = 0$\n\nThe roots of these quadratic equations are:\n1.  From $x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0$, the roots are $r_{1,2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n2.  From $x^2 + 4x + 19 = 0$, the roots are $r_{3,4} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n\nThe general solution for $a_n$ is of the form $a_n = C_1(2+\\sqrt{7})^n + C_2(2-\\sqrt{7})^n + C_3(-2+i\\sqrt{15})^n + C_4(-2-i\\sqrt{15})^n$. The long-term behavior of the sequence is dominated by the root with the largest absolute value. Let's compare the magnitudes of the roots:\n*   $|r_1| = |2+\\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$\n*   $|r_2| = |2-\\sqrt{7}| \\approx |2 - 2.646| = 0.646$\n*   $|r_3| = |r_4| = |-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$\n\nThe dominant root is $R = 2+\\sqrt{7}$. Therefore, for large $n$, the sequence $a_n$ behaves as $a_n \\sim C \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^n$, where $C$ is a constant determined by the initial conditions. We can verify that with the given initial conditions ($a_0=1, a_1=a_2=0, a_3=88$), the constant $C$ is non-zero.\n\n### Asymptotic Behavior of the sum $s_n$\nThe sum $s_n$ is given by:\n$s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$\n\nTo find the limit, we need to determine the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ for large $n$. This involves identifying the term that grows fastest.\nLet $R = 2+\\sqrt{7}$ be the dominant root.\n1.  **First sum**: $\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})$\n    *   The term $a_{2k-3}$ grows like $C \\cdot R^{2k-3}$. The sum is dominated by its last term (when $k=n$), so the sum grows like $R^{2n-3}$.\n    *   The term $2a_{k+100}$ grows like $2C \\cdot R^{k+100}$. The sum grows like $R^{n+100}$.\n    *   The term $7a_{k+51}$ grows like $7C \\cdot R^{k+51}$. The sum grows like $R^{n+51}$.\n    For large $n$, $2n-3$ is larger than $n+100$. Thus, the term $\\sum a_{2k-3}$ dominates the first part of $s_n$. The sum behaves as a geometric series with ratio $R^2$, so its value is proportional to the last term, $a_{2n-3} \\sim C R^{2n-3}$.\n\n2.  **Second sum**: $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}U_k$ where $U_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\n    *   The dominant term in $U_k$ for large $k$ is $a_{k+3}a_{k-4} \\sim (CR^{k+3})(CR^{k-4}) = C^2 R^{2k-1}$. The other terms have a similar or smaller order of magnitude. For instance, $a_{k+2}a_{k-3} \\sim C^2R^{2k-1}$.\n    *   The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}U_k$ is dominated by its last term $U_{n-1}$, which grows like $R^{2(n-1)-1} = R^{2n-3}$.\n\nComparing the two parts of $s_n$, the first sum grows proportionally to $R^{2n-3}$, and the second sum also grows proportionally to $R^{2n-3}$. While there might be some partial cancellation, the overall asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ is governed by the fastest growing term, which is of the order $R^{2n}$. More precisely, $s_n$ is dominated by the sum $\\sum a_{2k-3}$, which grows like $a_{2n-3}$.\n\nTherefore, for large $n$, we have $s_n \\approx K \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{7})^{2n-3}$ for some constant $K$.\n\n### Calculating the Limit\nWe want to find $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$.\nUsing the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$:\n$\\ln(s_n) \\approx \\ln(K \\cdot R^{2n-3}) = \\ln(K) + (2n-3)\\ln(R)$\n\nNow we can evaluate the limit:\n$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K) + (2n-3)\\ln(R)}{n}$\n$= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\ln(K)}{n} - \\frac{3\\ln(R)}{n} + \\frac{2n\\ln(R)}{n}\\right)$\n$= 0 - 0 + 2\\ln(R) = 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe final value to compute is the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot 2\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7})$.\nUsing the value $\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) \\approx 1.535905$:\n$10^4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1.535905 = 20000 \\cdot 1.535905 = 30718.1$\n\nThe integer part of this value is 30718.\n\n"
