    "The user is asking about the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of the complete graph K_n, where n=35.\n\nBased on the Google searches, this problem is related to the **Graham-Pollak theorem**.\n\n*   The **Graham-Pollak theorem** states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to partition the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( n-1 \\). A partition is a specific type of covering where the edge sets of the bipartite graphs are disjoint. The question uses the word \"covering,\" which can sometimes be more general than \"partitioning.\"\n\n*   If arbitrary bipartite graphs (not necessarily complete) are allowed to cover the edges (not necessarily a partition), then the minimum number is \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). For n=35, this would be \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6\\).\n\n*   However, the context of the problem and the phrasing \"family of bipartite graphs\" usually points towards the well-known Graham-Pollak theorem, which deals with partitioning into *complete* bipartite graphs. In this setting, the terms \"cover\" and \"partition\" are often used interchangeably.\n\n*   The phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is unusual. In graph theory, a \"family of graphs\" is a set of graphs. The \"vertices\" of this set would be the graphs themselves. Therefore, it is highly likely that the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs in the family.\n\nAssuming the standard interpretation of partitioning the edges of \\( K_n \\) into complete bipartite subgraphs, the Graham-Pollak theorem provides the answer.\n\nAccording to the theorem, the minimum number of complete bipartite graphs required to partition the edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( n-1 \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 35 \\), the minimum number of such bipartite graphs is \\( 35 - 1 = 34 \\).\n\nThere is an alternative interpretation concerning the sum of the orders (number of vertices) of the bipartite graphs in the covering. A result by Katona and Szemer√©di states that the minimum of the sum of the orders of a collection of complete bipartite graphs that cover E(K_k) is k log k. For n=35, this would be approximately 35 * log(35), which is a different value and less likely to be the intended question given the standard problems in this area.\n\nGiven the common understanding and phrasing of such problems, the question is most likely asking for the size of the smallest family of complete bipartite graphs that partition the edges of K_35.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of bipartite graphs is n - 1.\nFor n = 35, this is 35 - 1 = 34.\n\nThe question is about the minimum number of *vertices* in a family of bipartite graphs. This is an unusual phrasing. Let's analyze it more deeply. If it's asking for the number of graphs, the answer is 34. If it's asking for the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph, it would be a much more complex calculation and would depend on the specific construction. One common construction involves n-1 star graphs. For K35, this would involve a sum of vertices, but the question is \"minimum number of vertices\", which is still ambiguous. The most direct and standard interpretation is that \"number of vertices in a family of graphs\" is a misstatement for \"number of graphs in a family\". Under this interpretation, the answer is provided by the Graham-Pollak theorem.\n\nGiven the overwhelming evidence pointing to the Graham-Pollak theorem as the key to this problem, and the awkward phrasing of the question, the most reasonable conclusion is that it asks for the minimum number of complete bipartite graphs required to partition the edges of K35.\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is a well-studied problem in graph theory. The definitive answer for partitioning the edges into complete bipartite subgraphs is provided by the Graham-Pollak theorem.\n\nThe Graham-Pollak theorem states that the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs whose edges partition the edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is \\( n-1 \\). An edge partition is a covering where each edge is included in exactly one subgraph.\n\nFor the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\), where \\( n = 35 \\), the minimum number of complete bipartite graphs needed to partition its edges is:\n\\( n - 1 = 35 - 1 = 34 \\)\n\nThe phrase \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is an unconventional way to ask this question. In this context, the \"family\" is the set of bipartite graphs, and its \"vertices\" are the graphs themselves. Therefore, the question is asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs in the family.\n\nThere are other related problems, such as covering with non-complete bipartite graphs, which would yield a different answer (\\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\)). However, the phrasing and the classic nature of the problem strongly suggest that it refers to partitioning into complete bipartite graphs, as addressed by Graham and Pollak.\n\n"
