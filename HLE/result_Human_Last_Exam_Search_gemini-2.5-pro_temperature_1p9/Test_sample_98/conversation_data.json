    "When an icosahedron tank is standing on one of its twenty faces, that face forms the base of the tank. A regular icosahedron has a high degree of symmetry. For every face, there is a parallel face on the opposite side. Therefore, when the tank is resting on one face, there is another face parallel to it at the top.\n\nThe water surface in any container at rest is always a horizontal plane. When the icosahedron is half-filled with water, the volume of the water is half the total volume of the tank. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, with a parallel top and bottom face, the plane that divides the volume into two equal halves is exactly at the midpoint of the height of the tank.\n\nThis horizontal plane at mid-height intersects the faces of the icosahedron to form a two-dimensional shape. An icosahedron has 20 faces, which are all equilateral triangles. When resting on a face, there is one face at the bottom and one at the top. The remaining 18 faces are on the sides. The mid-plane will intersect some of these side faces.\n\nSpecifically, the plane cuts through a \"belt\" of the icosahedron's faces. Given the 3-fold rotational symmetry around the axis perpendicular to the base face, the resulting cross-section will also have at least 3-fold symmetry. The top face is rotated 60 degrees relative to the bottom face. This configuration means the cross-section at the midpoint of the height will be a hexagon. Due to the overall symmetry of the icosahedron, this hexagon is regular.\n\nTherefore, the shape of the water surface will be a **regular hexagon**.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
