    "The problem requires the evaluation of a complex SKI combinator expression and the subsequent calculation of the base-2 logarithm of the resulting integer.\n\n### 1. Decoding the SKI Expression\n\nThe given expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nTo decipher this, we first need to identify the components and their functions within Church numeral arithmetic. Church numerals represent natural numbers as functions. The number `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and an argument `x`, and applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times.\n\nLet's break down the expression:\n*   **Successor function (`succ`)**: The combinator `S(S(K(S))(K))` represents the successor function, which takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n*   **Church numeral 2 (`c_2`)**: The term `S(I)(I)` corresponds to the Church numeral for 2. Its application to `f` and `x` results in `f(f(x))`.\n*   **Church numeral 1 (`c_1`)**: The identity combinator `I` is often used to represent the Church numeral for 1, as it is equivalent to `S(K)(K)`.\n\nThe expression can be parsed as follows:\nLet `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`. This is the successor function applied to the Church numeral for 1 (`I`). Thus, `A` represents the Church numeral for 2 (`c_2`).\n\nLet `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`. This is the successor function applied to `S(I)(I)`, which is the Church numeral for 2. Therefore, `B` represents the Church numeral for 3 (`c_3`).\n\nSubstituting `A` and `B` back into the main expression gives:\n`n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))))(c_3)`\n\n### 2. Evaluating the Expression through Church Numeral Arithmetic\n\nIn combinatory logic, the application of one Church numeral to another, such as `c_m(c_n)`, corresponds to exponentiation, yielding `c_{n^m}`.\n\nLet's evaluate the expression from the inside out:\n*   The sub-expression `K(c_2)(c_3)` reduces to `c_2` because the `K` combinator, `K x y`, returns `x`.\n*   Let `E = S(I)(K(c_2))`. When applied to `c_3`, `E(c_3)` becomes `I(c_3)(K(c_2)(c_3))`, which simplifies to `c_3(K(c_2)(c_3))` and further to `c_3(c_2)`.\n*   Applying the exponentiation rule, `c_3(c_2)` evaluates to `c_{2^3}`, which is `c_8`.\n\nNow substitute this back into the larger expression:\n*   Let `C = S(I)(S(I)(K(c_2)))`. When applied to `c_3`, `C(c_3)` becomes `I(c_3)(S(I)(K(c_2))(c_3))`, which is `c_3` applied to the result we just calculated (`c_8`).\n*   So, `C(c_3) = c_3(c_8)`. Using the exponentiation rule again, this gives `c_{8^3}`.\n*   `8^3 = 512`. So, `C(c_3) = c_{512}`.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the entire expression, `n`:\n*   `n = S(I)(C)(c_3) = I(c_3)(C(c_3)) = c_3(C(c_3))`\n*   This becomes `c_3(c_{512})`, which according to the exponentiation rule is `c_{512^3}`.\n\nCalculation of `512^3`:\n`512^3 = (2^9)^3 = 2^{27}`\n`2^{27} = 134,217,728`\n\nSo, the given SKI expression is the Church numeral for `n = 134,217,728`.\n\n### 3. Calculating the Logarithm\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(134,217,728) = log_2(2^{27}) = 27`\n\n<<<27>>>"
