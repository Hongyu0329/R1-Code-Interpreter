    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points for the function $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points are the solutions to $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of the polynomial:**\n    *   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n    *   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial whose degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n    *   The degree of $h(x)$ is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The leading term is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3x^9$.\n    *   Therefore, $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:**\n    A polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Since $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means there can be at most 9 fixed points.\n\n3.  **Analyze the constraints on the derivatives:**\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. For $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$, this means the quadratic must always be positive. This requires the leading coefficient to be positive, so $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$. It also requires the discriminant to be negative: $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$.\n    *   Similarly, the condition $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. For $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$, this means $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$ and $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\n    *   The derivative of the composite function is $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for any $x$, their product $h'(x)$ is also strictly positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable:**\n    For the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots according to Rolle's Theorem.\n    $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    The equation for the roots of $P'(x)$ is $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n\n    Let's analyze the polynomial $K(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n    *   Therefore, $K(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n    The equation $K(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots. So, it is possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots.\n\n    To have 9 real roots for $P(x)$, we would need $P'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, which would correspond to 8 local extrema for $P(x)$. For $P(x)$ to have 9 roots, the values of these extrema must alternate in sign.\n\n    Let's check the derivative of $K(x)$, which determines the number of its local extrema.\n    $K'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[f'(g(x))g'(x)] = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n    *   $f''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   $g'(x)$ has degree 2.\n    *   $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n    *   The degree of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $(1 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 2) = 3 + 4 = 7$.\n    *   The degree of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(2 \\times 3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   The leading term of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$ is $(6a(px^3)) \\cdot (3px^2)^2 = 54ap^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$ is $(3a(px^3)^2) \\cdot (6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading term of $K'(x)$ is $(54+18)ap^3x^7 = 72ap^3x^7$.\n\n    Since $K'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it can have up to 7 distinct real roots. This means $K(x)$ can have up to 7 local extrema. An 8th-degree polynomial with 7 local extrema can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=1$) at most 8 times. Thus, $P'(x)$ can have 8 roots.\n\n    This analysis shows there's no algebraic obstruction to having 9 fixed points. The constraints on the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are inequalities, leaving open sets for the coefficients. It is possible to choose the coefficients to create a situation where the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x))-x$ has 9 real roots. Although constructing a specific example is complex, the theoretical maximum of 9 is not ruled out by the given conditions.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is the degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x))-x=0$, which is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
