    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. Prior to the enactment of this law in 1973, Israeli contract law was primarily influenced by the English common law, which did not include a general, explicitly stated principle of good faith.\n\nThe Contracts (General Part) Law marked a significant shift, incorporating the \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev*) principle, which was influenced by continental legal systems, particularly German law. The statute introduces this concept in two key sections:\n\n*   **Section 12**, which requires that a person act in good faith during the negotiations leading up to the formation of a contract.\n*   **Section 39**, which mandates that any right or obligation arising from a contract must be exercised and fulfilled in good faith.\n\nThis introduction was considered a major innovation in Israeli law, establishing good faith as a fundamental tenet of the legal system. The law extends this principle beyond contracts to apply to other legal acts and obligations as well.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
