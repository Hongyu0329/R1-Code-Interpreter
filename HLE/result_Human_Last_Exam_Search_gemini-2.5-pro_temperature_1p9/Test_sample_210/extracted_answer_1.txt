Between 1803 and 1823, the number of destitute migrants who settled in the Talbot Settlement grew from a few families to a substantial number, with records showing 804 families by 1817 and an estimated 20,000 immigrants by 1826. Colonel Thomas Talbot's personal landholdings increased by at least 60,000 acres, from an initial 5,000-acre grant to over 65,000 acres by 1821.
