    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous space is one where for any two points, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps the first point to the second. A planar continuum is a compact, connected subset of the plane. The classification of such objects results in four distinct classes up to homeomorphism.\n\nThese four classes are:\n*   **The point:** This is a degenerate continuum, meaning it consists of a single point.\n*   **The simple closed curve (or circle):** This is the familiar one-dimensional circle. Any two simple closed curves are homeomorphic.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a fractal-like, arc-like continuum where every subcontinuum is indecomposable. It was identified as a homogeneous continuum by Bing in 1948. Any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This continuum is constructed by having a continuous decomposition of the space into pseudo-arcs, with the resulting quotient space being a circle. Bing and Jones showed this to be a homogeneous continuum in 1959.\n\nIn 2014, L. C. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen proved that this list is complete for all non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua, meaning any such object must be homeomorphic to one of these three. Including the degenerate case of a point, this brings the total number of homeomorphism classes to four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
