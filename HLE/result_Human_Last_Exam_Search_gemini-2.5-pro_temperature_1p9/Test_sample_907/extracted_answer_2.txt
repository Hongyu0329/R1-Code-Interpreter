The final equations for the absorption cross-section are:
a) **σₐ(ω₀) = C * N * |d_eg ⋅ ε|² * e^(-(ω_ex - ω₀)²τ²/2)**
b) **σ_b(ω₀) = C * N * |d_eg ⋅ ε|² * e^(-(ω_ex + 2V/ħ - ω₀)²τ²/2)**
where C is a constant, N is the number of molecules, **d**_eg is the single-molecule transition dipole moment, **ε** is the laser polarization vector, ω_ex is the single-molecule exciton frequency, ω₀ is the laser's central frequency, τ is the pulse duration, and V is the near-neighbor interaction energy.
