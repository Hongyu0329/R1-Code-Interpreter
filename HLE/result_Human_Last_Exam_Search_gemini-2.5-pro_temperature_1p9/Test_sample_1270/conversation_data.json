    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a humorous concept in chemistry that envisions a benzene ring with three substituents arranged in a pattern resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo. This arrangement is achieved by attaching three ethyl groups to the 1, 3, and 5 positions of the benzene ring, creating the molecule 1,3,5-triethylbenzene.\n\nA standard benzene ring consists of 6 carbon atoms. Each of the three ethyl groups (C₂H₅) adds an additional 2 carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of carbon atoms in the \"mercedesbenzene\" molecule is calculated as follows:\n6 carbons (from the benzene ring) + 3 x 2 carbons (from the three ethyl groups) = 12 carbon atoms.\n\nThe chemical formula for 1,3,5-triethylbenzene is C₁₂H₁₈, confirming a total of 12 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<12>>>"
