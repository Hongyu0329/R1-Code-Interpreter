    "There are **eight** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. A product-free set is a non-empty subset of a group where the product of any two elements in the set is not in the set. A maximal by inclusion product-free set is one that is not a proper subset of any other product-free set.\n\nThe classification of such groups was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. The finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 are:\n\n*   **Cyclic group of order 2 (C₂)**\n*   **Cyclic group of order 3 (C₃)**\n*   **Cyclic group of order 4 (C₄)**\n*   **Cyclic group of order 5 (C₅)**\n*   **Cyclic group of order 6 (C₆)**\n*   **Cyclic group of order 8 (C₈)**\n*   **The Klein four-group (C₂ × C₂)**\n*   **The dihedral group of order 6 (D₆)**, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three elements (S₃)\n\nThese are the only finite groups that possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n<<<8>>>"
