    "Recent studies have revealed that a specific type of fish, the herring, possesses a remarkable sense of hearing that might allow it to detect sounds as subtle as human muscle twitches.\n\nThe frequency of human muscle twitches ranges from approximately 15 to 115 hertz. To be audible, an animal's hearing range must overlap with this frequency.\n\nAn examination of the hearing capabilities of the animals listed reveals the following:\n\n*   **Dog:** The hearing range of a dog is roughly 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz, which means they could potentially hear the higher-frequency muscle twitches.\n*   **Bat:** Bats have a hearing range that typically starts around 700 to 1,000 Hz and can extend up to 200,000 Hz, well above the frequency of muscle twitches.\n*   **Herring:** Members of the herring family have an impressive hearing range. They can detect sounds with frequencies from as low as 5 Hz up to 8,000 Hz. Their most sensitive hearing is in the range of 30 to 1,200 Hz, which comfortably includes the entire frequency spectrum of human muscle twitches.\n*   **Whale:** The hearing of whales greatly varies. Baleen whales can hear very low frequencies, sometimes as low as 7 Hz, while toothed whales are attuned to much higher frequencies. Therefore, some whales could potentially hear muscle twitches.\n*   **Human:** The typical human hearing range is from 20 to 20,000 Hz. This would theoretically allow for the detection of some muscle twitch frequencies, provided the sound could be effectively transmitted to the ear.\n\nGiven its highly sensitive low-frequency hearing which aligns perfectly with the frequency of human muscle contractions, the herring is a strong candidate for being able to hear these subtle sounds.\n\n<<<C>>>"
