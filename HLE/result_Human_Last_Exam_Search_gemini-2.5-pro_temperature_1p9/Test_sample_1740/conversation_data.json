    "To date, between 9 and 12 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. The most commonly cited members include let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98. Some sources also include miR-202 as a member of this family.\n\nThe variation in the exact number can be attributed to the distinction between mature microRNAs (miRNAs) and their precursor genes, as well as ongoing genomic research. For instance, there are 10 mature let-7 miRNAs that are derived from 13 precursor genes. In the human genome, there are at least eleven let-7 miRNA genes that produce nearly identical mature let-7 miRNAs. Some research indicates the let-7 family is composed of nine mature let-7 miRNAs that are encoded by 12 different genomic loci. Another study identifies 12 members of the let-7 family located at eight different loci on seven chromosomes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
