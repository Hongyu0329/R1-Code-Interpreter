As the operator is applied, the edges of the image will evolve according to a discrete approximation of mean curvature flow. This causes sharp corners and high-curvature sections of the edges to smooth out. Convex areas of a shape will erode, while concave areas will be filled in. Over many iterations, closed shapes will shrink and ultimately disappear, leading to a final image with minimal edge curvature, such as an image that is all one color or has only straight lines for boundaries.
