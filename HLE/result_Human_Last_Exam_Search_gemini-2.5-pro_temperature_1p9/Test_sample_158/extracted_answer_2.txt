**Required Permeability of the Magnetic Material (μ):**

There are two possible values for the permeability that satisfy the condition of an undistorted external field:

1.  `μ = μ₀ * (R₂ + R₁)/(R₂ - R₁)`
2.  `μ = μ₀ * (R₂ - R₁)/(R₂ + R₁)`

where `μ₀` is the permeability of free space.

**Magnetic Field in the Interior Region (H_int):**

The magnetic field inside the shell (`ρ < R₁`) is uniform and depends on which permeability is chosen for the shell.

1.  Corresponding to the permeability `μ = μ₀ * (R₂ + R₁)/(R₂ - R₁)`:
    `H_int = H₀ * (R₂/R₁) * x̂`

2.  Corresponding to the permeability `μ = μ₀ * (R₂ - R₁)/(R₂ + R₁)`:
    `H_int = -H₀ * (R₂/R₁) * x̂`
