    "The next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\nThe provided sequence of numbers is: 1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352.\n\nUpon analysis, it is evident that all the numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6. A list of four-digit numbers divisible by 6 confirms that each number in the sequence is a multiple of 6.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is 2352. To find the next number, we can identify the next multiple of 6 in the list. Following 2352, the next multiple of 6 is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
