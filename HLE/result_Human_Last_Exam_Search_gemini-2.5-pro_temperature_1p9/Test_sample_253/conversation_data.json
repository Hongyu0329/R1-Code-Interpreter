    "Following the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 applications starting from a single cell in state 1 results in the binary pattern: `11011110110111111011`.\n\nThe evolution of the pattern is determined by Rule 110, an elementary cellular automaton. This rule dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. A cell and its neighbors form a triplet of binary values (0s and 1s), and for each of the eight possible triplets, Rule 110 specifies the resulting state of the central cell.\n\nThe rule can be summarized as follows, where the triplet represents the state of the left neighbor, the cell itself, and the right neighbor, and the result is the new state of the cell.\n\n*   111 → 0\n*   110 → 1\n*   101 → 1\n*   100 → 0\n*   011 → 1\n*   010 → 1\n*   001 → 1\n*   000 → 0\n\nStarting with a single '1' surrounded by '0's, this rule is applied iteratively to generate each new generation. The pattern grows and changes with each of the 20 steps, leading to the final binary sequence. This process is often visualized as a triangular pattern, where each row represents a successive generation.\n\nTo determine the precise pattern after 20 iterations, a computational simulation is the most reliable method. By implementing the logic of Rule 110 in a program, one can start with an initial state of a single '1' and apply the rule 20 times to arrive at the final pattern.\n\n<<<11011110110111111011>>>"
