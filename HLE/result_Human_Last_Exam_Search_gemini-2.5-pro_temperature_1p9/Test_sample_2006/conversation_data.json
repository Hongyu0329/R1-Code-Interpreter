    "This haiku puzzle can be deciphered by connecting its lines to a significant historical event and its geography. The title, \"The Bays,\" functions as a question, prompting the identification of specific geographical bays related to the haiku's subject.\n\nThe haiku's three lines provide the necessary clues:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This points to the turbulent end of World War II in the Pacific, which occurred in August 1945. The \"tempest\" metaphorically refers to the intense final events of the war.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty, which can be interpreted as the 30-year period from 1915 to 1945. This timeframe marks a significant chapter of Japanese history, beginning with the \"Twenty-One Demands\" presented to China in 1915 that signaled Japan's expansionist ambitions and concluding with the end of the war, which brought about immense \"winds of change.\"\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This is a direct reference to Emperor Hirohito of Japan. The Emperor was regarded as a divine figure by many of his people, and his radio broadcast announcing Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, was a moment where the \"divine one\" yielded.\n\nWith the historical context established as the surrender of Japan, the answer to the question \"The Bays?\" are the key geographical bays associated with the end of the war:\n\n*   **Hiroshima Bay**: The city of Hiroshima, the target of the first atomic bomb which precipitated the surrender, is located on this bay.\n*   **Nagasaki Bay**: Nagasaki, the site of the second atomic bombing, is situated on its harbor, a bay-like inlet.\n*   **Tokyo Bay**: The formal surrender ceremony was held aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay.\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\n\n<<<Hiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
