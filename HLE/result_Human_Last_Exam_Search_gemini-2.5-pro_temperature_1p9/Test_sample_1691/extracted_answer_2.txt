The analytical formula that approximates the integral for the small $\epsilon$ regime is given by:
$I(\epsilon) \approx C \cdot \epsilon^{-4/5}$
where the constant C is:
$C = \frac{\pi}{5 \cdot 9^{1/5} \sin(\frac{\pi}{5})}$

This formula is derived by noting that for small $\epsilon$, the integral is dominated by the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$. In this region, the term $9x^5$ is the most significant part of the denominator. This allows for an approximation of the integral which can be solved analytically. The upper limit of integration is extended to infinity as the contribution from the tail of the integral becomes negligible for small $\epsilon$. The constant C involves the well-known value of $\sin(\pi/5)$.
