    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the large *x* regimes, we employ the method of dominant balance. This technique involves identifying the terms in the equation that dictate the behavior of the solution for large values of *x*.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large *x*, certain terms can be considered negligible. The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ diminishes, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is a bounded, oscillating forcing term. In the context of finding the leading-order asymptotic behavior, it's a common approach to first analyze the autonomous part of the equation to find the intrinsic behavior of the system.\n\nWe focus on the autonomous part of the equation, assuming the oscillatory term's effects are secondary to the primary balance of terms for large *x*:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nTo determine which of the nonlinear terms is dominant, we test a power-law solution of the form $y(x) = C x^n$.\nThe derivatives are $y'(x) = Cnx^{n-1}$, $y''(x) = Cn(n-1)x^{n-2}$, and $y'''(x) = Cn(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}$.\nThe non-linear terms become $y^4 = C^4 x^{4n}$ and $y'^4 = (Cn)^4 x^{4n-4}$.\n\nFor large *x*, the term with the highest power of *x* will dominate. Since $4n > 4n-4$, the term $y^4$ is dominant over $y'^4$. Therefore, the primary balance of terms for large *x* is approximately:\n$y''' \\approx y^4$\n\nSubstituting the power-law solution into this simplified equation gives:\n$Cn(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3} \\approx C^4 x^{4n}$\n\nFor this balance to hold for all large *x*, the exponents of *x* must be equal:\n$n - 3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$\n\nNow, we equate the coefficients:\n$C(-1)(-1-1)(-1-2) = C^4$\n$C(-1)(-2)(-3) = C^4$\n$-6C = C^4$\n\nThis gives two possibilities: $C=0$ (the trivial solution) or $C^3 = -6$. The non-trivial solution for *C* is:\n$C = -\\sqrt{6}$\n\nThus, the approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$ in the large *x* regime is:\n$y(x) \\approx -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{x}$\n\nTo provide the answer rounded to two decimal places, we calculate the value of the constant:\n$C = -\\sqrt{6} \\approx -1.8171$\nRounding to two decimal places gives $C \\approx -1.82$.\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
