    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, is a non-abelian group of order 128. It can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, y² = x³², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹ >.\n\nA power subgroup, Gⁿ, is the subgroup generated by the n-th powers of all elements in the group G. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of Q_128 that can be formed in this manner.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 consist of two types:\n1.  Elements of the form xⁱ for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. These form a cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form xⁱy for i = 0, 1, ..., 63. These elements are outside the cyclic subgroup <x>.\n\nThe order of an element of the form xⁱy can be calculated:\n(xⁱy)² = xⁱy xⁱy = xⁱ(yxⁱy⁻¹)y² = xⁱ(x⁻ⁱ)y² = y² = x³².\n(xⁱy)⁴ = ((xⁱy)²)² = (x³²)² = x⁶⁴ = 1.\nThus, every element outside the cyclic subgroup <x> has an order of 4.\n\nWe examine the power subgroups Gⁿ for G = Q_128:\n\n**Case 1: n is odd**\nLet n be an odd integer. The n-th power subgroup is generated by the set {gⁿ | g ∈ Q_128}.\n*   For elements in the cyclic subgroup <x>, the n-th powers are (xⁱ)ⁿ = xⁱⁿ. Since n is odd, gcd(n, 64) = 1. Therefore, the subgroup generated by {xⁱⁿ | i = 0, ..., 63} is the entire cyclic group <x>.\n*   For elements of the form xⁱy, the n-th power is (xⁱy)ⁿ. Since n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, we have (xⁱy)ⁿ = ((xⁱy)²)ᵏ(xⁱy) = (x³²)ᵏxⁱy. By choosing appropriate values for i and k, this form can represent an element containing 'y'.\nSince the power subgroup (Q_128)ⁿ contains the generator 'y' (e.g., for i=0 and n=1) and the whole subgroup <x>, it must be equal to Q_128 itself. So, for any odd n, (Q_128)ⁿ = Q_128. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: n is even**\nLet n be an even integer. We can write n = 2ᵏm, where m is an odd integer and k ≥ 1.\nThe power subgroup (Q_128)ⁿ is generated by {gⁿ | g ∈ Q_128}.\n*   (xⁱ)ⁿ = xⁱⁿ = xⁱ(²ᵏm). The subgroup generated by these elements is <x^(2ᵏ)>.\n*   (xⁱy)ⁿ = (xⁱy)^(2ᵏm) = ((xⁱy)²)⁽²ᵏ⁻¹m⁾ = (x³²)⁽²ᵏ⁻¹m⁾ = x^(32 * 2ᵏ⁻¹ * m).\n\nLet's analyze this for different values of k:\n*   **k = 1** (n = 2m): The powers are x^(i*2m) and x^(32m). Since m is odd, x^(32m) is x³². The subgroup generated is <x², x³²>, which simplifies to <x²>, a cyclic group of order 32 (C₃₂).\n*   **k = 2** (n = 4m): The powers are x^(i*4m) and x^(64m)=1. The subgroup generated is <x⁴>, a cyclic group of order 16 (C₁₆).\n*   **k = 3** (n = 8m): The powers are x^(i*8m) and x^(128m)=1. The subgroup generated is <x⁸>, a cyclic group of order 8 (C₈).\n*   **k = 4** (n = 16m): The powers are x^(i*16m) and x^(256m)=1. The subgroup generated is <x¹⁶>, a cyclic group of order 4 (C₄).\n*   **k = 5** (n = 32m): The powers are x^(i*32m) and x^(512m)=1. The subgroup generated is <x³²>, a cyclic group of order 2 (C₂).\n*   **k = 6** (n = 64m): The powers are x^(i*64m)=1 and x^(1024m)=1. The subgroup generated is the trivial subgroup {1} (C₁).\n\nAny integer n will fall into one of the above categories based on the highest power of 2 that divides it. This gives us 6 distinct power subgroups in addition to Q_128 itself.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n1.  Q_128\n2.  C₃₂\n3.  C₁₆\n4.  C₈\n5.  C₄\n6.  C₂\n7.  The trivial subgroup {1}\n\nIn total, there are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
