    "To determine the number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas, we must identify the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the model's target space.\n\nIn the theory of disordered systems, the different symmetry classes are characterized by specific random matrix ensembles. The supersymmetric sigma-model provides a powerful field-theoretic framework to study these systems. For symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target space of the sigma-model is the symmetric supermanifold G/K, where G is the supergroup SpO(2n,R|2n) and K is the subgroup U(n|n). For the specific case of two replicas (n=2), the target space is SpO(4,R|4)/U(2|2).\n\nThe non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the even part of this supermanifold. The bosonic part of the supergroup G=SpO(4,R|4) is G_B = Sp(4,R) × O(4), and the bosonic part of the subgroup K=U(2|2) is K_B = U(2) × U(2). Consequently, the bosonic sector of the target space is the manifold G_B / K_B, which decomposes into the product of two symmetric spaces:\n1.  The Bose-Bose (BB) sector: Sp(4,R)/U(2)\n2.  The Fermi-Fermi (FF) sector: O(4)/U(2)\n\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two spaces. We can calculate the dimension of each component as follows:\n\n*   **Dimension of the Bose-Bose sector (Sp(4,R)/U(2)):**\n    *   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n,R) is given by n(2n+1). For Sp(4,R), where n=2, the dimension is 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10.\n    *   The dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². For U(2), the dimension is 2² = 4.\n    *   Therefore, the dimension of the BB sector is dim(Sp(4,R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\n*   **Dimension of the Fermi-Fermi sector (O(4)/U(2)):**\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n(n-1)/2. For O(4), the dimension is 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6.\n    *   The dimension of U(2) is 4.\n    *   Therefore, the dimension of the FF sector is dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThe total number of non-Grassman variables is the sum of the dimensions of these two sectors: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
