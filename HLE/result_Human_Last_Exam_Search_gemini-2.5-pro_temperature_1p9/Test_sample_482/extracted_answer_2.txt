The critical amount of correlation, expressed as the correlation coefficient `ρ`, required to balance potentiation and depression is given by the formula:
`ρ_{crit} = (2(θ - μ))/(1 - μ) - 1/N_{pop}`
where `μ` is the average input rate, `θ` is the plasticity offset constant, and `N_{pop}` is the number of neurons in each input layer (`N_v` and `N_s`).
