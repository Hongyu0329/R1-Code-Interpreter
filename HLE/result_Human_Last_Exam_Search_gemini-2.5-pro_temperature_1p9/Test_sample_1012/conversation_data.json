    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically use Grover's algorithm to significantly speed up the process of breaking symmetric key encryption. This algorithm effectively halves the security strength of a symmetric key.\n\nTo counteract this, the key length needs to be doubled to maintain a sufficient level of security. For a cryptographic system to be considered secure against an attack by a quantum computer, it is widely recommended that it provides at least 128 bits of security.\n\nTherefore, to achieve a post-quantum security level of 128 bits, a symmetric key of at least 256 bits is necessary. An attack on a 256-bit key using Grover's algorithm would require approximately 2^128 operations, a number still considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has also indicated a move towards requiring 256-bit AES keys for protecting classified information.\n\nBased on this, to be secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n<<<A>>>"
