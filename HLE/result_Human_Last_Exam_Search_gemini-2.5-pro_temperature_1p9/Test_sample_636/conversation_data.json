    "To solve this problem, we will use the pole placement method.\n\n**1. Define System Matrices and Desired Eigenvalues**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a system with matrices:\nA = \n```\n[-1  1]\n[ 1  0]\n```\nB = \n```\n[1  2]\n[1  0]\n```\nThe desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system are at -1 + j and -1 - j.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired characteristic polynomial is formed from the desired eigenvalues:\np(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))\np(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)\np(λ) = (λ + 1)² - (j)²\np(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 + 1\np(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2\n\n**3. Form the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe state feedback control law is given by `u = -Fx`, where F is the state feedback gain matrix. The problem asks to find F such that the eigenvalues of `A + BF` are the desired ones. Let F be a 2x2 matrix:\nF = \n```\n[f₁₁  f₁₂]\n[f₂₁  f₂₂]\n```\n\nNow, we compute the matrix `A + BF`:\nBF = \n```\n[1  2] [f₁₁  f₁₂]  =  [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁  f₁₂ + 2f₂₂]\n[1  0] [f₂₁  f₂₂]      [     f₁₁          f₁₂    ]\n```\n\nA + BF = \n```\n[-1  1] + [f₁₁ + 2f₂₁  f₁₂ + 2f₂₂] = [-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁   1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂]\n[ 1  0]   [     f₁₁          f₁₂    ]   [   1 + f₁₁                 f₁₂    ]\n```\n\n**4. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system `A + BF` is given by `det(λI - (A + BF)) = 0`.\nFor a 2x2 matrix `M`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ² - Tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0`.\nLet `M = A + BF`.\n\nThe trace of `M` is:\nTr(M) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁) + f₁₂ = f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1\n\nThe determinant of `M` is:\ndet(M) = (-1 + f₁₁ + 2f₂₁)(f₁₂) - (1 + f₁₂ + 2f₂₂)(1 + f₁₁)\ndet(M) = -f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - (1 + f₁₁ + f₁₂ + f₁₁f₁₂ + 2f₂₂ + 2f₁₁f₂₂)\ndet(M) = -1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial of `A + BF` is:\nλ² - (f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂)\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe now equate the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial, λ² + 2λ + 2.\nComparing the coefficient of λ:\n-(f₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ - 1) = 2\nf₁₁ + f₁₂ + 2f₂₁ = -1  (Equation 1)\n\nComparing the constant term:\n-1 - f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ = 2\n-f₁₁ - 2f₁₂ + 2f₂₁f₁₂ - 2f₂₂ - 2f₁₁f₂₂ = 3  (Equation 2)\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns. This means there are infinite solutions for the feedback gain matrix F. We can find one solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nLet's assume the first row of F is zero, i.e., `f₁₁ = 0` and `f₁₂ = 0`.\nSubstituting these into our equations:\nEquation 1 becomes:\n0 + 0 + 2f₂₁ = -1  =>  f₂₁ = -0.5\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n-0 - 2(0) + 2(-0.5)(0) - 2f₂₂ - 2(0)f₂₂ = 3\n-2f₂₂ = 3  =>  f₂₂ = -1.5\n\nSo, one possible state feedback gain matrix is:\nF = \n```\n[  0     0  ]\n[-0.5  -1.5]\n```\n\n**6. Verification**\nLet's check if this F yields the correct eigenvalues.\nA + BF = \n```\n[-1 + 0 + 2(-0.5)   1 + 0 + 2(-1.5)] = [-2  -2]\n[    1 + 0                     -1.5 ]   [ 1  -1.5]\n```\nWait, the calculation for A+BF in step 3 used f12 which is now 0. Let's re-calculate A+BF using the derived F.\nF = `[[0, 0], [-0.5, -1.5]]`\nBF = `[[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[0, 0], [-0.5, -1.5]] = [[-1, -3], [0, 0]]`\nA + BF = `[[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[-1, -3], [0, 0]] = [[-2, -2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this resulting matrix is:\ndet(λI - (A + BF)) = det([[λ+2, 2], [-1, λ]]) = λ(λ+2) - (2)(-1) = λ² + 2λ + 2.\nThe roots of this polynomial are λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4-8))/2 = -1 ± j.\nThis matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n"
