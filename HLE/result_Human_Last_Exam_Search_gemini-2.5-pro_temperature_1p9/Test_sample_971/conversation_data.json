    "While Natalia Osipova was widely acclaimed for her brilliant and technically prodigious performances as Kitri in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote* around 2008, pinpointing the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in her Act I variation is not feasible based on available records.\n\nReviews and articles from the period consistently praise her for her \"dizzying series of revolutions\" and \"breathtaking technique\". Multiple sources refer to her performing \"multiple pirouettes\".\n\nA close analysis of available performance videos from 2008, including a guest performance in Novosibirsk, reveals the virtuosic nature of her interpretation. However, the choreography of the Act I variation is a dynamic and evolving showcase of a ballerina's skills and does not have a universally set number of pirouettes. The exact number of turns can vary between performances depending on the dancer's interpretation and physical condition on a given day.\n\nTherefore, a definitive number of single-turn pirouettes performed by Osipova in any specific 2008 performance as Kitri cannot be authoritatively stated.\n\n<<<Not possible to provide a definitive number.>>>"
