    "The symmetry of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two most common forms are the copper(I) and copper(II) complexes.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I):**\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation, [Cu(C₆H₁₄S₂)₂]⁺, adopts a tetrahedral coordination geometry. In this complex, the cation possesses an S₄ improper rotation axis, which assigns it to the **S₄ point group**. This structure is described as having a compact, nearly spherical shape due to the folding of the ligand.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II):**\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, typically found as [Cu(C₆H₁₄S₂)₂](BF₄)₂, exhibits a distorted octahedral geometry. In the crystal structure, the copper atom is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms of the two dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane and to two fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions in the axial positions. The crystal structure belongs to the centrosymmetric space group P2₁/c, and the molecule resides on a crystallographic inversion center. This means the point group of the molecule in the solid state is **Cᵢ**.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper is S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex in the solid state.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex.>>>"
