    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop.\n\nThe algorithm's core is the loop that repeatedly divides the number `n` by the base `c` to find the digits of the representation. Let's analyze the loop:\n1.  **Initialization**: Step 1 involves a few arithmetic operations (division, subtraction) which are performed once. This step takes constant time, O(1).\n2.  **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `q` is greater than 0. `q` is initialized as `⌊n/c⌋`.\n3.  **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, the value of `x` is set to the previous `q`, and then a new `q` is calculated by `⌊x/c⌋`. In essence, the original number `n` is divided by `c` in each iteration.\n\nThe number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is less than 1 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, which is written as log<sub>c</sub>(n). The loop will execute approximately log<sub>c</sub>(n) times.\n\nEach operation inside the loop (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction) is considered to take constant time, O(1), assuming the numbers fit within a standard machine word.\n\nTherefore, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop.\n\nComplexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Complexity of loop body)\nComplexity = O(log<sub>c</sub>n) × O(1)\nComplexity = O(log<sub>c</sub>n)\n\nAccording to the change of base formula for logarithms, log<sub>c</sub>(n) is proportional to log(n) (e.g., ln(n) or log<sub>10</sub>(n)) by a constant factor (1/log(c)). In Big O notation, constant factors are omitted. Thus, the complexity is simplified to O(log n).\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
