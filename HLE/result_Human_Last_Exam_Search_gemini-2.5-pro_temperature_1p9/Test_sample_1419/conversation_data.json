    "### Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling in ϕ⁴ Theory Unveiled\n\nIn the vicinity of four spatial dimensions, the ϕ⁴ theory exhibits a non-trivial fixed point known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. The leading order expression for the coupling constant at this fixed point, denoted as u*, is directly proportional to the dimensional deviation parameter, ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe behavior of the coupling constant under changes in energy scale is described by the renormalization group beta function. For the ϕ⁴ theory with a Lagrangian interaction term of the form (λ/4!)φ⁴, the beta function to one-loop order is given by β(λ) = -ελ + 3λ². A fixed point of the renormalization group flow occurs when the beta function is zero, which signifies that the coupling constant is scale-invariant.\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, β(λ) = 0, yields two possible solutions for the fixed point coupling. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at λ* = 0. The other, the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is found at λ* = ε/3. This result is fundamental in the study of critical phenomena and statistical mechanics.\n\nDifferent conventions for the coupling constant exist in the literature. For instance, if the interaction term is defined as (u/4)φ⁴, the beta function and the corresponding fixed point value for 'u' would differ by a numerical factor. However, for the standard (λ/4!)φ⁴ interaction, the leading order fixed point coupling is ε/3. More precise calculations, including higher-order terms in the epsilon expansion, have been performed to refine the value of the fixed point coupling.\n\n<<<u* = ε/3>>>"
