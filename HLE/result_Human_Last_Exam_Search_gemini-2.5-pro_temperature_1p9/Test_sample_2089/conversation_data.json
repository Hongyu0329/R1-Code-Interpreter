    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed in a harrowing bus scene is the 2010 Canadian film *Incendies*. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nIn a pivotal and brutal sequence in *Incendies*, the protagonist, Nawal Marwan, is traveling on a bus with other Muslim refugees during a violent civil war. The bus is ambushed by Christian nationalists who proceed to massacre the passengers. Nawal, who is a Christian, survives by revealing a crucifix she wears, identifying her as one of them. This moment of being spared sets her on a dark path of retribution that ultimately leads to a devastating and tragic revelation years later, sealing her and her family's fate. While the act of being spared on the bus is the crucial turning point, detailed descriptions of the scene and its dialogue do not prominently feature her saying \"Thank you.\" It is the act of survival itself, in the midst of such brutality, that propels the narrative toward its tragic conclusion.\n\n<<<Incendies>>>"
