    "The thickness of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve is a measure of how singular the point is. For a curve defined over a field with a discrete valuation, the stable reduction is a simplified version of the curve over the residue field. This reduction process can result in a curve with simple singularities, known as ordinary double points or nodes.\n\nTo determine the thickness for the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}_2$), we analyze the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The behavior of these roots under the 2-adic valuation, $v_2$, where $v_2(2)=1$, determines the structure of the stable reduction.\n\nThe valuations of the roots are found using a Newton polygon. For $f(x)$, the relevant points for the Newton polygon are determined by the 2-adic valuations of its coefficients: $(5, v_2(2)) = (5,1)$, $(3, v_2(2)) = (3,1)$, and $(0, v_2(1)) = (0,0)$. The lower convex hull of these points has two segments.\n*   A segment from (0,0) to (3,1) with a slope of 1/3.\n*   A segment from (3,1) to (5,1) with a slope of 0.\n\nThe valuations of the roots are the negatives of the slopes of the Newton polygon. This implies there are three roots with a valuation of -1/3 and two roots with a valuation of 0.\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of the roots of its defining polynomial based on their valuations. In this case, the roots partition into two clusters:\n*   Cluster A: Two roots with valuation 0.\n*   Cluster B: Three roots with valuation -1/3.\n\nThe stable reduction will have two components, one for each cluster, that intersect at a double point. The component corresponding to Cluster A is a rational curve (genus 0), while the component for Cluster B is an elliptic curve (genus 1).\n\nThe thickness of the double point is related to the valuations of the differences between roots from different clusters. A simplified model of the singularity at the double point is given by an equation of the form $uv=2^m$, where the integer or rational number *m* is the thickness. Based on the analysis of the root clusters and their valuations, the thickness is determined to be 2/3.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
