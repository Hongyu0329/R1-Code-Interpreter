    "### Without Viking Influence, \"Sister\" Would Likely Be \"Suster\" in Modern English\n\nHad the Norse never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely be \"suster,\" rhyming with \"muster\" or \"duster.\" This is based on the phonological evolution of the original Old English word without the influence of Old Norse.\n\nThe story of the word \"sister\" is a tale of two closely related Germanic languages intersecting. The native Old English term for a female sibling was *sweostor* or, in some dialects, *swuster*. These words were the direct ancestors of the term used by the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Norse settlers and their language, Old Norse, introduced the cognate term *systir*. The interaction and eventual fusion of Old English and Old Norse led to a blending of these two forms. The Middle English period saw the prevalence of the form *suster*, which was a natural phonetic smoothing of the Old English *sweostor*. But the Old Norse *systir* also exerted its influence, and it is from this Scandinavian form that the Modern English \"sister\" gets its \"i\" vowel. This \"i\" vowel eventually replaced the \"u\" in *suster*.\n\nIf we remove the Norse influence from this historical linguistic equation, the word would have followed a more direct evolutionary path from Old English. The Old English *sweostor* evolved into the Middle English *suster*. From there, the short 'u' sound in *suster* (pronounced similarly to the 'u' in \"put\") would have most likely undergone the same sound change as other words with a similar structure. During the development of Modern English, the Middle English short 'u' typically became the /ʌ/ sound, as heard in words like \"sun\" (from Old English *sunne*) and \"cut\".\n\nThis phonological pattern is also evident in words that rhyme with the hypothetical \"suster,\" such as \"muster\" and \"duster,\" which also feature the /ʌ/ sound. Therefore, without the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the Old English *sweostor* would have naturally evolved into the Modern English \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
