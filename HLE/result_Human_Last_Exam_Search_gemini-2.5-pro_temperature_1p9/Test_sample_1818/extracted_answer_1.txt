The optimal configuration that the network server should assign is the lowest Spreading Factor (starting with SF7) and the minimum Transmit Power (starting from 2 dBm) that can achieve a Packet Error Rate (PER) not exceeding 1%. The server will prioritize reducing the SF over reducing the transmit power due to the dominant effect of Time on Air on energy consumption.
