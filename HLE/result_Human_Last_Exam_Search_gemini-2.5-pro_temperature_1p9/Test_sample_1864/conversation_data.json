    "Preparing for a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five channels and streptavidin beads requires a comprehensive set of controls to ensure data accuracy and proper gating. You should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples for your experiment.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the necessary controls:\n\n### Essential Controls for a Five-Color Experiment:\n\n*   **1. Unstained Cells:** This sample contains only your cells without any dyes or antibodies. It is fundamental for determining the baseline level of autofluorescence from your cells and for setting the initial voltages on the cytometer.\n\n*   **2. Viability Dye Control:** You should include a control with cells stained only with a viability dye. This allows you to distinguish between live and dead cells. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies, leading to false-positive results, so they must be excluded from your analysis. There are various types of viability dyes, some of which are fixable, allowing for fixation and permeabilization after staining.\n\n*   **3. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 samples):** For a multicolor experiment, you must prepare a separate control for each fluorophore in your panel. These single-color controls are used to create a compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between different fluorophores. In your case, this means one control for each of the following:\n    *   AF350\n    *   GFP\n    *   PE\n    *   AF647\n    *   AF750\n\n*   **4. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are crucial for accurately setting your gates, especially when populations are not clearly separated or have low expression levels. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel except for one. This allows you to see the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the one that is missing, providing a precise negative control for gating. For a five-color panel, you will need five FMO controls.\n\n### Specific Controls for Streptavidin Bead-Based Sorting:\n\n*   **5. Streptavidin Beads Alone Control:** You should have a control sample of cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin beads alone, without any biotinylated antibody. This is to assess the level of non-specific binding of the streptavidin beads to your cells.\n\nIn total, these essential controls amount to **13 individual tubes**: 1 (unstained) + 1 (viability) + 5 (single-stain) + 5 (FMO) + 1 (streptavidin beads alone).\n\n### Other Recommended Controls to Consider:\n\n*   **Biological Controls:** These are essential for interpreting the biological significance of your results. They can include:\n    *   A known positive control sample (cells that are known to express the target antigen).\n    *   A known negative control sample (cells that do not express the target antigen).\n\n*   **Isotype Controls:** While their use can be debated, isotype controls can be helpful in some situations to assess non-specific antibody binding due to Fc receptor interactions. An isotype control is an antibody of the same immunoglobulin class and subclass, and with the same fluorophore conjugate, as your primary antibody but is raised against an antigen not present on your cells. If you choose to use them, you would need an isotype control for each of your primary antibodies.\n\nBy preparing these controls, you can be confident in the quality and accuracy of your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n<<<13>>>"
