    "### Rank of the Néron-Severi Group of the 15th Symmetric Power of a Genus 3 Riemann Surface\n\nLet C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. The Néron-Severi group, NS(X), is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted by $\\rho(X)$, is also known as the Picard number of X. This analysis will determine the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(X)$.\n\n#### Relating the Néron-Severi Rank of Symmetric Powers and Jacobians\n\nA crucial result in the study of algebraic curves connects the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve to the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety. For a smooth projective curve C of genus $g \\ge 2$ and its d-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$, there exists an isomorphism of groups:\n\n$NS(C^{(d)}) \\cong NS(J(C)) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nfor any integer $d \\ge g$.\n\nIn this problem, the curve C has genus $g=3$, and we are considering its 15th symmetric power, so $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, this formula is applicable. The formula implies that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is given by:\n\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(\\text{Sym}^{15}(C)) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n\nwhere $J(C)$ is the Jacobian variety of C, a 3-dimensional abelian variety. Therefore, to find the range of $\\rho(X)$, we must determine the possible range for $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve.\n\n#### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian, $\\rho(J(C))$, depends on the properties of the curve C. For a \"very general\" curve C of genus g, its Jacobian J(C) has the minimum possible number of endomorphisms (the ring of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$). In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank is 1. A \"very general\" curve is one whose isomorphism class lies outside a countable union of proper subvarieties in the moduli space of curves. Thus, there exist genus 3 curves for which $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nFor such a curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its 15th symmetric power is:\n\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank is 2.\n\n#### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}$, which is equal to $g^2$. For the Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus 3 curve, this upper bound is $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. This maximum rank is achieved for curves whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM).\n\nAn example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian attains this maximum rank is the Klein quartic, defined by the equation $x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$. The Jacobian of the Klein quartic is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of a specific elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For an abelian variety that is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the rank of its Néron-Severi group is $g^2$. Thus, for the Jacobian of the Klein quartic, $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nThis confirms that the maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is 9. Using our formula, we can find the largest possible rank for NS(X):\n\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nIn conclusion, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
