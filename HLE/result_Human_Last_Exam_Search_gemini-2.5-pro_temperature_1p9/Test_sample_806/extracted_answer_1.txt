The initial biochemical event is the binding of the causative antiepileptic drug (or its metabolite) to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule, most notably within the HLA-B allele. This interaction creates a novel antigenic complex that is recognized by T-cell receptors, leading to the activation and clonal proliferation of drug-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. These activated T-cells then release a cascade of cytotoxic mediators, including granulysin, perforin/granzyme B, and Fas-ligand, which induce widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes, resulting in the separation of the epidermis from the dermis and the formation of skin blisters.
