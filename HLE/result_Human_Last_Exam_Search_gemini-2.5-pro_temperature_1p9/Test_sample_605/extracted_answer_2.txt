The Crawley-Nordstr√∂m invariant cannot be calculated for the given polynomial, as it is not weighted-homogeneous. The term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of 224, while the other terms have a weighted degree of 225, which makes the equation inconsistent for defining a hypersurface in the specified weighted projective space.
