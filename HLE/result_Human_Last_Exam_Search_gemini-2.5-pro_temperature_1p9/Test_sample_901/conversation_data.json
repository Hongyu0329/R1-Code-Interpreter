    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol results in the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nThis reaction is an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how this product is formed:\n*   **Reagents**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a trans-disubstituted cyclohexane. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), is a strong, sterically bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 elimination mechanism.\n*   **Stereochemical Requirement**: A crucial requirement for E2 reactions in cyclohexane rings is that the leaving group (in this case, the bromine atom) and the hydrogen atom being removed must be in a *trans-diaxial* position. This means both atoms must be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, oriented in opposite directions.\n*   **Conformational Analysis**: For (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the bromine and methyl groups are trans to each other. This molecule can exist in two chair conformations:\n    1.  A more stable conformation with both the bulky bromine and methyl groups in equatorial positions.\n    2.  A less stable conformation where both groups are in axial positions.\n*   **Reaction Pathway**: The E2 reaction cannot proceed from the more stable diequatorial conformation because the axial bromine required for elimination is not present. The molecule must first flip into its less stable diaxial conformation to meet the trans-diaxial requirement for the E2 reaction.\n*   **Identifying the Removable Hydrogen**: In the trans-diaxial conformation, the bromine is on carbon 1 in an axial position. We must look for an axial hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n    *   On carbon 2, the methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on carbon 2 is equatorial. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it cannot be eliminated. Therefore, the more substituted alkene (1-methylcyclohexene, the Zaitsev product) cannot be formed.\n    *   On carbon 6, there is a hydrogen atom in the axial position that is trans to the axial bromine. This hydrogen can be removed by the tert-butoxide base.\n*   **Product Formation**: Elimination of the axial hydrogen from C6 and the axial bromine from C1 leads to the formation of a double bond between these two carbons. The resulting product is 3-methylcyclohexene. This is considered the Hofmann product (the less substituted alkene), which is formed not primarily due to the bulky base, but because of the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 mechanism in this specific stereoisomer.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
