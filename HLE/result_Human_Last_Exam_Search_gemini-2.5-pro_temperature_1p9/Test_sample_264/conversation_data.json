    "The volume of the intersection of two cubes, each with a side length of 1, that are shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other is 1/8.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at this solution:\n\n**1. Defining the Cubes and the Shift**\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be aligned with the coordinate axes, occupying the space where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. This cube has a side length of 1.\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). A shift \"along the main diagonal\" implies a displacement in the direction of the vector (1, 1, 1).\n\nA shift of 1/2 along this diagonal means the second cube, C2, is displaced by a vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, the coordinates of the second cube will be in the range 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2. This simplifies to the region where 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.5, 0.5 ≤ y ≤ 1.5, and 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1.5.\n\n**2. Finding the Intersection Volume**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space where the conditions for both cubes are met simultaneously. To find this, we can find the intersection of the coordinate ranges for each axis independently.\n\n*   **For the x-axis:** The first cube is in the range and the second is in [0.5, 1.5]. The intersection of these two intervals is [0.5, 1], which has a length of 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n*   **For the y-axis:** Similarly, the intersection of and [0.5, 1.5] is [0.5, 1], with a length of 0.5.\n*   **For the z-axis:** Again, the intersection of and [0.5, 1.5] is [0.5, 1], with a length of 0.5.\n\nThe resulting intersection is a smaller cube defined by the ranges 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0.5 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1. This method of finding the intersection of axis-aligned bounding boxes is a standard approach in geometry and computer graphics.\n\n**3. Calculating the Volume**\n\nThe side length of this intersection cube is 0.5 for each dimension. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing its side length.\n\nVolume = (side length)³ = (0.5)³ = 0.125\n\nIn fractional form, this is (1/2)³ = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
