An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The primary conditions for the existence of such a point are established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces and generally require:
1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The metric spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete.
2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must adhere to a specific mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orders on X, Y, and Z. This means each function must be monotone (either non-decreasing or non-increasing) in each of its arguments in a way that preserves the order in iterative sequences.
3.  **Contractive Condition:** There must be a contractive inequality that involves the metrics of the spaces. Specifically, for all comparable elements, the sum of the distances between the function outputs, d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d_Y(G(y,x,y), G(v,u,v)) + d_Z(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)), must be less than or equal to a weighted sum of the distances between the inputs, k₁d_X(x,u) + k₂d_Y(y,v) + k₃d_Z(z,w), where the non-negative constants k₁, k₂, k₃ sum to less than 1.
4.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies an order relation with the output of the functions at that point, such as x₀ ≤ F(x₀,y₀,z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀,x₀,y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀,y₀,x₀).

Additional conditions regarding the continuity of the functions or the regularity of the ordered spaces may also be required, especially to ensure uniqueness of the fixed point.
