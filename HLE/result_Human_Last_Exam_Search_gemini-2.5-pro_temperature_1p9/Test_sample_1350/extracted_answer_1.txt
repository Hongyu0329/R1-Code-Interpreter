In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, while a former thrall of the House of the Gael is identified as having been in a Roman city and learned of their customs, there is no evidence within the text of this character, or any other, describing Roman religious practices in a manner that alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus.
