    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a former thrall from the House of the Gael who has been to a Roman settlement and speaks of their customs. However, a detailed analysis of the text and extensive searches have not revealed any passage where this character, or any other, describes Roman religious practices in a way that alludes to the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe narrative does contain a man of the House of the Gael who was captured in battle by the Romans and lived as a slave in one of their cities, where he learned about their ways. He shares his knowledge of their social structure, noting that thralls are treated poorly and that there is great social stratification.\n\nWhile the story features a prominent conflict between the Germanic Goths, known as the Wolfings, and the Romans, and the Wolfings themselves bear a wolf on their banner, there is no direct or recognizable allusion by any character to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf. Searches for descriptions of Roman gods, religious rituals, or any mention of twins raised by a wolf within the novel's text have not yielded any results.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, no character in *The House of the Wolfings* describes Roman religious practices in a way that directly or indirectly references Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, while a former thrall of the House of the Gael is identified as having been in a Roman city and learned of their customs, there is no evidence within the text of this character, or any other, describing Roman religious practices in a manner that alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus.>>>"
