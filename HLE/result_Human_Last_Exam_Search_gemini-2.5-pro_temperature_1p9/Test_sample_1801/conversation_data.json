    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Jagdish Bhagwati.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969, is clearly identified in multiple sources as having appeared in the advertisement. The second individual was the Indian-American economist Jagdish Bhagwati, a prominent figure in international trade theory and a professor at Columbia University. While not a Nobel laureate at the time of the commercial, his work in economics has been widely recognized as Nobel-caliber. The \"Ask Why\" campaign was part of Enron's aggressive marketing strategy to portray itself as an innovative and forward-thinking company.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Jagdish Bhagwati>>>"
