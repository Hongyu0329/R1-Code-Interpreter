    "The line is best scanned as a Trochaic Septenarius, which is a common meter in Roman Comedy and consists of seven trochaic feet (L S). This meter allows for frequent substitutions, which are present in this line. The elision of the final \"-e\" in \"bene\" with the initial \"e-\" of \"esse\" results in 14 syllables, which fits the structure of a septenarius.\n\nHere is the breakdown by syllable quantity:\n\n**et(S) ti(S) bi(S) be(S) | nes(L) se(S) | so(L) li(L) | quom(L) si(S) | bi(S) sit(L) | ma(L) le(S)**\n\nThe division into feet, showing the substitutions, is as follows:\n\n*   **Foot 1:** S S S S (Proceleusmatic, substituting for a Trochee)\n*   **Foot 2:** L S (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 3:** L L (Spondee, substituting for a Trochee)\n*   **Foot 4:** L S (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 5:** S L (Iamb, substituting for a Trochee)\n*   **Foot 6:** L S (Trochee)\n*   The final two syllables do not form a standard foot in this analysis, highlighting the metrical complexity of Terentian verse.\n\nGiven the complexities and variations common in this style of poetry, the most direct representation of the scansion is:\n\n<<<S S S S L S L L L S S L L S>>>"
