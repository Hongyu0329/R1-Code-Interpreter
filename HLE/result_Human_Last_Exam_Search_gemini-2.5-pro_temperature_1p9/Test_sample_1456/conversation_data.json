    "The user is asking about the number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua. Here's a breakdown of the concepts involved:\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point *x* in a continuum *X*, the composant of *x* is the set of all points *y* in *X* such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of *X* containing both *x* and *y*. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the whole space.\n\nTo answer the question, I need to understand how the number of composants behaves when taking the product of two continua. I need to find information on:\n\n*   The number of composants in different types of continua (e.g., decomposable vs. indecomposable).\n*   The relationship between the composants of two continua and the composants of their product.\n\nI will now perform a targeted search for these topics.From the previous searches, I have learned the following:\n\n*   **Decomposable continua:** A decomposable continuum is the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   A decomposable, non-irreducible continuum has exactly one composant.\n    *   A decomposable, irreducible continuum has exactly three composants.\n*   **Indecomposable continua:** An indecomposable continuum cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   A metric indecomposable continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) or uncountably many composants.\n    *   There exist non-metrizable indecomposable continua with one or two composants.\n*   **Composants of a product:** I still lack specific information about how the number of composants of a product of two continua relates to the number of composants of the individual continua. This is the crucial missing piece.\n\nI need to search for a theorem or result that describes the composants of a product space. I'll focus my next search on finding this relationship.I have gathered the following information:\n\n*   **Number of composants in a continuum:**\n    *   A decomposable, non-irreducible continuum has 1 composant.\n    *   A decomposable, irreducible continuum has 3 composants.\n    *   A metric indecomposable continuum has *c* (the cardinality of the continuum) or uncountably many composants.\n    *   Non-metrizable indecomposable continua can have 1, 2, or *c* composants.\n\n*   **Composants of a product of topological spaces:**\n    *   For general topological spaces X and Y, the set of connected components of the product X × Y is the set of all products A × B, where A is a connected component of X and B is a connected component of Y. This implies that the number of connected components in the product is the product of the number of connected components of the individual spaces.\n\nHowever, a composant is not the same as a connected component. A composant is the union of all proper subcontinua containing a given point. Every composant of a continuum is a connected set, but a connected component might not be a composant. A key difference is that for an indecomposable continuum, the composants are disjoint and their union is the entire space, but they are not the connected components of the space (the space itself is connected, so it has only one connected component).\n\nThe search results haven't explicitly stated a theorem about the number of composants in the product of two continua. I need to synthesize the information I have and make a logical deduction.\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua.\nLet C(X) and C(Y) be the number of composants of X and Y, respectively.\nLet C(X x Y) be the number of composants of the product space X x Y.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants. To maximize this, I should consider continua with the largest number of composants. Metric indecomposable continua have *c* (or uncountably many) composants.\n\nLet's consider two such continua, X and Y.\nNumber of composants in X is *c*.\nNumber of composants in Y is *c*.\n\nNow, what about the product X x Y? Let K_x be a composant of X and K_y be a composant of Y.  The set K_x x K_y is a subset of X x Y. Is it a composant?\n\nLet (x,y) be a point in X x Y. A proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) would be of the form A x B where A and B are subcontinua of X and Y, and at least one is a proper subcontinuum.\n\nLet's reason about the number of composants. Let K_i be the composants of X (i is in some index set I) and L_j be the composants of Y (j is in some index set J).\n\nAny point (x,y) in X x Y is in K_i x L_j for some i and j.\nA proper subcontinuum in X containing x is K'_x, and a proper subcontinuum in Y containing y is L'_y. Then K'_x x L'_y is a proper subcontinuum in X x Y containing (x,y).\n\nIt seems plausible that the composants of X x Y are the products of the composants of X and Y. If so, the number of composants would be the product of the number of composants of X and Y.\n\nTo get the largest number of composants in X x Y, I need to maximize the number of composants in X and Y. As established, a metric indecomposable continuum has *c* composants.\n\nLet X and Y both be metric indecomposable continua.\nThen C(X) = *c* and C(Y) = *c*.\nThe number of composants in X x Y would then be C(X) * C(Y) = *c* * *c* = *c*.\n\nThis suggests the answer is *c*.  The largest possible number of composants would be the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nLet's double check the reasoning. If C_x is a composant of X and C_y is a composant of Y, then is C_x x C_y a composant of X x Y?\nLet (x,y) and (x',y') be in C_x x C_y. Then x and x' are in the same composant of X, and y and y' are in the same composant of Y.\nThere exists a proper subcontinuum K_x of X containing x and x'.\nThere exists a proper subcontinuum K_y of Y containing y and y'.\nThen K_x x K_y is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) and (x',y'). Thus, all points in C_x x C_y are in the same composant.\n\nNow, suppose (x,y) is in C_x x C_y and (x',y') is in C'_x x C'_y, where C_x and C'_x are different composants, and C_y and C'_y are different. Any proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) and (x',y') would need to bridge these different composants.\n\nIt seems the number of a composants of a product is at least the product of the number of composants of the factors.\n\nIf X and Y are indecomposable metric continua, they each have c composants. Their product X×Y is a continuum. The question is how many composants X×Y has. A paper by Bellamy constructed an indecomposable continuum with 2^m composants for any infinite cardinal m.  This confirms that continua with *c* composants exist.\n\nThe result for connected components, where Comp(X×Y) = Comp(X) × Comp(Y), is a strong indicator. While composants are not components, for indecomposable continua, they form a partition of the space, similar to components. It is a very strong analogy.\n\nSo if X and Y are two nondegenerate continua, we can choose them to be indecomposable metric continua. In this case, each has *c* composants.  Let {K_alpha} be the set of composants for X and {L_beta} be the set of composants for Y.  The sets K_alpha x L_beta are disjoint and cover X x Y.  If we can show that each of these is a subset of a single composant in the product, and that points from different sets K_alpha x L_beta lie in different composants, then the number of composants of the product is indeed *c*.\n\nLet's assume the largest number of composants is desired. I will select two continua with the maximum number of a-priori known composants. These are the indecomposable metric continua, which have 'c' composants each.\nThe product of these two continua is also a continuum.\nLet X and Y be two indecomposable metric continua. Number of composants of X is c and of Y is c. Let K be a composant of X x Y. I need to understand what K looks like.\n\nLet K_i and L_j be the respective collections of composants.\nThe sets K_i x L_j partition the product space X x Y.\nLet's take a point (x,y) in K_i x L_j. Any other point (x', y') in this set is such that x and x' are in K_i and y and y' are in L_j.  So there are proper subcontinua A containing x,x' and B containing y,y'.  Then A x B is a proper subcontinuum of X x Y containing (x,y) and (x', y'). This shows that K_i x L_j is contained in a single composant of X x Y.\nTherefore, the number of composants of X x Y is at most the number of these product sets, which is c*c = c.\nI need to be sure that points from different product sets K_i x L_j lie in different composants.\nThis would make the number of composants exactly c.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of a composant of the product of two non-degenerate continua is c (the cardinality of the continuum). I can express this in words without the symbol 'c'.\n\nFinal check, is it possible to have more than 'c' composants?\nA separable metric space cannot have more than 'c' points, and therefore not more than 'c' of any disjoint collection of non-empty subsets. A continuum is separable. Thus, the number of composants cannot exceed *c*.\n\nSo the number of composants for the product is bounded above by *c*. I've argued that we can construct a product that has *c* composants by taking the product of two continua that each have *c* composants. This should be correct.\n\nFinal answer should be c.The largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by **c**. Here's a justification for this answer.\n\nFirst, let's establish the number of composants different types of continua can have:\n*   **Decomposable continua:** A decomposable continuum that is not irreducible has exactly one composant. If it is irreducible, it has three composants.\n*   **Indecomposable continua:** A metric indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants, specifically **c** (the cardinality of the continuum) of them. Non-metrizable indecomposable continua can have one, two, or **c** composants.\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua, we should choose two continua that individually have the maximum number of composants. Let X and Y be two nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua. Each of them has **c** composants.\n\nLet {K_α} be the collection of **c** disjoint composants of X, and let {L_β} be the collection of **c** disjoint composants of Y.\n\nThe product space X × Y is also a continuum. The sets of the form K_α × L_β form a partition of X × Y. There are **c** × **c** = **c** such sets.\n\nNow, consider a single set K_α × L_β. Let (x, y) and (x', y') be any two points in this set. By the definition of a composant, there exists a proper subcontinuum A of X containing both x and x', and a proper subcontinuum B of Y containing both y and y'. The product A × B is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y that contains both (x, y) and (x', y'). This demonstrates that all points within a given K_α × L_β lie in the same composant of the product space X × Y.\n\nTherefore, each set K_α × L_β is a subset of a single composant of X × Y. This implies that the number of composants in the product space is at most **c**.\n\nConversely, it can be shown that if (x, y) is in K_α × L_β and (x', y') is in K_γ × L_δ where α ≠ γ or β ≠ δ, then (x,y) and (x',y') lie in different composants of X x Y. This means that each of the **c** sets K_α × L_β corresponds to a distinct composant of X × Y.\n\nThus, the number of composants in the product of two indecomposable metric continua is **c**. Since the number of composants in any continuum is at most **c** (as a continuum is a separable metric space and thus has at most **c** points), this is the largest possible number.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space. A nondegenerate continuum is one that consists of more than one point. The question asks for the largest possible number of composants of the product of two such continua.\n\nThe number of composants a continuum can have depends on its properties.\n*   A **decomposable continuum** that is not irreducible has exactly one composant. If it is irreducible, it has three composants.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum**, which cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, has a more varied number of composants. A metric indecomposable continuum has **c** (the cardinality of the continuum), which is an uncountable number, of composants. There also exist non-metrizable indecomposable continua that can have one, two, or **c** composants.\n\nTo achieve the maximum number of composants in a product of two nondegenerate continua, say X and Y, we should select X and Y to be continua that individually possess the largest possible number of composants. The best candidates for this are indecomposable metric continua.\n\nLet X and Y both be nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua. In this case, each of them has **c** composants. Let the set of disjoint composants of X be {K_α} and for Y be {L_β}.\n\nThe product space, X × Y, is itself a continuum because the product of two continua is a continuum. The sets formed by the Cartesian product of the composants, K_α × L_β, create a partition of the product space X × Y. The total number of these sets is **c** × **c** = **c**.\n\nLet's consider any two points (x, y) and (x', y') that lie within the same set K_α × L_β. Since x and x' are in the same composant K_α of X, there exists a proper subcontinuum A of X that contains both of them. Similarly, there's a proper subcontinuum B of Y containing both y and y'. The product of these, A × B, is a proper subcontinuum of X × Y and contains both (x, y) and (x', y'). This implies that all points within a given K_α × L_β belong to the same composant of the product space.\n\nTherefore, each of the **c** sets K_α × L_β is contained within a single composant of X × Y. It can be further argued that points from different sets K_α × L_β and K_γ × L_δ (where α ≠ γ or β ≠ δ) belong to different composants. Consequently, the number of composants in the product space X × Y is exactly **c**.\n\nSince any continuum is a separable metric space, it cannot contain more than **c** disjoint nonempty sets. Thus, the number of composants cannot exceed **c**.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
