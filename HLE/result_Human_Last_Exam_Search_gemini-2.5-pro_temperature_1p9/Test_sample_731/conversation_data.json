    "A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, we must count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_512 has the presentation:\n`SD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>`\n\nThe elements of this group are of two forms: `r^i` for `0 <= i < 256`, and `sr^i` for `0 <= i < 256`. We can find the cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each of these types of elements.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `r^i`:**\n    These elements form a cyclic subgroup of order 256, denoted as `<r>`. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group of order `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`. For the subgroup `<r>` of order 256, we need to find the number of divisors of 256. Since `256 = 2^8`, the divisors are `2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8`. Thus, there are `8 + 1 = 9` cyclic subgroups contained within `<r>`.\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `sr^i`:**\n    We must analyze the order of these elements, which depends on whether the exponent `i` is even or odd.\n    *   **When `i` is even:** Let `i = 2k`. The order of the element `sr^(2k)` is 2. There are 128 even integers from 0 to 255. Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. These are not contained in the subgroup `<r>`, so they are new subgroups.\n    *   **When `i` is odd:** The order of the element `sr^i` is 4. There are 128 odd integers from 0 to 255. The subgroups generated by these elements are of the form `{1, sr^i, r^128, sr^(i+128)}`. An element `sr^j` will generate the same subgroup as `sr^i` if `j` is congruent to `i + 128` modulo 256. This means that the 128 elements of order 4 form `128 / 2 = 64` distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. These are also not contained in the subgroup `<r>`.\n\nCombining these counts, the total number of power subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from each category:\nTotal number of subgroups = (subgroups from `<r>`) + (subgroups from `sr^i` with `i` even) + (subgroups from `sr^i` with `i` odd)\nTotal = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201\n\nThus, there are 201 power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n<<<201>>>"
