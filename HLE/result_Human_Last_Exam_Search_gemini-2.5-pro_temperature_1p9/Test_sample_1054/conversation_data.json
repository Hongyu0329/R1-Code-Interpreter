    "An aortomesenteric diameter of less than or equal to 8 mm will be greater than 60% sensitive and greater than 80% specific for identifying Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) syndrome.\n\nStudies have shown that a cutoff value for the aortomesenteric distance of <8 mm is a strong indicator for SMA syndrome, with a reported sensitivity and specificity of 100% for both. The normal aortomesenteric distance is typically in the range of 10 mm to 34 mm.\n\nFor the diagnosis of SMA syndrome, various sources confirm the following:\n*   An aortomesenteric distance of less than 8 mm is considered a key diagnostic criterion.\n*   Values for this distance in patients with SMA syndrome generally fall between 2 mm and 8 mm.\n*   One study specifies that a cutoff of â‰¤8 mm has a 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.\n\nThere was no information found regarding \"EVP enhancement\" in relation to aortomesenteric diameter. The data strongly supports the use of this measurement in the diagnosis of SMA syndrome.\n\n<<<8 mm>>>"
