    "When a single-dose container ampule is punctured or opened in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately. There is no permissible storage time, and therefore, no Beyond-Use Date (BUD) applies.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n*   **Immediate Use:** Once an ampule is opened, its contents are exposed to the environment and are at risk of contamination. Unlike vials with a rubber stopper that can be resealed, an ampule cannot be closed again. Therefore, any unused portion of the medication must be discarded immediately after the initial use.\n\n*   **Environmental Factors:** The requirement for immediate use applies regardless of the air quality in which the ampule is opened, including in an ISO 5 environment.\n\n*   **Distinction from Vials:** This rule is specific to ampules. Single-dose *vials* have different guidelines. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an ISO Class 5 or better environment, it can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, as long as storage requirements are met. However, if opened in an environment with air quality less than ISO Class 5, the BUD for a single-dose vial is reduced to one hour.\n\nIn summary, for a single-dose ampule, the BUD from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate use, with no storage allowed.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule must be used immediately after being opened in a sterile environment. No storage is permitted, and therefore a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) does not apply. Any remaining contents must be discarded.>>>"
