    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed through a functional integral. This formulation is set in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate `t` is replaced by an imaginary time `τ = it`, which is periodic with a period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function `Z` is given by:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action of the scalar field. The action is an integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` over the Euclidean spacetime volume (a cylinder with circumference `β` in the time direction and infinite spatial volume).\n\nThe Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m` is quadratic in the field and has the form:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ [ (∂_τϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]`\n\nThis quadratic form defines an inner product. The expression `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the context of the functional integral represents this quadratic part of the action. The operator `D` is a differential operator acting on the field `ϕ`.\n\nBy integrating the kinetic term `(∇ϕ)²` by parts and assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity, we can identify the operator `D`. The kinetic part of the action becomes `∫ d⁴x_E ϕ (-∇²ϕ)`, where `d⁴x_E = d³x dτ`. The full quadratic part of the Lagrangian density can thus be written as `(1/2) ϕ (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ`.\n\nTherefore, the operator `D` is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\n\n`D = -∂_μ∂_μ + m² = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is then given by the integral of `ϕ(x)` multiplied by `D` acting on `ϕ(x)` over the Euclidean spacetime:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x) D ϕ(x) = ∫ d³x ∫₀^β dτ ϕ(x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(x)`\n\nIt's this inner product (multiplied by 1/2) that appears in the exponential of the functional integral for the partition function of a non-interacting neutral scalar field.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` that appears in the quadratic part of the Euclidean action in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x) [-∂_μ∂_μ + m²] ϕ(x)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `x = (τ, **x**)`, with `τ` being the imaginary time coordinate and `**x**` the spatial coordinates.\n*   The integration is over Euclidean spacetime: `∫ d⁴x_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³**x**`, where `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `ϕ(x)` is the neutral scalar field.\n*   `-∂_μ∂_μ = -∂_τ² - ∇²` is the Laplacian in four-dimensional Euclidean space.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n\nThus, the operator `D_ϕ` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, `D = -∂_μ∂_μ + m²`.>>>"
