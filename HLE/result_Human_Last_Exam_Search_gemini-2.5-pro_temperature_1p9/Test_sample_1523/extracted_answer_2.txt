In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` that appears in the quadratic part of the Euclidean action in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x) [-∂_μ∂_μ + m²] ϕ(x)`

where:
*   `x = (τ, **x**)`, with `τ` being the imaginary time coordinate and `**x**` the spatial coordinates.
*   The integration is over Euclidean spacetime: `∫ d⁴x_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³**x**`, where `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `ϕ(x)` is the neutral scalar field.
*   `-∂_μ∂_μ = -∂_τ² - ∇²` is the Laplacian in four-dimensional Euclidean space.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.

Thus, the operator `D_ϕ` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, `D = -∂_μ∂_μ + m²`.
