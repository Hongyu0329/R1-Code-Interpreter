    "I have started by gathering information about connected metric spaces and dense open subsets. The search results confirm some basic properties. A key finding is that an infinite separable connected metric space has a cardinality of 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>. I also found that in a metric space, a dense open set is a set that is both dense and open, and that a space with a countable dense subset is called separable. The condition that each point in the dense open subset U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to ℝ makes U a 1-manifold. I need to investigate the cardinality of manifolds and how the properties of U might constrain the cardinality of the entire space X. The current information is a good starting point, but I need to delve deeper into the implications of the local homeomorphism to ℝ.I have gathered information about connected metric spaces, dense open sets, and 1-manifolds. A key piece of information is that a separable metric space has a cardinality of at most 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>. The dense open set U, being locally homeomorphic to ℝ, is a 1-manifold. Since U is a subset of the metric space X, U is also a metric space. As a 1-manifold, U is locally second-countable, and since it's a subspace of a metric space, it is metrizable, which means it is second-countable if and only if it is separable. Since U contains a countable dense subset (it is a 1-manifold that is a metric space), U is separable. As U is dense in X, a countable dense subset of U is also a countable dense subset of X. Therefore, X is separable. This implies that the cardinality of X is at most 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>. It is also at least 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup> since it contains a subset homeomorphic to an open interval of ℝ. Thus, the cardinality of X is exactly 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>. I now have a clear path to the solution. I will formulate the final answer based on this chain of reasoning.\n\nYes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The cardinality of $X$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this bound:\n\n1.  **The dense open subset $U$ is a 1-manifold.**\n    The defining property of a 1-manifold is that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^1$. The problem states that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $U$ is a 1-manifold.\n\n2.  **As a metric space, the 1-manifold $U$ is separable.**\n    Since $X$ is a metric space, its subset $U$ is also a metric space. A metric space is separable if and only if it is second-countable. Any manifold is locally second-countable. For a metric space, being locally second-countable implies being second-countable. Therefore, $U$ is a second-countable metric space, which in turn implies that $U$ is separable. This means that $U$ contains a countable dense subset, let's call it $D$.\n\n3.  **The space $X$ is separable.**\n    We are given that $U$ is a dense open subset of $X$. Since $D$ is a dense subset of $U$, and $U$ is a dense subset of $X$, it follows that $D$ is a dense subset of $X$. Because $D$ is countable, we have shown that $X$ contains a countable dense subset. Therefore, $X$ is a separable metric space.\n\n4.  **A separable metric space has cardinality at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.**\n    A separable metric space cannot have a cardinality greater than that of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$). This is a standard result in topology. One way to see this is to consider a countable dense subset $A$. To each point $x$ in the space, we can associate the set of all open balls with rational radii centered at points in $A$ that contain $x$. This defines an injective map from the space into the power set of a countable set, which has cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n5.  **The space $X$ has cardinality at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$.**\n    Since $U$ is a non-empty open subset of a connected metric space with more than one point, $U$ must be uncountable. In fact, since every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, $U$ contains a subset that is homeomorphic to an open interval of the real line. The real numbers have cardinality $2^{\\aleph_0}$, and so must any open interval within them. Since $U$ is a subset of $X$, the cardinality of $X$ must be at least the cardinality of this subset, which is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nCombining these points, we conclude that the cardinality of $X$ is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<There is an upper bound on the cardinality of X. The cardinality of X is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
