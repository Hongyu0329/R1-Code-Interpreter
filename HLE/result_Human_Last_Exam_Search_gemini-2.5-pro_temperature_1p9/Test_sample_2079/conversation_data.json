    "I am unable to identify the specific individual who held the position of judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nHistorical records confirm that the town of Bártfa had a system of governance that included a town council, a judge, and lay judges during the 15th century. Documents from the 1460s make explicit reference to these officials. For instance, a letter from 1465 was addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa.\"\n\nDetailed information for this specific year is likely contained within the city archives of Bardejov, particularly in the collection titled \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára 1319–1526\" compiled by Béla Iványi. However, a review of the currently available digitized portions of this and other relevant documents does not yield the name of the judge for the year 1461.\n\n<<<I was unable to find the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461.>>>"
