The Poynting vector is given by the expression:
$$ \vec{S} = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4 \epsilon_0} \hat{z} $$
Where:
*   $E$ is the magnitude of the uniform external electric field.
*   $\rho$ is the uniform volume charge density of the rod.
*   $v$ is the speed of the rod.
*   $r$ is the radial distance from the axis of the rod.
*   $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
*   $\hat{r}$ is the unit vector in the radial direction.
*   $\hat{z}$ is the unit vector along the axis of the rod.
