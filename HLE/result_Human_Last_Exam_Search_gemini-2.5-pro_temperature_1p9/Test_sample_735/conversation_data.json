    "A total of 13 finite groups possess maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. These groups have been fully classified.\n\nIn 2015, Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah Hart proved that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. This proof confirmed a conjecture by Giudici and Hart and completed the classification of such groups.\n\nThe complete list of these groups is provided in a table within their paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\". The groups are as follows:\n\n*   **Cyclic groups:** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂\n*   **Dihedral groups:** D₆, D₈, D₁₀\n*   **Other non-abelian groups:** A₄ (Alternating group on 4 elements), Q₈ (Quaternion group), and the dicyclic group of order 12 (denoted as Dic₃ or Q₁₂).\n\nTherefore, there are 13 distinct finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<13>>>"
