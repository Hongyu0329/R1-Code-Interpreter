    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that primarily feed on small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. Several sources also indicate that adults of some species supplement their diet with pollen and nectar. Pollen has been found in the digestive tracts of some snakeflies, although its necessity for their life cycle is not fully understood.\n\nBased on the provided answer choices:\n*   **A. Nectar:** This is a recorded food source for some adult snakeflies.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While snakeflies are known to eat pollen in general, there is no specific mention of them feeding on pollen from the Māhoe tree.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no evidence to suggest that snakeflies consume fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not recorded as feeding on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** Aphids are a well-documented primary food source for adult snakeflies. Given that Totara is a tree where aphids might be present, it is a highly likely food source.\n\nBoth nectar and aphids are confirmed food sources for adult Raphidiopterans. Therefore, the option combining both is the most comprehensive answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
