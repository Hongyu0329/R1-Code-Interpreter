Yes, but the characteristic energy splitting due to tunneling would not be observable. The symmetrization principle for spin-0 hydrogen nuclei (bosons) would forbid the existence of one of the two energy levels that are normally created by the tunneling effect, resulting in no observable inversion frequency.
