    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a_2`. The spectral action is constructed from the trace of a function of the squared Dirac operator, `D^2`, and its heat kernel expansion yields the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, which are local geometric invariants.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field in four dimensions coupled to a gauge field, the relevant operator is the square of the Dirac operator, `D^2`. The corresponding second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a_2`, is given by the following expression integrated over the four-dimensional manifold M:\n\n`a_2 = \\int_M d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\text{tr} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{30} \\nabla^2 R + \\frac{1}{72} R^2 - \\frac{1}{180} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{180} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right) \\mathbf{1} - \\frac{1}{12} R F_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\right]`\n\nHere:\n*   `g` is the determinant of the metric tensor `g_{\\mu\\nu}`.\n*   `R` is the Ricci scalar curvature.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu}` is the Ricci tensor.\n*   `R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Riemann curvature tensor.\n*   `\\nabla^2` is the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\n*   `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the field strength tensor of the gauge field.\n*   `\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{i}{2}[\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu]` are the generators of the Lorentz group in the spinor representation, with `\\gamma^\\mu` being the Dirac gamma matrices.\n*   **1** is the identity matrix in the spinor space.\n*   The trace `tr` is taken over the spinor indices.\n\nThis coefficient `a_2` contributes to the part of the spectral action that contains terms quadratic in curvature and the Yang-Mills action.\n\n<<<`\\int_M d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\text{tr} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{30} \\nabla^2 R + \\frac{1}{72} R^2 - \\frac{1}{180} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{180} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\right) \\mathbf{1} - \\frac{1}{12} R F_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\right]`>>>"
