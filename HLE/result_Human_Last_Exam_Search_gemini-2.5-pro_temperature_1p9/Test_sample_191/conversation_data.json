    "When the signaling of the protein CD47 is broken down or blocked, it allows for the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nCD47 is a protein found on the surface of many cells in the body. It interacts with another protein called Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRPα), which is present on the surface of macrophages. This interaction essentially sends a \"don't eat me\" signal to the macrophage, which prevents it from engulfing the cell.\n\nIn the context of amyloid, disrupting the connection between CD47 and SIRPα has been shown to enhance the ability of macrophages to clear amyloid deposits through phagocytosis (the process of engulfing cellular debris). Therefore, blocking the CD47 signaling pathway is a therapeutic strategy being explored for diseases characterized by amyloid accumulation, such as Alzheimer's disease. Research indicates that inhibiting this \"don't eat me\" signal can restore the phagocytic function of macrophages, promoting the removal of harmful amyloid aggregates.\n\nWhile other proteins are involved in the regulation of amyloid phagocytosis, the CD47-SIRPα axis is a primary inhibitory pathway that, when disrupted, facilitates this crucial clearance mechanism.\n\n<<<CD47>>>"
