    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the state n = 2, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density function is:\n|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability (P) of finding the particle in the interval from x = 0.495a to x = 0.505a is:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, where θ = 2πx/a.\nP = (2/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2)(1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\nP = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a\nP = (1/a) [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]\nP = (1/a) [ 0.01a - (a/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)) ]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π))\n\nUsing the identity sin(2π ± y) = ±sin(y), we get:\nsin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π)\nsin(1.98π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for P:\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π)(sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π)))\nP = 0.01 - (2sin(0.02π))/(4π)\nP = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)\n\nSince the interval is very small and centered around x = 0.5a, where there is a node for n=2, we can also use a Taylor expansion of the probability density around x = a/2. The probability density function |ψ₂(x)|² ≈ (8π²/a³)(x-a/2)². Integrating this approximation gives:\nP ≈ ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (8π²/a³)(x-a/2)² dx\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] u² du (where u = x - a/2)\nP ≈ (8π²/a³) [u³/3] from -0.005a to 0.005a\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nP ≈ 6.5797 x 10⁻⁶\n\nThus, the probability is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
