    "When computing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from beat-to-beat intervals captured using Photoplethysmography (PPG), the value between heartbeats is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**.\n\nWhile the gold standard for measuring HRV is electrocardiography (ECG), which measures the time between successive R-waves of the QRS complex (known as the R-R interval), PPG provides a comparable measure. In the context of PPG, this interval is sometimes more specifically referred to as the **peak-to-peak (PP) interval**, representing the time between consecutive peaks of the light-based signal.\n\nTherefore, while \"inter-beat interval (IBI)\" is the general and widely accepted term, \"peak-to-peak (PP) interval\" is the more specific technical name for the value derived from a PPG signal. It's also worth noting that when HRV is derived from PPG, it is sometimes referred to as Pulse Rate Variability (PRV).\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
