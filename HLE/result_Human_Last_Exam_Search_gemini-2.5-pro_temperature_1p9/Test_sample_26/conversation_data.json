    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We want to determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n1.  **Dimensionality and Basic Properties**: A hypersurface in a complex manifold of dimension $n$ is a submanifold of complex dimension $n-1$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ has a complex dimension of 3, the hypersurface $X$ is a complex surface with $\\text{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$. Its real dimension is $\\text{dim}_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 4$.\n\n2.  **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**: This fundamental theorem relates the topology of a complex projective manifold to its submanifolds. For a smooth hypersurface $X$ of complex dimension 2 in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < \\text{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) - 1 = 2-1 = 1$.\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group**: Applying the theorem for $k=1$, we get that $\\pi_1(X)$ is isomorphic to $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for all $n \\geq 1$, we have $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, meaning $X$ is a simply connected space. This is a general property for complete intersections of complex dimension greater than one.\n\n4.  **Homology Groups**: As $X$ is simply connected, its first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, so $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. The Betti number $b_1(X)$ is therefore 0.\n\n5.  **Poincaré Duality**: For any compact, orientable $m$-dimensional manifold without boundary, Poincaré duality establishes an isomorphism between the $k$-th and $(m-k)$-th homology groups (with integer coefficients if the manifold is orientable). Our space $X$ is a smooth complex manifold, so it is orientable and compact, with real dimension $m=4$. Poincaré duality implies that $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$. For $k=1$, this gives $b_1(X) = b_3(X)$.\n\n6.  **Third Betti Number**: Since $b_1(X) = 0$, we must have $b_3(X) = 0$. This means the third homology group with rational coefficients, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Q})$, is trivial. The integer homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is also trivial as these surfaces are known to have torsion-free homology.\n\n7.  **Hurewicz Theorem and Rank**: The rank of an abelian group, such as a homotopy group, is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We are thus looking for the dimension of $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n    The rational Hurewicz theorem connects rational homotopy groups with rational homology groups. For a simply connected space $X$, the Hurewicz homomorphism $\\rho_n: \\pi_n(X) \\to H_n(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ induces an isomorphism between the corresponding rational vector spaces, $\\pi_n(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_n(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, provided the lower homotopy groups are trivial up to that point.\n\n    A more direct argument uses the fact that for a simply connected space, the kernel of the Hurewicz map $\\rho_n$ is a torsion group for all $n$. This means that $\\pi_n(X)$ and its image inside $H_n(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ have the same rank. Consequently, the rank of $\\pi_n(X)$ is equal to the rank of the submodule $\\text{Im}(\\rho_n) \\subset H_n(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is at most the rank of the full homology group $H_n(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n    In our case, for $n=3$, the Hurewicz map is $\\rho_3: \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the target group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is trivial (as $b_3(X)=0$), the map is necessarily the zero map. Therefore, its image has rank 0. Because the kernel of the Hurewicz map consists only of torsion elements, the free part of $\\pi_3(X)$ must be isomorphic to the image, which is trivial.\n\n    Thus, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the prompt specifies a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the term \"quintic threefold\" refers to a quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. For a quintic threefold, which is a Calabi-Yau manifold of complex dimension 3, the third Betti number $b_3$ is 204. A similar argument would then show that the rank of its third homotopy group is 204. However, strictly following the prompt's wording, the space in question is a complex surface, leading to the result of 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
