    "While Kurt Vonnegut famously called him \"the worst poet alive,\" there is no definitive written record of Vonnegut describing this musician as looking like a porcupine. However, the man whose name fits the two-word, same-letter format and was a known subject of Vonnegut's criticism is Bob Dylan. It is possible the \"porcupine\" description is a misattribution or an anecdotal comment, perhaps alluding to Dylan's famously wild hair in his younger years.\n\n<<<Bob Dylan>>>"
