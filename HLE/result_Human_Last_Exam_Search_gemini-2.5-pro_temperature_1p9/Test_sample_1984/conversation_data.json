    "To find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, we first need to determine the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, for the given differential equation:\n$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$\n\n**1. Find the equilibrium points:**\n\nEquilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\nFactoring out $-x$ from the expression, we get:\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\nThis can be further simplified by factoring the quadratic expression, which is a perfect square:\n$-x(x - 1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are the roots of this equation, which are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determine the stability of the equilibrium points:**\n\nTo classify the stability of these equilibrium points, we can analyze the sign of the first derivative of $f(x)$ at these points. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is generally stable if solutions that start near it move toward it as time increases.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the sign of $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point** $x = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point** $x = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive for this point. We must use another method, such as the phase line test or higher-order derivatives.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the regions around the equilibrium points:\n*   For $x > 1$, let's pick $x=2$: $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2 < 0$. This indicates that $x(t)$ is decreasing towards $1$.\n*   For $0 < x < 1$, let's pick $x=0.5$: $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.125 < 0$. This indicates that $x(t)$ is decreasing away from $1$ and towards $0$.\n*   For $x < 0$, let's pick $x=-1$: $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 4 > 0$. This indicates that $x(t)$ is increasing towards $0$.\n\nThe analysis of the phase line confirms the stability:\n*   For $x = 0$, solutions on both sides of the point move towards it, which confirms that it is a **stable equilibrium**.\n*   For $x = 1$, solutions from the right side ($x>1$) move towards it, but solutions from the left side ($0<x<1$) move away from it. This type of equilibrium is known as **semi-stable**. A semi-stable equilibrium point is not considered stable.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$. This means the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$, is 1.\n\n**3. Calculate the final expression:**\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m = 1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
