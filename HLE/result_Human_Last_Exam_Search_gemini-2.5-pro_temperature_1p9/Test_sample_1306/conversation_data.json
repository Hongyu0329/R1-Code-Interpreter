    "In the context of the representation theory of quantum groups, when $q$ is a primitive root of unity, the category of finite-dimensional representations is no longer semisimple. This means that there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible. The question asks for the percentage of indecomposable representations that are irreducible for the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity, i.e., $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$.\n\nFor this question to have a well-defined numerical answer, it is understood to refer to the **small quantum group**, denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra, and it has a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. Let $l$ be the smallest positive integer such that the quantum integer $[l]_q = 0$. For $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$, we find that $l=3$. The representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ is well-established.\n\nThe category of finite-dimensional $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules decomposes into blocks of modules. For $l=3$, there are two main blocks of interest:\n\n1.  **The Steinberg Block:** This is a semisimple block containing a single module, the Steinberg module $L_3$. This module has dimension $l=3$. Since it is simple (irreducible) and constitutes the entire block, it is also projective and indecomposable. Thus, this block contributes **one** indecomposable module, which is also irreducible.\n\n2.  **The Principal Block:** This block contains the trivial representation and is not semisimple. A complete classification of its indecomposable modules is known. The block contains:\n    *   **Two simple (irreducible) modules**: $L_1$ (the trivial module of dimension 1) and $L_2$ (a simple module of dimension 2).\n    *   **Six other indecomposable modules** that are not irreducible. These include the projective covers of the simple modules and other indecomposable modules of mixed composition factors. Explicitly, the list of indecomposables for the principal block consists of 8 modules in total.\n\nIn summary, let's tally the number of modules:\n\n*   **Total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules:**\n    *   From the Steinberg Block: 1\n    *   From the Principal Block: 8\n    *   Total: $1 + 8 = 9$ indecomposable modules.\n\n*   **Total number of non-isomorphic irreducible modules:**\n    *   From the Steinberg Block: 1 ($L_3$)\n    *   From the Principal Block: 2 ($L_1$ and $L_2$)\n    *   Total: $1 + 2 = 3$ irreducible modules.\n\nThe set of all irreducible modules is a subset of the set of all indecomposable modules. To find the percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible, we calculate the ratio of these totals:\n\nPercentage = $\\frac{\\text{Number of irreducible modules}}{\\text{Number of indecomposable modules}} \\times 100\\%$\n\nPercentage = $\\frac{3}{9} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% \\approx 33.33\\%$\n\nThus, one-third of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity are irreducible.\n\n<<<33.33333333333333>>>"
