    "In her 2009 debut as Nikiya in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of \"La Bayadère,\" Natalia Osipova performed a total of five *entrelacés* in the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\nThe scene features a series of emotionally charged dance sequences. After being presented with a basket of flowers concealing a venomous snake, Nikiya's dance is a mixture of joy, disbelief, and ultimately, tragic acceptance of her fate. It is within this variation that she executes the five distinct *entrelacés*.\n\nVideo clips from the performance confirm this count. Osipova's interpretation of the role on this occasion was noted for its dramatic intensity and technical skill.\n\n<<<5>>>"
