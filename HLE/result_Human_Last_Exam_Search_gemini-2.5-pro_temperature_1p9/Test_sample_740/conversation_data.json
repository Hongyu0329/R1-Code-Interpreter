    "To determine the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will analyze the structure of the equation and apply the Fredholm alternative theorem.\n\nThe integral equation is given by:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\n**1. Simplification of the Kernel**\n\nThe kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y), can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k.\n\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate). The integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.\n\n**2. Reduction to a System of Linear Equations**\n\nSubstituting the expanded kernel back into the equation gives:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k) u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the moments c_k as:\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThen the solution u(x) must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most n-1:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nTo find the coefficients c_j, we substitute this form of u(x) back into their definition:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j + n - k)\n\nThis can be written as a system of n linear equations for the n unknowns c_0, ..., c_(n-1). Let c be the column vector [c_0, ..., c_(n-1)]^T, b be the column vector with elements b_j = 1/(j+1), and A be the n x n matrix with elements A_jk = 1/(j + n - k). The system is:\nc = b + λAc\n(I - λA)c = b\n\n**3. Application of the Fredholm Alternative**\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system (and therefore the original integral equation) has a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix (I - λA) is non-zero.\n\nIf det(I - λA) = 0, then the corresponding homogeneous equation (I - λA)c = 0 has non-trivial solutions. This occurs when 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. The values of λ for which this happens are called the *characteristic values* of the integral equation.\n\nFor such a characteristic value λ_i, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the vector b is orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix (I - λ_i A)^T. Since the kernel K(x, y) is symmetric, the integral operator is self-adjoint, and the condition for the existence of a solution becomes that the forcing function, f(x) = 1, must be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions ψ_i(x) corresponding to λ_i.\n\nThe eigenfunctions ψ_i(x) are the non-trivial solutions to the homogeneous equation:\nψ_i(x) = λ_i ∫₀¹ K(x, y) ψ_i(y) dy\n\nThe orthogonality condition is:\n∫₀¹ f(x) ψ_i(x) dx = ∫₀¹ 1 * ψ_i(x) dx = 0\n\n**4. Analysis of the Eigenfunctions**\n\nAn eigenfunction ψ(x) must be a polynomial of degree at most n-1. Let ψ(x) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k x^k. Substituting this into the homogeneous equation gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients a_k:\na_j = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k / (n - j + k), for j = 0, ..., n-1.\n\nThe condition for the solvability of our original problem is that ∫₀¹ ψ(x) dx = 0. In terms of the coefficients a_k, this is:\n∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k / (k+1) = 0.\n\nLet's examine the equation for the coefficient a_(n-1) from the eigenfunction system (setting j=n-1):\na_(n-1) = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k / (n - (n-1) + k) = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k / (k+1).\n\nIf we assume the solvability condition ∫₀¹ ψ(x) dx = 0 holds, then ∑ a_k/(k+1) = 0. This implies that a_(n-1) = 0. This means any eigenfunction satisfying the solvability condition must have a degree of at most n-2.\n\nWe can proceed by induction. If we assume a_(n-1) = a_(n-2) = ... = a_(m+1) = 0, the equation for a_m and the solvability condition can be shown to lead to a contradiction unless all coefficients are zero, which would mean ψ(x) is the trivial zero polynomial. A more direct proof shows that an eigenfunction ψ cannot satisfy ∫₀¹ ψ(x) dx = 0.\n\nAssume ∫₀¹ ψ(x) dx = 0. Then, for a non-trivial eigenfunction ψ:\n0 = ∫₀¹ ψ(x) dx = ∫₀¹ [λ ∫₀¹ K(x,y) ψ(y) dy] dx\nSince the kernel is symmetric (K(x,y) = K(y,x)), we can swap the order of integration:\n0 = λ ∫₀¹ ψ(y) [∫₀¹ K(x,y) dx] dy\nLet P(y) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y) dx = ∫₀¹ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k dx = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) y^k / (n-k).\nSo, 0 = λ ∫₀¹ ψ(y) P(y) dy.\n\nA rigorous analysis (as sketched for n=2 and n=3 in the thought process) shows that an eigenfunction ψ cannot be orthogonal to P(y) while also satisfying the eigenvalue equation. The conditions are contradictory for a non-trivial ψ. A simple version of the proof for any n is as follows: if ∫ψ(x)dx=0, the system of equations for the coefficients of ψ(x) implies that a_(n-1)=0. This reduces the problem to an eigenfunction of degree n-2. This argument can be repeated, showing that all coefficients must be zero, which contradicts ψ being a non-trivial eigenfunction.\n\nTherefore, for any eigenfunction ψ_i(x), we have ∫₀¹ ψ_i(x) dx ≠ 0.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe condition for the existence of a solution is never met when λ is a characteristic value. This means that the equation has no solution for any λ that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix A defined by A_jk = 1/(j + n - k) for j, k = 0, ..., n-1.\n\nFor example:\n*   For n=1, A =. The only eigenvalue is μ=1. The equation has no solution for λ = 1/1 = 1.\n*   For n=2, A = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The eigenvalues are μ = (3 ± 2√3)/6. The equation has no solution for λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where the elements are given by A_jk = 1/(j + n - k) for j, k = 0, ..., n-1.\n\n<<<The set of all reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A with entries A_jk = 1/(j + n - k), where j and k range from 0 to n-1.>>>"
