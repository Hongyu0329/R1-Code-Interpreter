    "In the history of Major League Baseball, including the Negro Leagues, there have been a combined total of 42 players who have won a Triple Crown, for either hitting or pitching.\n\nThe batting Triple Crown—leading a league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs)—has been accomplished by 17 different players. Notable among these is Rogers Hornsby, who won it twice. The most recent player to achieve this feat was Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nThe pitching Triple Crown—leading a league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA)—has been achieved by 35 pitchers, with some accomplishing it multiple times. Sandy Koufax, for instance, won the pitching Triple Crown three times. In 2020, four Negro League players were added to the official list of pitching Triple Crown winners.\n\nCombining the lists of individual winners for both hitting and pitching, and accounting for players who have won multiple times by counting them only once, results in the total of 42 unique Triple Crown winners.\n\nHere is a list of the MLB batting Triple Crown winners:\n*   Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n*   Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n*   Frank Robinson (1966)\n*   Mickey Mantle (1956)\n*   Ted Williams (1942, 1947)\n*   Joe Medwick (1937)\n*   Lou Gehrig (1934)\n*   Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n*   Chuck Klein (1933)\n*   Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925)\n*   Heinie Zimmerman (1912)\n*   Ty Cobb (1909)\n*   Nap Lajoie (1901)\n*   Hugh Duffy (1894)\n*   Tip O'Neill (1887)\n*   Paul Hines (1878)\n\nInformation from a search result also indicates a list of 27 or 28 winners when including the Negro Leagues.\n\n<<<42>>>"
