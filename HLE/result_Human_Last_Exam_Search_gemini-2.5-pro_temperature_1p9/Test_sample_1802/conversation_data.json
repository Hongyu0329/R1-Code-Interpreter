    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel on a d-dimensional system (qudit):** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system is described by the following map:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} U_{ij} \\rho U_{ij}^\\dagger $$\n    Here, $\\rho$ is the $d \\times d$ density matrix of the qudit. The operators $U_{ij} = X^i Z^j$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), where $X$ and $Z$ are the shift and phase operators, respectively. These $d^2$ operators form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_{ij}$ are probabilities, meaning they satisfy $p_{ij} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} = 1$. These conditions ensure that the channel is completely positive and trace-preserving.\n\n2.  **Kraus Operators and Complementary Channel:** The expression for the Pauli channel is a Kraus representation, with the Kraus operators being $A_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_{ij}} U_{ij}$. A channel can have multiple Kraus representations, and for a Pauli channel, we can choose a set of $d^2$ such operators.\n\n    Given a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l \\rho) |k\\rangle\\langle l| $$\n    where the states $|k\\rangle$ form an orthonormal basis for the environment system. The rank of the complementary channel is determined by the properties of the original channel's Kraus operators.\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel and the Gram Matrix:** A key theorem in quantum information theory states that the Choi rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ formed by the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The entries of the Gram matrix are given by the inner products of the Kraus operators:\n    $$ G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l) $$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Gram Matrix for a Pauli Channel:** For the Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $A_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_{ij}} U_{ij}$. The entries of the Gram matrix $G$ are indexed by pairs of indices, so we have:\n    $$ G_{(ij),(kl)} = \\text{Tr}\\left( (\\sqrt{p_{ij}} U_{ij})^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_{kl}} U_{kl}) \\right) = \\sqrt{p_{ij} p_{kl}} \\text{Tr}(U_{ij}^\\dagger U_{kl}) $$\n\n5.  **Orthogonality of Generalized Pauli Operators:** The generalized Pauli operators $U_{ij}$ have the property of being an orthogonal basis with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Specifically, their trace satisfies:\n    $$ \\text{Tr}(U_{ij}^\\dagger U_{kl}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl} $$\n    where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit system.\n\n6.  **Rank of the Gram Matrix:** Substituting the orthogonality relation into the expression for the Gram matrix gives:\n    $$ G_{(ij),(kl)} = \\sqrt{p_{ij} p_{kl}} (d \\cdot \\delta_{ik} \\delta_{jl}) $$\n    This shows that the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix of size $d^2 \\times d^2$. The diagonal entries are $G_{(ij),(ij)} = d \\cdot p_{ij}$. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of its non-zero entries. Therefore, the rank of $G$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{ij}$.\n\n7.  **Maximizing the Rank:** To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel, we need to find the Pauli channel with the maximum number of non-zero coefficients $p_{ij}$. It is possible to define a valid Pauli channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. The most prominent example is the completely depolarizing channel, for which $p_{ij} = 1/d^2$ for all $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d-1\\}$. In this case, all $d^2$ diagonal entries of the Gram matrix are non-zero ($d \\cdot (1/d^2) = 1/d$).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible rank of the Gram matrix is $d^2$, which implies that the maximal rank of the complementary channel is also $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
