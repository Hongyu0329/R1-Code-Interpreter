    "The man described is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nAndrei Voznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (published in English as \"Story Under Full Sail\") tells the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807). This poem formed the libretto for the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which premiered in 1981 and sparked widespread interest in Rezanov's life.\n\nThe opera and poem are based on the historical romance between the 42-year-old Rezanov, a chamberlain to the Tsar and a commander of the Russian-American Company, and the 15-year-old Concepción \"Conchita\" Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of San Francisco. Rezanov had sailed to California in 1806 on a mission to secure provisions for starving Russian colonies in Alaska. After becoming engaged to Conchita, he began the long journey back to St. Petersburg to seek the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic but died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807.\n\nThe line about his grave is a central theme in Voznesensky's work. Rezanov's original tombstone was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. Following the cultural and political shifts of the late Soviet era and renewed interest in his story, his burial site was re-established. In October 2000, a memorial service was held, and a new white cross was dedicated at his presumed grave in Krasnoyarsk.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
