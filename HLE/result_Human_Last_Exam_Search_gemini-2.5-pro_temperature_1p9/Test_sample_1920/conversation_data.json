    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nFrom the search results, the prime factorization of $d = 53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character modulo $d$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes, say $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$, any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if each of the characters $\\chi_i$ in its factorization is primitive. For a prime modulus $p$, any non-principal character is primitive. The only non-primitive character modulo a prime $p$ is the principal character.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the characters $\\chi_i$. We want the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This means $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nThe order of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. Let's calculate $p_i - 1$ for each prime factor:\n*   $p_1 = 7$, $p_1 - 1 = 6$\n*   $p_2 = 13$, $p_2 - 1 = 12$\n*   $p_3 = 19$, $p_3 - 1 = 18$\n*   $p_4 = 31$, $p_4 - 1 = 30$\n\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p)$. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet $o_i$ be the order of $\\chi_i$. We need $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$. Also, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, none of the $\\chi_i$ can be the principal character, which has order 1. So, $o_i > 1$ for all $i$.\n\nThe possible orders $o_i$ for each character $\\chi_i$ must be divisors of $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)=6$ and also divisors of $p_i - 1$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6. Since we need primitive characters, we exclude the order 1. The possible orders are thus from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's check which of these orders are possible for each prime factor:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$ ($p_1 - 1 = 6$): The orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible. The number of characters for each order are:\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_2 = 13$ ($p_2 - 1 = 12$): The orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible. The number of characters are:\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_3 = 19$ ($p_3 - 1 = 18$): The orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible. The number of characters are:\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n*   For $p_4 = 31$ ($p_4 - 1 = 30$): The orders 2, 3, and 6 are all possible. The number of characters are:\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, at least one of the $o_i$ must be a multiple of 3, and at least one must be a multiple of 2.\n\nLet $N(k, p-1)$ be the number of characters of order $k$ modulo $p$. We want to find the number of choices $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4) = 6$.\nThe orders $o_i$ must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\nLet $C_i$ be the set of orders of primitive characters for $p_i$.\nFor each prime $p_i$, the number of characters of order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $\\phi(k)$. So, for each $p_i$ we have:\n*   1 character of order 2.\n*   2 characters of order 3.\n*   2 characters of order 6.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all possible combinations of primitive characters. The total number of combinations of primitive characters of orders dividing 6 is $(1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\nThese are the characters whose order is a divisor of 6.\n\nNow, we need to exclude the combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6.\nThe lcm is not 6 if it is 1, 2 or 3.\nSince the characters are primitive, the order cannot be 1.\n\nCase 1: lcm is 2. This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{2\\}$.\nFor each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$ such character.\n\nCase 2: lcm is 3. This happens if all $o_i \\in \\{3\\}$.\nFor each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$ such characters.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of order dividing 6 is $( \\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) )^4 = (1+2+2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order dividing 3 is $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order dividing 2 is $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order 1 is 0.\n\nLet $N_k$ be the number of primitive characters with order dividing $k$.\nThe number of characters of order 6 is given by the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n$N_6 - N_3 - N_2 + N_1$ where $N_k$ is the number of characters with order dividing $k$.\nThe number of characters of order 6 is the total number of characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order dividing 3, minus those with order dividing 2.\nNumber of characters with order dividing 6 is $(\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6))^4 = (1+1+2+2)^4 = 6^4$ if we allow non-primitive.  Let's stick to the primitive characters.\n\nLet $A_2$ be the set of characters where all component orders divide 2. Size is $1^4=1$.\nLet $A_3$ be the set of characters where all component orders divide 3. Size is $2^4=16$.\nTotal combinations where orders are from $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is $(1+2+2)^4=625$.\nThe lcm is 6 if not all orders divide 2 and not all orders divide 3.\nThe number of combinations where orders divide 6 is 625.\nThe number of combinations where orders divide 3 (i.e. are all in {3}) is $2^4 = 16$.\nThe number of combinations where orders divide 2 (i.e. are all in {2}) is $1^4=1$.\nThe set of characters of order dividing 2 and 3 are disjoint except for order 1, but we excluded that.\n\nThe total number of primitive characters with order lcm being 6 is:\n(Total where orders can be 2, 3, or 6) - (those where orders are only 2 or 3)\nNumber of primitive characters whose order divides 6:\n$(\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6))^4 = (1 + 2 + 2)^4 = 5^4 = 625$.\nNumber of primitive characters whose order divides 3 is $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4 = 16$.\nNumber of primitive characters whose order divides 2 is $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4 = 1$.\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nFinal verification.\nLet $n_k(p)$ be the number of primitive characters mod $p$ of order $k$.\nTotal number of primitive characters mod d of order 6 is\n$$ \\sum_{\\substack{d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4=d \\\\ \\text{lcm}(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)=6}} \\prod_{i=1}^4 n_{k_i}(p_i) $$\nThis seems too complex.\n\nAlternative calculation:\nTotal possibilities for orders $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4)$ where each $o_i$ divides $p_i-1$ and lcm is 6.\nFor each of the 4 primes, the number of characters of orders 2, 3, 6 are $\\phi(2)=1, \\phi(3)=2, \\phi(6)=2$.\nLet $C_2$ be the number of choices where each $\\chi_i$ has order 2. $C_2 = 1^4=1$.\nLet $C_3$ be the number of choices where each $\\chi_i$ has order 3. $C_3 = 2^4 = 16$.\nLet $C_{2,3}$ be the number of choices where orders are from $\\{2,3\\}$. This means each $o_i$ can be 2 or 3. There are $(1+2)^4 = 3^4=81$ such choices. The lcm of these will be either 2, 3 or 6.\nNumber of choices with lcm=2 is 1. Number of choices with lcm=3 is 16. Number of choices with lcm=6 is $81-1-16=64$.\n\nTotal choices for orders from $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is $5^4 = 625$.\nLcm is 6 if not all orders from $\\{2,3\\}$, not all from $\\{2,6\\}$, not all from $\\{3,6\\}$.\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's use a clearer inclusion-exclusion.\nLet $S$ be the set of 4-tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where the order of $\\chi_i$ divides 6.\n$|S| = (1+2+2)^4=5^4=625$.\nLet $A_2 \\subset S$ be the subset where all orders divide 2. $|A_2|=1^4=1$.\nLet $A_3 \\subset S$ be the subset where all orders divide 3. $|A_3|=2^4=16$.\nWe want the number of tuples where the lcm of orders is 6.\nThis is the total number of tuples minus those where the lcm is not 6.\nLcm is not 6 means lcm can be 1, 2, or 3. Order is never 1. So lcm can be 2 or 3.\nThe set of tuples with lcm 2 are those in $A_2$.\nThe set of tuples with lcm 3 are those in $A_3$.\nThe sets for lcm=2 and lcm=3 are disjoint.\nSo number of characters of order 6 is $|S| - |A_2| - |A_3| = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
