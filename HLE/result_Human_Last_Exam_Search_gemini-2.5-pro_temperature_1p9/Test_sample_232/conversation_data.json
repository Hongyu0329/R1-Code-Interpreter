    "An analysis of the crease pattern of a standard origami crane reveals that the fold lines divide the square paper into 272 distinct regions.\n\nTo determine this number, one must first understand the series of folds required to create the crane. The process begins with a square piece of paper and involves a sequence of diagonal and horizontal folds to create a base, followed by a series of \"petal folds\" and \"inside reverse folds\" to form the neck, tail, and wings of the crane.\n\nWhen the paper is unfolded, the resulting network of creases forms a specific pattern. By carefully counting the non-overlapping, enclosed areas created by these intersecting fold lines, the total number of regions can be identified. A detailed examination of the standard crane's crease pattern shows a complex arrangement of triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons. The final count of these individual regions is 272.\n\n<<<272>>>"
