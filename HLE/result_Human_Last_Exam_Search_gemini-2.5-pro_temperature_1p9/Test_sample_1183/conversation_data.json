    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is known as 2,3,9,10,16,17-tris(ethynyl)-5,6,12,13,18,19-hexaazatrinaphthylene.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group of this molecule, we first need to consider its three-dimensional structure. The core of the molecule, hexaazatrinaphthylene, is a large, planar system of fused aromatic rings. The three ethynyl (`-C≡CH`) groups are attached to the outer rings in a symmetrical arrangement. Assuming the entire molecule maintains a planar conformation, which is the most stable arrangement for such extended π-systems, we can identify its symmetry elements.\n\nThe key symmetry elements for the idealized planar structure are:\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to the molecular plane. A 120-degree rotation around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) that lie within the molecular plane. Each of these axes passes through the center of the molecule and goes through the midpoints of the bonds connecting the outer rings.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical/dihedral mirror planes (σᵥ or σₔ) that are perpendicular to the horizontal mirror plane and each contain the principal C₃ axis and one of the ethynyl groups.\n*   An inversion center (i) at the very center of the molecule.\n*   An improper three-fold axis of rotation (S₃) which is coincident with the C₃ axis.\n\nThe presence of a principal C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes indicates that the molecule belongs to the D₃ point group family. The addition of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) elevates the symmetry to the **D₃ₕ** point group.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
