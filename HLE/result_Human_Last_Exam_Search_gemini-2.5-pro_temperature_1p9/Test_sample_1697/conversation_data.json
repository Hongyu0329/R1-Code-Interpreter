    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF followed by methyl iodide yields N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is a powerful directing group in ortho-metalation reactions. The sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), a strong organolithium base, in the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), which breaks down the butyllithium aggregates and increases its reactivity, selectively removes a proton from the aromatic ring at a position ortho to the amide group. In N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, there are two positions ortho to the amide: C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group at the meta position (C3) also has a directing effect. Both the amide and the dimethylamino groups work together to direct the lithiation to the C2 position, which is ortho to both groups. This results in the formation of a lithiated intermediate at the C2 position.\n\n2.  **Reaction with an Electrophile:** The subsequent addition of methyl iodide introduces an electrophilic methyl group. The highly nucleophilic carbanion at the C2 position of the lithiated intermediate attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nThe final result is the substitution of a hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group, leading to the formation of N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
