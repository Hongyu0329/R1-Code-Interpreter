    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the steam merchant ship **Bretagne**.\n\nThe **SS Bretagne**, with a tonnage of 10,108 tons, was sunk by the German U-boat U-45 on October 14, 1939. The ship, owned by the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, was part of the unescorted convoy KJF-3 when it was attacked approximately 230 miles southwest of Fastnet.\n\nSeveral other French ships were also sunk by U-boats during this period. On October 13, 1939, the day before the sinking of the *Bretagne*, the French steam merchant **Louisiane** (6,903 tons) was sunk by the U-boat U-48. Another French steamer, the **Vermont** (5,186 GRT), was sunk on October 15, 1939, by U-37. In November 1939, the steam merchant **Arijon** (4,374 GRT) was sunk by U-43.\n\nAdditionally, the French submarine **Doris** (552 tons surfaced displacement) was sunk by the German submarine U-9 on May 8 or 9, 1940.\n\nA newspaper article from October 17, 1939, mentioned the sinking of three French ships over the preceding weekend: the *Bretagne*, the *Louisiane*, and the *Emile Miquet*. While the *Bretagne* and *Louisiane* are confirmed to be substantial vessels, the *Emile Miquet* was a smaller fishing trawler.\n\nIt is important to distinguish the merchant ship *Bretagne* from the French battleship of the same name. The battleship *Bretagne* had a much larger displacement of approximately 23,936 tonnes, but it was sunk by the British Royal Navy during the attack on Mers-el-Kébir on July 3, 1940, after the armistice was signed on June 22, 1940.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, the merchant ship *Bretagne* remains the largest French vessel sunk by a U-boat before the armistice.\n\n<<<Bretagne (merchant ship)>>>"
