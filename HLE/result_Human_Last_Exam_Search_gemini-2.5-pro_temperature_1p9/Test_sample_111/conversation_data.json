    "On September 12, 1368, Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, passed away. At this time, Geoffrey Chaucer's precise whereabouts are not definitively known, though it is established he was on the European continent.\n\nIn 1368, Chaucer was engaged in diplomatic missions for the king. Historical records and scholarly analysis place him in either France or Italy during that year. Some sources suggest he traveled to the continent, likely France, on the king's service.\n\nOther evidence points to a possible journey to Italy. In April 1368, Chaucer may have been part of the retinue of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, who traveled to Milan for his marriage to Violante Visconti. Lionel died in Italy later that year. There is a record of a warrant allowing Chaucer to pass through Dover on July 17, 1368, though his destination is not specified. Following these events, it is believed Chaucer entered the service of John of Gaunt.\n\nWhile it is certain Chaucer was not in England when Blanche of Lancaster died, and he would later write \"The Book of the Duchess\" in her honor, his exact location—whether in France or Italy—on that specific September day remains a subject of scholarly discussion and is not definitively recorded.\n\n<<<D>>>"
