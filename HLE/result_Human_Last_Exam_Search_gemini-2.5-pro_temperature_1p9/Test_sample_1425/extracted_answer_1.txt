The partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN in the grand canonical ensemble is given by Z = Tr[e^(2βμN)], which is equivalent to Σ_n e^(2βμn) where the sum is over all possible particle number states n. In the path integral formalism, this translates to Z = ∫D[fields] e^(-S_E), where the Euclidean action S_E for bosons is S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x φ*(∂_τ + 2μ)φ and for fermions is S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ̄(∂_τ + 2μ)ψ.
