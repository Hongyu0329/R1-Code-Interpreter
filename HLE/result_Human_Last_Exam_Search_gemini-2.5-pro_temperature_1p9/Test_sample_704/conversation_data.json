    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is represented by the note **G**.\n\nNewton famously drew an analogy between the colors of the light spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. He organized the seven colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—into a circle. He then mapped these colors to the seven notes of the Dorian musical mode, starting with D.\n\nIn this system, the colors are assigned to the notes as follows:\n*   Red corresponds to D\n*   Orange corresponds to E\n*   Yellow corresponds to F\n*   **Green corresponds to G**\n*   Blue corresponds to A\n*   Indigo corresponds to B\n*   Violet corresponds to C\n\nThe color produced by mixing yellow and blue is green. Therefore, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green and blue on Newton's color circle is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
