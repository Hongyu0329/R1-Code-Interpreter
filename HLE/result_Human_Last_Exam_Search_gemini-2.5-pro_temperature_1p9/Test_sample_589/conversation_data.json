    "I have conducted multiple searches using various keywords and search strategies to identify a Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car. These searches have included general movie databases, specific scene-finding forums, and news archives.\n\nDespite these efforts, I have been unable to find a definitive match for this specific scene in a major Hollywood motion picture. The search results have included:\n\n*   Discussions on forums and Reddit where users have tried to recall similar scenes, but none have led to a verifiable identification of the film in question.\n*   Mentions of pink bicycles in other contexts within films, such as a prop in a photoshoot for an upcoming movie.\n*   News articles about real-life incidents involving cyclists, which do not correspond to a fictional film scene.\n\nGiven the lack of any affirmative results from these extensive searches, it is possible that the user may be misremembering details of the scene or the film in question. It is also possible that the film is not a major Hollywood production or is a more obscure or independent film that is not widely indexed in the databases and forums that were searched.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available through the performed searches, I cannot identify a specific Hollywood feature film that matches the described scene.\n\n<<<I am unable to find a major Hollywood feature film that definitively matches the described scene based on the information I could access.>>>"
