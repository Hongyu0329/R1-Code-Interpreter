    "Answering your question requires interpreting the notation provided. In the context of algebraic number theory for a field $K$ constructed from a squarefree natural number $N$ (specifically, a real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ where $N>0$), a plausible interpretation is as follows:\n\n*   **$k_{k,\\infty}$**: This likely refers to the **regulator** of the number field $K$, denoted as $R_K$ or simply $R$. The regulator is a fundamental invariant that measures the \"size\" of the group of units of the ring of integers of $K$. For a real quadratic field, $R = \\log(\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is the fundamental unit.\n*   **$V$**: This represents the **covolume** of the ring of integers $O_K$ embedded as a lattice in a real vector space. This covolume is directly related to the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ of the number field by the formula $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n\nFor a squarefree natural number $N$, the discriminant of the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ is:\n*   $\\Delta_K = N$ if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n*   $\\Delta_K = 4N$ if $N \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$\n\nThe relationship between the regulator ($R$), the covolume ($V=\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$), and other invariants of the number field is given by Dirichlet's class number formula. For a real quadratic field, this formula is:\n\n$h_K = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta_K} \\cdot L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})}{2R}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $h_K$ is the class number of $K$, which is a positive integer ($h_K \\ge 1$).\n*   $L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})$ is the value of the Dirichlet L-function at $s=1$ for the quadratic character $\\chi_{\\Delta_K}$ associated with the field.\n\nFrom this formula, we can express the regulator as:\n\n$R = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta_K} \\cdot L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})}{2h_K}$\n\nTo find an upper bound for the regulator $R$ in relation to the covolume $V=\\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$, we can use the facts that $h_K \\ge 1$ and there exist unconditional upper bounds for $L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})$. Since $h_K \\ge 1$, we have:\n\n$R \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta_K} \\cdot L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K})}{2}$\n\nThe classical unconditional upper bound for the L-function value is $L(1, \\chi_{\\Delta_K}) = O(\\log \\Delta_K)$. More precisely, it is known that $L(1, \\chi) \\le \\frac{1}{2}\\log q + C$ for a character of modulus $q$ and some constant $C$. Substituting this into the inequality for the regulator gives:\n\n$R = O(\\sqrt{\\Delta_K} \\log \\Delta_K)$\n\nExpressed in terms of the covolume $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$, the upper bound for the regulator $R$ (interpreted as $k_{k,\\infty}$) is:\n\n$R = O(V \\log(V^2)) = O(V \\cdot 2 \\log V) = O(V \\log V)$\n\nThus, the upper bound for the regulator is on the order of the covolume multiplied by the logarithm of the covolume.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the regulator $(R)$, which we interpret as $k_{k,\\infty}$, in relation to the covolume $(V)$ of the ring of integers of a real quadratic field is given by the relation $R = O(V \\log V)$.>>>"
