    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy inference system is calculated by applying a t-norm operation, which serves as a fuzzy logical AND, to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   Antecedent firing strength, `Phi_k(x′)` = 0.7\n*   Consequent membership degree, `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9\n\nThe rule activation level is the result of `T(0.7, 0.9)`, where T represents a specific t-norm function. The result depends on which t-norm is used:\n\n*   **Minimum T-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is the most common t-norm, defined as T(a, b) = min(a, b).\n    *   min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Product T-norm:** Another frequently used t-norm, defined as T(a, b) = a * b.\n    *   0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\n*   **Łukasiewicz T-norm:** Defined as T(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1).\n    *   max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6\n\nWithout a specified t-norm, the standard and most common choice is the Minimum t-norm.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
