    "The two high schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, which stand next to each other in Pisa, form the letter 'C' when viewed from above.\n\nThe buildings of the two schools are located on Via Benedetto Croce. The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is situated at number 32/34, and the Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini is at number 36. The schools are adjacent and share an internal courtyard.\n\nAn analysis of satellite imagery of the area reveals the distinct C-shape of the combined structures. The main building of the Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini forms the upper part of the 'C', while the adjoining building of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti creates the curve and the lower part of the letter. The shared courtyard is enclosed within the curve of the 'C'.\n\n<<<C>>>"
