    "Assuming the \"Justified True Belief\" (JTB) definition of knowledge and a simplified world with only two epistemic states—Knowledge and Belief—two significant problems arise that are distinct from Gettier-style examples. These problems challenge the very coherence and applicability of the JTB conditions themselves.\n\n<<<The two problems are the infinite regress of justification and the inaccessibility of the truth condition.\n\n**1. The Infinite Regress of Justification (The Agrippan Trilemma)**\n\nThe JTB theory states that for a belief to become knowledge, it must be justified. The problem, known as Agrippa's Trilemma, arises when we question what form this justification must take. If every belief requires justification, then the belief(s) offered as justification must also be justified. This leads to three problematic possibilities:\n\n*   **Infinite Regress:** Each justification requires a further justification, creating an endless chain that never provides a solid foundation for knowledge.\n*   **Dogmatism:** The chain of justification stops at a belief that is asserted without its own justification, which is an arbitrary and unsupported foundation.\n*   **Circularity:** The chain of justification circles back on itself (e.g., A is justified by B, and B is justified by A), which is a logically flawed argument.\n\nThe JTB framework does not solve this problem; it merely requires justification without explaining how to ground it successfully. In a system with only \"Belief\" and \"Knowledge,\" this issue becomes particularly stark. To elevate a Belief to Knowledge, it needs a justification. However, that justification consists of other Beliefs, which in turn need justification, trapping the individual in an endless loop within the state of Belief without ever being able to satisfy the \"J\" condition.\n\n**2. The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**\n\nThe \"T\" in JTB demands that the belief be objectively true—that it corresponds to reality. The problem is that an individual cannot step outside of their own mind to directly verify that this condition has been met. They can accumulate evidence and strengthen their justification for believing that something is true, but they can never access the objective state of the world to confirm it with absolute certainty.\n\nThis creates a gap between the requirements of the definition and what is epistemically possible for the believer:\n\n*   The JTB definition requires an external, objective condition (Truth) to be met.\n*   The individual can only ever achieve an internal, subjective state (a very strongly justified Belief).\n\nBecause the believer cannot independently confirm the \"Truth\" of their belief, they can never be certain they have fulfilled all the conditions to transition from a justified Belief to the state of Knowledge. The definition sets a requirement that is, from the believer's perspective, fundamentally unverifiable.>>>"
