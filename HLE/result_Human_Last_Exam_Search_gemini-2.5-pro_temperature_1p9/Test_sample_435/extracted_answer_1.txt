Based on the body of evidence, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an enhanced and broader release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is evidenced by the known role of IL-15 in promoting T cell activation and effector function, and the clinical observation of a higher incidence and severity of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in patients treated with IL-15-modified CAR T cells.
