To simulate the correlations from POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state using a local hidden variable model, the minimal resources required, on average, are either a single non-signaling PR-Box or one bit of classical communication for the case of projective measurements. For the more general case of all POVMs, the resource cost is known to be higher, but a single definitive minimal value is an ongoing subject of research. The simulation also requires a finite amount of shared randomness as the local hidden variable.
