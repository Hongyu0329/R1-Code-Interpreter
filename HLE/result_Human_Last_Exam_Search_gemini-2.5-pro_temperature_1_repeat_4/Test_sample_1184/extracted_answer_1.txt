The human beta-1 subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel 2.3 interacts with the alpha-1 subunit primarily through a hydrophobic groove on its guanylate kinase (GK) domain. Specific residues within this groove form a binding pocket for the Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties is modulated by specific residues on the beta-1 subunit, including the phosphorylation of Serine 193 and Threonine 205 in the HOOK domain.
