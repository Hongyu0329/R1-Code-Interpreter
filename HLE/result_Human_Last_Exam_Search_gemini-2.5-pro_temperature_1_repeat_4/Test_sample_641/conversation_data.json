    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2, meaning it is not the identity element and its square is the identity. The problem asks for the total number of such elements in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\n### 1. The Group PSU(4, 997)\n\nThe group PSU(n, q) is the projective special unitary group, defined over a finite field with q^2 elements. It is the quotient of the special unitary group SU(n, q) by its center, Z(SU(n, q)).\n*   **n = 4**\n*   **q = 997** (a prime number, hence odd)\n\nThe group PSU(4, 997) is a finite simple group of Lie type.\n\n### 2. Involutions in PSU(n, q)\n\nAn element `x` in PSU(n, q) is an involution if `x ≠ 1` and `x^2 = 1`. If `x` is the image of an element `g` in SU(n, q) under the natural projection (i.e., `x = gZ`, where `Z = Z(SU(n, q))`), then the condition `x^2 = 1` translates to `g^2 ∈ Z`. The condition `x ≠ 1` means `g ∉ Z`.\n\nThe center of SU(n, q), for n=4 and q=997, is `Z = {cI | c^4 = 1 and c^(997+1) = 1}`. This means `c^4 = 1` and `c^998 = 1`. Since `gcd(4, 998) = 2`, this implies `c^2 = 1`. Thus, the center is `Z = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the 4x4 identity matrix.\n\nSo, the involutions in PSU(4, 997) correspond to the cosets of `gZ` where `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n### 3. Conjugacy Classes of Involutions\n\nFor PSU(n, q) with n even and q odd, there are `n/2` conjugacy classes of involutions. For `n=4`, there are `4/2 = 2` such classes.\n\n*   **Class 1: Involutions arising from `g^2 = I`**\n    An element `g ∈ SU(4, q)` with `g^2 = I` is diagonalizable with eigenvalues ±1. Since `det(g) = 1`, the number of -1 eigenvalues must be even. The only non-central case is when there are two -1 eigenvalues. The representative for this conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)` is `g_1` conjugate to `diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`. This gives one class of involutions in PSU(4, q).\n\n*   **Class 2: Involutions arising from `g^2 = -I`**\n    An element `g ∈ U(n, q)` with `g^2 = -I` must have eigenvalues `i` and `-i` (where `i^2 = -1`). For `g` to be an element of the unitary group `U(n, q)`, the dimensions of the eigenspaces for `i` and `-i` must be equal. Since `n=4`, both must have dimension 2. The representative for this class is `g_2`, conjugate to `diag(i, i, -i, -i)`. The determinant is `i^2 * (-i)^2 = 1`, so `g_2` is in `SU(4, q)`. This gives the second class of involutions in PSU(4, q).\n\n### 4. Calculation of the Number of Involutions\n\nThe total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes. The size of a conjugacy class `C_x` is `|G| / |C_G(x)|`, where `G = PSU(4, q)` and `C_G(x)` is the centralizer of `x` in `G`.\n\nThe order of PSU(n, q) is given by the formula:\n`|PSU(n, q)| = (1/gcd(n, q+1)) * q^(n(n-1)/2) * Π_{i=2 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\nFor `n=4` and `q=997`:\n`|PSU(4, 997)| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^2 - 1)(997^3 + 1)(997^4 - 1)`\n\n**Size of Class 1 (from `g_1 = diag(1, 1, -1, -1)`)**\nThe centralizer of `g_1` in `U(4, q)` is `U(2, q) × U(2, q)`. The order of the centralizer in `PSU(4, q)` is derived from this.\nThe size of this class, denoted `|K_1|`, is:\n`|K_1| = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n**Size of Class 2 (from `g_2 = diag(i, i, -i, -i)`)**\nThe centralizer of `g_2` in `U(4, q)` is isomorphic to the general linear group `GL(2, q^2)`. The order of the centralizer in `PSU(4, q)` is derived from this.\nThe size of this class, denoted `|K_2|`, is:\n`|K_2| = q^4 * (q + 1)^2 * (q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n**Total Number of Involutions**\nThe total number of involutions `N` is the sum `|K_1| + |K_2|`.\n`N = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q + 1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`\n`N = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * [(q^2 + 1) + (q + 1)^2]`\n`N = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * [q^2 + 1 + q^2 + 2q + 1]`\n`N = q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * (2q^2 + 2q + 2)`\n`N = 2q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + q + 1)`\n\nUsing the identity `(x^2 - x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) = x^4 + x^2 + 1`, we get:\n`N = 2q^4 * (q^4 + q^2 + 1)`\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\n`N = 2 * 997^4 * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`\n\n<<<2 * 997^4 * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)>>>"
