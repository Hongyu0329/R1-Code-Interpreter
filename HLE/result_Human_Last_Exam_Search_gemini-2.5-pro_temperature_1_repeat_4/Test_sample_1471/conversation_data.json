    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **MDCCCLXXXI** is converted as follows:\n    *   M = 1000\n    *   D = 500\n    *   CCC = 300\n    *   LXXX = 80\n    *   I = 1\n    *   Adding these values together: 1000 + 500 + 300 + 80 + 1 = 1881.\n\n*   **MCCCLXXXI** is converted as follows:\n    *   M = 1000\n    *   CCC = 300\n    *   LXXX = 80\n    *   I = 1\n    *   Adding these values together: 1000 + 300 + 80 + 1 = 1381.\n\nThe word \"Cassini\" in the equation does not represent a standard Roman numeral. It is likely a reference to the astronomer Giovanni Cassini, who is associated with a brand of puzzles. In the context of this puzzle-like equation, \"Cassini\" is a placeholder that needs to be deciphered. Without a specific numerical value assigned to \"Cassini\" from the context of a specific puzzle set, the equation is unsolvable.\n\nHowever, if we assume \"Cassini\" is a typo and was intended to be the same as the denominator, the equation would be:\n\n1881 / 1881 - 1381\n\nFollowing the order of operations (division first, then subtraction):\n\n1.  1881 / 1881 = 1\n2.  1 - 1381 = -1380\n\nGiven this common puzzle format, -1380 is the logical solution under the assumption of a typo.\n\n<<<-1380>>>"
