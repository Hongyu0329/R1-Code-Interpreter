The problem is not decidable in the formal sense of computability theory. This is primarily because the concept of "god" lacks a single, universally accepted, and formal definition that can be processed by an algorithm. Decidability requires a problem to be stated in precise, mathematical terms, which is not the case for this metaphysical question.
