    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, composite topological system. The Chern number of this resulting junction is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\n\nThe additivity of the Chern number is a fundamental property in the study of topological phases of matter. For a system composed of multiple subsystems, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of each subsystem, assuming the coupling between them allows for the overall system to be described by a single, continuous wave function. The negligible tunneling barrier in this scenario ensures a strong coupling, fulfilling this condition.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction is calculated as:\n\nC_total = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThis principle is analogous to how the total charge of a combined system is the sum of the individual charges. In the context of Chern insulators, the Chern number is a topological invariant that quantifies the Hall conductivity. The doubling of the Chern number to 2 in the combined system implies that the Hall conductivity of the junction will be twice the quantized value of a single C=1 insulator.\n\nThis concept has been explored in various contexts, including the creation of topological circuits and devices with tunable topological properties. By engineering junctions of materials with different Chern numbers, it is possible to create new topological phases with tailored characteristics. For instance, a junction between a C=1 and a C=2 insulator would result in a system with different properties than the one described here.\n\n<<<2>>>"
