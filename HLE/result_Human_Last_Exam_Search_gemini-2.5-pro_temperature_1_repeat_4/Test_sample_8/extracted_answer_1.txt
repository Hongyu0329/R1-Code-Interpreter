Given that $f \in \mathcal{A}^{2+\alpha}(X)$ and the resolvent $R(\sigma)$ is an operator of order -2 in the scattering calculus, the resulting function $R(\sigma)f$ belongs to the space of polyhomogeneous conormal functions of order $4+\alpha$, which can be denoted as $\mathcal{A}^{4+\alpha}_{phg}(X)$.
