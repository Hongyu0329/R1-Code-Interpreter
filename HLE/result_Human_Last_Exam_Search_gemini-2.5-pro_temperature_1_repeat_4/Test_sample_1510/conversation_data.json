    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. There are a total of 17 distinct wallpaper groups. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed, such as rotations and reflections. The order of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups are:\n*   **p1**: Point group C1 (order 1)\n*   **p2**: Point group C2 (order 2)\n*   **pm**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **pg**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **cm**: Point group D1 (order 2)\n*   **pmm**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **pmg**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **pgg**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **cmm**: Point group D2 (order 4)\n*   **p4**: Point group C4 (order 4)\n*   **p4m**: Point group D4 (order 8)\n*   **p4g**: Point group D4 (order 8)\n*   **p3**: Point group C3 (order 3)\n*   **p3m1**: Point group D3 (order 6)\n*   **p31m**: Point group D3 (order 6)\n*   **p6**: Point group C6 (order 6)\n*   **p6m**: Point group D6 (order 12)\n\nThe point groups with an order of 2 are C2 and D1. The wallpaper groups associated with these point groups are:\n*   **p2** (point group C2)\n*   **pm** (point group D1)\n*   **pg** (point group D1)\n*   **cm** (point group D1)\n\nTherefore, there are four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
