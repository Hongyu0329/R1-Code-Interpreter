    "Let $S$ be the unit square, $ \\times$. We are looking for the maximum number of connected components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of $S$, say $A$ and $B$, whose union is $S$.\n\nLet's try to construct an example where the number of components in the intersection is an arbitrary integer $N$. This will show that there is no largest number.\n\nConsider the following construction for an odd number of components, $2n+1$, where $n$ is any positive integer.\n\nLet $\\epsilon$ be a small positive number, for instance, $\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{4n}$.\n\nDefine the set $A$ as the union of $n+1$ horizontal closed strips connected by a vertical bar on the left side:\n$A = \\left( \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n} \\times \\left[\\frac{2k}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}\\right] \\right) \\cup \\left( [0, \\epsilon] \\times \\right)$\nThis set $A$ is closed as it is a union of closed sets. It is also path-connected, and therefore connected, because all the horizontal strips are connected by the vertical bar on the left.\n\nDefine the set $B$ as the union of the remaining $n$ horizontal closed strips connected by a vertical bar on the right side:\n$B = \\left( \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n-1} \\times \\left[\\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+2}{2n+1}\\right] \\right) \\cup \\left( [1-\\epsilon, 1] \\times \\right)$\nThis set $B$ is also closed and connected for the same reasons.\n\nThe union of $A$ and $B$ is the entire unit square $S$.\n$A \\cup B = S$\n\nNow, let's analyze the intersection $A \\cap B$. The intersection consists of the parts of the connecting bars that fall into the strips of the other set.\nThe intersection is the union of two disjoint sets:\n1.  The intersection of the left connecting bar of $A$ with the horizontal strips of $B$:\n    $([0, \\epsilon] \\times) \\cap \\left( \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n-1} \\times \\left[\\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+2}{2n+1}\\right] \\right) = \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n-1} [0, \\epsilon] \\times \\left[\\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+2}{2n+1}\\right]$\n    This part consists of $n$ disjoint closed rectangles.\n\n2.  The intersection of the right connecting bar of $B$ with the horizontal strips of $A$:\n    $([1-\\epsilon, 1] \\times) \\cap \\left( \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n} \\times \\left[\\frac{2k}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}\\right] \\right) = \\bigcup_{k=0}^{n} [1-\\epsilon, 1] \\times \\left[\\frac{2k}{2n+1}, \\frac{2k+1}{2n+1}\\right]$\n    This part consists of $n+1$ disjoint closed rectangles.\n\nThe connecting bars themselves do not intersect, as we chose $\\epsilon < 1/2$. The set of $n$ rectangles on the left is disjoint from the set of $n+1$ rectangles on the right. Therefore, the intersection $A \\cap B$ is the disjoint union of $n + (n+1) = 2n+1$ closed rectangles. Each of these rectangles is a connected component.\n\nSince we can choose $n$ to be any positive integer, we can make the number of components, $2n+1$, arbitrarily large. For example, if we want 21 components, we can choose $n=10$.\n\nA similar construction can be made to achieve any even number of components. Therefore, there is no finite upper bound on the number of components.\n\n<<<âˆž>>>"
