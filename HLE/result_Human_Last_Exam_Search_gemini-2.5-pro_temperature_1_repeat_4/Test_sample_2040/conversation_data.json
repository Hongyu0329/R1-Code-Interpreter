    "## Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion in Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets: An Expectation of Absence Under Normal Conditions\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, in their pristine form, are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) upon excitation by incident light. This is due to the inherent crystal symmetry of the most stable borophene phases, which precludes the necessary second-order nonlinear optical effects.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit this phenomenon is a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which allows for a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\nTheoretical studies and experimental observations have shown that common, stable phases of free-standing borophene, such as the β₁₂ phase, possess a centrosymmetric crystal lattice. This means the material has inversion symmetry, and as a consequence, its second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Without a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, the process of SPDC cannot occur. Research into the nonlinear optical properties of pure boron nanosheets has primarily focused on third-order effects like nonlinear absorption, with no reports of second-order phenomena like SPDC. In a related example, theoretical calculations have shown that a bare boron carbide nanosheet has a first hyperpolarizability (a molecular analogue to χ⁽²⁾) of zero, only becoming non-zero with the introduction of doping elements that break the symmetry.\n\nWhile pristine, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit SPDC, it is theoretically possible to induce a non-zero second-order susceptibility. This can be achieved by breaking the inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice. Methods to achieve this include:\n\n*   **Interaction with a substrate:** The process of growing borophene on a substrate can induce a break in inversion symmetry.\n*   **Applying an external electric field:** An external electric field can also perturb the crystal structure and break the inversion symmetry.\n\nIf the inversion symmetry were to be broken by such external means, the resulting material could, in principle, exhibit a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ and potentially support spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, to date, there have been no experimental or direct theoretical predictions of SPDC in boron nanosheets, even under these symmetry-breaking conditions.\n\nIn contrast, other two-dimensional materials with inherently non-centrosymmetric structures, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have been shown to exhibit SPDC.\n\nTherefore, while the possibility of inducing the necessary properties for SPDC in boron nanosheets exists under specific external influences, free-standing boron nanosheets in their natural state are not expected to display this quantum optical phenomenon.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion under normal conditions due to their centrosymmetric crystal structure.>>>"
