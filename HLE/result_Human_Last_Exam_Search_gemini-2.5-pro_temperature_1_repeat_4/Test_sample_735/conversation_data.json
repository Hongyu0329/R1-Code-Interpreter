    "There are exactly 34 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. This is based on the work of Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart, who proved that any such group must have an order of at most 24. Their paper provides a complete classification, listing all such groups.\n\nThe groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C5, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15 (isomorphic to C3 x C5), C17, C19, C20, C21 (isomorphic to C3 x C7), C22, and C24.\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D10, D12, D14, D18, D22, and D24.\n*   **Dicyclic (or Quaternion) Groups:** Q12, Q16, Q20, and Q24.\n*   **Abelian Groups (non-cyclic):** C2 x C8, C4 x C4, and C2 x C9.\n*   **Other Non-Abelian Groups:** The alternating group A4, the special linear group SL(2,3), the direct product C2 x A4, and the semidirect products (C3 x C3) : C2 and C3 : C8.\n\nThis exhaustive list was compiled after proving that no group of order greater than 24 can possess a locally maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n<<<34>>>"
