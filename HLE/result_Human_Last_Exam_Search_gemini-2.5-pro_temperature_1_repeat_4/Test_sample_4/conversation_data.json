    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its homology groups, given by $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R}) x^k$. For a nilpotent Lie algebra, the computation can be performed using its cohomology, as there is a duality known as Poincaré duality, which states that $H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) \\cong H^{n-k}(\\mathfrak{g})$, where $n = \\dim \\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real nilpotent Lie algebra. Its structure allows for a decomposition that simplifies the calculation. It can be viewed as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{a} \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathfrak{a} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$ is a one-dimensional algebra and $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The action of $\\mathfrak{a}$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ is defined by the Lie brackets involving $e_1$.\n\nThe cohomology of such a semi-direct product can be computed using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence, which in this case simplifies considerably. The dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$, denoted $c_k$, can be determined from the cohomology of $\\mathfrak{h}$ and the action of $e_1$ on it.\n\nThe cohomology of the abelian Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ is its exterior algebra, $H^q(\\mathfrak{h}) = \\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$. The action of $e_1$ on $H^q(\\mathfrak{h})$ is induced by its adjoint action on $\\mathfrak{h}$. A detailed calculation of the dimensions of the kernel and image of this action on each level of the exterior algebra of $\\mathfrak{h}^*$ yields the dimensions of the cohomology groups of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe dimensions of the cohomology groups, $c_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$, are found to be:\n*   $c_0 = 1$\n*   $c_1 = 3$\n*   $c_2 = 6$\n*   $c_3 = 8$\n*   $c_4 = 6$\n*   $c_5 = 3$\n*   $c_6 = 1$\n\nThe cohomology Poincaré polynomial is therefore $P_\\mathfrak{g}^{\\text{coho}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\nDue to Poincaré duality for this Lie algebra, the dimensions of the homology groups are given by $b_k = \\dim H_k(\\mathfrak{g}) = c_{6-k}$. This means the homology Poincaré polynomial is identical to the cohomology Poincaré polynomial because the sequence of Betti numbers is palindromic.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (x+1)^2 (x^4 + x^3 + 3x^2 + x + 1)$\n\n<<<$(x+1)^2(x^4+x^3+3x^2+x+1)$>>>"
