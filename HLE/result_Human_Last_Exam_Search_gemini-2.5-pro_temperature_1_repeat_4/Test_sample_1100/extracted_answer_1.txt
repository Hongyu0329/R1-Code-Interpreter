The new diet is important because it is likely rich in fava beans, a natural source of L-DOPA. L-DOPA is a precursor to dopamine, and its consumption is likely a form of self-medication to replace the withdrawn dopamine agonist drug. This is crucial for controlling an underlying, undiagnosed pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) that was being inadvertently treated by the medication and which likely caused the woman's severe postpartum symptoms.
