    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a cycloaddition product. Specifically, it undergoes a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the Diels-Alder reaction.\n\nIn this reaction, butadiene acts as the conjugated diene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene serves as the dienophile. The reaction leads to the formation of a six-membered ring.\n\nThe product of this reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows: the four pi electrons from butadiene and the two pi electrons from 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene rearrange to form a new six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds and one new pi bond.\n\nWhile Diels-Alder reactions are a common pathway for conjugated dienes, some fluoroalkenes can also undergo [2+2] cycloadditions, which would result in a four-membered ring. In the case of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, the primary and most commonly cited product under typical Diels-Alder conditions is the [4+2] cycloadduct. Studies have shown that while a [2+2] adduct can form, it is often the kinetic product and can rearrange to the more stable [4+2] adduct under thermal conditions.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is primarily **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**, formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction)."
