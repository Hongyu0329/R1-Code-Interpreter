    "### Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas Found in Zapotec Civilization\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on Monument 3, a carved stone from San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. This artifact, attributed to the Zapotec civilization, dates to around 600 BCE.\n\nThe monument depicts a slain captive, and between his legs are glyphs that have been interpreted as his name, \"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion.\" This represents a day in the 260-day ritual calendar used by various Mesoamerican cultures. This makes it the earliest known calendrical record in the Americas. Recent radiocarbon dating places the monument no later than 630–560 BCE.\n\nWhile the Olmec civilization produced what is considered the oldest writing in the Americas, the Cascajal Block, dated to around 900 BCE, it does not contain any known calendrical dates. The glyphs on the Cascajal Block are still largely undeciphered.\n\nLater Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Epi-Olmec and the Maya, developed more complex calendrical systems, including the Long Count calendar. The earliest known Long Count date is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, an Epi-Olmec site, which corresponds to 36 BCE. The Maya also used the Long Count calendar, with their earliest recorded dates appearing later than the Zapotec example.\n\nTherefore, the Zapotec inscription on Monument 3 from San José Mogote remains the earliest identified instance of a specific date being recorded in a native writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas.\n\n<<<\"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion\", around 600 BCE>>>"
