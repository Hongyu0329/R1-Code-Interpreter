    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit and then its uncertainty in momentum based on the given uncertainty in position.\n\n### 1. Momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit\n\nThe angular momentum (L) of an electron in the nth Bohr orbit is quantized and given by the formula:\nL = nħ\nwhere n is the principal quantum number and ħ is the reduced Planck constant (h/2π).\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, n = 1, so the angular momentum is:\nL = 1 * ħ = ħ\n\nThe angular momentum is also defined as L = mvr = pr, where p is the linear momentum and r is the radius of the orbit. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n\nTherefore, the momentum (p) of the electron is:\np = L / r = ħ / a₀\n\nThe values for the reduced Planck constant (ħ) and the Bohr radius (a₀) are approximately:\n*   ħ ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   a₀ ≈ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nNow, we can calculate the momentum:\np ≈ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### 2. Uncertainty of the momentum\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant. The principle is expressed as:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nWe are given the uncertainty in the position of the electron:\nΔx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nWe can now calculate the minimum uncertainty in the momentum (Δp):\nΔp ≥ ħ / (2 * Δx)\nΔp ≥ (1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\nΔp ≥ 5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### 3. Ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio ≈ (5.27 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.645\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
