The assertion that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is a nuanced issue. Strictly speaking, the first postulate alone is insufficient to derive the second. The principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, is also compatible with Galilean relativity, where the speed of light is not constant.

However, if one accepts Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism as fundamental laws of physics, then the first postulate implies the second. Maxwell's equations predict a constant speed for electromagnetic waves (light). If these equations are to have the same form in all inertial frames, as required by the first postulate, then the speed of light must be constant for all inertial observers.

Alternative formulations of special relativity have shown that it is possible to derive the theory from the principle of relativity along with other assumptions like the isotropy and homogeneity of space. These "single-postulate" approaches demonstrate that the core structure of special relativity, including a universal speed limit, can be established without directly postulating the constancy of the speed of light. In this context, the speed of light becomes an experimentally determined value for this universal limit.

Historically, Einstein chose to present two distinct postulates to provide a clear and solid axiomatic basis for his theory. This approach sidestepped the then-ongoing debates about the exact nature of electromagnetism and the luminiferous aether.

In summary, it is not entirely accurate to say the second postulate is simply superfluous. While it can be derived from the first postulate in conjunction with Maxwell's equations, it is not a consequence of the first postulate in isolation. The relationship between the two postulates highlights the deep consistency between the principle of relativity and the laws of electromagnetism.
