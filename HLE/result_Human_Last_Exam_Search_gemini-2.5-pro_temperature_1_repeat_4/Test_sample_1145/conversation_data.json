    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box is determined by its wave function. For a particle in the n=2 state, the wave function, ψ₂(x), has a node at the center of the box (x = a/2), meaning the probability of finding the particle at this exact point is zero. The specified interval from 0.495a to 0.505a is centered around this node. Therefore, the probability of finding the particle within this small interval is expected to be very low.\n\nTo find the probability, we must integrate the probability density, |ψ₂(x)|², over the given interval. The wave function for the n=2 state of a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density is:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability (P) of finding the particle in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is calculated by the integral:\nP = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nSince the interval is very small, we can approximate the value by considering the behavior of the sine function near the node at x = a/2. By performing an integration using a Taylor series expansion of the probability density function around x = a/2, we arrive at the following approximation:\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\nThis calculation yields a probability of approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶. This confirms that there is a very small, but non-zero, chance of finding the particle in the specified interval close to the node.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
