    "It is not possible to provide a definitive number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized or consistently defined term in ballet vocabulary. While some online sources, particularly on social media platforms like TikTok, demonstrate a specific sequence described as \"pas de Balanchine\" (often a jump followed by two steps), this is not a universally accepted definition.\n\nFurthermore, William Forsythe's choreographic style, while heavily influenced by the speed, dynamism, and off-balance aesthetic of George Balanchine, is a deconstruction and evolution of the neoclassical form. His work is characterized by its complex and rapid sequences, making it challenging to isolate and count individual, non-standardized steps without a definitive choreographic guide.\n\nA video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman solo\" with the Semperoper Ballett on November 9, 2015, is available online. However, a precise count of any specific step, including a non-standard one like the \"pas de Balanchine,\" would require a detailed choreographic analysis or a step-by-step breakdown of the solo, which is not publicly available. Reviews and articles about the performance praise Gileva's execution of Forsythe's demanding choreography but do not offer a technical description of the steps performed.\n\nTherefore, without a clear, universally accepted definition of \"pas de Balanchine\" and a detailed choreographic score for this specific performance, any attempt to provide a number would be speculative.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the 'pas de Balanchines' performed as the term is not a standardized ballet step and a detailed choreographic breakdown of the specified performance is not available.>>>"
