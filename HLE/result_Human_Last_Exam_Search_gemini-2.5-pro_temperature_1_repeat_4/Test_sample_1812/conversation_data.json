    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix A, we can use several methods.\n\nThe matrix is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nWe can expand along the first row:\ndet(A) = 2 * det([[2, -1], [-1, 2]]) - (-1) * det([[-1, -1], [-1, 2]]) + (-1) * det([[-1, 2], [-1, -1]])\n= 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + 1 * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - 1 * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))\n= 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\n= 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\n= 6 - 6 = 0\n\n**Method 2: Row Operations**\n\nA property of determinants is that if we add a multiple of one row to another row, the determinant does not change. We can add the second and third rows to the first row (R1 -> R1 + R2 + R3):\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2+(-1)+(-1) & -1+2+(-1) & -1+(-1)+2 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSince the resulting matrix has a row of zeros, its determinant is 0.\n\n**Method 3: Eigenvalues**\n\nThe sum of each row of the matrix is 0:\n2 - 1 - 1 = 0\n-1 + 2 - 1 = 0\n-1 - 1 + 2 = 0\nThis implies that the vector is an eigenvector of the matrix with an eigenvalue of 0. Since one of the eigenvalues is 0, the determinant, which is the product of all eigenvalues, must be 0.\n\nThe reference to the \"Markov quiver for m_1/2 = 13\" specifies the context in which this matrix arises. The Markov equation is x² + y² + z² = 3xyz, and 13 is a Markov number, being part of the solution (1, 5, 13). The provided matrix A is the generalized Cartan matrix for a specific quiver related to this context. However, this information is not necessary for the calculation of the determinant of the explicitly given matrix.\n\n<<<0>>>"
