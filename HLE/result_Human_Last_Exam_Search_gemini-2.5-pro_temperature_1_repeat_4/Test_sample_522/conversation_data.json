    "The solution to the puzzle is found by identifying the rule that transforms the input grids into the output grids. The transformation follows a specific, consistent logic across all provided examples.\n\n### The Transformation Rule\n\nThe puzzle involves a grid of numbers where a single character '2' changes its position according to a set of prioritized rules. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the '2'**: In each input, there is a single cell containing the number '2'.\n2.  **'2' Becomes '0'**: The cell that originally contains the '2' is changed to a '0'.\n3.  **'2' Moves to a '0'**: The '2' then \"moves\" to a new cell. This destination cell must originally contain a '0' and must be one of the eight immediate neighbors (including diagonals) of the '2's original position.\n4.  **Prioritized Movement**: The direction of the move is determined by a priority list. The '2' will move to the first available neighboring '0' cell based on the following directional priority:\n    1.  North-East (NE)\n    2.  North-West (NW)\n    3.  (The full order of priority is not required to solve the given puzzles, but a consistent order like SE, SW, N, E, S, W would follow).\n5.  **Final State**: The destination '0' cell becomes a '2', and the original '2' cell becomes a '0'. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Puzzle\n\nLet's apply this rule to `Input_C` to determine the value of `MISSING`.\n\n**Input_C**: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n\nThis can be visualized as the following grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 2 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n1.  The '2' is located at row 1, column 4 (using 0-based indexing).\n2.  We check its neighbors for a '0' based on the directional priority:\n    *   **Priority 1: North-East (NE)**. The cell to the North-East of (1, 4) is (0, 5). The value at this position is '0'.\n3.  Since the first priority direction (NE) points to a valid '0' cell, the move is determined.\n4.  The '2' moves from (1, 4) to (0, 5).\n    *   The value at (1, 4) changes from '2' to '0'.\n    *   The value at (0, 5) changes from '0' to '2'.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nConverting this grid back to the string format gives the final answer.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
