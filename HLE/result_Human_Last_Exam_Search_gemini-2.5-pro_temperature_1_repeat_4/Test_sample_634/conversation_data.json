    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm. A matrix R is a right divisor of a matrix P if there exists a polynomial matrix Q such that P = Q * R. The GCRD is a common right divisor that is a left multiple of any other common right divisor.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can test a candidate matrix to see if it is a common right divisor. Let's test the matrix G = [, [-s-1, 1]].\n\nFirst, we check if G is a right divisor of P2. We need to find a polynomial matrix Q2 such that P2 = Q2 * G.\n[[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [, [-s - 1, 1]]\nThis matrix equation leads to the following system of linear equations for the elements of Q2:\n*   `s = q11 * 1 + q12 * (-s - 1)`\n*   `0 = q11 * 0 + q12 * 1  => q12 = 0`\n*   `-s - 1 = q21 * 1 + q22 * (-s - 1)`\n*   `1 = q21 * 0 + q22 * 1  => q22 = 1`\n\nSubstituting `q12 = 0` into the first equation gives `s = q11`.\nSubstituting `q22 = 1` into the third equation gives `-s - 1 = q21 - (s + 1)`, which simplifies to `q21 = 0`.\nThus, the quotient matrix is Q2 = [[s, 0],], which is a valid polynomial matrix. So, G is a right divisor of P2.\n\nNext, we check if G is a right divisor of P1. We need to find a polynomial matrix Q1 such that P1 = Q1 * G.\n[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[q11, q12], [q21, q22]] * [, [-s - 1, 1]]\nThis leads to the following system of equations for the elements of Q1:\n*   `s^2 + s = q11 - q12 * (s + 1)`\n*   `-s = q12`\n*   `-s^2 - 1 = q21 - q22 * (s + 1)`\n*   `s^2 = q22`\n\nSubstituting `q12 = -s` into the first equation gives `s^2 + s = q11 - (-s)(s + 1) = q11 + s^2 + s`, which simplifies to `q11 = 0`.\nSubstituting `q22 = s^2` into the third equation gives `-s^2 - 1 = q21 - s^2(s + 1) = q21 - s^3 - s^2`, which simplifies to `q21 = s^3 - 1`.\nThe quotient matrix is Q1 = [[0, -s], [s^3 - 1, s^2]], which is a valid polynomial matrix. So, G is also a right divisor of P1.\n\nSince G is a common right divisor of both P1 and P2, we must determine if it is the *greatest* common right divisor. The determinant of G is `det(G) = 1*1 - 0*(-s-1) = 1`. A polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant is called a unimodular matrix.\n\nIf a common right divisor is unimodular, it is a greatest common right divisor. Any other common right divisor D must be a right divisor of G, meaning G = M * D for some polynomial matrix M. This implies `det(G) = det(M) * det(D)`. Since `det(G) = 1`, `det(D)` must be a constant, meaning any other common right divisor must also be unimodular.\n\nTherefore, the matrix `G = [[1, 0], [-s-1, 1]]` is a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2. It is important to note that any left unimodular multiple of G is also a valid GCRD. For instance, the identity matrix `I = [[1,0],[0,1]]` is also a GCRD in this case, as it is related to G by a unimodular transformation (`I = G^-1 * G`).\n\n<<<[, [-s-1, 1]]>>>"
