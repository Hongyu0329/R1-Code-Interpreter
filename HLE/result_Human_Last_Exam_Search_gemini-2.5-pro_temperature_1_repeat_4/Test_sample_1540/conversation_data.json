    "To solve this competitive programming problem with the highest memory efficiency in C, we need to compare two strings lexicographically while ignoring the case of the letters. The goal is to use the minimum amount of memory for variables.\n\n### The C Program\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare two character arrays to store the strings.\n    // The maximum length is 100, so 101 bytes are needed for each\n    // to include the null terminator ('\\0').\n    char str1[101];\n    char str2[101];\n\n    // Read the two strings from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", str1);\n    scanf(\"%s\", str2);\n\n    // Use a 'char' for the loop counter as the string length is at most 100,\n    // which fits within the range of a char.\n    char i = 0;\n\n    // Loop through the strings character by character.\n    // The loop terminates at the end of the string (null character).\n    while (str1[i]) {\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.\n        if (tolower(str1[i]) < tolower(str2[i])) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (tolower(str1[i]) > tolower(str2[i])) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe problem requires calculating the total memory in bytes used for the variables in the program. The `sizeof` operator in C can determine the size of any data type.\n\n1.  **`char str1[101];`**: The input strings can have a maximum length of 100. In C, a string is terminated by a null character (`\\0`), so we need an array of size 101 to store it. The `char` data type occupies 1 byte.\n    *   Memory for `str1` = 101 characters * 1 byte/character = 101 bytes.\n\n2.  **`char str2[101];`**: Similarly, the second string requires another 101 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `str2` = 101 characters * 1 byte/character = 101 bytes.\n\n3.  **`char i = 0;`**: A loop counter is needed to iterate through the strings. Since the maximum length is 100, the counter will go from 0 to 99. The `char` data type, which is 1 byte, is sufficient to store this range of values, making it the most memory-efficient choice for the counter.\n    *   Memory for `i` = 1 byte.\n\nBy summing the memory used by these variables, we get the total memory `m`:\n\nm = (size of `str1`) + (size of `str2`) + (size of `i`)\nm = 101 + 101 + 1\nm = 203 bytes\n\nThis program is maximally memory-efficient because it uses the smallest possible data types for its variables while correctly solving the problem. The buffers for the strings are necessary as the comparison requires indexed access to both strings simultaneously.\n\n<<<203>>>"
