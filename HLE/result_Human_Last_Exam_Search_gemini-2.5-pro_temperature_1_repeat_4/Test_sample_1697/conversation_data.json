    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by quenching with methyl iodide, yields **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation occurs via a process known as directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt₂) on the benzene ring is a powerful directed metalation group (DMG). It is a stronger directing group than the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) also present on the ring. The Lewis basic oxygen atom of the amide coordinates to the lithium atom of the sec-BuLi. This coordination brings the strong base into proximity with the proton at the ortho position (C2), facilitating its removal (deprotonation). TMEDA is a chelating agent that enhances the basicity of the alkyllithium reagent, making the deprotonation more efficient. This step forms a lithiated intermediate at the C2 position.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The resulting aryllithium compound is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The carbanion at C2 attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion in an S_N2 reaction.\n\nThe net result is the selective substitution of the hydrogen atom at the position ortho to the N,N-diethylamido group with a methyl group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
