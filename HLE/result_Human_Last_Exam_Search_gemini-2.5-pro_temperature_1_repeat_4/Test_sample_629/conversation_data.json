    "The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot is 3. We are therefore looking for the number of distinct 3x3 grid diagrams that represent the left-hand trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalent.\n\nThe trefoil knot is the only prime knot with a crossing number of three. A key invariant of a knot is its grid number, which is the smallest integer 'n' for which the knot can be represented on an n x n grid. For the trefoil knot, this number is 3.\n\nThe number of minimal grid diagrams for a knot is the same as for its mirror image. This means the left-hand trefoil knot has the same number of minimal grid diagrams as the right-hand trefoil knot.\n\nFor the right-handed trefoil knot, there are two minimal grid diagrams, up to translation and rotation. Consequently, the left-handed trefoil knot also has two such diagrams.\n\n<<<B>>>"
