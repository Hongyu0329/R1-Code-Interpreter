    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The first successful synthesis of XeF₄ was achieved by reacting xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel vessel heated to 400°C. This method is reported to yield good amounts of the compound.\n\nThe synthesis is typically performed under the following conditions:\n*   **Reactants:** Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) in a 1:5 molar ratio.\n*   **Temperature:** 400°C (which is 673 Kelvin).\n*   **Pressure:** Approximately 6 to 7 bar.\n*   **Reaction Vessel:** A sealed nickel container is used, as it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface.\n\nThis direct combination of the elements is an exothermic reaction, releasing 251 kJ/mol of energy. While the reaction can proceed over a range of temperatures (e.g., 300-500°C), 400°C is the standard and commonly cited temperature for an efficient production process. Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂), while higher temperatures and excess fluorine favor xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), making the process less efficient for isolating pure XeF₄. Other methods, such as using an electric discharge, have been noted but often result in contamination with XeF₂. Therefore, the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently through the standard, established method is 400°C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
