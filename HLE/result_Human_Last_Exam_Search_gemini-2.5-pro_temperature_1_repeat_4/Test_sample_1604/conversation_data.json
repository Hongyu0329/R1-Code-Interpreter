    "From the initial search results, I have a list of several of Lady Butler's battle paintings. I will now identify the battles and their dates.\n\n*   ***The Roll Call (Calling the Roll After An Engagement, Crimea)***: Depicts a scene after the Battle of Inkerman (1854) during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras (1815) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Balaclava***: Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava (1854) during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Return from Inkerman***: Depicts a scene after the Battle of Inkerman (1854).\n*   ***Remnants of an Army***: Depicts William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad in 1842, the sole survivor of a 16,000-strong army from the First Anglo-Afghan War. The painting itself is from 1879.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879) during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo (1815).\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir***: Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir (1882).\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek (1881) during the First Boer War.\n*   ***The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj***: Depicts a cavalry charge at the Battle of Huj (1917) during World War I.\n*   ***Retreat From Mons***: Depicts the retreat from the Battle of Mons (1914) during World War I.\n\nNow I will list the battles and their dates to find the latest one:\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n*   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n*   First Anglo-Afghan War (depicted in *Remnants of an Army*): 1842\n*   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n*   Battle of Balaclava: 1854\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n*   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n*   Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n*   Battle of Mons: 1914\n*   Battle of Huj: 1917\n\nBased on this, the Battle of Huj in 1917 is the latest historical battle.\n\nI need to confirm this with another search to ensure I haven't missed any other paintings of later battles.The previous searches have confirmed that Lady Butler painted scenes from World War I. I have identified *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj* which depicts a battle in 1917. I have also seen mentions of *Retreat From Mons* (1914) and a painting of the London Irish Rifles at Loos (1915). To be absolutely certain, I will do one more search to see if she painted any other scenes from World War I that might be later than November 1917.The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler was the Battle of Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917. The painting is titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nElizabeth Butler, a prominent British painter of military scenes, created works depicting various historical conflicts. While she painted scenes from the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the Anglo-Zulu War, her work also extended to the First World War.\n\nAmong her World War I paintings are depictions of the Battle of Mons in 1914 (*Retreat From Mons*) and the Battle of Loos in 1915 (a watercolour of the London Irish Rifles). However, the charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj in Palestine during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I is the latest specific historical battle she is known to have painted. This engagement is notable for being one of the last classic cavalry charges in British military history.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
