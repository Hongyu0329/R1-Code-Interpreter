    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is a pericyclic reaction governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which are encapsulated in the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis based on FMO theory to predict the ratio of the cis-isomer (A) and trans-isomer (B):\n\n1.  **Electron Count**: The reactant, deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, is a conjugated polyene with four π-bonds. Therefore, it is an 8π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, systems with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case) undergo electrocyclization via a specific mechanism under thermal conditions.\n\n2.  **Selection Rule for Thermal Reaction**: For a 4n π-electron system, thermal electrocyclic reactions proceed in a **conrotatory** manner. This means that the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond with constructive orbital overlap in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**: The stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, determines the stereochemistry of the product. We must examine the orientation of the substituents at the termini of the conjugated system (C2 and C9).\n    *   At the C2=C3 double bond, the configuration is *Z*. This places the methyl group on C2 on the \"inside\" of the carbon chain as it begins to coil.\n    *   At the C8=C9 double bond, the configuration is *E*. This places the methyl group on C9 on the \"outside\" of the carbon chain.\n\n4.  **Predicting the Product Stereochemistry**: During the conrotatory ring closure, the \"inward\" pointing methyl group at C2 and the \"outward\" pointing methyl group at C9 will rotate in the same direction.\n    *   If both ends rotate clockwise, the inward methyl group at C2 moves \"up,\" while the outward methyl group at C9 moves \"down.\" This results in a *trans* configuration of the methyl groups in the product.\n    *   If both ends rotate counter-clockwise, the inward methyl group at C2 moves \"down,\" while the outward methyl group at C9 moves \"up.\" This also results in a *trans* configuration.\n\nTherefore, the conrotatory cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is predicted to yield exclusively the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n\n5.  **Formation of the Cis-Isomer**: The formation of the *cis*-isomer (A) would require a **disrotatory** ring closure. For an 8π-electron system under thermal conditions, the disrotatory pathway is symmetry-forbidden according to FMO theory. This means the transition state for the disrotatory process has a much higher activation energy than the allowed conrotatory pathway.\n\n6.  **Predicted Ratio**: Since FMO theory predicts that the conrotatory pathway is \"allowed\" and the disrotatory pathway is \"forbidden,\" the reaction is expected to be highly stereospecific. The theory predicts that only the product from the allowed pathway, the trans-isomer (B), will be formed. The formation of the cis-isomer (A) is predicted to be negligible. While in reality, \"forbidden\" reactions may occur to a very small extent, the theoretical prediction based on FMO is a ratio of 0 for the forbidden product.\n\nThus, the predicted ratio of isomer A (cis) to isomer B (trans) is 0:1.\n\n<<<0:1>>>"
