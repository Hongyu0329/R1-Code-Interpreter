    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a solver must observe a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThe process of identifying the specific PLL case out of the 21 possibilities relies on recognizing patterns formed by the stickers on the side faces of the last layer. These patterns are typically identified by looking at two adjacent sides of the cube. This technique, known as 2-Sided PLL Recognition, allows the solver to determine the permutation of the corners and edges of the final layer without needing to see all four sides.\n\nThe five stickers that provide the necessary information are typically from the three visible corner pieces and the two visible edge pieces on the two adjacent faces being observed. By analyzing the colors and relative positions of these five stickers, a solver can distinguish between all possible PLL scenarios. Common visual cues include \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color on one face), bars of solved pieces, and checkerboard patterns. While it is possible to see six stickers on two adjacent faces (three on each side face, not including the top layer), one of them is redundant for the purpose of unique case identification.\n\n<<<5>>>"
