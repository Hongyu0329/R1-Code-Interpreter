    "An equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" in French would be \"Bec-de-Sureau,\" which translates to \"beak of elder\" or \"elder-beak.\" This translation is based on the etymological components of the Gaulish name.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is composed of two distinct Gaulish elements:\n\n*   **\"Odo-\"**: This root is linked to the Gaulish word *odocos*, which refers to the elder tree (*sureau* in French). An earlier, less substantiated suggestion pointed to a meaning related to smell, but the connection to \"elder\" is more strongly supported by etymological sources.\n*   **\"-beccus\"**: This is the Gaulish word for \"beak\" (*bec* in French). The term was later adopted into Latin and has survived in the modern French language.\n\nThe historical figure Odobeccus (also spelled Edobicus or Edobichus) was a general in the service of the usurper Constantine III in Gaul during the early 5th century.\n\nAn initial informal source suggested the French equivalent as \"Sent-du-Bec,\" with the meaning \"one that has bad breath.\" This appears to be a folk etymology based on the modern French verb *sentir* (to smell) or the pejorative term *puer* (to stink), as seen in the expression \"pue-du-bec\" (one with bad breath). However, this interpretation does not align with the Gaulish origin of \"odo-\".\n\nTherefore, a more accurate and etymologically sound French equivalent for \"Odobeccus\" is \"Bec-de-Sureau,\" reflecting the meaning \"elder-beak.\"\n\n<<<Bec-de-Sureau>>>"
