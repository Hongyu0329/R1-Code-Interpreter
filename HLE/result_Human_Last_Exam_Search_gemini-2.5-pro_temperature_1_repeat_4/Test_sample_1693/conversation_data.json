    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the steam tanker **Monique**. The vessel was sunk on June 22, 1940, by the German submarine U-65.\n\nThe *Monique*, a steam tanker with a tonnage of 7,011 GRT, was attacked in the Bay of Biscay, approximately 70 miles southwest of Penmarch. The U-65, commanded by Hans-Gerrit von Stockhausen, fired two torpedoes which caused the tanker to be engulfed in flames and break apart before sinking.\n\nThe sinking of the *Monique* occurred at 18:04 local time. This was just over half an hour before the signing of the Franco-German Armistice at Compi√®gne, which took place at 18:36 on the same day.\n\nOther French vessels were sunk by U-boats in the period leading up to the armistice, but they were of a smaller displacement. For instance, the submarine *Doris*, with a tonnage of 525/765 tons, was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940. The steam merchant *Quiberon*, at 1,296 tons, was sunk by U-59 on January 19, 1940.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
