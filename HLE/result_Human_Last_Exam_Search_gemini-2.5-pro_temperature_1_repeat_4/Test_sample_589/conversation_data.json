    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 2017 supernatural horror film *It*, based on Stephen King's novel of the same name.\n\nThe character in question is Beverly Marsh (played by Sophia Lillis), a member of the \"Losers' Club.\" The film was produced by New Line Cinema, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Pictures, which is a major film studio.\n\nWhile there are several scenes featuring bicycles, the specific moment of Beverly riding her pinkish-red bike head-on towards a car is a key character-defining moment. The bikes used in the film were period-correct for the 1980s setting.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
