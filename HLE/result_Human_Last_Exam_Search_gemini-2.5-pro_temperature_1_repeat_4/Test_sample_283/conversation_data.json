    "During a matrix multiplication involving a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of depth 4, a specific number of submatrices are accessed. The structure of an HSS matrix is represented by a binary tree, and operations like matrix multiplication are performed by traversing this tree.\n\nFor an HSS tree with a given depth *d*, the number of submatrices accessed during matrix evaluation can be calculated using a specific formula. This formula accounts for all the submatrices, including the diagonal blocks, that are involved in the computation.\n\nThe formula to determine the number of accessed submatrices is:\n2<sup>(d+2)</sup> + 2<sup>(d+1)</sup> + 2d - 6.\n\nGiven a tree depth of *d* = 4, the calculation is as follows:\n2<sup>(4+2)</sup> + 2<sup>(4+1)</sup> + 2(4) - 6\n= 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> + 8 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 2\n= 98\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 98 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<98>>>"
