    "### The three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic, the Aeneid, are the Don, the Aras, and the Kuban.\n\nThese rivers, all significant waterways in the ancient world, are referenced in the epic poem alongside the more central Italian rivers and mythological streams of the underworld. Their inclusion reflects the geographical scope of the world known to the Romans and adds to the grandeur of Aeneas's prophesied Roman destiny.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Don River**, known in antiquity as the Tana√Øs. It flows for approximately 1,870 kilometers (about 1,162 miles) through modern-day Russia to the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe second longest is the **Aras River**, referred to by its ancient Greek name, the Araxes. This river, which is 1,072 kilometers (about 666 miles) long, flows through modern-day Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. Virgil mentions it in the context of the far-reaching power of Rome.\n\nThe third in this list is the **Kuban River**, which was known in antiquity as the Hypanis. It has a length of approximately 870 to 906 kilometers (about 540 to 563 miles) and flows through southern Russia into the Sea of Azov.\n\nOther notable real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the Hebrus (modern-day Maritsa), with a length of about 480 to 530 kilometers, the Tiber, the primary river of Rome, which is about 405 kilometers long, and the significantly shorter Aufidus (modern Ofanto) at around 134 to 170 kilometers and the Timavus with a short surface course of 2 kilometers. While the rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx and Acheron, play a significant symbolic role in the epic, they are mythological and do not have a measurable length in the real world.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Don, the Aras, and the Kuban.>>>"
