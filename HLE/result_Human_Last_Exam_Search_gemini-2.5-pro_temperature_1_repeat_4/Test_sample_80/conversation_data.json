    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. This is calculated by summing the squares on all four sides (8+8+8+8) and subtracting the four corner squares that are counted twice (32 - 4 = 28), or by summing the top and bottom rows (8+8) and the remaining squares on the left and right columns (6+6), which also equals 28.\n\nBishops move diagonally and can only attack pieces on squares of the same color. To place the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares without any of them attacking each other, they must all be placed on squares of the same color.\n\nThe 28 edge squares of a chessboard are evenly divided between the two colors, meaning there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares. By placing a bishop on every edge square of the same color, none of the bishops can attack each other. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14.\n\nIf the two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, they would have placed 14 bishops. The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of placed bishops.\n\nTherefore, 28 total edge squares - 14 placed bishops = 14 edge squares lacking bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
