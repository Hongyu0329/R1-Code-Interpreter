    "The number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is three.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of this result:\n\n### 1. Identifying the Knots\nFirst, we must identify all knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are:\n*   **The unknot (0₁):** The simple loop, with zero crossings.\n*   **The trefoil knot (3₁):** The simplest non-trivial knot, with three crossings. It exists in two mirror-image forms: right-handed and left-handed.\n*   **The figure-eight knot (4₁):** The only knot with four crossings.\n\n### 2. Understanding Integral Surgery and the Homology Cobordism Group\nFor a 3-manifold to represent an element in the integral homology cobordism group, it must be an integral homology 3-sphere. This means its first homology group, H₁(M; ℤ), must be the trivial group, just like the 3-sphere (S³).\n\nWhen performing an integral surgery on a knot K with an integer coefficient *n* (denoted as *n*-surgery), the resulting 3-manifold has a first homology group of H₁(M; ℤ) = ℤ/*n*ℤ. For this to be a homology sphere, the group must be trivial, which requires |*n*| = 1. Therefore, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries on these knots.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Each Knot\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** Performing a +1 or -1 surgery on the unknot results in the 3-sphere, S³. The 3-sphere is the identity element (the trivial element) in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is amphichiral, meaning it is identical to its mirror image. The homology spheres resulting from both +1 and -1 surgery on the figure-eight knot are homology cobordant to S³. This means they also represent the **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, with distinct right-handed and left-handed versions.\n    *   **+1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil** produces the famous **Poincaré homology sphere**, often denoted as Σ(2,3,5). This manifold has a non-trivial Rochlin invariant, which proves it is not homology cobordant to S³ and thus represents a **non-trivial element** of the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **-1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil** produces the mirror image of the Poincaré sphere, which represents the **inverse element** in the group.\n    *   Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil produce the same elements: +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil yields the inverse of the Poincaré sphere, and -1 surgery yields the Poincaré sphere itself.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy examining all possible integral surgeries on knots with at most four crossings, we find three distinct elements in the homology cobordism group:\n1.  **The trivial element:** Represented by surgery on the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n2.  **The Poincaré homology sphere:** A non-trivial element from surgery on the trefoil knot.\n3.  **The inverse of the Poincaré homology sphere:** The distinct inverse element, also from surgery on the trefoil knot.\n\nTherefore, a total of three elements can be represented.\n\n<<<3>>>"
