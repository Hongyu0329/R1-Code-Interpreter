    "This sequence is based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe letters Z, X, C, V, B, and N are the first six letters on the bottom row of the keyboard, read from left to right. Although your provided sequence includes a duplicate \"X\" and a \"Y\" (which is on the top row), these appear to be distractors in a common puzzle format. The underlying pattern follows the bottom row of keys.\n\nThe order of the letter keys on the bottom row is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M. Therefore, the letter that should appear next is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
