In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G_0 has a direct inverse functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. In the energy-momentum representation, this is expressed as G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη), where ħω is the energy and iη is an infinitesimal term for causality.
