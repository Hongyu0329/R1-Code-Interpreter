    "The line is an iambic senarius, a common meter in Terence's plays consisting of six iambic feet. The scansion of this particular line is complex due to several metrical phenomena common in Roman comedy, such as elision and syllabic substitutions.\n\nThe scansion is as follows:\n\nL S S | S L | S L | L L | S S L | S S\n\n***\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti bi` (L S S) - A dactyl, a common substitution for the first foot. The initial syllable \"et\" is long by position.\n*   **Foot 2:** `ben' es-` (S L) - An iamb. The final 'e' of `bene` is elided with the initial 'e' of `esse`.\n*   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` (S L) - An iamb.\n*   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` (L L) - A spondee, a frequent substitution.\n*   **Foot 5:** `si bi sit` (S S L) - An anapest, another common substitution.\n*   **Foot 6:** `ma le` (S S) - A pyrrhic. The final foot of an iambic senarius is typically an iamb (S L). This ending is irregular, though metrical licenses are frequent in comic verse.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
