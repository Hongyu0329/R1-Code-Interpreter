    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, a power subgroup is a subgroup that is the set of all n-th powers of elements of the group for some integer n. The number of such distinct subgroups is 7.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 can be described by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe elements of Q_128 consist of powers of 'a' and elements of the form aⁱx. The order of aⁱ is 64/gcd(i, 64), and the order of any element aⁱx is 4.\n\nA power subgroup is of the form Gⁿ = {gⁿ | g ∈ G} for some integer n. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\nLet's analyze the subgroups Gⁿ for different values of n:\n*   **n is odd:** For any odd n, Gⁿ = G. This is because the mapping g → gⁿ is a bijection on the cyclic subgroup <a>, and it also maps the set of other elements {aⁱx} to itself. Thus, for any odd n, the power subgroup is Q_128 itself.\n*   **n = 2:** The squares of the elements are:\n    *   (aⁱ)² = a²ⁱ, which generate the cyclic subgroup <a²> of order 32 (C₃₂).\n    *   (aⁱx)² = a³², which is an element in <a²>.\n    Thus, G² = <a²>.\n*   **n = 4:** The fourth powers of the elements are:\n    *   (aⁱ)⁴ = a⁴ⁱ, which generate the cyclic subgroup <a⁴> of order 16 (C₁₆).\n    *   (aⁱx)⁴ = 1, which is in <a⁴>.\n    Thus, G⁴ = <a⁴>.\n*   **n = 2ᵏ:** In general, for n = 2ᵏ where k ≥ 1, the power subgroup G²ᵏ is the cyclic subgroup <a²ᵏ>.\n\nThis gives us the following distinct power subgroups:\n1.  G¹ = Q₁₂₈\n2.  G² = <a²> (cyclic group of order 32)\n3.  G⁴ = <a⁴> (cyclic group of order 16)\n4.  G⁸ = <a⁸> (cyclic group of order 8)\n5.  G¹⁶ = <a¹⁶> (cyclic group of order 4)\n6.  G³² = <a³²> (cyclic group of order 2)\n7.  G⁶⁴ = <a⁶⁴> = {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nAny power Gⁿ where n can be written as n = 2ᵏm with m being odd, will result in one of the subgroups listed above, specifically Gⁿ = G²ᵏ. Therefore, there are a total of 7 distinct power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
