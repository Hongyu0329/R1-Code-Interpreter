    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We are given that $P(x) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. We want to find the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ can be found by calculating the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\nLet's define $P(x)$ and $P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\sum_k a_k (x^{-1})^k = \\sum_k a_k x^{-k}$\n\nTheir product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^j\\right) \\left(\\sum_k a_k x^{-k}\\right) = \\sum_{j,k} a_j a_k x^{j-k}$\n\nThe constant term of this product is the coefficient of $x^0$, which occurs when $j=k$. The sum of these terms is $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ using the definition of $P(x)$:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} F_i(x)$, where $F_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\nThen, $P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} F_i(x^{-1})$, where $F_i(x^{-1}) = 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}$.\n\nThe product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(F_i(x)F_i(x^{-1})\\right)$\n\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of their individual constant terms. Let's find the constant term of each $F_i(x)F_i(x^{-1})$.\nThe product for a single index $i$ is:\n$F_i(x)F_i(x^{-1}) = \\left(1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)\\left(1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nTo find the constant term of this product, we identify the terms that multiply to produce a constant (i.e., $x^0$):\n*   $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   $x^{3^i} \\cdot x^{-3^i} = 1$\n*   $x^{2\\cdot 3^i} \\cdot x^{-2\\cdot 3^i} = 1$\n*   $x^{3\\cdot 3^i} \\cdot x^{-3\\cdot 3^i} = 1$\n\nThe constant term of $F_i(x)F_i(x^{-1})$ is the sum of these products: $1+1+1+1=4$.\n\nSince this is true for each index $i$ from 0 to 19, the constant term of the entire product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms of each of the 20 factors.\nThere are $19 - 0 + 1 = 20$ such factors.\nConstant Term = $\\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$.\n\nThus, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is:\n$\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$\n\nThis can also be written as $(2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\n"
