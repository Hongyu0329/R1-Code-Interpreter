    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF) results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of halogens in such organometallic reactions follows the order I > Br > Cl > F, based on the bond energies of the carbon-halogen bond. Consequently, the iodine atom at the 2-position is the most reactive and is substituted first by a phenyl group.\n\nDue to the use of excess phenyl magnesium bromide and reflux conditions (heating), the less reactive bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions are also subsequently replaced by phenyl groups. This type of reaction with polyhalogenated benzenes and excess Grignard reagents is known to proceed to full substitution.\n\nThe final organic molecule formed has a central benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. The aqueous work-up step serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and neutralize the magnesium halide byproducts, leaving the stable final product.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for this structure is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
