The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, also known as a photon gas, can be determined using the principles of statistical mechanics, with the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems providing a rigorous framework for understanding why these equilibrium values are the most probable for a system with a large number of particles.

### Theoretical Framework: Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics

The connection between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics lies in the fact that the equilibrium state of a system is the most probable macroscopic state. The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a mathematical basis for this by quantifying the probability of deviations from the average behavior in large systems.

*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In the context of a
