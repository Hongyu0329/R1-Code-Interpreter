    "I am unable to provide a definitive answer to your question.\n\nMy search for a video of Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance of the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* in Novosibirsk has been unsuccessful. While it is confirmed that she did perform this role as a guest artist from the Bolshoi Ballet, and that a video of this specific performance was once available online, all existing links to it are now inactive.\n\nWithout a viewable copy of the performance, it is impossible to accurately count the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that she executed in the specified variation.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
