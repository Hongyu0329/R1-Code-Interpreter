    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can use standard results from algebraic topology concerning the relationship between homotopy and homology groups.\n\nFirst, let's establish some basic properties of $X$:\n*   $X$ is a smooth complex hypersurface of degree 5 in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. As such, it is a complex surface, which corresponds to a real 4-dimensional manifold.\n*   The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that for a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n \\geq 2$, the inclusion map induces an isomorphism on the fundamental groups. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(X)$ is the trivial group.\n\nFor any simply connected space (like $X$), there is a close relationship between its homotopy groups and its homology groups. A fundamental result in this area is a consequence of the Serre spectral sequence or the Postnikov tower construction, which states that for any simply connected CW complex, the rank of the $k$-th homotopy group is equal to the rank of the $k$-th homology group.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_k(X)) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z})) $$\nThis result can also be derived from rational homotopy theory. For a simply connected compact Kähler manifold like $X$, its rational homotopy groups can be determined from its rational cohomology ring.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to computing the rank of the third homology group, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nWe can determine the Betti numbers (the ranks of the homology groups) of $X$. Since $X$ is a compact, oriented 4-dimensional manifold, Poincaré duality holds, which gives us an isomorphism $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe first cohomology group, $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, can be related to the first homology group, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem gives a short exact sequence, which implies that if $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is a finitely generated abelian group, then $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\text{Hom}(H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nAs established earlier, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. The first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)$ is the trivial group, its abelianization $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is also the zero group.\n\nNow we can put the pieces together:\n1.  Since $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$, it follows that $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{Hom}(0, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n2.  By Poincaré duality, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, so $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n3.  The rank of a zero group is 0. So, $\\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = 0$.\n4.  As the rank of the homotopy group is the same as the rank of the homology group for a simply connected space, we have $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 0$.\n\nThis means that the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a finite (torsion) group.\n\nThe rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
