    "The performed search confirms my initial analysis. I found academic resources discussing the structure of semidihedral groups and their subgroups. Specifically, a semidihedral group SD_2^n is defined by the presentation <a, b | a^(2^(n-1)) = b^2 = 1, bab = a^(2^(n-2)-1)>. For the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2^n = 512, which gives n=9.\n\nA power subgroup H of a group G is a subgroup for which there exists an integer k such that H = {g^k | g in G}. My derivation concluded that:\n*   For any odd integer k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself.\n*   For any even integer k, the power subgroup G^k is a cyclic subgroup of the form <a^k>, which is equal to <a^d> where d = gcd(k, 2^(n-1)). Since k is even, d must be an even divisor of 2^(n-1).\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512 (n=9), the cyclic subgroup <a> has order 2^(9-1) = 256. The even divisors of 256 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. This gives 8 distinct cyclic subgroups: <a^2>, <a^4>, <a^8>, <a^16>, <a^32>, <a^64>, <a^128>, and <a^256> (which is the trivial subgroup {e}).\n\nCombining the single subgroup from odd powers of k (the group G itself) and the 8 subgroups from even powers of k, the total number of power subgroups is 1 + 8 = 9.\n\nMy reasoning that for SD_{2^n}, the number of power subgroups is n, is consistent. For n=9, the number is 9. The search results did not provide a direct formula for the number of power subgroups of a semidihedral group, but they did confirm the fundamental properties of these groups that I used in my derivation. The concept of power subgroups is a standard one in group theory, though less commonly discussed than other subgroup types. No information found contradicts my step-by-step derivation.\n\nTherefore, I am confident in my result.\n\n<<<9>>>"
