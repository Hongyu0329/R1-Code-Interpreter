    "To find the number that should fill the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   2, 11, 23, 51, 119, (...)\n\nFirst, we can examine the difference between each number and the one preceding it:\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\n\nThe sequence of differences is 9, 12, 28, 68. At first glance, this sequence doesn't present a simple arithmetic pattern.\n\nLet's explore another common type of pattern, which involves multiplication and addition/subtraction.\n*   From 2 to 11: 2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   From 11 to 23: 11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n*   From 23 to 51: 23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n*   From 51 to 119: 51 * 2 + 17 = 119\n\nThis reveals a pattern of the form: `next_term = (previous_term * 2) + k`, where `k` changes with each step. The sequence of the added numbers `k` is 7, 1, 5, 17. This also does not seem to follow a simple rule.\n\nLet's reconsider the differences (9, 12, 28, 68) and see how they relate to the terms of the original sequence.\n*   The difference to get to 23 is 12. The previous term is 11. (12 - 11 = 1)\n*   The difference to get to 51 is 28. The previous term is 23. (28 - 23 = 5)\n*   The difference to get to 119 is 68. The previous term is 51. (68 - 51 = 17)\n\nThis reveals a new sequence: 1, 5, 17. Let's find the pattern here.\n*   The difference between 5 and 1 is 4.\n*   The difference between 17 and 5 is 12.\n\nThe differences of this new sequence are 4 and 12. This is a geometric progression where each difference is multiplied by 3 (4 * 3 = 12). The next difference should be 12 * 3 = 36.\n\nUsing this, we can find the next term in the sequence 1, 5, 17:\n*   Next term = 17 + 36 = 53.\n\nNow we can work our way back to the original sequence. The next difference in the main sequence will be the previous term (119) plus this new number (53):\n*   Next difference = 119 + 53 = 172.\n\nFinally, to find the number that should be in the parentheses, we add this new difference to the last term of the sequence:\n*   Next term in sequence = 119 + 172 = 291.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
