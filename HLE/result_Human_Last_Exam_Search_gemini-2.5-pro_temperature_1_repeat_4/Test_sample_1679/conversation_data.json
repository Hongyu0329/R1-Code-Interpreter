    "An American in Paris*, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1951, is the first winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features an elaborate 17-minute ballet sequence that serves as its climax.\n\nThough the movie was primarily filmed on MGM backlots, this final ballet sequence showcases sets designed in the styles of various French Impressionist painters. One of the prominent locations recreated for this sequence is the Place de la Concorde in Paris, the site of the Luxor Obelisk. The set features a replica of the iconic fountain from the Place de la Concorde, and the obelisk is visible in the background during this enchanting dance number.\n\nWhile other Best Picture winners have been filmed in cities with Luxor Obelisks, such as *The Lost Weekend* (1945) in New York or *Gigi* (1958) in Paris, *An American in Paris* is the earliest to feature a clear depiction of the monument. *Gigi*, for instance, was filmed on location and includes scenes in the Place de la Concorde, but was released seven years after *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
