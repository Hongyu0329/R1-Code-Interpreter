For `k_1 ≠ 0`, the general representation of the infinitesimal transformation on `x` is a constant, `ξ = c_2`, corresponding to spatial translations. For `k_1 = 0`, the representation is `ξ(t,x) = (c_1 t + c_2)x + c_3 t + c_4`, which generates a richer set of transformations including translations, scaling, boosts, and projective transformations.
