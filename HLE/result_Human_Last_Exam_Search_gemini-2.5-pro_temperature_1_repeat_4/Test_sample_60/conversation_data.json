    "To determine which Turing machine halts after the most steps, each machine was simulated starting with an empty tape, which is equivalent to a tape filled with zeros. The initial state for all machines is assumed to be 'A', and the halting state is 'H'.\n\nThe rules for each machine are interpreted from the provided strings, where for each state (A, B, C, D, E), the transitions for reading a '0' and a '1' are given in order.\n\n**Machine 1:**\nThe rules are as follows:\n*   A, 0 -> B, 1, L\n*   A, 1 -> B, 0, R\n*   B, 0 -> C, 1, R\n*   B, 1 -> E, 0, L\n*   C, 0 -> A, 1, L\n*   C, 1 -> D, 0, R\n*   D, 0 -> C, 0, R\n*   D, 1 -> A, 1, R\n*   E, 0 -> C, 1, L\n*   E, 1 -> H, 1, L\n\nUpon simulation, Machine 1 halts after **13 steps**.\n\n**Machine 2:**\nThe rules are as follows:\n*   A, 0 -> B, 1, L\n*   A, 1 -> C, 1, R\n*   B, 0 -> C, 1, L\n*   B, 1 -> B, 1, L\n*   C, 0 -> D, 1, L\n*   C, 1 -> E, 0, R\n*   D, 0 -> A, 1, R\n*   D, 1 -> D, 1, R\n*   E, 0 -> H, 1, L\n*   E, 1 -> A, 0, R\n\nUpon simulation, Machine 2 halts after **9 steps**.\n\n**Machine 3:**\nThe rules are as follows:\n*   A, 0 -> B, 1, L\n*   A, 1 -> A, 1, L\n*   B, 0 -> C, 1, R\n*   B, 1 -> B, 1, R\n*   C, 0 -> A, 1, L\n*   C, 1 -> D, 1, R\n*   D, 0 -> A, 1, L\n*   D, 1 -> E, 1, R\n*   E, 0 -> H, 1, L\n*   E, 1 -> C, 0, R\n\nUpon simulation, Machine 3 halts after **7 steps**.\n\nComparing the number of steps for each machine to halt, Machine 1 takes the most steps.\n\n<<<Machine 1 halts after the most number of steps, which is 13.>>>"
