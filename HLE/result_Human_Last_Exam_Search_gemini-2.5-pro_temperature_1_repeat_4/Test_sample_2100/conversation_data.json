    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about is Nikolai Rezanov. The story of Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer, and his love for a Spanish girl in California, became the basis for Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while on his way back to St. Petersburg. His original gravesite was destroyed in the 1930s. The location of his remains was a subject of uncertainty for a long time, and a new memorial was dedicated in 2000 on what is believed to be his burial site.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
