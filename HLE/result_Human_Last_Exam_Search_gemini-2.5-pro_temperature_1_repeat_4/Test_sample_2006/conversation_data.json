    "This haiku is a riddle, where each line points to a specific geographical bay. The title, \"The Bays,\" indicates the theme of the answer. The solution requires identifying the three bays described in the haiku and then listing them in alphabetical order as requested.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the haiku's clues:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This line refers to **Mobile Bay** in Alabama. The bay was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina, a powerful tempest that made landfall in late August 2005.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals thirty. This is an allusion to the \"thirty pieces of silver\" paid to Judas Iscariot for his betrayal of Jesus, an act which brought about a significant \"wind of change.\" This clue points to the **Bay of Traitors**.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This points to **Corpus Christi Bay** in Texas. The name \"Corpus Christi\" is Latin for \"Body of Christ,\" referencing a \"divine one.\"\n\nFollowing the prompt's instruction, the answer is these three bays, listed in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<Bay of Traitors, Corpus Christi Bay, Mobile Bay>>>"
