    "To solve this problem in the most memory-efficient way, we should avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Since the sum only contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can process the input string as a stream of characters, counting the occurrences of each number. This approach is a form of Counting Sort.\n\nHere is the strategy:\n1.  Read the input character by character, without storing the whole string.\n2.  Use four counter variables to keep track of the frequency of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'. To be maximally memory-efficient, we will use the `short` data type for these counters, as it is smaller than `int` and large enough to hold the maximum possible count (the string is at most 1000 characters long, so a number can appear at most 501 times).\n3.  Use a single `char` variable to store the character being read from the input stream.\n4.  After counting, print the numbers in non-decreasing order. A flag variable, also a `char` to save space, will be used to correctly place the \"+\" signs between the numbers.\n\nThis method completely avoids allocating a large buffer for the input string and uses only a few small variables, making it extremely memory-efficient.\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // The input string is at most 1000 characters long. The maximum\n    // number of any single digit is (1000+1)/2 = 501. A 'short'\n    // (typically holding up to 32,767) is sufficient for the counts.\n    short count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0, count4 = 0;\n\n    // A single char variable to read input characters one by one.\n    char c;\n\n    // A flag to handle the printing of the first number without a\n    // preceding '+'. A 'char' is the smallest addressable data type.\n    char first = 1;\n\n    // Read the input character by character until a newline or EOF is found.\n    // This avoids storing the entire string in memory.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c == '1') {\n            count1++;\n        } else if (c == '2') {\n            count2++;\n        } else if (c == '3') {\n            count3++;\n        } else if (c == '4') {\n            count4++;\n        }\n        // The '+' characters in the input are ignored.\n    }\n\n    // Print the numbers in sorted order based on the counts.\n    // The loop condition also decrements the counter.\n    while (count1-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('1');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (count2-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('2');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (count3-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('3');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (count4-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('4');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is calculated as the sum of the sizes of all declared variables. We assume standard data type sizes on typical competitive programming platforms (like a system using GCC on Linux):\n*   `sizeof(short)` = 2 bytes\n*   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n\nThe variables declared are:\n*   `short count1`: 2 bytes\n*   `short count2`: 2 bytes\n*   `short count3`: 2 bytes\n*   `short count4`: 2 bytes\n*   `char c`: 1 byte\n*   `char first`: 1 byte\n\nTotal memory `m` = (4 * `sizeof(short)`) + (2 * `sizeof(char)`) = (4 * 2) + (2 * 1) = 8 + 2 = 10 bytes.\n\n<<<10>>>"
