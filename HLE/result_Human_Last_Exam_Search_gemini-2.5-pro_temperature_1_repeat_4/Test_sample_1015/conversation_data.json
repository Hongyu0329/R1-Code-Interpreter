    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip. This difference is rooted in the core principles of each ballet technique.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso. This means that during a cambré derrière, the hips should remain aligned and directly over the feet. The Vaganova style prioritizes a codified system where maintaining the square of the body is crucial at all times. This approach ensures a strong, stable core and a sense of aplomb, or stability, which is a hallmark of the Vaganova technique. The movement should be initiated from the upper back, with the pelvis providing a stable base.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often allows for a more open hip. While this is most famously noted in the Balanchine arabesque, where the hip of the working leg is permitted to lift to create a higher and more dramatic line, this principle of adapting the body's alignment for aesthetic effect can also influence the execution of a cambré derrière. Balanchine's style is characterized by speed, sharpness, and a focus on creating long, extended lines. Allowing the hip to open can contribute to a greater sense of fluidity and a more dynamic visual line in the backbend.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, the degree of the backbend, and head placement can differ between the two styles, the fundamental approach to hip placement is a more defining and consistent difference in the execution of movements like the cambré derrière. The Vaganova method's insistence on square hips contrasts with the Balanchine method's willingness to open the hip to achieve a specific aesthetic look.\n\n<<<B>>>"
