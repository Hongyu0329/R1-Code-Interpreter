    "### A Total of 27 Players Have Won the MLB Triple Crown\n\nIn the history of Major League Baseball (MLB), a total of 27 different players have achieved the prestigious Triple Crown for batting. This accomplishment is awarded to a player who leads their league in three key offensive categories: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in a single season.\n\nThe recognition of Triple Crown winners has expanded to include players from the Negro Leagues, whose statistics were officially integrated into MLB records. This has rightfully added a new dimension to the historical understanding of this rare feat.\n\n#### American and National League Winners\n\nIn the American and National Leagues, 17 different players have won the batting Triple Crown. Two of these players, Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, accomplished the feat twice. The most recent player to win the Triple Crown in the AL or NL was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, who ended a 45-year drought.\n\nThe winners from the American and National Leagues are:\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878)\n*   **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n#### Negro Leagues Winners\n\nWith the inclusion of Negro Leagues statistics, ten additional players are recognized as Triple Crown winners. Among them, Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson each won the honor multiple times.\n\nThe Triple Crown winners from the Negro Leagues are:\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (1921, 1924, 1925)\n*   **Heavy Johnson** (1923)\n*   **Mule Suttles** (1926)\n*   **Willie Wells** (1930)\n*   **Josh Gibson** (1936, 1937)\n*   **Lennie Pearson** (1942)\n*   **Ted Strong** (1942)\n*   **Lester Lockett** (1948)\n\nIt is worth noting that a pitching Triple Crown also exists, awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\n<<<27>>>"
