    "To determine whether the 1-incidence rate ratio overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, we must first define these terms.\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete immunity to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the rest. Let's say a proportion `p` is fully protected, and `1-p` remains completely susceptible.\n*   **Incidence Rate:** This is the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specified period.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IR_V) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (IR_U).\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe):** This measures the reduction in the probability of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen for a vaccinated individual compared to an unvaccinated one.\n\nLet's model the situation:\n1.  In the unvaccinated group, all individuals are susceptible. Let their incidence rate (or hazard rate) be `λ`. So, `IR_U = λ`.\n2.  In the vaccinated group, only the proportion `1-p` is susceptible. The proportion `p` is fully protected and will never get the disease, so their incidence rate is 0. The susceptible vaccinated individuals have the same incidence rate as the unvaccinated group, which is `λ`, because the vaccine had no effect on them.\n3.  The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group (`IR_V`) is the average rate across both its protected and unprotected members. This is calculated as: `IR_V = (p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ) = (1-p)λ`.\n4.  Now, we can calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):\n    `IRR = IR_V / IR_U = (1-p)λ / λ = 1-p`.\n5.  The vaccine efficacy (VE) as measured by the incidence rate is `1 - IRR`.\n    `VE = 1 - (1-p) = p`.\n\nSo, the value of `1 - IRR` is equal to `p`, the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected.\n\nNow, what is the \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" for this type of vaccine? For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the efficacy is not uniform across all vaccinated individuals.\n*   For the proportion `p` that is fully protected, their per-exposure efficacy is 100% (or 1).\n*   For the proportion `1-p` that is not protected, their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n\nSince the question asks for a single value to compare against `1-IRR`, the logical interpretation of \"per-exposure vaccine efficacy\" is the average efficacy across the entire vaccinated population.\n\nAverage `VE_pe = (p * 1) + ((1-p) * 0) = p`.\n\nBy comparing the two results:\n*   Vaccine efficacy calculated from the incidence rate ratio (`1 - IRR`) is `p`.\n*   The average per-exposure vaccine efficacy is also `p`.\n\nTherefore, the `1-incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine under the standard assumption of constant hazard rates. Several sources confirm that for an all-or-nothing model, the standard vaccine efficacy calculation (`1 - IRR`) estimates the proportion of individuals who are completely protected. This is equivalent to the average per-exposure efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
