As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the edges in the binary image evolve according to a process analogous to mean curvature flow. This causes sharp corners to round off, convex shapes to shrink and eventually disappear, and the overall edge geometry to simplify by minimizing its length and curvature. The final state is a "fixed point" image, which is often a completely uniform image or one with only perfectly flat edges.
