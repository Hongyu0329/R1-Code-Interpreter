    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The two common forms are bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) and bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II).\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I):**\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex features a copper(I) ion with a tetrahedral coordination geometry. The specific point group for this molecule is **S₄**. This point group is characterized by an improper rotation axis of order 4.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II):**\nIn the case of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II), the copper(II) ion is in a distorted octahedral environment. In the crystal structure of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate), the copper atom is coordinated by four sulfur atoms from the two dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial plane and two fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate anions in the axial positions. The coordination geometry is described as a tetragonally elongated octahedron. Given the description in the literature that the copper is in a centrosymmetric environment in some crystal forms, the idealized point group for such a trans-distorted octahedral complex would be **D₄h**. However, in the actual crystal structure, the symmetry is often lower. For instance, in the monoclinic crystal form, the molecule lies on a crystallographic inversion center, which would correspond to the **Cᵢ** point group. A more general description based on the distorted octahedral geometry would lead to a subgroup of D₄h. Without a visual representation of the exact molecular conformation in solution or an isolated state, D₄h represents the highest possible symmetry for a tetragonally distorted octahedral complex of this type.\n\nIn summary, the point group is **S₄** for the copper(I) complex and can be considered as a distorted version of **D₄h**, often reducing to **Cᵢ** in the solid state for the copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<S₄ for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) and distorted D₄h for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)>>>"
