In a jointly exchangeable random graph, the probability of a link \(y_{ij}\) between nodes *i* and *j* is determined by the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem. Each node *i* is assigned a latent variable U<sub>i</sub> drawn independently from a uniform distribution on. The probability of the link is then given by a symmetric, measurable function W (called a graphon) of the latent variables associated with the two nodes: **P(\(y_{ij}=1\) | U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>, W) = W(U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>)**. If the graphon W is itself random and drawn from a distribution specified by a random measure F, the probability is the expected value, **E<sub>F</sub>[W(U<sub>i</sub>, U<sub>j</sub>)]**.
