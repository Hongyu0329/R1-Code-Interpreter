    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" is **Ghost** (1990). However, the character is not boarding a bus, but is on a subway.\n\nIn the film, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), a ghost, seeks out the help of a ghost on the subway (Vincent Schiavelli) to learn how to move physical objects. After the subway ghost demonstrates his power, Sam asks him how he does it. The subway ghost becomes agitated when questioned about his own death. While not explicitly stated, it is implied that he may have taken his own life by jumping in front of a train. His inability to move on and his aggressive reaction to Sam's question about his past seals his tormented fate of being perpetually stuck. The movie \"Ghost\" was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Supporting Actress (Whoopi Goldberg) and Best Original Screenplay.\n\n>>>Ghost"
