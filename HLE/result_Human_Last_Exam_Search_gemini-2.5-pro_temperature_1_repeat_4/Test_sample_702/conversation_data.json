    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we first identify the spaces and the map in question.\n\n### The Spaces\n*   **Domain:** The domain is the suspension of a smash product of loop spaces, $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   The 4-sphere, $S^4$, is 3-connected. Its loop space, $\\Omega S^4$, is therefore 2-connected ($\\pi_i(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_{i+1}(S^4)$).\n    *   The 6-sphere, $S^6$, is 5-connected. Its loop space, $\\Omega S^6$, is therefore 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product of a $k$-connected space and an $l$-connected space is $(k+l+1)$-connected. Thus, $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1)=7$-connected.\n    *   The suspension of a $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected. Therefore, the domain $A = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n\n*   **Codomain:** The codomain is the loop space of a smash product of spheres, $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   The smash product of spheres $S^m \\wedge S^n$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{m+n}$. So, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n    *   The 10-sphere, $S^{10}$, is 9-connected.\n    *   The loop space, $\\Omega S^{10}$, is therefore 8-connected.\n\n### The Map\nA natural map between these spaces arises from the smash product of evaluation maps. Let $u \\in \\Omega S^4$ and $v \\in \\Omega S^6$ be loops. We can define a map that smashes these loops together to form a map from $S^1 \\wedge S^1 \\simeq S^2$ to $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$. This suggests a map of spaces:\n$\\tilde{f}: \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6 \\to \\Omega^2 (S^4 \\wedge S^6) \\simeq \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\nThe map in the question, $f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is the adjoint of $\\tilde{f}$.\n\n### Connectivity of the Map\nA map $g: X \\to Y$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $g_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n1.  Since both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, their homotopy groups are trivial for dimensions $i \\le 8$. The map is trivially an isomorphism on these groups, so the map $f$ is at least 8-connected.\n\n2.  To check for 9-connectivity, we need $f_*$ to be an isomorphism on $\\pi_i$ for $i<9$ (which it is) and a surjection on $\\pi_9$. We will check if it is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$.\n    *   **Domain's 9th homotopy group:** By the Freudenthal suspension theorem, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6; \\mathbb{Z})$. Using the KÃ¼nneth formula for the homology of a smash product (and noting that the homology groups of loop spaces of spheres are free abelian), we have $\\tilde{H}_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Codomain's 9th homotopy group:** $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is therefore a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. The double adjoint of the map $f$, which is $\\hat{f}: \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^{10}$, can be identified with the smash product of the evaluation maps $ev_4 \\wedge ev_6$. A detailed analysis shows that this map has degree 1 on the generator of the 10th homotopy group of the sphere, meaning it induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_{10}$. This implies that the adjoint map $f$ induces an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$.\n\n3.  Since $f_*$ is an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the map is 9-connected. To check for 10-connectivity, we need $f_*$ to be surjective on $\\pi_{10}$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This group is non-trivial; for instance, its rationalization is zero, but it contains torsion elements.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The map $f_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ could be surjective.\n\n4.  To check for 11-connectivity, we need $f_*$ to be an isomorphism on $\\pi_{10}$. However, the source group $\\pi_{10}(A) \\cong \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ contains a copy of $\\mathbb{Z}$ from $H_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, whereas the target group $\\pi_{10}(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is finite. A map from a group with a free summand to a finite group cannot be an isomorphism. Therefore, the map is not 11-connected.\n\nThe connectivity of the map is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
