    "The user is asking for a specific Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology for changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth and the Fall.\n\nMy initial searches on \"theologian terminology changes in laws of nature virgin birth the fall\" led me to the 17th-century natural philosopher and theologian Robert Boyle. The results show that Boyle wrote extensively on the laws of nature, God's will, and miracles.\n\nSpecifically, one search result mentions that Boyle distinguished between different types of miracles, using terms like \"Preternatural or Supernatural, than (if I may so speak) Contra-natural\". This shows he was developing specialized terminology.\n\nBoyle's view was that the laws of nature were contingent on God's will and could be altered by God. He considered miracles to be instances where God acts contrary to ordinary experience. He explicitly discusses the creation of human souls and the resurrection of Lazarus as miracles. While the virgin birth isn't explicitly named in these snippets, it falls squarely within this category of miracle.\n\nThe concept of the Fall isn't directly linked to Boyle's terminology in these search results. However, the query also brought up the Pauline terms \"law of sin and death\" and \"law of the Spirit of life\" from Romans 8:2. These terms describe a change in the governing \"law\" for humanity due to sin (the Fall) and salvation in Christ. While Paul is the originator of these terms, a later theologian might have applied them in a way that fits the user's question, perhaps by interpreting them as changes in the \"laws of nature\" governing humanity.\n\nIt's plausible that a theologian has connected Boyle's scientific/philosophical framework for miracles with Paul's theological framework regarding the Fall. The key is to find who made this specific connection.\n\nThe query asks for the *first* theologian to do this. Robert Boyle (1627-1691) is a strong candidate for developing terminology around the laws of nature and miracles. The Pauline terms are much older, from the Apostle Paul himself.\n\nLet's refine the search to see if Boyle or another theologian explicitly connected the terminology for miracles (like the virgin birth) with the state of natural law after the Fall.\n\nI will conduct another search to try and link Boyle's \"contra-natural\" terminology or similar concepts directly to the theological implications of the Fall on the laws of nature. It's also worth checking if any theologian explicitly used Paul's \"law of sin and death\" in the context of natural/physical laws changing after the Fall.The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the governing principles of the world, applicable to both the Fall of Man and the divine act of the virgin birth, was the **Apostle Paul**.\n\nIn his Epistle to the Romans, Paul introduces the concepts of the \"law of sin and death\" and the \"law of the Spirit of life\" (Romans 8:2). This terminology provides a framework for understanding a fundamental shift in the principles governing humanity and creation.\n\n*   **The Law of Sin and Death:** Paul develops this term to describe the state of humanity and the world after the Fall (Genesis 3). It is the principle that sin, having entered the world through Adam's disobedience, inevitably leads to both spiritual and physical death. This \"law\" is not merely a set of rules but a powerful, active force or principle at work in fallen human nature, leading to corruption and death. Theologians have understood this to be a curse affecting not just humanity but the entire natural world.\n\n*   **The Law of the Spirit of Life:** In contrast, Paul presents the \"law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus\" as the new principle that liberates believers from the \"law of sin and death.\" This is the liberating power of the Holy Spirit, which brings new life. It is this superseding \"law\" or power of the Spirit that accounts for supernatural acts of God within salvation history, such as the virgin birth of Jesus. The virgin birth is understood in Christian theology as a unique act of the Holy Spirit, operating under this \"law of the Spirit of life\" rather than the fallen \"law of sin and death\" which governs ordinary, post-Fall human generation.\n\nWhile later theologians, such as the 17th-century scientist Robert Boyle, would develop more scientific-sounding language to describe miracles as \"supernatural\" or \"contra-natural\" events that deviate from the ordinary laws of nature, the Apostle Paul was the first to coin the specific theological terminology that describes the fundamental change in the world's governing principles resulting from the Fall and the new reality inaugurated by Christ and his Spirit, which encompasses such miraculous events.\n\n<<<Apostle Paul>>>"
