    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in the Grigorchuk group has been a subject of detailed study. Specifically, the lattice of normal subgroups of small index has been completely described. The Grigorchuk group, being a 2-group (a group where every element has an order that is a power of 2), can only have subgroups of index that is a power of 2.\n\nThe determination of the number of subgroups of small index relies on the analysis of the group's structure and its quotient groups. For an index of 4, one needs to consider the homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to transitive subgroups of the symmetric group S₄. As the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group, the image of any such homomorphism must also be a 2-group. The transitive 2-subgroups of S₄ are the cyclic group of order 4 (C₄), the Klein four-group (V₄), and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).\n\nA detailed analysis, such as the one presented in the paper \"The top of the lattice of normal subgroups of the Grigorchuk group\" by T. Ceccherini-Silberstein, F. Scarabotti, and F. Tolli, provides a complete description of the lattice of normal subgroups up to a high level, which includes those of index 4. From this and related work, it is established that the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4. These subgroups are all normal.\n\n<<<7>>>"
