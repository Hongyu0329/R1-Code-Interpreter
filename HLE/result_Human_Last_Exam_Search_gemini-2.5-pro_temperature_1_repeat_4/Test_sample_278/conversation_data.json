    "To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the maximum width and height of the curve.\n\nThe parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\begin{cases} \\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in [0, \\pi] \\\\ 5\\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi) \\end{cases}$\n\n1.  **Find the range of x:**\n    The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of the cosine function over a full period is $[-1, 1]$.\n    Therefore, the minimum value of x is -1 and the maximum value of x is 1.\n    The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values:\n    Width = $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n2.  **Find the range of y:**\n    We need to consider the two separate intervals for t.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the y-coordinate is given by $y = \\sin t$. In this interval, the value of $\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1. So, the maximum y-value is 1.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the y-coordinate is given by $y = 5\\sin t$. In this interval, $\\sin t$ ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0). Therefore, the value of $5\\sin t$ ranges from -5 to 0. The minimum y-value is -5.\n\n    Combining these two ranges, the total range for the y-coordinate is $[-5, 1]$.\n    The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values:\n    Height = $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Determine the smallest circumscribing square:**\n    A square that circumscribes the figure must have a side length that is at least as large as both the width and the height of the figure. To find the smallest such square, we must choose the side length to be the maximum of these two dimensions.\n    Side length = $\\max(\\text{Width, Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area of the square:**\n    The area of a square is the side length squared.\n    Area = $(\\text{Side length})^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the maximum width and height of the curve.\n\nThe parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\begin{cases} \\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in [0, \\pi] \\\\ 5\\sin t & \\text{if } t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi) \\end{cases}$\n\n1.  **Find the range of x:**\n    The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.
