    "Hypothetically, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would depend on the specific structure of the parent nanocar, as various designs exist. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms would equal the number of hydrogen atoms in the chosen nanocar model.\n\nSince the first nanocar was synthesized, several different molecular designs have been developed. For instance, one computationally studied nanocar with a flexible chassis has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. In a perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced with fluorine atoms.\n\nAnother example of a nanocar has the chemical formula C₄₃₀H₂₇₄O₁₂. A perfluorinated version of this molecule would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nBecause there is no single standardized structure for a nanocar, the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar is variable. However, based on one specific published model, the number would be 34.\n\n<<<34>>>"
