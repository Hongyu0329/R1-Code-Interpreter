In the CCSD method, because the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body terms and the cluster operator is limited to single and double excitations, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, when acting on the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$, can only generate determinants with up to four excitations. The CCSD equations are set up to zero out the matrix elements for singly and doubly excited determinants. Consequently, the matrix elements for triply and quadruply excited Slater determinants are generally non-zero. However, for any Slater determinant with an excitation level of five or more (i.e., quintuply, sextuply, etc., excited determinants), the matrix element $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ is identically zero.
