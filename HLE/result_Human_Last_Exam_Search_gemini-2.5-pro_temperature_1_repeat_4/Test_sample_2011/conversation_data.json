    "An induced clique of size `k` in a graph `G` is a set of `k` vertices such that the subgraph induced by these vertices is a complete graph `K_k`. The question asks for the maximum possible number of different values of `k` for which a graph on `n=128` vertices can contain an induced clique of size `k`.\n\nLet `G` be a graph with 128 vertices. Let `S` be the set of all integers `k` such that `G` contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`. We want to find the maximum possible value of `|S|` over all graphs `G` on 128 vertices.\n\nLet `ω(G)` be the clique number of `G`, which is the size of the largest clique in `G`. By definition, a clique in `G` corresponds to an induced subgraph that is a complete graph. Therefore, `ω(G)` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. Let this size be `k_max`.\n\nIf a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k_max` on a set of vertices `V'`, then any subset of `V'` with `k` vertices (where `1 ≤ k ≤ k_max`) will also form an induced clique, specifically a `K_k`. This is because if all pairs of vertices in `V'` are connected, the same holds true for any subset of `V'`.\n\nThis implies that if `k_max` is a possible size for an induced clique in `G`, then all integer sizes from 1 to `k_max` are also possible. In other words, if `k_max ∈ S`, then `{1, 2, ..., k_max} ⊆ S`.\n\nSince `k_max` is the maximum size of any induced clique in `G`, no integer larger than `k_max` can be in `S`. Thus, the set of all possible induced clique sizes for a given graph `G` is precisely `S = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore `|S| = ω(G)`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number, `ω(G)`, for a graph `G` with `n=128` vertices. For any graph on `n` vertices, the size of the largest clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices, so `ω(G) ≤ n`.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved by the complete graph, `K_n`, which is a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For `n=128`, the complete graph `K_128` has a clique number of `ω(K_128) = 128`. In `K_128`, any subset of `k` vertices forms an induced clique of size `k`.\n\nTherefore, the graph `K_128` has induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128. The number of different clique sizes is 128. Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
