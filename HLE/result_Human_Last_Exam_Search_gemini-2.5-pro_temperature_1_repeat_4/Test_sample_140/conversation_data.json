    "The largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube with an edge length of 15 is 351.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this number is achieved through a straightforward packing strategy:\n\nFirst, consider the volume of the cube and the block. The cube has a volume of 15x15x15 = 3375 cubic units, and each block has a volume of 9x1x1 = 9 cubic units. Dividing the total volume of the cube by the volume of a single block gives a theoretical maximum of 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks. However, this number does not account for the geometric constraints of packing.\n\nA practical approach to packing the blocks is to align them with the axes of the cube in stages:\n\n1.  **First Layer**: Align the 9-inch side of the blocks along one of the 15-inch edges of the cube (let's call this the x-axis). You can fit one block along this dimension (15 / 9 = 1 with a remainder). Along the other two 15-inch edges (y and z-axes), you can fit 15 blocks each (15 / 1 = 15). This arrangement fills a 9x15x15 section of the cube with 1 * 15 * 15 = 225 blocks. This leaves a remaining space of 6x15x15.\n\n2.  **Second Layer**: In the remaining 6x15x15 space, the 9-inch side of the blocks cannot be placed along the 6-inch dimension. Therefore, they must be aligned with one of the 15-inch dimensions. Let's align them with the y-axis. In this orientation, you can fit 6 blocks along the 6-inch dimension, 1 block along the 15-inch dimension (15 / 9 = 1 with a remainder), and 15 blocks along the other 15-inch dimension. This adds another 6 * 1 * 15 = 90 blocks. This fills a 6x9x15 section of the remaining space, leaving a 6x6x15 space.\n\n3.  **Third Layer**: In the final 6x6x15 space, the 9-inch side of the blocks can only be aligned with the 15-inch dimension. Here you can fit 6 blocks along one 6-inch side, 6 blocks along the other 6-inch side, and 1 block along the 15-inch side (15 / 9 = 1 with a remainder). This accounts for 6 * 6 * 1 = 36 blocks. This fills a 6x6x9 section, with a 6x6x6 space remaining.\n\nNo 9x1x1 block can fit into the final 6x6x6 space, as all its dimensions are smaller than 9.\n\nBy summing the blocks from each stage, the total number of blocks that can fit inside the cube is 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\n<<<351>>>"
