    "The rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule and the membership of the consequent of the rule.\n\nGiven:\n*   Firing strength of the antecedent, `Phi_k(x′)` = 0.7\n*   Membership of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\nRule Activation Level = T(`Phi_k(x′)`, `μG_k_j(y_j)`)\n\nWhere T represents a t-norm operation. The two most common t-norms are the minimum operator and the product operator.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum T-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This is the most common t-norm and is defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n    *   Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product T-norm:** This t-norm is defined as `T(a, b) = a * b`.\n    *   Rule Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not mentioned, the answer can vary. However, the minimum t-norm is the most standard for this kind of operation.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
