    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into six metrical feet. A dactyl consists of one long syllable followed by two short syllables (— U U), while a spondee consists of two long syllables (— —).\n\nThe scansion of this particular line from Lucretius (*De rerum natura*, 4.739) is notoriously difficult and has been a subject of scholarly debate, with some suggesting the text may be corrupt. However, a plausible scansion can be achieved by acknowledging certain poetic licenses.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n**Line:** verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elisions:**\n    *   `ve-rum u-bi e-qui at-que ho-mi-nis ca-su con-ve-nit i-ma-go.`\n    *   An elision occurs when a word ends in a vowel or \"-m\" and the next word begins with a vowel or \"h.\"\n    *   The first elision is `verum ubi`. The `-um` of `verum` is elided.\n    *   The second elision is `equi atque`. The `-i` of `equi` is elided.\n\n2.  **Foot-by-Foot Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Foot 1:** `vērum ubi` becomes `vē-r(um) u-bĭ`. The first syllable `vē-` is long by nature. The `u` and `bi` of `ubi` are both short. This forms a **Dactyl** (— U U).\n\n    *   **Foot 2:** `equi atque` becomes `ēqu(i) āt-`. The first syllable of `atque` (`āt-`) is long by position because its vowel is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`, which counts as `c`). For the foot to be a spondee, the `e-` of `equi` must be treated as long. This is a form of poetic license known as metrical lengthening, as this `e` is naturally short. With this license, the foot is a **Spondee** (— —).\n\n    *   **Foot 3:** `-que hominis` is scanned as `-que hŏ-mĭ-`. The `-que` from `atque` is short, and the first two syllables of `hominis` are also short. This forms a **Dactyl** (— U U).\n\n    *   **Foot 4:** `-nis cāsū` is scanned as `-nīs cā-sū`. The final syllable of `hominis` (`-nis`) is long by position because it is followed by the two consonants `c` and `s` in `casu`. The two syllables of `cāsū` (ablative case) are long by nature. This forms a **Spondee** (— —).\n\n    *   **Foot 5:** `cōnvenit` is scanned as `cōn-vĕ-nĭt`. The first syllable `cōn-` is long by position. The following two syllables are short. This forms a **Dactyl** (— U U).\n\n    *   **Foot 6:** `imāgō`. The fifth foot is a dactyl, which leaves `imāgō` for the sixth foot. The `ā` and final `ō` are long. For this to be a spondee, the initial `i-` must be treated as long, another poetic license. This forms a **Spondee** (— —).\n\nTherefore, the metrical pattern is Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
