    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe allowed symbols are T, F, !, &, |, (, ). The precedence is ! > & > |.\n\nFirst, we classify the possible structures of a 5-symbol expression. An expression can be formed by a binary operator, a unary operator, or parentheses at the top level of its syntax tree.\n\nLet N(k, V) be the number of valid expressions of length k that evaluate to value V (where V is True or False).\n\n### **Expressions of Length 1, 2, 3, and 4**\n\n*   **Length 1:**\n    *   N(1, True) = 1  (`T`)\n    *   N(1, False) = 1 (`F`)\n\n*   **Length 2:**\n    *   These are of the form `!E1` (where E1 is an expression of length 1).\n    *   `!F` (True), `!T` (False).\n    *   N(2, True) = 1\n    *   N(2, False) = 1\n\n*   **Length 3:**\n    *   `E1 op E1`: `T|T` (T), `T|F` (T), `F|T` (T), `F|F` (F). (3 T, 1 F). `T&T` (T), `T&F` (F), `F&T` (F), `F&F` (F). (1 T, 3 F).\n    *   `!E2`: `!!T` (T), `!!F` (F). (1 T, 1 F).\n    *   `(E1)`: `(T)` (T), `(F)` (F). (1 T, 1 F).\n    *   N(3, True) = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n    *   N(3, False) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.\n\n*   **Length 4:**\n    *   We need to count the number of false expressions of length 4 to later determine expressions of the form `!E4`.\n    *   False expressions of length 4 (`E4`):\n        1.  `L op E2`: `F|!T` (False). (1)\n        2.  `E2 op L`: `!T|F` (False). (1)\n        3.  `L & E2`: `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F` (3 False).\n        4.  `E2 & L`: `!T&T`, `!T&F`, `!F&F` (3 False).\n        5.  `!(E3)`: This is false if E3 is true. There are 6 true E3. `!(T|T)`, `!(T|F)`, `!(F|T)`, `!(T&T)`, `!(!!T)`, `!((T))`. (6 False)\n        6.  `(E2)`: `(!T)` (False). (1)\n        7.  `!!!L`: `!!!T` (False). (1)\n    *   Total false E4: N(4, False) = 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\n### **True Expressions of Length 5**\n\nNow, we count the number of true expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Expressions with a top-level binary operator (`A op B`)**\n\nThe total length is 5, so the lengths of A and B must sum to 4 (e.g., 1+3, 2+2, 3+1). We must respect operator precedence.\n\n*   **`L | E3`** (length 1|3): This is true if `L` is T, or if `L` is F and `E3` is true. There are 12 E3 in total.\n    *   `T | E3`: 12 expressions, all true.\n    *   `F | E3`: True if `E3` is true. N(3, True) = 6. So, 6 expressions.\n    *   Total: 12 + 6 = 18.\n*   **`E3 | L`** (length 3|1): Symmetrically, this gives 18 true expressions.\n*   **`L & E3`** (length 1&3): This is only valid if `E3` does not contain `|`.\n    *   True E3 without `|`: `T&T`, `!!T`, `(T)` (3 expressions).\n    *   The expression is true if `L` is T and `E3_no_|` is true. `T & {T&T, !!T, (T)}`.\n    *   Total: 3.\n*   **`E3 & L`** (length 3&1): Symmetrically, this also gives 3 true expressions.\n*   **`E2 op E2`** (length 2 op 2):\n    *   `!L | !L'`: `!F|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!T|!F`. (3 true).\n    *   `!L & !L'`: `!F&!F`. (1 true).\n    *   Total: 4.\n\nSum for binary operators = 18 + 18 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 46.\n\n**2. Expressions with a top-level unary operator `!` (`!A`)**\n\n*   The expression must be of the form `!E4`, where `E4` is an expression of length 4.\n*   `!E4` is true if `E4` is false.\n*   From our earlier calculation, there are 16 false expressions of length 4.\n*   Total: 16.\n\n**3. Expressions with top-level parentheses (`(A)`)**\n\n*   The expression must be of the form `(E3)`, where `E3` is an expression of length 3.\n*   `(E3)` is true if `E3` is true.\n*   There are 6 true expressions of length 3 (`T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`, `T&T`, `!!T`, `(T)`).\n*   Total: 6.\n\n### **Final Count**\n\nThe total number of true boolean expressions of length 5 is the sum of these disjoint categories:\nTotal = (Binary Ops) + (Unary ! Ops) + (Paren Ops)\nTotal = 46 + 16 + 6 = 68.\n\n"
