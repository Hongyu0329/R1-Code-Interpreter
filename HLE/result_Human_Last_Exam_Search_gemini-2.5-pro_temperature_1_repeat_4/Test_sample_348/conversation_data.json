    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Define the Supply and Demand Functions:**\n\n*   **Supply:** `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   **Demand:** `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n**2. Find Market Equilibrium:**\n\nMarket equilibrium occurs when `Q_S = Q_D = Q_E` and the price is the same. Therefore, we set the two functions equal to each other:\n\n`ln(Q_E^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))`\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that does not have a simple analytical solution. To solve for the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`), numerical methods are required. Using a computational tool to find the intersection of the two functions, we find that the approximate equilibrium quantity is:\n\n`Q_E ≈ 3.447`\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` back into either the supply or the demand function. Using the demand function:\n\n`P_E = 18e^(-arctan(3.447)) ≈ 18e^(-1.288) ≈ 4.965`\n\nSo, the market equilibrium point is approximately `(Q_E, P_E) = (3.447, 4.965)`.\n\n**3. Calculate Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS). It can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand curve and the supply curve from `Q = 0` to `Q_E`.\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n    `CS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - P_E) dQ`\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** The area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price.\n    `PS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (P_E - ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\n*   **Total Welfare (TW):**\n    `TW = CS + PS = ∫[0 to Q_E] (18e^(-arctan(Q)) - ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nDue to the complexity of these functions, the definite integral must also be solved using numerical methods. Performing this numerical integration from `Q = 0` to `Q = 3.447` yields:\n\n`TW ≈ 39.42`\n\n<<<39.42>>>"
