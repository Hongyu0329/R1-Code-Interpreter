The problem as stated does not yield a solution in terms of elementary functions. The final step requires the evaluation of the integral `4 * ∫[0, ∞] dτ / (3e^{2τ^2} + 1)`, which can only be expressed using special functions (Polylogarithm `Li_{1/2}(-1/3)`). This suggests a possible error in the problem statement.
