    "The initial value problem is given by the differential equation $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$ with the initial condition $x(0) = -8$.\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rewrite it as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$.\n\n1.  **Separate the variables**:\n    We move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other side.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n\n2.  **Integrate both sides**:\n    Now, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$. The integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n    So, the integration yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the initial condition to find C**:\n    We are given that $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation to solve for $C$.\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n\n4.  **Write the particular solution**:\n    Now we substitute the value of $C$ back into the integrated equation.\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Solve for $x(t)$**:\n    First, we solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    Then, we take the reciprocal to find $x(t)$.\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}\n    $$\n    To simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}\n    $$\n\n6.  **Find x(1)**:\n    Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the expression for $x(t)$.\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1}\n    $$\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1}\n    $$\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
