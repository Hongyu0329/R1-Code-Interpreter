    "In the ϕ^4 theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is given in terms of ϵ = 4 - d, where d is the spatial dimension.\n\nThe renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant u is described by the beta function, β(u). To the lowest order in u and ϵ, the beta function is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nwhere B is a constant that depends on the specific conventions used for the coupling constant. For the standard normalization, the beta function is β(u) = -ϵu + (3/2)u².\n\nA fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling does not change with scale (β(u*) = 0). Setting the beta function to zero yields:\n-ϵu* + (3/2)(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  The Gaussian fixed point: u* = 0\n2.  The Wilson-Fisher fixed point: u* = (2/3)ϵ\n\nThis non-trivial fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of the system. Higher-order corrections to this expression exist as a power series in ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (2/3)ϵ>>>"
