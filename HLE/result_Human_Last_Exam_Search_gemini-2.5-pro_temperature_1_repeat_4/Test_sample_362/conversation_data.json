    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes and ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). The reaction's outcome, particularly the stereochemistry of the resulting alkene, is highly dependent on the nature of the ylide used.\n\nThe reactants in question are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal), which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane**, the Wittig reagent. The ylide carbon, which forms the new double bond, is attached to a (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethyl) group.\n\nThe ylide can be classified based on the substituent attached to the negatively charged carbon. In this case, the substituent is an alkyl group (-CH₂-C₆H₄Cl), which makes this an **unstabilized ylide**. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides reacting with aldehydes predominantly form the (Z)-alkene (cis isomer) as the major product.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the carbonyl oxygen of pivalaldehyde with the carbanionic part of the ylide. This forms a new carbon-carbon double bond. The final product is triphenylphosphine oxide and the newly formed alkene.\n\nBased on these principles, the product of the reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
