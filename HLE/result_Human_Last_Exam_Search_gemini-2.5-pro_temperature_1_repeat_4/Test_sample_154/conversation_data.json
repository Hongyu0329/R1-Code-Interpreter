    "There are 11 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph does not have any articulation points (or cut vertices). To find the number of such graphs with 5 vertices, we must examine the 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices. Of these, 21 are connected graphs.\n\nBy systematically analyzing these 21 connected graphs, we can identify those that are 2-vertex-connected:\n\n*   **Graphs with 4 or fewer edges:** All connected graphs with 5 vertices and 4 or fewer edges are trees, which have articulation points and are therefore not 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **Graphs with 5 edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5) is 2-vertex-connected because removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices, which is connected.\n\n*   **Graphs with 6 edges:** There are two 2-vertex-connected graphs:\n    *   The \"house graph,\" which consists of a square (C4) with a triangle (C3) on top.\n    *   A cycle on 5 vertices with one chord, which creates two smaller cycles.\n\n*   **Graphs with 7 edges:** There are three such graphs:\n    *   The wheel graph with 5 vertices (W5) with one of its outer edges removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with three edges forming a path of length three removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with three edges that form a triangle removed.\n\n*   **Graphs with 8 edges:** All three non-isomorphic graphs with 8 edges are 2-vertex-connected:\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two adjacent edges removed.\n    *   The wheel graph (W5), which is a central vertex connected to the four vertices of a cycle C4.\n\n*   **Graphs with 9 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed is 3-vertex-connected and thus also 2-vertex-connected.\n\n*   **Graphs with 10 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 is 4-vertex-connected, which means it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n\nCounting these up: 1 (with 5 edges) + 2 (with 6 edges) + 3 (with 7 edges) + 3 (with 8 edges) + 1 (with 9 edges) + 1 (with 10 edges) = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
