    "With optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence is as follows:\n1.  Qxf7+ Kh8\n2.  Qf8+ Rxf8\n3.  Rxf8+ Qg8\n4.  Rxg8#\n\nHere is a breakdown of the moves:\n*   **1. Qxf7+**: White starts with a check, forcing the black king to h8. If the king moves to h7, White delivers checkmate immediately with 2. Qxg7#.\n*   **2. Qf8+**: A queen sacrifice forces Black's rook to capture the queen.\n*   **3. Rxf8+**: White's rook now delivers a check, forcing the black queen to block on g8.\n*   **4. Rxg8#**: White's rook captures the queen, resulting in a checkmate. The bishop on h5 prevents the king from escaping.\n\n<<<4>>>"
