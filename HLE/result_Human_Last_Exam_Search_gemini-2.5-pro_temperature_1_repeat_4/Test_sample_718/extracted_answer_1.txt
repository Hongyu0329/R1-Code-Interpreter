There is no universal integer $n$. The value of $n$ for which a tame functor is $n$-resolvable depends on the combinatorial properties of the specific upper semilattice $J$. For any given $J$, such a finite $n$ exists and is bounded by a measure of the poset's complexity, such as its parental dimension. For the specific case where $J = \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^r$, a tame functor is $r$-resolvable.
