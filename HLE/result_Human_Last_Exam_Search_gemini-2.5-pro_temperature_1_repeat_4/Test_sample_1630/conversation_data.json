    "The maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n1.  **Definition of a Fixed Point:** A fixed point of the function $f(g(x))$ is a real number $x$ such that $f(g(x)) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n2.  **Degree of the Composite Polynomial:** Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n3.  **Degree of the Equation for Fixed Points:** The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the function $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n4.  **Maximum Number of Real Roots:** According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This means there can be at most 9 fixed points.\n\n5.  **Conditions on the Derivatives:** The problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. The derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since both $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive, their product $h'(x)$ is also always positive. Thus, $f(g(x))$ is a strictly increasing function.\n\n6.  **Possibility of 9 Fixed Points:** For the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have at least 8 real roots, according to Rolle's Theorem. The derivative is $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   Since $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, $f'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, $g'(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n    *   The term $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n    *   This means $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8, which can have up to 8 real roots.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The algebraic structure allows for the existence of up to 9 fixed points. The conditions that $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing do not fundamentally change the degrees of the polynomials involved. While constructing an explicit example of such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complex, it is theoretically possible to choose the coefficients such that the polynomial $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ has 8 distinct real roots. This would create 8 \"wiggles\" in the graph of $f(g(x)) - x$, allowing it to cross the x-axis up to 9 times. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
