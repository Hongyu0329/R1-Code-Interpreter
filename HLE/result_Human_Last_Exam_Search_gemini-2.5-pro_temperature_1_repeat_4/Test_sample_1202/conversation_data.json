    "When a gene is duplicated, there are several possible evolutionary fates for the resulting two copies. Of the choices provided, two are primary mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of these duplicate genes: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization**: This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. One copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene because it is redundant and not maintained by selective pressure. This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention.\n*   **Neofunctionalization**: In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free to accumulate mutations. These mutations may result in the gene acquiring a completely new, beneficial function, which is then preserved by natural selection.\n*   **Subfunctionalization**: This model, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that the original ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy sustains mutations that degrade a different sub-function. Consequently, both copies become essential to carry out the full set of the original gene's functions, ensuring their mutual preservation.\n*   **Gene Conversion**: This process involves the homogenization of two gene copies, where one sequence replaces the other. This mechanism works against divergence and thus does not explain the retention of two distinct, functional genes.\n*   **Adaptive Radiation**: This is a macroevolutionary term describing the rapid diversification of species from a common ancestor, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention.\n\n**Comparing Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, there is considerable debate about which is more prevalent. The classic neofunctionalization model faces a significant hurdle: the redundant gene copy is much more likely to be lost to pseudogenization before a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation can occur.\n\nSubfunctionalization provides a more likely path to initial retention. It relies on more common degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations that partition the original functions. This makes both copies necessary for the organism's fitness, effectively \"rescuing\" them from being lost and locking them into the genome. This period of guaranteed retention provides more evolutionary time for the genes to diverge further, potentially allowing one copy to eventually neofunctionalize later. Therefore, because it provides a more probable initial pathway for preserving both gene copies from the more common fate of pseudogenization, subfunctionalization is considered a highly significant, and likely the most common, mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
