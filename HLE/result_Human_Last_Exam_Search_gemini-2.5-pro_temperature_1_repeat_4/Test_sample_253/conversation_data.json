    "When applying cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1 (represented as a '1' surrounded by '0's), the binary pattern after 20 iterations is **11111011011**.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule is defined by the following transitions, where the triplet represents the left neighbor, the cell itself, and the right neighbor, and the result is the cell's next state.\n\n*   111 → 0\n*   110 → 1\n*   101 → 1\n*   100 → 0\n*   011 → 1\n*   010 → 1\n*   001 → 1\n*   000 → 0\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' (or a black cell in visual representations), each subsequent line, or \"generation,\" of the pattern is generated by applying these rules simultaneously to every cell in the preceding line. The evolution of the pattern is characterized by the formation of complex and seemingly chaotic structures, even from such a simple starting condition.\n\nHere is a summary of the first 20 steps of the evolution:\n*   n=0: 1\n*   n=1: 11\n*   n=2: 111\n*   n=3: 1101\n*   n=4: 11111\n*   n=5: 110001\n*   n=6: 1110011\n*   n=7: 11010111\n*   n=8: 11111101\n*   n=9: 110000111\n*   n=10: 111001101\n*   n=11: 110101111\n*   n=12: 111111001\n*   n=13: 1100001011\n*   n=14: 1110010111\n*   n=15: 11010110001\n*   n=16: 11111110011\n*   n=17: 110000010111\n*   n=18: 111000110001\n*   n=19: 11010011101\n*   n=20: 11111011011\n\n<<<11111011011>>>"
