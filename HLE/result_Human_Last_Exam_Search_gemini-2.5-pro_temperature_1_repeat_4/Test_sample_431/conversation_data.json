    "The human GABAAρ1 receptor, with the UniProt accession number P24046, possesses defined transmembrane domains. The third transmembrane domain (TM3) spans amino acid positions 314-334, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) is located at positions 454-474. The region connecting these two domains, known as the TM3-TM4 linker, encompasses residues from position 335 to 453.\n\nAnalysis of the amino acid sequence within this specific linker region reveals the presence of 12 cysteine residues.\n\n<<<12>>>"
