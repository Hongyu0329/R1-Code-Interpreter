1. **The Relativity of Simultaneity:** Yes, this would still be true in some models of Euclidean relativity. The definition and measurement of time in these frameworks can lead to a situation where events simultaneous in one frame are not simultaneous in another.

2. **Relativity of Lengths:** This is not universally true across all proposed Euclidean relativity models. Some models predict length contraction similar to special relativity, while others predict no length contraction, and some even suggest expansion.

3. **Relativity of Time:** Yes, this is a more consistent prediction across different Euclidean relativity models.

4. **Invariance of the Speed of Light:** This is replaced by a different postulate in many Euclidean models, such as the idea that all objects have a universal velocity 'c' in a 4D Euclidean space, from which the apparent invariance of the speed of light in 3D space can be derived.

5. **Non-Newtonian Addition of Speeds:** Yes, the addition of speeds would be non-Newtonian, but the formula would differ from that of special relativity.

6. **Give the formulas for #2:** There is no single agreed-upon formula. Some models use the standard formula from special relativity:
$L = L₀ \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$
However, other models predict no length contraction at all.

7. **Give the formulas for #3:** The formula for time dilation is often the same as in special relativity:
$Δt = \frac{Δt₀}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$

8. **Give the formulas for #5:** The formula for the addition of velocities is different and depends on the specific model. One proposed formula for collinear velocities `u` and `v` is:
$w = \frac{u+v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}$
However, other models propose different transformation equations that would lead to a different velocity addition law.
