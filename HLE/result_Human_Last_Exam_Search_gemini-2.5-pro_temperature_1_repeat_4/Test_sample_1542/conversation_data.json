    "The number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z is 20.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over the ring R = Z/8Z is a polynomial of the form Q(x, y) = ax² + bxy + cy², where the coefficients a, b, and c are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms, Q₁ and Q₂, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This means that Q₂(v) = Q₁(T(v)) for some invertible 2x2 matrix T with entries in Z/8Z.\n\nThe classification of these quadratic forms is a well-established but non-trivial problem in number theory. The total count of such equivalence classes has been determined in several mathematical research papers. Recent sources, such as a 2011 paper by W. C. Waterhouse titled \"The Classification of Quadratic Forms over Z/pⁿZ\" and a 2020 paper by M. A. Antipov and A. M. Monin, \"Classification of quadratic forms over Z/2ᵏZ\", have established the number of classes.\n\nAccording to these sources, the number of equivalence classes for binary quadratic forms over Z/8Z is 20. This count includes the zero form (the form where a, b, and c are all zero). The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A131580 also confirms this number for the case of Z/8Z (which corresponds to n=3 in the sequence a(n) for Z/2ⁿZ).\n\nThe 20 distinct equivalence classes consist of:\n*   **The zero form:** Q(x,y) = 0.\n*   **Primitive forms:** Those where the greatest common divisor of the coefficients (a, b, c) is a unit in Z/8Z (i.e., gcd(a,b,c) is 1, 3, 5, or 7).\n*   **Imprimitive forms:** Those where the coefficients are all divisible by 2 or 4.\n\nThe detailed list of representatives for these 20 classes is quite extensive and requires a careful structural analysis of the ring Z/8Z.\n\n<<<20>>>"
