    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered, or \"bulky,\" base. In an E2 reaction, a proton and the leaving group (in this case, bromide) must be in an anti-periplanar orientation, meaning they are in the same plane but on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon bond. In cyclohexane chairs, this corresponds to both groups being in axial positions.\n\nFor the (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane molecule, the bromine and methyl groups are trans to each other. In the most stable chair conformation, the bulky methyl group will preferentially occupy an equatorial position, forcing the bromine atom into an axial position. This axial orientation of the bromine is required for the E2 elimination to proceed.\n\nThere are two types of beta-hydrogens that can be eliminated:\n1.  The hydrogen on carbon 2 (C2).\n2.  The hydrogens on carbon 6 (C6).\n\nFor the elimination to occur, a beta-hydrogen must also be in an axial position, anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. In the reactive conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, there is an axial hydrogen on C2 and an axial hydrogen on C6.\n\nElimination of the axial hydrogen from C2 would lead to the formation of 1-methylcyclohexene. This is the more substituted alkene and is known as the Zaitsev product.\n\nElimination of the axial hydrogen from C6 would lead to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene. This is the less substituted alkene and is known as the Hofmann product.\n\nBecause potassium tert-butoxide is a bulky base, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered proton on C2. Consequently, it preferentially removes the less hindered proton from C6. This leads to the formation of the Hofmann product as the major product of the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the name of the product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
