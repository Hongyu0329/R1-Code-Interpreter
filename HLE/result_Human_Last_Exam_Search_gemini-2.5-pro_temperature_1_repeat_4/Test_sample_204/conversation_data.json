    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field is a topological invariant that describes how the field lines are twisted and linked in three-dimensional space. It is an integer quantity. The Whitehead formula provides a way to calculate this charge.\n\nFor a normalized vector field **n**(x,y,z) that is uniform at infinity (i.e., **n** approaches a constant vector as |**r**| → ∞), the Hopf charge can be understood as the product of two winding numbers, H = p * q.\n\nThe given vector field is:\n**n** = (nx, ny, nz) where:\nnx = sin(G)cos(f)\nny = sin(G)sin(f)\nnz = cos(G)\n\nThis represents a mapping from the 3D space R³ to the surface of a unit sphere S², where `G` is the polar angle and `f` is the azimuthal angle on the sphere.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (p):**\n    The angle `f` is defined as `f = atan2(y,x)`. This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. As one traverses a loop in the (x,y) plane around the z-axis, the angle `f` changes by 2π. The winding number `p` associated with this is given by the coefficient of `f` in the vector field definition. In this case, the terms are cos(f) and sin(f), so the winding number `p` is 1.\n\n2.  **Polar Winding Number (q):**\n    The angle `G` is defined as `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)² + z²)`. Let's analyze the range of `G`:\n    *   At the spatial origin (x=0, y=0, z=0), we have `r2 = 0.5`, and `G = π * exp(-5)`.\n    *   As the distance from the origin goes to infinity (|**r**| → ∞), `r2` also goes to infinity. This makes `exp(-10*r2)` approach 0, so `G` approaches 0. When G=0, the vector **n** points to (0,0,1), the \"north pole\". This confirms the field is uniform at infinity.\n    *   The maximum value of `G` is π. This occurs when the exponent is zero, which means `r2 = 0`. This happens when `z=0` and `(x*x+y*y-0.5)² = 0`, which defines a circle in the (x,y) plane with radius `sqrt(0.5)`. Along this circle, `G=π`, and the vector **n** points to (0,0,-1), the \"south pole\".\n\n    The function `G` maps the 3D space to the range of polar angles [0, π]. A path from the circle where `G=π` to a point at infinity corresponds to a path on the sphere from the south pole (G=π) to the north pole (G=0). This traversal of the full range of the polar angle corresponds to a winding number `q` of 1.\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\nH = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge is an integral expression which formalizes this concept. In its differential form representation, H = ∫ α ∧ dα, where dα is the pullback of the sphere's area form. The calculation confirms that the result is an integer. Based on the structure of the field, this integer is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
