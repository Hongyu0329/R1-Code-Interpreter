    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida** in Crete.\n\nSeveral mountains feature in Homer's epic poem, serving as locations for divine intervention and observation of the Trojan War. While Mount Olympus stands as the highest peak in Greece and the mythical home of the gods, other significant mountains are also mentioned.\n\nNotably, two mountains are referred to as Mount Ida in the ancient texts. One is located in Crete and is the island's highest summit at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). This mountain is famously associated with the birthplace of Zeus, where he was hidden from his father, Cronus.\n\nThe other Mount Ida is in the Troad region of western Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), near the site of ancient Troy. This Mount Ida, also known as Kaz Dağı, has an elevation of 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). In the *Iliad*, it is from this mountain's peaks that the gods are said to have watched the Trojan War, and it plays a significant role in the Trojan landscape and mythology.\n\nAnother mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Samothrace**, with its highest peak named Feggari. Poseidon is said to have watched the Trojan War from this vantage point. Its height is approximately 1,611 meters (about one mile).\n\nComparing these elevations, Mount Ida in Crete, at 2,456 meters, is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus (2,917 meters).\n\n<<<Mount Ida in Crete>>>"
