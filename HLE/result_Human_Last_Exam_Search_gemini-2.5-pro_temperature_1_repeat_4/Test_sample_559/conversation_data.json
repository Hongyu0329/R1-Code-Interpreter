    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first need to understand the qualitative behavior of the system's trajectories in the phase plane. A separatrix is a curve that divides the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. Often, this corresponds to the boundary of a basin of attraction.\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nWe are considering the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points:**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, we have an equilibrium point at **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, we have two more equilibrium points at **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Flow of *u(t)***\nThe equation for the u-coordinate, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$, determines the horizontal movement in the phase plane.\n*   If $0 \\leq u < 1$, then $u'(t) \\leq 0$. Trajectories move towards the vertical line $u=0$.\n*   If $u > 1$, then $u'(t) > 0$. Trajectories move away from the line $u=1$ to the right, towards $u \\to \\infty$.\n\nThis analysis immediately reveals two fundamentally different long-term behaviors based on the initial value of $u$. Trajectories starting in the region $0 \\leq u < 1$ will approach the line $u=0$, while trajectories starting in the region $u > 1$ will have their u-coordinate tend to infinity.\n\n**3. Identifying the Separatrix**\nThe line $u=1$ acts as a boundary separating these two distinct behaviors.\n*   Any trajectory starting in the region defined by $0 \\leq u < 1$ has its u-coordinate converge to 0. A more detailed analysis shows that all trajectories in this region converge to the equilibrium point at the origin (0, 0), making this region the basin of attraction for the origin.\n*   Any trajectory starting in the region $u > 1$ will see its u-coordinate grow indefinitely.\n\nThe boundary of a basin of attraction is a separatrix. In this system, the basin of attraction for the equilibrium at the origin is the region where $0 \\leq u < 1$. The boundary of this region is the vertical line $u=1$.\n\nFurthermore, the line $u=1$ is an invariant set. If a trajectory starts on this line (i.e., with an initial condition $u_0 = 1$), it will remain on this line for all time, since $u'(t)=0$ when $u=1$. The behavior on this line is governed by the equation for $d'$, which becomes $d' = 2d^2 + 2d$. On this line, there is a stable equilibrium at $d=-1$ (the saddle point of the 2D system) and an unstable equilibrium at $d=0$.\n\nBecause the line $u=1$ is an invariant set that divides the phase plane into regions of fundamentally different long-term behavior, it is the separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is the vertical line $u=1$.>>>"
