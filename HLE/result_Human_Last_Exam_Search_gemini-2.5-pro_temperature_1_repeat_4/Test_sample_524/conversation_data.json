    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected subset of the plane that is \"homogeneous,\" meaning that for any two points within the set, there exists a homeomorphism (a continuous, invertible map with a continuous inverse) of the set onto itself that transforms one point into the other. The classification of these mathematical objects results in four distinct categories up to homeomorphism.\n\nThe single point is the most straightforward example of a homogeneous planar continuum. It is considered a \"degenerate\" continuum as it consists of only one point.\n\nFor the more complex \"non-degenerate\" continua (those containing more than one point), a complete classification was finalized in 2014 by L. C. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen. Their work demonstrated that there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes:\n\n1.  **The simple closed curve (or the circle):** This is the most familiar example, being topologically equivalent to a circle.\n2.  **The pseudo-arc:** This is a more exotic, fractal-like object. It is characterized by being hereditarily indecomposable, meaning it cannot be broken down into two proper subcontinua.\n3.  **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This can be visualized as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nTherefore, combining the single degenerate case with the three non-degenerate cases, there are a total of four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
