    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometric conditions under which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case (SSA)\n\nThe problem describes a scenario known as the Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines. We are given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA): side `BC`, side `AC`, and `∠B`. For there to be two possible triangles (and thus two possible lengths for the third side `AB`), the length of the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be greater than the altitude from vertex `C` to side `AB` but less than the other given side (`BC`).\n\nLet's denote the side lengths as follows:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n\nWe are given `a = S` and `m∠B = 30°`.\n\n### Deriving the Condition\n\n1.  First, let's find the length of the altitude `h` from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`. In the right triangle formed by the altitude, we have:\n    `sin(B) = h / a`\n    `h = a * sin(B)`\n\n2.  Substituting the given values:\n    `h = S * sin(30°)`\n    Since `sin(30°) = 1/2`, the altitude is:\n    `h = S / 2`\n\n3.  For two distinct triangles `ABC` to exist, the length of side `AC` (which is `b`) must satisfy the following inequality:\n    `h < b < a`\n\n4.  Substituting the expressions for `h` and `a`, we get:\n    `S / 2 < AC < S`\n\n### Computing the Number of Integer Values\n\nThe problem asks for the number of possible *integer* values for the length of side `AC`. We need to count the number of integers `k` in the interval `(S/2, S)`.\n\nThe integers `k` that satisfy this condition are `floor(S/2) + 1`, `floor(S/2) + 2`, ..., `S - 1`.\n\nThe number of these integers can be calculated as:\nNumber of integers = `(S - 1) - (floor(S/2) + 1) + 1 = S - 1 - floor(S/2)`\n\nThis formula can be simplified. Let's consider two cases for the integer `S`:\n*   **If S is even:** Let `S = 2m` for some integer `m`. The inequality is `m < AC < 2m`. The integer values for `AC` are `m+1, m+2, ..., 2m-1`. The number of values is `(2m-1) - (m+1) + 1 = m-1`. This is equal to `S/2 - 1`.\n*   **If S is odd:** Let `S = 2m+1` for some integer `m`. The inequality is `m + 0.5 < AC < 2m+1`. The integer values for `AC` are `m+1, m+2, ..., 2m`. The number of values is `2m - (m+1) + 1 = m`. This is equal to `(S-1)/2`.\n\nBoth of these cases can be unified into a single formula: `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\n### The Value of S\n\nThe value of `S` is given as `SNYWR`. This appears to be a placeholder for a specific number, likely from a math competition or puzzle, which cannot be determined from public sources. Without the specific numerical value of `S`, a final numerical answer cannot be computed.\n\nThe number of integer values for `AC` is given by the formula: `floor((S-1)/2)`.\n\n<<<floor((S-1)/2)>>>"
