    "While historical records confirm the existence of a judge in the free royal town of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461, the specific name of the individual holding this office remains elusive in the available digital archives and documents.\n\nBártfa, a significant urban center in the 15th-century Kingdom of Hungary, possessed a well-developed administrative structure, with the judge (bíró in Hungarian) serving as a key official. A letter from 1461 is known to have been addressed to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa,\" attesting to the presence of this office during the year in question.\n\nA comprehensive study on the medieval administration of the town, \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by historian Mária Fedorčáková, likely contains detailed information about the town's officials, including a list of judges. A review of the book's contents reveals a chapter specifically dedicated to \"Bardejov judges and senators,\" suggesting that the names of the judges from this period are documented within this scholarly work. However, the full text of this publication is not accessible through available online resources, preventing a definitive identification of the judge in 1461.\n\nOther historical figures from Bártfa during this era are mentioned in various documents. For instance, Juraj Stenczel was a prominent member of the town council in the 15th century and served as mayor in 1454. Nevertheless, no available source explicitly names him or any other individual as the judge of Bártfa in the specific year of 1461. Historical documents from that year, including some that are damaged, have so far not yielded the name of the judge.\n\nTherefore, based on the currently accessible information, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to your question as the information is not available in the search results.>>>"
