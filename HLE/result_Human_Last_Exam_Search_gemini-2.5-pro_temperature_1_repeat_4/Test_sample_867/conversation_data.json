    "I am unable to provide a definitive count of the sissone ferm√©es performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's \"Swan Lake,\" choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich.\n\nDespite extensive research to locate a video of this specific performance, a complete and accessible recording is not publicly available. Numerous sources confirm that Zakharova performed the role in 2014 and that the production was filmed and broadcast. However, existing online links to the full ballet are either broken or behind a paywall.\n\nReviews and articles from the time praise Zakharova's technical skill and artistry in the role but do not offer a detailed breakdown of the choreography, such as counting specific ballet steps. A precise answer to your question would require a visual analysis of the performance, which is not possible with the currently available resources.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question because a publicly accessible video of the performance is not available.>>>"
