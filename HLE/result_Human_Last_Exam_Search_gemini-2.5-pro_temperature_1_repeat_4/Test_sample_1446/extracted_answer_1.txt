The value of the critical exponent ν is not a single number but depends on the spatial dimension 'd':
- For d=2, ν is non-universal and varies continuously (e.g., ν=1 for the Ising limit, ν=2/3 for the 4-state Potts limit).
- For d=3, ν ≈ 0.6717 (3D XY universality class).
- For d≥4, ν = 0.5 (mean-field value).
