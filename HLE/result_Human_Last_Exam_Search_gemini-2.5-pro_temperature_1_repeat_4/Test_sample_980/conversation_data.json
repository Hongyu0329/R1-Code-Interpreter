    "Here is the sequence of numbers: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nAn analysis of this sequence suggests that the numbers are not part of a conventional mathematical progression. Instead, the sequence appears to be based on a series of bus routes in Singapore, where each number represents a specific bus service. The connection between the numbers is the geographical proximity of the end of one bus route to the start of the next, creating a virtual journey across the city-state.\n\nBased on the available information, here is a breakdown of the probable journey:\n\n*   **111**: This route starts from Ghim Moh Terminal and loops at Suntec City.\n*   **142**: This service operates in a loop from Toa Payoh Interchange to Potong Pasir Avenue 1. A public transport user might connect from the area served by bus 111 to Toa Payoh.\n*   **41**: This bus service runs in a loop from Jurong East Interchange to Jalan Anak Bukit.\n*   **67**: This is a long route that connects Choa Chu Kang Interchange to Tampines Interchange.\n*   **93**: This service operates between HarbourFront Interchange and Eunos Interchange.\n*   The sequence then repeats some numbers, notably **111** and **67**, and introduces others.\n*   **62**: This service loops from Punggol Interchange to Sims Avenue.\n*   **36**: This route connects Changi Airport Terminal 2 to Tomlinson Road in a loop.\n*   **49**: This bus loops from Jurong East Interchange to Jurong West Street 42.\n*   **155**: This service connects Toa Payoh Interchange with Bedok Interchange.\n*   **10**: This route runs from Tampines Interchange to Kent Ridge Terminal.\n*   **124**: This bus service connects St. Michael's Terminal to HarbourFront Interchange.\n\nThe last number in the sequence is **124**, which terminates at HarbourFront Interchange. To find the next number in the sequence, we must identify a bus service that starts from or near HarbourFront Interchange.\n\nUpon examining the bus services that depart from HarbourFront Interchange, several possibilities arise. Without a more defined pattern in the selection of the subsequent bus, pinpointing the exact next number is challenging. The repetitions of numbers like 111, 67, 62, 36, 49, and 124 suggest that the choice of the next route might not be based on a simple linear path but could involve returning to previous locations or following a more complex logic.\n\nGiven the available information and the established pattern of using Singapore bus routes, the next number would be a bus service that can be taken from HarbourFront Interchange. However, due to the multitude of bus services available from this location and the lack of a clear rule for selecting the next specific route, a definitive single next number cannot be determined from the provided sequence alone.\n\nTherefore, based on the established context of Singapore bus routes, the answer is indeterminate from the given information.\n\n<<<Not enough information to determine the next number.>>>"
