    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in a 2021 paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin titled \"Gromovâ€“Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\".\n\nThe unit circle, denoted as $S^1$, is considered to have a radius of 1, and therefore a circumference of $2\\pi$. The intrinsic metric measures the distance between two points as the length of the shortest arc connecting them. The interval in question is $$, which has a length of $\\lambda=1$.\n\nThe exact value of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is provided in Theorem 6.8 of the aforementioned paper. This result is presented as a formula dependent on the length $\\lambda$ of the interval. For the specific case of the interval $$, the length is $\\lambda = 1$. According to the formula in the paper, for $\\lambda \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is $\\pi/3$. Since $1 \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ (as $\\pi/2 \\approx 1.57$), the distance is $\\pi/3$.\n\nTherefore, the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is $\\pi/3$.\n\n<<<$\\pi/3$>>>"
