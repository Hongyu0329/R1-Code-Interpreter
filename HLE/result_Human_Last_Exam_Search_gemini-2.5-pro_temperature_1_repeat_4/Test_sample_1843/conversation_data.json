    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we follow a systematic approach based on the structure of Dirichlet characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$. In this case:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\cdot \\chi_{9} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nFor the character $\\chi$ to be **primitive** with conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be primitive for its respective modulus $p^a$.\n\nThe **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We require this order to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6. That is, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a}) \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. Since each component must be primitive, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each primitive component are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6. The number of primitive characters of conductor $p^a$ and order $d$ is given by $\\phi(d)$, provided certain conditions are met.\n\n*   **For $N_1 = 4 = 2^2$**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(4) = 2$. There is one primitive character modulo 4, which has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice.\n    *   Number of choices: 1 (of order 2).\n\n*   **For $N_2 = 9 = 3^2$**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(9) = 6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders for characters are divisors of 6, i.e., {1, 2, 3, 6}. The primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n*   **For $N_3 = 7$**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. The possible orders are {2, 3, 6}. All of these divide 6.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n*   **For $N_4 = 11$**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The primitive characters have orders {2, 5, 10}. We only consider those whose order divides 6. Only order 2 qualifies.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Total choices: 1.\n\n*   **For $N_5 = 13$**:\n    The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ has order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The primitive characters have orders {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. We select those whose order divides 6, which are {2, 3, 6}.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ is the product of the number of choices for each component character, provided the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. Let's verify this condition.\n\n*   Any valid combination of characters must include the single primitive character $\\chi_4$, which has order 2. This guarantees the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 2.\n*   Any valid combination must include one of the 4 primitive characters $\\chi_9$. The orders of these characters are 3 or 6, both of which are multiples of 3. This guarantees the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Also, since the order of every component must divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. An integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, any combination of the allowed primitive component characters will result in a character of order 6. The total number is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal number = (Choices for 4) $\\times$ (Choices for 9) $\\times$ (Choices for 7) $\\times$ (Choices for 11) $\\times$ (Choices for 13)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n\n<<<100>>>"
