The normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven ion cyclotron (AIC) waves is calculated using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial due to the Parker spiral, so it is not standard practice to use components perpendicular to the radial direction for this calculation.
