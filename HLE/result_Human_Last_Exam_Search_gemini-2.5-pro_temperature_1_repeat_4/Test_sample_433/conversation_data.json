    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules\n\nOnce a single-dose glass ampule is opened, it must be used immediately, and any remaining contents must be discarded. There is no permissible beyond-use date (BUD) for a punctured ampule, even when handled in a sterile environment such as an ISO Class 5 cleanroom.\n\nThis guideline is stipulated by United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA). The rationale is that once an ampule is broken open, it cannot be resealed, leaving the contents exposed to potential microbial contamination. Unlike vials, which have a rubber stopper that can be resealed, ampules are an open system after being broken.\n\nWhile single-dose *vials* that are entered in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, this rule does not apply to ampules. For single-dose ampules, the guidance is unequivocal: they are not to be stored for any period after opening. If the contents are not used immediately for a single procedure, they must be discarded to ensure patient safety and prevent the risk of contamination.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period and must be discarded.>>>"
