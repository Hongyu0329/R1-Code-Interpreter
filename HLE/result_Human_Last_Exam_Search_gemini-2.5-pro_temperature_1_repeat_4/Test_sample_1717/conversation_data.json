    "According to the source code of the video game *Terraria*, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players in the server. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling for multiple players follows a specific iterative formula. The health increase for the second player is 35% of the base health. For each subsequent player, the amount of health added increases according to a recurrence relation. Let `H(n)` be the health for `n` players and `H_base` be the base health (3,640). The total health can be expressed as a multiplier `M(n)` on the base health, such that `H(n) = H_base * M(n)`. The multiplier for `n` players is the sum of incremental additions for each player.\n\nThe formula for the incremental multiplier added by the n-th player (`d_n`), for `n >= 3`, is derived from the previous player's increment (`d_{n-1}`) as follows:\n`d_n = (2 * d_{n-1} + 1) / 3`, with the starting increment for the second player being `d_2 = 0.35`.\n\nAs the number of players (`n`) approaches infinity, the incremental health multiplier added by each new player (`d_n`) approaches 1. This means that for a very large number of players, each additional player adds approximately 3,640 health to the boss.\n\nBecause each additional player (in the limit) adds a fixed amount of health, the total health does not converge to a finite number. The total health multiplier is the sum of these ever-increasing increments, which forms a divergent series. Therefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the theoretical health of the Eye of Cthulhu also approaches infinity.\n\nWhile some online discussions mention a potential health cap, such as a 1000x multiplier, the detailed analysis of the game's scaling formula available in the search results does not support this claim and instead points towards unbounded growth.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
