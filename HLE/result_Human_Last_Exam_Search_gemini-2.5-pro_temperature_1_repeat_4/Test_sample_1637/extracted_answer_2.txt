Yes, replacing the amide group with a PEG group is a highly recommended strategy to solve the precipitation problem. The original probe's poor water solubility, primarily due to its hydrophobic thioxanthenone core, is the likely cause of precipitation. PEGylation is a well-established method for increasing the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules by attaching hydrophilic PEG chains. This modification should increase the probe's solubility in the cell culture medium and prevent it from precipitating at the 100 ÂµM working concentration.
