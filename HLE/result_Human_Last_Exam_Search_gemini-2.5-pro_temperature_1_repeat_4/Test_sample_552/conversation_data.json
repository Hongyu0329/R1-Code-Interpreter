    "### Einstein's 1905 Paper on Brownian Motion Did Not Cite Any Lectures\n\nIn his groundbreaking 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat\"), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures. The paper is distinguished by its minimal number of references to the works of other scientists.\n\nEinstein's paper on Brownian motion, one of his four celebrated \"Annus Mirabilis\" papers published in 1905, provided a theoretical explanation for the random, erratic movement of particles suspended in a fluid. This work was pivotal in providing empirical evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, a topic of considerable debate among physicists at the time.\n\nWhile the phenomenon of dynamical equilibrium that Einstein described had been previously discussed by other physicists, such as J. J. Thomson in his 1903 lectures at Yale University, Einstein's paper does not contain any citations to these lectures or other contemporary works on the subject. His approach in the paper was largely theoretical and self-contained, building upon his own doctoral dissertation. The absence of citations is a noted characteristic of this particular publication.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
