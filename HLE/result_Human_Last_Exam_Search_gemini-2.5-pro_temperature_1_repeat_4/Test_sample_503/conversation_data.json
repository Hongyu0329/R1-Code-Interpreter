    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, consists of a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ that form an adjunction. Here, $[k]$ denotes the finite ordinal $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$. The objects of this 2-category are the ordinals $[k]$, the 1-morphisms are order-preserving maps between them, and a 2-morphism exists from a map $\\alpha$ to a map $\\beta$ if $\\alpha(x) \\le \\beta(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain.\n\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is given by a pair of morphisms (order-preserving maps) $f: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint) satisfying the condition $f(i) \\le j$ if and only if $i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$. This relationship is also known as a Galois connection between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$.\n\nA key theorem in this context states that a monotone map between complete lattices has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). The posets $[k]$ are finite total orders, which means they are complete lattices. The join of any subset of elements in $[k]$ is simply its maximum.\n\nAny order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ preserves maxima. To see this, let $S$ be a subset of $[m]$ and let $k = \\max(S)$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, for any $i \\in S$, we have $i \\le k$, which implies $f(i) \\le f(k)$. This shows that $f(k)$ is an upper bound for the set $\\{f(i) \\mid i \\in S\\}$, and since $f(k)$ is itself in this set, it must be the maximum. Therefore, $f(\\max(S)) = \\max\\{f(i) \\mid i \\in S\\}$, meaning $f$ preserves all joins.\n\nBecause every order-preserving map $f: \\to$ preserves joins, every such map is a left adjoint in an adjunction. The corresponding right adjoint $g: \\to$ is uniquely determined by $f$. Consequently, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of order-preserving maps from $$ to $$.\n\nThe number of order-preserving maps from $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ to $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ is a classic combinatorial problem. An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of $m+1$ values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(m)$ chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$. The number of such maps is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\left(\\!\\!{k\\choose r}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{k+r-1}{r}$, which in this context becomes $\\binom{(n+1) + (m+1) - 1}{m+1} = \\binom{n+m+1}{m+1}$.\n\nFor this problem, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. The number of elements in the domain $$ is $23+1=24$, and the number of elements in the codomain $$ is $37+1=38$. Plugging these into the formula for the number of order-preserving maps:\nNumber of maps = $\\binom{37 + 23 + 1}{23 + 1} = \\binom{61}{24}$.\n\nThe value of this binomial coefficient is:\n$\\binom{61}{24} = \\frac{61!}{24! \\cdot (61-24)!} = \\frac{61!}{24! \\cdot 37!} = 21,399,363,770,883,100$.\n\n<<<21399363770883100>>>"
