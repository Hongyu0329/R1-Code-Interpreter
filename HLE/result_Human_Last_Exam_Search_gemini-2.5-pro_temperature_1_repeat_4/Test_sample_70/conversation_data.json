    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag and then apply the same methodology to the flags of African nations.\n\n### Determining the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe prompt requires that we view flags as matrices and assume the rank is maximal. This implies that different colors are represented by linearly independent values. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. Let's represent the two colors, red and white, by variables R and W. A simplified matrix representing the flag's essential design would have rows that are either entirely one color or a combination of colors.\n\nFor example, a schematic representation could be:\n```\nR W R\nW W W\nR W R\n```\nIf we assign numerical values, for instance R=1 and W=2, the matrix becomes:\n```\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 1\n```\nThe unique row vectors are `[1 2 1]` and `[2 2 2]`. Since neither vector is a multiple of the other, they are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of this matrix is 2. This logic holds regardless of the specific numerical values chosen for the colors, as long as they are distinct. Thus, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Identifying African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe now need to find African flags whose matrix representation also has a rank of 2. This can occur in two main ways:\n1.  Flags with exactly two colors arranged in a design that is not a simple horizontal or vertical bicolor (which would have a rank of 1).\n2.  Flags with more than two colors, but with a geometric arrangement that results in only two linearly independent rows or columns.\n\nBased on this methodology, the following African nations have flags with a rank of 2:\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band on the hoist side and two horizontal bands of yellow and red on the fly side. This design can be simplified to a 2x2 matrix structure:\n    ```\n    G Y\n    G R\n    ```\n    The two row vectors, `[Green, Yellow]` and `[Green, Red]`, are linearly independent. Thus, the rank is 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar features a vertical white band on the hoist side and two horizontal bands of red and green. This has the same essential structure as the flag of Benin:\n    ```\n    W R\n    W G\n    ```\n    The row vectors `[White, Red]` and `[White, Green]` are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Morocco:** The Moroccan flag is composed of a solid red field with a green pentagram in the center. It has two colors. A row passing through the pentagram will contain both red and green values, while a row outside the emblem will be entirely red. These two types of rows are linearly independent, making the rank 2.\n\n*   **Nigeria:** The flag of Nigeria consists of three vertical bands of green, white, and green. The column vectors are `[Green]`, `[White]`, and `[Green]`. The set of unique column vectors is `{[Green], [White]}`. These two vectors are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n\n*   **Somalia:** The flag of Somalia has a light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center. Similar to the flag of Morocco, the presence of the central emblem of a different color on a solid field creates two types of linearly independent rows, leading to a rank of 2.\n\n*   **Tunisia:** The flag of Tunisia is a red field with a central white disk. Inside the disk are a red crescent and a red star. The flag uses only two colors: red and white. The structure of a central emblem on a solid field results in two linearly independent row types, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria, Somalia, Tunisia>>>"
