    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control tubes for proper instrument setup, compensation, and accurate gating. The purity of the sorted population relies heavily on precise gating, making these controls critical.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls and the number of tubes required for each:\n\n### **1. Unstained Controls (2 tubes)**\nUnstained controls are fundamental for assessing the natural fluorescence (autofluorescence) of your cells and the beads, which is essential for setting the baseline voltage and distinguishing true positive signals from background noise.\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 tube):** Your experimental cells without any fluorescent labels.\n*   **Unstained Streptavidin Beads (1 tube):** The beads you are using, without any fluorophores, to determine their intrinsic fluorescence.\n\n### **2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (6 tubes)**\nIn any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, single-stain controls are essential to correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes. This process, known as compensation, ensures that the signal detected in one channel is not bleed-through from another. You will need one for each fluorochrome in your panel, plus one for the viability dye.\n*   **AF350 control (1 tube)**\n*   **GFP control (1 tube)**\n*   **PE control (1 tube):** This control must use the same PE-conjugated streptavidin that is in your experimental sample.\n*   **AF647 control (1 tube)**\n*   **AF750 control (1 tube)**\n*   **Viability Dye control (1 tube):** To exclude dead cells, a viability dye is crucial. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have higher autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. This dye requires its own compensation control.\n\n### **3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes)**\nFMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially when populations are not distinctly separated or when identifying dim or rare populations. An FMO control contains all the fluorochromes in your panel minus one. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from all other colors into the channel of the omitted fluorochrome, allowing for precise gate placement. For a new or complex panel, it is highly recommended to prepare an FMO control for each channel.\n*   **FMO for AF350 (1 tube):** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750, and viability dye.\n*   **FMO for GFP (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750, and viability dye.\n*   **FMO for PE (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750, and viability dye.\n*   **FMO for AF647 (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750, and viability dye.\n*   **FMO for AF750 (1 tube):** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and viability dye.\n\nIn addition to these instrument setup controls, you should also consider including **biological controls** (e.g., samples known to be positive and negative for your markers of interest) to validate the biological aspect of your staining. However, for the technical setup of the sort, the 13 controls listed above are essential.\n\n<<<13>>>"
