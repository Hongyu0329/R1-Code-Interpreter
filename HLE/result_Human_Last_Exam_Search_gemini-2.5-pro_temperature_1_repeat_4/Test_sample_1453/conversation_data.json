    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. These positions are critical for the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing that dictates the structure and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nA coiled-coil is characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues that form the buried core of the structure. The spacing between these residues is fixed: a residue at position 'a' is followed by a residue at 'd' three positions later (`a` -> `d`), and a 'd' residue is followed by the next 'a' residue four positions later (`d` -> `a`).\n\nLet's analyze the provided sequence:\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nWe can identify the hydrophobic core residues by assigning the 'a' and 'd' positions. Let's test a possible register. If we assign the Isoleucine (I) at position 3 as a 'd' residue, the Leucine (L) at position 7 would be in an 'a' position (since it's four residues after I). Let's verify if this pattern holds.\n\n*   **d-position**: Isoleucine (I) at residue 3\n*   **a-position**: Leucine (L) at residue 7 (3 + 4 = 7)\n*   **d-position**: Isoleucine (I) at residue 10 (7 + 3 = 10)\n*   **a-position**: Leucine (L) at residue 14 (10 + 4 = 14)\n*   **d-position**: Isoleucine (I) at residue 17 (14 + 3 = 17)\n*   **a-position**: Leucine (L) at residue 21 (17 + 4 = 21)\n*   **d-position**: Isoleucine (I) at residue 24 (21 + 3 = 24)\n*   **a-position**: Leucine (L) at residue 28 (24 + 4 = 28)\n\nThis assignment is consistent throughout the entire length of the repeating sequence. The heptad repeat positions are as follows:\n\n<pre>\nPosition: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7    8  9  10 11 12 13 14   15 16 17 18 19 20 21   22 23 24 25 26 27 28\nResidue:  G  E  <b>I</b>  A  Q  S  <b>L</b>    K  E  <b>I</b>  A  K  S  <b>L</b>    K  E  <b>I</b>  A  W  S  <b>L</b>    K  E  <b>I</b>  A  Q  S  <b>L</b>\nHeptad:   b  c  <b>d</b>  e  f  g  <b>a</b>    b  c  <b>d</b>  e  f  g  <b>a</b>    b  c  <b>d</b>  e  f  g  <b>a</b>    b  c  <b>d</b>  e  f  g  <b>a</b>\n</pre>\n\nThis analysis confirms the identity of the core residues:\n*   **'a' positions are consistently occupied by Leucine (L).**\n*   **'d' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (I).**\n\n### 2. Relating Core Residues to Oligomeric State\n\nThe identity and arrangement of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions are primary determinants of the coiled-coil's oligomeric state. Extensive studies have established a set of rules based on packing efficiency and hydrophobic interactions:\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Favored by having Isoleucine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position (`Ia/Ld`). This is the pattern found in the classic GCN4 leucine zipper.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often favored when both 'a' and 'd' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (`Ia/Id`) or by the presence of polar residues like Asparagine.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Favored by the reverse arrangement of the dimeric pattern, with Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position (`La/Id`). The packing geometry of a four-helix bundle better accommodates the bulky, Î²-branched Isoleucine side chain at the 'd' position and the more flexible Leucine at the 'a' position.\n\nThe sequence in question, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, has a clear `La/Id` pattern. Based on the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this arrangement strongly directs the formation of a tetrameric coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the most probable oligomeric state for this protein sequence is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
