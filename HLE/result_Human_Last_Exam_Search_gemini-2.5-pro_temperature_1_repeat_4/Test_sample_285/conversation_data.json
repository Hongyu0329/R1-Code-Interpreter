    "To determine the largest $p$ for which the function $I(a_1, \\dots, a_9)$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we first need to understand the behavior of the integral $I$ for large values of its arguments, i.e., as $|\\mathbf{a}| = \\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2} \\to \\infty$. The function $I(\\mathbf{a})$ is an oscillatory integral, and its decay rate is determined by the phase polynomial\n$$ \\phi(x, y; \\mathbf{a}) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3 $$\nThe decay of $I(\\mathbf{a})$ as $|\\mathbf{a}| \\to \\infty$ depends on the direction of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ in the 9-dimensional parameter space. The overall $L^p$ integrability is limited by the direction(s) in which $|I(\\mathbf{a})|$ decays the slowest. Let this slowest decay rate be $|\\mathbf{a}|^{-\\delta_{\\min}}$.\n\nWe want to find the largest $p$ such that the following integral diverges:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\mathbf{a})|^p \\, d\\mathbf{a} $$\nBy switching to spherical coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^9$, with $R = |\\mathbf{a}|$, the volume element is $d\\mathbf{a} = R^8 dR d\\Omega$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{S^8} \\int_0^\\infty |I(R\\omega)|^p R^8 \\, dR \\, d\\Omega $$\nwhere $\\omega$ is a direction on the unit 8-sphere $S^8$. As $R \\to \\infty$, $|I(R\\omega)| \\sim C(\\omega)R^{-\\delta(\\omega)}$ for some exponent $\\delta(\\omega)$ that depends on the direction. The convergence of the integral is determined by the behavior for large $R$. We are interested in the radial part:\n$$ \\int_1^\\infty R^{-p\\delta(\\omega)} R^8 \\, dR = \\int_1^\\infty R^{8-p\\delta(\\omega)} \\, dR $$\nThis integral converges if $8-p\\delta(\\omega) < -1$, which implies $p\\delta(\\omega) > 9$. It diverges if $8-p\\delta(\\omega) \\ge -1$, which implies $p\\delta(\\omega) \\le 9$.\nFor the entire integral over $\\mathbb{R}^9$ to converge, we need convergence in all directions $\\omega$. This means we need $p\\delta(\\omega) > 9$ for all $\\omega$. This is equivalent to requiring $p > 9/\\delta(\\omega)$ for all $\\omega$, which means $p > 9/\\delta_{\\min}$, where $\\delta_{\\min} = \\min_{\\omega} \\delta(\\omega)$.\nThe function $I$ is in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ if $p > 9/\\delta_{\\min}$. Consequently, $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ if $p \\le 9/\\delta_{\\min}$. The largest such value of $p$ is precisely $9/\\delta_{\\min}$.\n\nThe problem now is to find the minimal decay exponent, $\\delta_{\\min}$. This is found by identifying which choice of coefficients $\\mathbf{a}$ makes the phase function $\\phi(x,y;\\mathbf{a})$ as \"flat\" as possible at some point in the integration domain $^2$. The flatness is related to the vanishing of derivatives of the phase function.\n\nLet's test some specific directions for $\\mathbf{a}$:\n1.  If only $a_1 \\ne 0$, $I(a_1,0,\\dots,0) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i a_1 x} dx dy = \\frac{e^{2\\pi i a_1}-1}{2\\pi i a_1}$, which decays like $|a_1|^{-1}$. So, $\\delta=1$.\n2.  If only $a_3 \\ne 0$, $I(0,0,a_3,0,\\dots,0) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_3 x^2} dx dy = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_3 x^2} dx$. By the van der Corput lemma, this integral decays like $|a_3|^{-1/2}$. So, $\\delta=1/2$.\n3.  If only $a_6 \\ne 0$, $I(0,\\dots,a_6,0,\\dots,0) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx dy = \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_6 x^3} dx$. The phase $\\psi(x)=x^3$ has $\\psi'(0)=\\psi''(0)=0$ and $\\psi'''(0)=6$. This is a degenerate critical point at the boundary of the integration domain. The decay rate is determined by the highest order of the vanishing derivative, which is $k=3$. The integral decays like $|a_6|^{-1/3}$. So, $\\delta=1/3$.\n4.  If only $a_7 \\ne 0$, $I(0,\\dots,a_7,0,0,0) = \\int_0^1 \\int_0^1 e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2 y} dx dy$. Integrating with respect to $y$ first gives $\\int_0^1 \\frac{e^{2\\pi i a_7 x^2} - 1}{2\\pi i a_7 x^2} dx$. An analysis of this integral shows a decay rate of $|a_7|^{-1/2}$. So, $\\delta=1/2$.\n5.  For a generic choice of $\\mathbf{a}$ where only the cubic coefficients $(a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9)$ are non-zero, the phase is a non-degenerate homogeneous cubic polynomial. A scaling argument ($x \\to u\\lambda^{-1/3}, y \\to v\\lambda^{-1/3}$) shows that the integral decays like $\\lambda^{-2/3}$. So, $\\delta=2/3$.\n\nComparing the decay exponents we found: $1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3$. The smallest of these is $1/3$. This corresponds to the slowest decay rate. The phase polynomial being of degree 3, the highest possible order of a root of the phase or its derivatives is 3, so a decay slower than $|\\mathbf{a}|^{-1/3}$ is not expected.\nTherefore, we have $\\delta_{\\min} = 1/3$.\n\nThe largest value of $p$ for which $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is:\n$$ p = \\frac{9}{\\delta_{\\min}} = \\frac{9}{1/3} = 27 $$\n\n<<<27>>>"
