    "In quantum statistical mechanics, the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H at an inverse temperature β = 1/(k_B T) is defined as the trace of the thermal operator:\n\nZ = Tr(e⁻βᴴ)\n\nFeynman's path integral formalism, when extended to imaginary time, provides a powerful method for calculating this partition function. The transition to imaginary time, τ = it/ħ, formally connects quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics.\n\nFor fermionic systems, a crucial modification is required to handle the anticommuting nature of fermion creation and annihilation operators, as dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. This is achieved by representing the fermionic fields not by ordinary numbers, but by anticommuting Grassmann numbers.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields ψ(τ, **x**) and its conjugate ψ̅(τ, **x**), which are treated as independent Grassmann variables:\n\nZ = ∫ Dψ̅Dψ e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̅,ψ]\n\nHere:\n\n*   **Dψ̅Dψ** represents the functional integration measure over all possible field configurations.\n*   **ψ(τ, x)** and **ψ̅(τ, x)** are the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields, which are functions of imaginary time τ and spatial coordinates **x**.\n*   **S_E[ψ̅, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the system, obtained from the standard action by a Wick rotation to imaginary time. The general form of the Euclidean action is:\n\n    S_E[ψ̅, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx L_E(ψ̅, ψ, ∂_τψ̅, ∂_τψ)\n\n    where L_E is the Euclidean Lagrangian density. For a common non-interacting fermionic system described by a Hamiltonian H = εc†c, the action takes the form:\n\n    S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̅(x, τ)(ħ∂/∂τ + H₀)ψ(x, τ)\n\n    where H₀ represents the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., containing kinetic energy and chemical potential terms).\n\nA critical feature that distinguishes fermionic from bosonic path integrals is the boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the imaginary time direction. The trace operation in the definition of the partition function forces the fermionic fields to be **anti-periodic** over the imaginary time interval [0, βħ]:\n\nψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + βħ, **x**)\nψ̅(τ, **x**) = -ψ̅(τ + βħ, **x**)\n\n(Here, ħ, the reduced Planck constant, is often set to 1 in natural units).\n\nFor non-interacting theories, the action is quadratic in the fermion fields, making the path integral a Gaussian integral over Grassmann variables. This integral can be evaluated exactly and yields the determinant of the operator in the action:\n\nZ = det(ħ∂/∂τ + H₀)\n\nThis determinant is taken over the space of anti-periodic functions.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ Dψ̅Dψ e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̅,ψ], where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̅. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ) = -ψ(τ + β). The term S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, typically of the form S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̅(∂/∂τ + H₀)ψ.>>>"
