The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ Dψ̅Dψ e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̅,ψ], where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̅. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ) = -ψ(τ + β). The term S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, typically of the form S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̅(∂/∂τ + H₀)ψ.
