To obtain the effective electron-electron interaction, we perform a path integral over the phonon fields. The total action contains the pure phonon part and the electron-phonon interaction term.

The relevant part of the action for the path integral over the phonon fields can be written as:
$S[\phi] = \sum_{q,j} \int d\tau \left( \frac{1}{2} |\partial_\tau \phi_{q,j}|^2 + \frac{1}{2} \omega_q^2 |\phi_{q,j}|^2 - i g \frac{q_j}{\sqrt{2m\omega_q}} \rho_q (\phi_{q,j} + \phi_{-q,j}^*) \right)$
where $\phi_{q,j}$ represents the phonon field and $\rho_q$ is the electron density operator.

This is a Gaussian integral over the phonon fields $\phi_{q,j}$. The general form of such an integral is:
$\int D[\phi] e^{-S[\phi]} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2} \sum_{q,j} J_{-q,j} D_{q,j} J_{q,j}\right)$
where $J_{q,j}$ is the source term arising from the electron-phonon coupling and $D_{q,j}$ is the phonon propagator.

In our case, the source term is proportional to the electron density operator: $J_{q,j} \propto g \frac{i q_j}{\sqrt{2m\omega_q}} \rho_q$.

Integrating out the phonon fields yields an effective action for the electrons. The resulting term that describes the electron-electron interaction for a specific momentum transfer **q** (without performing the sum over **q**) is:

$H_{eff} = - \frac{g^2}{2m\omega_q^2} \sum_j |q_j|^2 \rho_q \rho_{-q}$

This expression represents an effective interaction between electron density fluctuations mediated by phonons. The negative sign indicates that this interaction is attractive.
