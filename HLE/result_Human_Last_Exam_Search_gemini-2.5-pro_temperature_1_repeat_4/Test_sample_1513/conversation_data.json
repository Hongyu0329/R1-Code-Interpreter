    "An island town more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name is Hanga Roa, located on Easter Island.\n\nEaster Island, a Chilean dependency, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Pitcairn Island, being over 2,000 kilometers away. The main town and capital of Easter Island is Hanga Roa. In the local Rapa Nui language, \"Hanga Roa\" means \"wide bay\" or \"long bay,\" directly linking the town's name to the bay it is situated on.\n\nHanga Roa is located on the island's west coast in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. The Rano Kau volcano, which is adjacent to Hanga Roa, features a large and impressive volcanic caldera with a diameter of about 1.6 kilometers. The town of Hanga Roa sits on Hanga Roa Bay at the base of this volcanic structure.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
