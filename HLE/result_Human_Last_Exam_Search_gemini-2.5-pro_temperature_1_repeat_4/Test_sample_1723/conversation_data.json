    "There is no single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. While several mushroom species exhibit blue coloration in their caps, gills, or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nA spore print, a crucial tool for mushroom identification, is the colored powdery deposit left by the spores of a mushroom cap. The typical colors for spore prints are shades of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, purple-brown, and black. A notable exception is the green spore print of *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, but a blue spore print has not been documented.\n\nSeveral well-known blue-colored mushrooms highlight this fact:\n*   ***Lactarius indigo***: This striking blue mushroom has a yellowish-cream spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea*** (Blue Roundhead): This blue-green mushroom produces a purple-brown spore print.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri***: Native to New Zealand, this vibrant blue mushroom has a pink spore print.\n*   ***Neoalbatrellus caeruleoporus***: This blue-capped mushroom has a white spore print.\n*   ***Russula chloroides*** (Blue Band Brittlegill): This mushroom features a blue band at the top of the stem but has a white to pale cream spore print.\n\nTherefore, based on current mycological knowledge, the premise that a genus of mushroom produces a distinctly blue spore print is incorrect.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
