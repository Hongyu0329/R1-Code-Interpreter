    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as a₂. The spectral action is approximated by a sum over the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the square of the Dirac operator, D². For a massless gauged Dirac spinor in a four-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the operator D is the covariant derivative on spinors coupled to a gauge field.\n\nThe heat kernel expansion for the trace of the exponential of the operator is given by:\nTr(e⁻ᵗᴰ²) ≈ (4πt)⁻² Σₙ tⁿ aₙ\n\nThe second coefficient, a₂, is a functional of the background fields, namely the spacetime curvature and the gauge field strength. For a massless Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field, the a₂ coefficient is given by the integral of a local density over the manifold.\n\nThe general formula for the diagonal of the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient a₂(x,x) for a Laplace-type operator of the form D = - (gᵐᵘⁿ∇ₘ∇ₙ + E) is:\n\na₂(x,x) = (1/180) * RₐᵦᵧᵨRᵃᵝᵞᵟ tr(I) + (1/180) * RₐᵦRᵃᵝ tr(I) + (1/2) * tr(E²) + (1/6) * R*tr(E) + (1/30) * ∇²(R) tr(I) + (1/6) * ∇²tr(E)\n\nFor the square of the Dirac operator on a Dirac spinor bundle, the endomorphism E can be expressed in terms of the curvature and the gauge field strength. After performing the trace over the spinor space, the coefficient a₂ for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is found to be proportional to the integral of a linear combination of the square of the Weyl tensor, the square of the Ricci scalar, and the square of the gauge field strength.\n\nSpecifically, for a massless gauged Dirac spinor, the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient a₂ is:\na₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g [ (1/180) CₐᵦᵧᵨCᵃᵝᵞᵟ - (1/288) R² - (1/12) FₐᵦFᵃᵝ ]\n\nwhere:\n*   Cₐᵦᵧᵨ is the Weyl curvature tensor.\n*   R is the Ricci scalar.\n*   Fₐᵦ is the gauge field strength tensor.\n*   g is the determinant of the metric tensor.\n\nThis formula provides the contribution of the gravitational and gauge fields to the second term in the asymptotic expansion of the spectral action.\n\n<<<a₂ = ∫ d⁴x √g [ (1/180) CₐᵦᵧᵨCᵃᵝᵞᵟ - (1/288) R² - (1/12) FₐᵦFᵃᵝ ]>>>"
