    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is a type of triangular-shaped graphene flake, sometimes referred to as a triangulene derivative. The structure is planar and exhibits a high degree of symmetry.\n\nBased on its molecular structure, the symmetry group of this molecule is determined to be **D3h**. This point group is characterized by:\n\n*   One principal C3 axis of rotation (a 120-degree rotation leaves the molecule unchanged).\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation perpendicular to the principal axis.\n*   One horizontal mirror plane (σh) coincident with the molecular plane.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv) that contain the principal C3 axis.\n*   An improper rotation axis S3.\n\nThese symmetry elements are consistent with the triangular and planar nature of the molecule with its three ethynyl substituents.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
