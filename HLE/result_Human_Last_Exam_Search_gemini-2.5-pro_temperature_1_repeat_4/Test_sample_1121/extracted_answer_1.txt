Based on the analysis, the approximate number of non-Clifford gates required is:
*   **For a distance-3 code:** **15** gates per logical gate, based on a standard 15-to-1 distillation protocol.
*   **For a distance-5 code at 1% error:** **225** gates per logical gate, based on a two-level 15-to-1 distillation scheme needed to overcome the high physical error rate.
