    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who recounts a personal memory that strongly alludes to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus is the **Hall-Sun**.\n\nThe Hall-Sun, the foster-daughter of the Wolfing leader Thiodolf, describes her earliest memory to a carline (an old woman). In this recollection, she speaks of being a baby in the woods, where she was cared for by a great she-wolf. She recalls playing with the wolf without fear.\n\nHer memory continues with the appearance of a \"glorious creature,\" a warrior in a gleaming helmet and gold-adorned red raiment. This warrior approached her kindly, took her onto his knee, and she felt a strong connection to him before he departed. Afterwards, the she-wolf returned to her side.\n\nThis narrative does not describe a visit to a Roman city or its explicit religious rituals. Instead, it serves as a powerful and recognizable allusion to the legend of Romulus and Remus, the twin founders of Rome, who were abandoned as infants and suckled by a she-wolf. The \"glorious creature\" can be interpreted as a figure analogous to Faustulus, the shepherd who discovered and raised the twins, or perhaps even a nod to their divine father, Mars. Through the Hall-Sun's personal history, Morris weaves in this foundational Roman myth, contrasting it with the culture of the Goths.\n\n<<<The Hall-Sun>>>"
