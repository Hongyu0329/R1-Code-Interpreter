    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The key requirements involve the properties of the spaces, the monotonicity of the functions, and a contractive condition. The primary results in this area have been formulated by Deepa Karichery and Shaini Pulickakunnel.\n\nThe main conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\n**1. Properties of the Spaces:**\n(X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\n**2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe mappings F, G, and H must satisfy the mixed monotone property. This means that for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   **For F:**\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its first argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   F is non-increasing in its second argument: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its third argument: z₁ ≤ z₂ implies F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n*   **For G:**\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its first argument: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies G(y₁, x, y) ≤ G(y₂, x, y).\n    *   G is non-increasing in its second argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies G(y, x₁, y) ≥ G(y, x₂, y).\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its third argument: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies G(y, x, y₁) ≤ G(y, x, y₂).\n\n*   **For H:**\n    *   H is non-decreasing in its first argument: z₁ ≤ z₂ implies H(z₁, y, x) ≤ H(z₂, y, x).\n    *   H is non-increasing in its second argument: y₁ ≤ y₂ implies H(z, y₁, x) ≥ H(z, y₂, x).\n    *   H is non-increasing in its third argument: x₁ ≤ x₂ implies H(z, y, x₁) ≥ H(z, y, x₂).\n\n**3. Contractive Condition:**\nThere must exist non-negative constants k, l, m with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, the following inequality holds:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\n\n**4. Existence of Initial Points:**\nThere must exist points (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n**5. Continuity or Regularity:**\nEither:\n*   The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n*   Or, the spaces (X, ≤), (Y, ≤), and (Z, ≤) have a property where if a non-decreasing sequence converges, the limit is an upper bound for the sequence, and if a non-increasing sequence converges, the limit is a lower bound for the sequence.\n\nUnder these conditions, there exists at least one FGH-tripled fixed point. For the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is required: for any two points (x, y, z) and (x*, y*, z*) in X × Y × Z, there exists a point (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z that is comparable to both.\n\nThese conditions are a generalization of the celebrated Banach contraction principle to the case of three coupled functions in the setting of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The primary conditions for the existence of such a point are established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve the following:\n\n1.  **Properties of the Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z are partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, meaning they are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others.\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** A contraction inequality must hold for the sum of the distances between the function values, involving contraction constants that sum to less than one.\n4.  **Initial Point Condition:** There must exist initial points x₀, y₀, and z₀ that are related to their images under F, G, and H by the partial order.\n5.  **Continuity or Regularity of the Space:** Either the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the spaces satisfy a regularity condition concerning the convergence of monotone sequences.\n\nFor the fixed point to be unique, there is an additional comparability condition required for any two triplets in the space.>>>"
