    "In a standard surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded by introducing holes is directly related to the number of these holes. For each hole created within a surface code patch, a new logical qubit can be encoded.\n\nSpecifically, a single patch of surface code with 'b' closed holes can encode 'b' logical qubits. Therefore, one patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nGiven that there are two separate patches of surface code, and each patch contains two holes, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n*   **Patch 1:** 2 holes = 2 logical qubits\n*   **Patch 2:** 2 holes = 2 logical qubits\n\nTherefore, the total maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
