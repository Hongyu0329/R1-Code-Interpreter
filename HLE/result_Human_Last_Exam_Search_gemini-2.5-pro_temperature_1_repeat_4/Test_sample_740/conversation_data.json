    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. A solution may not exist for certain values of the parameter λ. These values are known as characteristic values.\n\nThe equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ ((xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)) u(y) dy`, for `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n\nThe kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σₖ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ xᵏ yⁿ⁻¹⁻ᵏ`.\n\nThis shows the kernel is \"separable\" or \"degenerate,\" which means the integral equation can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. The solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let's assume the solution has the form:\n`u(x) = 1 + Σᵢ₌₀ⁿ⁻¹ aᵢxⁱ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the original equation leads to a system of `n` linear equations for the unknown coefficients `aᵢ`. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n`(I - λA)a = λb`\n\nwhere:\n*   `a` is the column vector of coefficients `[a₀, a₁, ..., aₙ⁻¹]ᵀ`.\n*   `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix.\n*   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `Aᵢⱼ = 1 / (n - i + j)`, for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n*   `b` is a column vector with entries `bᵢ = 1 / (n - i)`.\n\nA unique solution to this system fails to exist when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.\n`det(I - λA) = 0`\n\nThe values of λ that satisfy this equation are the characteristic values of the integral equation. For these values, the system of equations either has no solution or infinitely many solutions, depending on the vector `b` (a consequence of the Fredholm alternative theorem).\n\nFor there to be no solution, the system must be inconsistent. This generally occurs when `det(I - λA) = 0`. A solution would only exist in the special case where the vector `λb` is orthogonal to the null space of the transpose of the coefficient matrix, `(I - λA)ᵀ`. It can be shown that this special condition is not met.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions for the values of λ that are the roots of the polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`. These values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\nLet's examine the cases for small `n`:\n\n*   **For n = 1:** The matrix `A` is `[1]`. The equation `det(I - λA) = 0` becomes `1 - λ = 0`, so `λ = 1`. Thus, for `n=1`, there is no solution when `λ = 1`.\n*   **For n = 2:** The matrix `A` is `[[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`. The determinant equation is `det([[1 - λ/2, -λ/3], [-λ, 1 - λ/2]]) = 0`. This simplifies to the quadratic equation `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`. The roots are `λ = -6 ± 4√3`. For these two values of `λ`, the equation has no solution.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe equation has no solutions for the values of λ that are the roots of the `n`-th degree polynomial equation `det(I - λA) = 0`, where `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries given by `Aᵢⱼ = 1 / (n - i + j)` for `i, j = 0, 1, ..., n-1`. There are `n` such values of `λ` for any given `n`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the roots of the equation `det(I - λA) = 0`, where `A` is the `n x n` matrix with entries `Aᵢⱼ = 1/(n-i+j)`.>>>"
