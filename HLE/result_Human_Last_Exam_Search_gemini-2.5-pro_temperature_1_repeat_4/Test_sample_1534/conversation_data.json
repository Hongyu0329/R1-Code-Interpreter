    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, as well as the **dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger group of lobes known as the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is situated in the posterior subesophageal mass of the brain. This complex governs lower motor control of locomotion.\n\nDetailed brain atlases of the dwarf cuttlefish, developed through MRI and histological techniques, have identified the components of the palliovisceral lobe complex. These components include the main palliovisceral lobe, the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes, the fin lobes, the posterior chromatophore lobes, and the vasomotor lobes. The naming and grouping of these structures within the posterior part of the brain indicate their close spatial relationship. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the release of ink. The posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, all of which are located towards the rear of the cuttlefish's body.\n\nThree-dimensional models of the dwarf cuttlefish brain, which can be viewed from a posterior perspective, show the arrangement of these lobes. These models confirm that the posterior chromatophore lobes and the vasomotor lobes are located adjacent to and behind the main palliovisceral lobe.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes.>>>"
