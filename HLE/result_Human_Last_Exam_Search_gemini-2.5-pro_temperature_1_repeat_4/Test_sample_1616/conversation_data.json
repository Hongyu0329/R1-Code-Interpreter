    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel or diphthong becomes lax (short) if it is followed by two or more syllables. This rule primarily affects words of Latin and Greek origin, often when suffixes are added.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **serenity**: This word is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing. It is derived from the word `serene`, which has a tense vowel /iː/ (like in \"machine\"). When the \"-ity\" suffix is added, creating the four-syllable word `se-ren-i-ty`, the vowel in the stressed syllable becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ (like in \"dress\").\n*   **derivative**: This is another classic case. The base word `derive` has a tense diphthong /aɪ/ (like in \"pride\"). In the four-syllable word `de-riv-a-tive`, this sound changes to the lax vowel /ɪ/ (like in \"kit\").\n*   **gratitude**: This word demonstrates the rule as well. It is related to `grateful`, which has a tense vowel /eɪ/ (like in \"gate\"). In the three-syllable word `grat-i-tude`, the vowel becomes the lax /æ/ (like in \"trap\").\n*   **southern**: While this word only has two syllables in Modern English (`south-ern`), its vowel change is a result of trisyllabic laxing on its Old English ancestor, *sūtherne*, which had three syllables. The tense diphthong /aʊ/ in `south` becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/ in `southern`. Therefore, it has undergone this sound change in its historical development.\n*   **pleasant**: This is a two-syllable word (`pleas-ant`). Although its vowel /ɛ/ is lax compared to the tense vowel /iː/ in the related word `please`, it does not fit the definition of trisyllabic laxing because the vowel is not followed by two syllables. This is an instance of laxing in a two-syllable word.\n*   **shadow**: This word, derived from Old English `sceaduwe`, has two syllables (`shad-ow`). The change from the tense vowel /eɪ/ in the related word `shade` to the lax vowel /æ/ in `shadow` is an example of a different process, sometimes called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` are two-syllable words and therefore have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, `shadow` is frequently cited as a textbook example of a different type of laxing (disyllabic), making it a clear contrast to the trisyllabic rule.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
