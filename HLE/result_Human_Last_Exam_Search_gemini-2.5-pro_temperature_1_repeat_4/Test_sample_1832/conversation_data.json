    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are used to describe the effects of gravity, are calculated from the derivatives of this metric.\n\nDue to the spherical symmetry and the static nature of the spacetime, most of the Christoffel symbols are zero. However, there are a specific number of non-zero symbols. These are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nCounting these distinct non-zero components, we find there are a total of 9 non-zero Christoffel symbols. It is important to note that due to the symmetry of the lower indices of the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$), components like $\\Gamma^t_{tr}$ are the same as $\\Gamma^t_{rt}$ and are counted as one.\n\n<<<9>>>"
