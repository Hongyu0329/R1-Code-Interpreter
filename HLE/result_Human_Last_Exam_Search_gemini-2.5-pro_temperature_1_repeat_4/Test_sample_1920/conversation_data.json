    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Factorize the Conductor\nFirst, we determine the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A search reveals that 53599 is a composite number. Its prime factorization is:\n$d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$\n\n### 2. Structure of the Dirichlet Character\nSince the conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, a primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d$ must be a product of primitive characters modulo each prime factor of $d$. That is,\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere each $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo the prime $p$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is not the principal (trivial) character, which has an order of 1.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### 4. Conditions on the Component Characters\nFor the lcm of the orders to be 6, the following conditions must be met:\n*   The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n*   Since each $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   At least one component character must have an order divisible by 2 (i.e., 2 or 6).\n*   At least one component character must have an order divisible by 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nFor the primes dividing $d$:\n*   $p=7$: $p-1=6$. Orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   $p=13$: $p-1=12$. Since 6 divides 12, orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   $p=19$: $p-1=18$. Since 6 divides 18, orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n*   $p=31$: $p-1=30$. Since 6 divides 30, orders 2, 3, and 6 are possible.\n\n### 5. Counting the Characters\nFor each prime factor $p$ of $d$, we count the number of available non-principal characters whose orders are divisors of 6:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\nFor each of the four prime components, there are $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices of characters whose orders are in the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The total number of ways to choose one such character for each prime factor is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nThis total includes combinations where the lcm of the orders is not 6. The lcm will not be 6 if all component orders lack a factor of 2, or if they all lack a factor of 3.\n\n*   **Case 1: lcm is not divisible by 3.** This occurs if all component characters have an order of 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. Thus, there is $1^4 = 1$ such combination.\n*   **Case 2: lcm is not divisible by 2.** This occurs if all component characters have an order of 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. Thus, there are $2^4 = 16$ such combinations.\n\nThese two cases are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the number of combinations where the lcm is 6 is the total number of combinations minus these exceptions.\n\nNumber of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm not divisible by 3) - (Combinations with lcm not divisible by 2)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
