    "To determine the protein sequence from the given nucleotide sequence, it is necessary to first identify the correct reading frame. A DNA sequence has three possible forward reading frames, starting at the first, second, or third nucleotide. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), the correct frame will be the one that does not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nTranslating this sequence in all three reading frames reveals the following:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the first nucleotide (`g`ga). The fifth codon in this frame is `tag`, which is a stop codon.\n    `G H C C * R R L N G T V K F S S S L P Y P N N L N S V L A E R L E K W`\n    *(Translation stops at the asterisk)*\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the second nucleotide (`g`ac). This frame does not contain any stop codons, which is consistent with it being from the middle of an ORF.\n    `D I V V S E D L N G T V K F S S S L P Y P N N L N S V L A E R L E K W P`\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the third nucleotide (`gg`a). The eighth codon in this frame is `tga`, which is a stop codon.\n    `T L L L A K T * M E R * S F K L F T L P Q * S * Q C P G * R L E K W`\n    *(Translation stops at the asterisk)*\n\nBased on this analysis, Frame 2 is the correct open reading frame.\n\nThe correct frame and its corresponding protein sequence are:\n\n*   **Frame:** 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** <<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKWP>>>"
