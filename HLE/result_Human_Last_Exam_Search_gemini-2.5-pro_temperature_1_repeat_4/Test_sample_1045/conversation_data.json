    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene (C7H8), the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is determined by summing the functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nFirst, the number of atoms of each element in toluene is:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 7 atoms\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 8 atoms\n\nNext, we determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each type of atom using the 6-31G basis set:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence double-zeta basis set. The core 1s orbital is described by a single contracted function. The valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is split into two sets of basis functions (an inner and an outer set). This results in one 1s function, two 2s functions, and two sets of three 2p functions (2px, 2py, 2pz). Therefore, each carbon atom uses 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 2 * 3 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** Hydrogen only has a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals. In the 6-31G basis set, this valence orbital is split into two contracted Gaussian functions (an inner and an outer function). Thus, each hydrogen atom uses **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\nFinally, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene is calculated as follows:\n\n*   (Number of Carbon atoms × Functions per Carbon atom) + (Number of Hydrogen atoms × Functions per Hydrogen atom)\n*   (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n*   63 + 16 = **79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
