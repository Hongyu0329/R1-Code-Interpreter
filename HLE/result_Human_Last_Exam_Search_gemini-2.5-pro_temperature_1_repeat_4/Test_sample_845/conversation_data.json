    "The value computed as the time between heartbeats, used for tracking HR and HRV from PPG signals, is most commonly called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis measurement quantifies the small fluctuations in time from one heartbeat to the next. While several terms are used for this value, IBI is frequently associated with data obtained from photoplethysmography (PPG).\n\nOther synonymous terms you might encounter include:\n*   **Beat-to-beat interval (BBI)**\n*   **R-R interval**, which specifically refers to the time between the R-peaks on an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform.\n*   **Heart period**\n*   **Normal-to-normal (NN) interval**, which is used to denote the intervals between normal heartbeats, excluding any irregular ones.\n\nEssentially, all these terms describe the same fundamental measurement: the duration between consecutive heartbeats, which is crucial for calculating heart rate variability.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
