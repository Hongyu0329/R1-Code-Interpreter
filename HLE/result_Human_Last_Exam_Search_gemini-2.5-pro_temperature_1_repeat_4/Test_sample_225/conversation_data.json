    "The curve described by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is a type of Lissajous curve. To find the number of self-intersection points, we can use a known formula for Lissajous figures of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers.\n\nFor such curves, where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1).\n\nIn this specific case, we have:\n*   a = 9\n*   b = 5\n\nThe numbers 9 and 5 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). Therefore, we can apply the formula:\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) = 8 * 4 = 32.\n\nThe curve intersects itself at 32 distinct points.\n\n<<<32>>>"
