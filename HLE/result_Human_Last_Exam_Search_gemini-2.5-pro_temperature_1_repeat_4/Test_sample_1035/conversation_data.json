    "The search results confirm that the problem of finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover all edges of a complete graph \\( K_n \\) is a standard problem in graph theory.\n\n*   The minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover all the edges of \\( K_n \\) is called the biclique cover number, denoted \\( bc(K_n) \\). A biclique is a complete bipartite subgraph, but any bipartite graph's edges can be covered by a single biclique, so the problem is the same.\n*   The value is firmly established to be \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). This is a well-known result.\n*   A proof sketch is provided: to cover \\( K_n \\), you can assign a unique binary vector of length \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) to each of the \\( n \\) vertices. For each coordinate \\( i \\), a bipartite graph is formed where the partitions are determined by the value of the \\(i\\)-th bit (0 or 1). Since any two vertices have different binary vectors, their vectors must differ in at least one position, say the \\(j\\)-th. This ensures that the edge between them is in the \\(j\\)-th bipartite graph.\n*   The lower bound, showing that fewer than \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) graphs is not possible, is also a standard proof. If you have \\( k \\) bipartite graphs, you can assign a binary vector of length \\( k \\) to each vertex, indicating which partition it belongs to in each graph. If \\( n > 2^k \\), by the pigeonhole principle, at least two vertices must have the same binary vector, meaning the edge between them is not covered.\n*   The phrase \"Graham-Pollak Theorem\" refers to the related, but different, problem of *partitioning* the edges of \\( K_n \\) into the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs, which is \\( n-1 \\). My problem is about *covering*, not partitioning.\n\nThe user's phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is unusual. My initial thought that it might refer to the sum of the number of vertices in each graph, \\( \\sum |V(G_i)| \\), is an interesting problem variation. One search result refers to this as the \"capacity\" of the covering. For \\(K_n\\), the capacity is at least \\(n \\log_2 n\\). However, the original question is very specific and short. Without further clarification, interpreting it as a standard, well-known problem is the most reasonable approach. The unusual phrasing is likely a slight awkwardness in the problem statement, and it is intended to ask for the number of bipartite graphs in the family. Other interpretations like \"vertex covering number\" refer to a different concept where a set of vertices must touch all edges.\n\nTherefore, the most likely interpretation is that the question asks for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required for the covering.\n\nFor \\( n = 35 \\):\nWe need to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\nWe know that \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\).\nSince \\( 32 < 35 \\le 64 \\), we have \\( 5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6 \\).\nTherefore, \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of vertices, which could be a misstatement for the minimum number of graphs. Given the context of the problem, this is the most logical interpretation.\n\nFinal check: The question is clear and the mathematical result is well-established. The calculation for n=35 is straightforward.\n\nFinal answer should be 6.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering \\(K_{35}\\). As reasoned above, this is most plausibly a slightly confusingly phrased question for the size of the family of bipartite graphs, i.e., the number of bipartite graphs.\n\nLet's quickly re-evaluate the \"sum of vertices\" interpretation.\nThe capacity is at least \\( n \\log_2 n \\). For \\( n=35 \\), this is \\( 35 \\log_2 35 \\approx 35 \\times 5.129 = 179.5 \\).\nThe standard construction gives a sum of \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\).\nThe problem I analyzed earlier for \\(n=3\\) gave a sum of 5, while \\( n \\log_2 n = 3 \\log_2 3 \\approx 4.75 \\). The standard construction would give \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\). So it's possible to do better than \\(n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\). However, the question asks for \"the minimum number of vertices in a family\", which does not sound like a sum. It sounds like a single number. The most natural single number to associate with the family is its size.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the interpretation that the question asks for the number of graphs in the family.\n\nThe question is \"What is the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) where n = 35?\". This is still nagging me. What if the graphs \\(B_i\\) are not subgraphs of \\(K_n\\)? No, that's not standard. What if the family is just one graph? A single graph covering \\(K_{35}\\) would be \\(K_{35}\\) itself, which is not bipartite. What if the family is a single bipartite graph whose vertices are not the vertices of \\(K_{35}\\)? This seems far-fetched.\n\nThe problem is almost certainly asking for the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover \\(K_n\\). The word \"vertices\" might be a mistake. If I have to give one number, it should be the number of graphs.\n\nFinal conclusion remains that the question is asking for \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\n\nFinal answer is 6.\n\nI will formulate the answer based on this conclusion. I will state the assumption about the interpretation of the question.\n\nFinal check of the prompt: \"directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>>\". This means I should not add explanations in the final output block. The thoughts here are my \"scratchpad\". My final response will be direct.\n\nI am confident in the result \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) and the calculation for n=35. The only ambiguity is the phrasing, which I have resolved to the most reasonable interpretation.\n\nSo, the final answer is 6.\nI'll write the response now.\nThe core of the problem lies in determining the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edge sets, when united, contain all the edges of the complete graph \\(K_{35}\\). This is a known problem in extremal graph theory.\nLet \\(k\\) be the number of bipartite graphs. A covering of \\(K_n\\) by \\(k\\) bipartite graphs can be constructed by assigning a unique binary vector of length \\(k\\) to each of the \\(n\\) vertices. For this to be possible, the number of available unique vectors, \\(2^k\\), must be at least \\(n\\). This leads to the inequality \\(2^k \\ge n\\), which implies \\(k \\ge \\log_2 n\\). Since \\(k\\) must be an integer, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required is \\(k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\nFor the specific case of \\(n=35\\):\nWe need to calculate \\(\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil\\).\nWe have \\(2^5 = 32\\) and \\(2^6 = 64\\).\nSince \\(32 < 35 \\le 64\\), the logarithm to the base 2 of 35 is between 5 and 6.\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\(k\\) that satisfies the condition is 6.\nThe phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is interpreted as the minimum number of graphs in the family, as this corresponds to a standard and well-defined graph-theoretic problem. Other interpretations are less likely and do not lead to a single integer answer in a straightforward manner.\n\nFinal answer is 6.\nI will now provide the final answer as requested.\n\nFinal check of the prompt: \"Once you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response\".\n\nI'm ready. The core logic is sound and backed by multiple sources. The calculation is trivial. The interpretation of the question is the only tricky part, and I have settled on the most plausible one.\n\nFinal Answer should be just the number.\n<<<6>>>The problem is to determine the minimum size of a family of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph on 35 vertices, \\( K_{35} \\). This is a classic problem in graph theory.\n\nLet the number of vertices be \\( n = 35 \\), and let the family of bipartite graphs be \\( B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k \\). The condition is that the union of the edge sets of these bipartite graphs is equal to the edge set of \\( K_{35} \\). The problem asks for the minimum possible value of \\( k \\).\n\nThis value is known as the biclique cover number of \\( K_n \\), and it is well-established that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover all the edges of \\( K_n \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nThe reasoning for this result is as follows:\nLet the \\( n \\) vertices of the complete graph be \\( v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n \\). To cover all edges with \\( k \\) bipartite graphs, we can assign a unique binary vector (a sequence of 0s and 1s) of length \\( k \\) to each vertex. For each of the \\( k \\) positions in the binary vectors, we can define a bipartite graph. In the \\( i \\)-th bipartite graph, the vertices are partitioned into two sets: those with a 0 in the \\( i \\)-th position of their binary vector and those with a 1.\n\nAn edge exists between two vertices in a bipartite graph only if they are in different partitions. For any pair of distinct vertices, say \\( v_a \\) and \\( v_b \\), their assigned binary vectors must be different. This means their vectors must differ in at least one position, say the \\( j \\)-th position. Consequently, in the \\( j \\)-th bipartite graph, \\( v_a \\) and \\( v_b \\) will be in different partitions, and the edge \\( (v_a, v_b) \\) will be included. Since this is true for any pair of vertices, all edges of \\( K_n \\) are covered.\n\nFor this scheme to work, we need to be able to assign a unique binary vector of length \\( k \\) to each of the \\( n \\) vertices. The total number of distinct binary vectors of length \\( k \\) is \\( 2^k \\). Therefore, we must have \\( 2^k \\ge n \\). Taking the logarithm of both sides gives \\( k \\ge \\log_2 n \\). Since \\( k \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( k \\) is \\( \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 35 \\):\nWe need to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\).\nWe know that \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\).\nSince \\( 32 < 35 \\le 64 \\), it follows that \\( 5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6 \\).\nThe ceiling of this value is 6.\n\nThus, the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 6. The phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is interpreted as the size of the family (the number of graphs), which is the standard interpretation of this problem.\n\n<<<6>>>"
