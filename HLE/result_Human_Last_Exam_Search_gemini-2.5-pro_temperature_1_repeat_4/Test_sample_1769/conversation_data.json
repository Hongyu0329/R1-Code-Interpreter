    "Without the influence of the Norse (Old Norse), the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **\"suster\"**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word:** The native Old English word for a female sibling was `sweostor`. This word, along with terms like `fæder` (father), `mōdor` (mother), and `brōþor` (brother), formed the core of Old English kinship terms.\n\n*   **Norse Influence:** The Old Norse word for sister was `systir`. During the Viking Age, extensive contact, settlement, and intermarriage between the Anglo-Saxons and Norse peoples led to a blending of the two languages. In this linguistic melting pot, the Old Norse `systir` eventually replaced the Old English `sweostor` in the mainstream language, giving us the modern word \"sister\". The change is notable for the \"i\" vowel sound, which comes directly from the Norse.\n\n*   **Natural Evolution:** Had the Norse influence never occurred, `sweostor` would have followed a natural path of linguistic evolution. The form `suster` appeared in Middle English and survived in various dialects for centuries. This shows the likely trajectory of the word's development without external replacement.\n\nTherefore, if the Anglo-Saxons' language had evolved without the significant impact of the Norse invaders, the word descended from `sweostor` would almost certainly have become \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
