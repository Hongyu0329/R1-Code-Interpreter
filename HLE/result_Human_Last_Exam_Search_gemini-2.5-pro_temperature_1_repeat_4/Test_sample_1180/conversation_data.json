    "The problem asks for the thickness of the double point in the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic integers, with the valuation $v$ normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Curve and its Roots\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $z^2=f(x)$ is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. We can analyze these valuations using the Newton polygon of the polynomial. The vertices of the Newton polygon are the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The corresponding points are $(5, v(2))=(5,1)$, $(3, v(2))=(3,1)$, and $(0, v(1))=(0,0)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n1.  A segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$. The slope is $(1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is 3. This indicates that there are 3 roots with 2-adic valuation $1/3$.\n2.  A segment from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$. The slope is $(1-1)/(5-3) = 0$. The length of its projection on the x-axis is 2. This indicates there are 2 roots with 2-adic valuation 0.\n\nThus, the roots of $f(x)$ are partitioned into two clusters based on their valuations:\n*   $S_1 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\}$ with $v(\\alpha_i) = 0$.\n*   $S_2 = \\{\\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5\\}$ with $v(\\alpha_j) = 1/3$.\n\n### 2. Structure of the Stable Reduction\nThe structure of the special fiber of the minimal regular model of the curve is determined by this clustering of roots. For a hyperelliptic curve, the special fiber consists of a central component, $\\Gamma_0$ (which is a copy of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$), and several \"leg\" components corresponding to the clusters of roots.\n\nIn this case, we have two clusters of roots, which give rise to two components, $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$, attached to the central component $\\Gamma_0$. The dual graph of the special fiber of the minimal regular model is a chain: $\\Gamma_1 - \\Gamma_0 - \\Gamma_2$. This model has two singular points (nodes), which are the intersection points $P_1 = \\Gamma_1 \\cap \\Gamma_0$ and $P_2 = \\Gamma_2 \\cap \\Gamma_0$.\n\n### 3. Thickness of the Double Points\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction is the arithmetic intersection number of the components meeting at that point in the minimal regular model. For a component $\\Gamma_S$ corresponding to a cluster of roots $S$, its intersection number with the central component $\\Gamma_0$ is equal to the number of roots in the cluster, i.e., $(\\Gamma_0 \\cdot \\Gamma_S) = |S|$.\n\nApplying this to our clusters:\n*   The thickness of the double point $P_1 = \\Gamma_1 \\cap \\Gamma_0$ is $(\\Gamma_0 \\cdot \\Gamma_1) = |S_1| = 2$.\n*   The thickness of the double point $P_2 = \\Gamma_2 \\cap \\Gamma_0$ is $(\\Gamma_0 \\cdot \\Gamma_2) = |S_2| = 3$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the\" thickness of \"the\" double point. This phrasing suggests a single value. In the context of stable reduction models, when multiple singularities arise, the one associated with the most significant ramification or the largest component cluster is often considered the principal one. In this case, the cluster $S_2$ is larger (size 3 vs. 2) and corresponds to roots in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ (since their valuation is fractional). This points to the thickness associated with $S_2$ as the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, the thickness of the principal double point is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
