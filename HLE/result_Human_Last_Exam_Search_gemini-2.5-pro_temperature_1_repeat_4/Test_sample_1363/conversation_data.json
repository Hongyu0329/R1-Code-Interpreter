    "The fundamental difference between the European Tango and the other four standard ballroom dances lies in its core technique. The Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all swing dances that utilize principles like continuous body movement (CBM), sway, and rise and fall to create a flowing, rotational character. In these dances, overturning a reverse turn (turning more than the prescribed amount) is possible as an element of advanced choreography or styling because the underlying technique supports continuous rotation.\n\nIn contrast, the European Tango is characterized by a staccato action, a \"no-rise-and-fall\" flat look, and the absence of swing. Crucially, the technique for a Tango reverse turn is fundamentally different. It is executed without the continuous, swinging CBM that defines the other dances. Instead of a fluid rotation, the Tango turn is a series of sharp, deliberate steps and pivots.\n\nAttempting to overturn a Tango reverse turn would require introducing a swinging, rotational momentum and CBM, which directly violates the core identity and technique of the dance. Doing so would essentially transform the figure into a \"Waltz-like\" or \"Foxtrot-like\" action, meaning it would no longer be a Tango turn from a technical standpoint. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn in the European Tango without disregarding its fundamental technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
