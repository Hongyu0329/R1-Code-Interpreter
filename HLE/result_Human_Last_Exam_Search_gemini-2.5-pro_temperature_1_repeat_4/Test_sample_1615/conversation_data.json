    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nA complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The chromatic number of a complete graph $K_n$ is $n$, as every vertex must be assigned a unique color. If a graph on $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$, it must be the complete graph $K_n$. Since the graph $G$ in question is not the complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than 12345.\n\nFor any graph $G$ that is not complete, there must exist at least one pair of vertices that are not adjacent. This means the independence number of $G$, $\\alpha(G)$, which is the size of the largest set of non-adjacent vertices, is at least 2. There is a general inequality relating the chromatic number and the independence number of a graph on $n$ vertices: $\\chi(G) \\le n - \\alpha(G) + 1$.\n\nGiven that $\\alpha(G) \\ge 2$ for any non-complete graph, we can establish an upper bound for its chromatic number:\n$\\chi(G) \\le n - 2 + 1 = n-1$.\nFor $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis establishes that the chromatic number of any such graph cannot exceed 12344. To determine if this maximum is achievable, we can consider a specific graph: the complete graph $K_{12345}$ with a single edge removed, let's call it $G^* = K_{12345} - e$.\nThis graph is not a complete graph and has 12345 vertices.\n\nWe can determine the chromatic number of $G^*$.\n1.  **Lower Bound**: The chromatic number of a graph is always greater than or equal to its clique number (the size of the largest complete subgraph). In $G^*$, if we take one of the endpoints of the removed edge, say $u$, and all other $n-2$ vertices, they form a clique of size $n-1 = 12344$. Therefore, $\\chi(G^*) \\ge 12344$.\n2.  **Upper Bound**: We can explicitly color $G^*$ with $n-1$ colors. Let the removed edge be $(u,v)$. We can assign a unique color to each of the other $n-2$ vertices. Then, since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same new color. This results in a proper coloring using $(n-2) + 1 = n-1 = 12344$ colors. Thus, $\\chi(G^*) \\le 12344$.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we find that the chromatic number of $G^*$ is exactly 12344. Since we have found a graph that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344, and we have shown that no such graph can have a higher chromatic number, the maximum possible number of colors is 12344.\n\nThis result can also be understood through Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$, where $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of the graph. For the graph $K_{12345} - e$, the maximum degree is $12344$. As this graph is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, Brooks' Theorem implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$, which is consistent with our finding.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
