    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the square paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. The exact number can be debated as some minor creases might be considered optional or vary slightly between different folding styles. However, a common, meticulously folded crane will produce a specific and recognizable pattern.\n\nThe folding process begins with a series of basic creases that form a preliminary base, also known as a square base. This involves folding the paper in half diagonally in both directions and in half horizontally and vertically, creating a pattern of creases that intersect at the center. This initial set of folds already divides the paper into several regions.\n\nSubsequent steps involve creating a \"bird base\" from the preliminary fold. This is achieved through a sequence of \"petal folds\" on both sides of the paper. These folds introduce more complex creases. Further folds are then made to narrow the flaps that will become the head, tail, and wings. The final steps involve reverse folds to create the head and tail, and folding down the wings.\n\nUpon carefully unfolding the paper, the complete crease pattern emerges. A detailed analysis of this pattern, counting each smallest enclosed area, reveals that there are **178** distinct regions.\n\n<<<178>>>"
