In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product \((\phi, D_\phi)\) in the functional integral representation of the partition function represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by:
\[ (\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) (-\partial_\tau^2 - \nabla^2 + m^2) \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) \]
Here, \(\phi(\tau, \vec{x})\) is the real scalar field, \(\tau\) is the imaginary time coordinate that is periodic with period \(\beta = 1/T\), \(\nabla^2\) is the spatial Laplacian, and \(m\) is the mass of the field. The operator \(D_\phi\) is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space, \(D_\phi = -\partial_E^2 + m^2\). The inner product is taken over the space of real scalar fields periodic in imaginary time.
