    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function for a neutral scalar field \\(\\phi\\) is expressed using the functional integral formalism. This approach involves a \"Wick rotation\" to Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate is made imaginary (\\(t \\to -i\\tau\\)), and the fields are periodic in this imaginary time with a period equal to the inverse temperature, \\(\\beta = 1/T\\).\n\nThe partition function \\(Z\\) is given by the functional integral over all field configurations that satisfy this periodicity:\n\\[\nZ = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}\n\\]\nHere, \\(S_E[\\phi]\\) is the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass \\(m\\), the Euclidean action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over Euclidean spacetime (\\(\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^1\\), where \\(S^1\\) is the circle of circumference \\(\\beta\\)):\n\\[\nS_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\phi, \\partial_\\mu \\phi)\n\\]\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2\n\\]\nThis can be rewritten using the Euclidean four-vector notation \\(x_E = (\\tau, \\vec{x})\\) and \\(\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2\\):\n\\[\nS_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\left[ (\\partial_{E,\\mu} \\phi)(\\partial_{E,\\mu} \\phi) + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]\n\\]\nThrough integration by parts, and assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity, the action can be expressed in a quadratic form. This quadratic form is interpreted as the inner product \\((\\phi, D_\\phi)\\).\n\nThe inner product of two fields, \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\phi_2\\), in this context is defined as:\n\\[\n(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi_1(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\phi_2(\\tau, \\vec{x})\n\\]\nWith this definition, the Euclidean action can be written as:\n\\[\nS_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi)\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_\\phi\\) is a differential operator. By performing an integration by parts on the kinetic term of the action, we can identify \\(D_\\phi\\) as:\n\\[\nD_\\phi = -\\partial_{E}^2 + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2\n\\]\nThe functions \\(\\phi\\) on which this operator acts are real-valued scalar fields that are periodic in the imaginary time coordinate \\(\\tau\\) with period \\(\\beta\\).\n\nTherefore, the inner product \\((\\phi, D_\\phi)\\) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature is:\n\\[\n(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})\n\\]\nThis quadratic form is central to the calculations in finite-temperature field theory. Due to the periodicity in the \\(\\tau\\) direction, the field \\(\\phi\\) can be expanded in a Fourier series, which leads to the discrete Matsubara frequencies \\(\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T\\) for bosons, where \\(n\\) is an integer. In terms of these frequencies, the operator \\(D_\\phi\\) in momentum space becomes \\(\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2\\), where \\(\\vec{p}\\) is the spatial momentum.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product \\((\\phi, D_\\phi)\\) in the functional integral representation of the partition function represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by:\n\\[ (\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\]\nHere, \\(\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})\\) is the real scalar field, \\(\\tau\\) is the imaginary time coordinate that is periodic with period \\(\\beta = 1/T\\), \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the spatial Laplacian, and \\(m\\) is the mass of the field. The operator \\(D_\\phi\\) is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space, \\(D_\\phi = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2\\). The inner product is taken over the space of real scalar fields periodic in imaginary time.>>>"
