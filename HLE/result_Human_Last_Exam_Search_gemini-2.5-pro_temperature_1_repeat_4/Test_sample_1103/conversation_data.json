    "There are 206 negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48. This result is based on the comprehensive work by M. Watkins, who in 2004 provided a complete classification of all imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its general form, seeks to classify all imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number. Watkins's paper, \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" is a pivotal resource that resolves this problem for class numbers N â‰¤ 100. His work involved extensive computations and theoretical insights to determine the exact number of fundamental discriminants for each class number in this range.\n\nFor the specific case of class number 48, Watkins's exhaustive search identified 206 such fundamental discriminants.\n\n<<<206>>>"
