    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive data compiled on the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht, which is a widely recognized resource for the best-known solutions to this packing problem. The table on this website provides data for a large number of circles, and for N=1135, the listed symmetry group is C_1. The C_1 symmetry group, in Schoenflies notation, indicates that the arrangement has no rotational or reflectional symmetry, which is common for optimal packings of a large and irregular number of circles.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
