    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is a crucial element in perturbative calculations, correcting for the overcounting of diagram configurations that are topologically identical. For a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators), the symmetry factor depends on the specific arrangement of these components.\n\nThe most common topology fitting this description is a vacuum diagram where two vertices are connected by four distinct propagators, sometimes referred to as a \"sunset diagram with four rungs\". The symmetry factor for this diagram is determined by the number of permutations of its components that leave the diagram's structure unchanged.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n*   **Permutation of propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in any way without changing the diagram. The number of permutations is 4! (4 factorial), which equals 24.\n*   **Permutation of vertices:** The two vertices are also indistinguishable in a vacuum diagram. Swapping them results in the same diagram. This contributes a factor of 2! (2 factorial), which is 2.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry factor (S) is:\nS = (Number of propagator permutations) × (Number of vertex permutations)\nS = 4! × 2! = 24 × 2 = 48\n\nIt is important to note that other, less common, diagram topologies can be constructed with two vertices and four propagators (for example, a \"dumbbell\" shape with two propagators connecting the vertices and one self-loop on each vertex). These different topologies would have different symmetry factors. However, the sunset-type vacuum diagram is the most direct and standard interpretation of the stated components.\n\n<<<48>>>"
