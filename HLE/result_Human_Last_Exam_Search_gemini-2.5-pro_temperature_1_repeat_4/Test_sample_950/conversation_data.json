    "The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The question asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nAn abelian group's rank is the dimension of the vector space that results from tensoring it with the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. A torsion group is a group where every element has a finite order. For any finite (or more generally, torsion) abelian group $T$, the tensor product $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. Consequently, the dimension of this vector space is 0.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of the integral cohomology groups at each degree: $T = \\bigoplus_i \\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$. It is a known result that the torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is exclusively 2-torsion, meaning every torsion element has an order that is a power of 2. Therefore, the torsion subgroup is a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of order $2^k$ for various $k \\geq 1$. As a direct sum of finite groups, the total torsion subgroup is itself a torsion group.\n\nWhen we compute the rank of this torsion subgroup $T$, we find:\nRank$(T) = \\dim(T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\nWhile the rank is strictly 0, it is worth noting the structure of the integral cohomology groups of $G(3, 5)$, which is homeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. The integral cohomology groups are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^2(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n*   $H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts listed above: $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^5$. This is a finite group, and as explained, its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
