    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups have been fully classified. A subset S of a group G is called product-free if for any elements a, b, c in S (not necessarily distinct), the equation ab=c has no solution. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing a maximal product-free set of size 2, denoted as S, is detailed in the work of Giudici and Hart. The classification is broken down based on whether the set S generates the group G.\n\nWhen the maximal product-free set S = {a, b} generates the group G (i.e., ⟨S⟩ = G), the possible groups are:\n*   **Cyclic groups:** If S contains no involutions, G must be a cyclic group C_n, where n is the order of element *a*, and *b* is a power of *a*, under specific conditions outlined in Table 1 of the paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". The conditions on n are: n can be 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 28, 30.\n*   **C₂ × C₂:** The Klein four-group, where S is any pair of non-identity elements.\n*   **C₆:** The cyclic group of order 6, where S consists of the unique involution and an element of order 3.\n*   **D₆ (or S₃):** The dihedral group of order 6, where S consists of any involution and any element of order 3.\n\nWhen the maximal product-free set S = {a, b} does not generate the group G (i.e., ⟨S⟩ is a proper subgroup of G), the possibilities are:\n*   The group G has a normal subgroup N such that G/N is isomorphic to C₂, and S is the coset of N not containing the identity. This is a general construction that yields infinitely many examples.\n*   The group G has a normal subgroup N such that G/N is isomorphic to C₄, and S is a specific coset.\n*   The group G is isomorphic to the dihedral group D₁₀.\n\nAdditionally, two specific groups are identified:\n*   **C₈:** The cyclic group of order 8, with the set S = {x², x⁶}.\n*   **Q₁₂:** The dicyclic group of order 12, with a specific maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\nThe classification provided by Giudici and Hart demonstrates that there is a rich and infinite variety of finite groups that contain these specific small structures.\n\n<<<There are infinitely many finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2. These groups have been completely classified and include specific cyclic groups, the Klein four-group, C₆, D₆, C₈, Q₁₂, and infinite families of groups constructed from normal subgroups.>>>"
