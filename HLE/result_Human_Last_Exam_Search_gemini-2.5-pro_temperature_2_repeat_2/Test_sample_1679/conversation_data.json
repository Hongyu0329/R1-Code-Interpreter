    "**\"Gigi\" (1958) is the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict the Luxor Obelisk on-screen.**\n\nThe musical, filmed extensively on location in Paris, features scenes shot in the Place de la Concorde, where the ancient Egyptian obelisk is a prominent landmark. A notable sequence shows the character Gaston Lachaille wandering through Paris at night, and includes shots of the famous square and its iconic monument. Another description of the film's cinematography explicitly mentions a \"wide boulevard leading to the Place de la Concorde, the Madeleine and Obelisk prominent in the centre of the screen\".\n\nWhile the earlier Best Picture winner, \"An American in Paris\" (1951), is also famously set in the French capital, its sequences depicting the Place de la Concorde were filmed on stylized studio sets with models and not on location. Research into other Best Picture winners that predate \"Gigi\" did not yield any evidence of on-location filming in the Place de la Concorde featuring the Luxor Obelisk. Earlier films set in Paris, such as \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), were primarily filmed on studio backlots. Therefore, \"Gigi\" stands as the first to showcase the actual monument.\n\n<<<Gigi (1958)>>>"
