No, based on the specified constraints, an asymmetry cannot be induced. The core reason is the explicit condition that "the decay rates into neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same," which artificially removes the known effect of CP violation in neutral kaon decaysâ€”the very mechanism that could otherwise generate such an asymmetry.
