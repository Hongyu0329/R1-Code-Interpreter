    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles are effective catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), but the ideal nickel-to-cerium ratio to maximize catalytic performance differs between the two applications.\n\nFor the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, which is crucial for producing high-purity hydrogen, research indicates that the optimal Ni content can vary. Studies have shown high CO conversion activity for Ni/CeO₂ catalysts with nickel content in the range of 5 to 12.5 wt%. Specifically, catalysts with 10 and 12.5 wt% Ni demonstrated nearly identical and high CO conversion rates. Another study focusing on the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction on lanthanum-doped ceria found an optimum nickel proportion of around 7% molar. Furthermore, a catalyst with 5% Ni on ceria was reported to achieve 84% CO conversion at 350°C. The synergistic interaction between highly dispersed NiO and CeO₂, along with the presence of oxygen vacancies, is credited for the high catalytic activity.\n\nIn the case of water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key step in the process, a different range of Ni/Ce ratios has been found to be optimal. Experimental studies have identified that Ni-Ceria catalysts with Ni to Ce molar ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ) exhibit superior OER activity. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, has demonstrated excellent long-term stability. The enhanced performance is attributed to the larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in these specific compositions. Computational studies support the efficacy of a higher Ni content, suggesting that a 3Ni/1Ce ratio leads to more favorable adsorption energies and consequently, better catalytic properties for the water-splitting reaction. For overall water splitting (both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution), Ni and Fe co-doped ceria with a high dopant concentration of 20 mol% has shown excellent performance.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is dependent on the target reaction. For the WGS reaction, a lower nickel content of around 5-12.5 wt% (or ~7% molar) appears to be highly effective. For water splitting, a significantly higher nickel content, with Ni to Ce molar ratios of 1:1 and even 3:1, is ideal for maximizing performance. The different requirements for each reaction, such as the nature of the active sites and the role of oxygen vacancies, dictate the optimal composition of the Ni-Ceria catalyst.\n\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the ideal Ni content is in the range of 5-12.5 wt%, while for water splitting, a higher Ni/Ce molar ratio, particularly 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ), is more effective.>>>"
