**Mean Energy (U/V):**
\[ u = \frac{U}{V} = \frac{8\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3}T^4 \]
This is the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The mean energy density is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.

**Entropy (S/V):**
\[ s = \frac{S}{V} = \frac{32\pi^5 k_B^4}{45h^3c^3}T^3 \]
The entropy density is proportional to the third power of the absolute temperature.

**Equilibrium Distribution (Bose-Einstein for photons):**
\[ \langle n(\nu) \rangle = \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_B T} - 1} \]
This distribution underpins the derivation of the mean energy and entropy.
