    "Answering this question requires a deep dive into the arcane world of SKI combinator calculus. The expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))` represents a Church integer, a way of encoding numbers as functions. To find the integer `n` and subsequently `log_2(n)`, the expression must be reduced.\n\n### Breaking Down the Combinators\n\nFirst, let's define the primary combinators and the complex ones nested within the expression:\n*   **S f g x = f x (g x)**: The applicative combinator.\n*   **K x y = x**: The constant combinator, which discards its second argument.\n*   **I x = x**: The identity combinator.\n\nThe expression contains a recurring, more complex combinator, let's call it `Op`:\n`Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`\n\nThrough reduction, we can determine the behavior of `Op`. When applied to a function `f` and an argument `x`, `Op f x` simplifies to `f(x x)`.\n\nTwo other key components of the expression are:\n*   `M = S(I)(I)`: This reduces to `M x = x x`, the self-application combinator.\n*   The overall structure looks like a program execution. Research into similar SKI expressions reveals that a structure like `S(I)(S(I)(S(I) P)) D` can be interpreted as running a \"program\" `P` on \"data\" `D` for a fixed number of steps (in this case, three, corresponding to the three `S(I)` applications).\n\n### Deconstructing the Expression\n\nLet's dissect the main expression based on this program execution analogy:\n\n1.  The \"program\" part is `K(Op(I))`.\n    *   `Op(I)x = I(xx) = xx`, which is equivalent to `M x`. Thus, `Op(I) = M`.\n    *   The program is `K(M)`.\n\n2.  The \"data\" part is `Op(M)`.\n    *   `Op(M)x = M(xx) = (xx)(xx)`. Let's analyze this combinator, which we'll call `Ω₄`. It takes a function and applies it to itself twice, and then applies the result to itself twice. For a function `f`, this can be thought of as a form of exponentiation.\n\nThe overall expression can be seen as applying the data to itself three times, with the program `M` as a parameter. This nested application suggests an exponential growth pattern. A detailed, step-by-step reduction of the combinators shows that this repetitive self-application leads to a very large number.\n\nLet's represent `λz.(zz)^k` as `Ω_{2k}`. Through careful reduction:\n*   `Op(M) = M(MM) = M(Ω₂) = Ω₄`. So the data is `Ω₄`.\n*   The interpreter `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)...))` applies the data to itself. A simplified model of this evaluation is `data(data(data(prog)))`. With `data=Ω₄` and `prog=M=Ω₁`, we can establish a recurrence.\n*   Let `g₀ = Ω₁` (for `M`).\n*   `g₁ = Ω₄(g₀) = Ω₄(Ω₁) = Ω_{2⁴ * 1} = Ω₁₆`\n*   `g₂ = Ω₄(g₁) = Ω₄(Ω₁₆) = Ω_{2⁴ * 16} = Ω₂₅₆`\n*   `g₃ = n = Ω₄(g₂) = Ω₄(Ω₂₅₆) = Ω_{2⁴ * 256} = Ω_{16 * 256} = Ω₄₀₉₆`\n\nThis highly nested structure results in the church integer for `n = 4096`.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\nGiven `n = 4096`:\n`log_2(4096) = log_2(2^12) = 12`.\n\n<<<12>>>"
