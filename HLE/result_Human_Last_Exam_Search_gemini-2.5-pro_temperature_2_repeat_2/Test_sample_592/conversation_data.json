    "In the 1997 film *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg), the character Tommaso, portrayed by Marco Cocci, relocates to the United States to further his education. However, the movie does not specify which particular US city he moves to.\n\nPlot summaries of the film consistently state that Tommaso's wealthy family sends him to study in \"America\" or \"the United States\" after he finishes high school in Livorno, Italy. This move marks a significant turning point in the protagonist Piero's life, as he and his friend Tommaso go their separate ways. Despite the move being a key plot point, no available synopsis, cast list, or review of the movie names the specific American city.\n\n<<<The specific US city is not mentioned in the movie.>>>"
