    "The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 10.\n\nThis result is determined by identifying the given map with the single suspension of a well-studied map in homotopy theory and then applying a known theorem about the connectivity of the latter.\n\n1.  **The Map and its Adjoint**: Let the given map be denoted by $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This map is the (first) adjoint to the double evaluation map, also known as a smash-product pairing, given by:\n    $g: \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n    Since the smash product of spheres $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to the 10-sphere $S^{10}$, the codomain of $g$ is $S^{10}$. The connectivity of a map and its adjoint are identical. Therefore, the connectivity of $f$ is the same as that of $g$.\n\n2.  **Connectivity of the Double Evaluation Map**: A significant result in homotopy theory, stemming from the work of BÃ¶digheimer, Madsen, and others, provides the connectivity of the map $g$. For spheres, the map $\\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to S^{m+n}$ is $(m+n)$-connected. In this case, $m=4$ and $n=6$. Thus, the map $g$ is $(4+6) = 10$-connected.\n\n3.  **Definition of Connectivity**: A map is said to be $k$-connected if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (a surjective homomorphism) on $\\pi_k$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since the map $g$ is 10-connected, its adjoint, the map $f$ in the question, is also 10-connected. This means that the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups up to degree 9 and a surjection in degree 10.\n\nThis can be verified by analyzing the lowest-degree homotopy groups of the domain and codomain. Both the domain, $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$, and the codomain, $\\Omega(S^{10})$, are 8-connected. Their first non-trivial homotopy group occurs at degree 9, where both $\\pi_9(\\text{Domain})$ and $\\pi_9(\\text{Codomain})$ are isomorphic to the integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. The 10-connectivity of the map implies that the induced homomorphism between these groups is an isomorphism.\n\n<<<10>>>"
