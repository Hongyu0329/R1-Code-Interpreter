Based on the body of evidence about the role of interleukin-15 in supporting T cell function, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to have a more robust and sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting T cell proliferation, survival, effector function, and the development of a memory phenotype, which collectively lead to a more potent and persistent anti-tumor response that is mediated by these cytokines.
