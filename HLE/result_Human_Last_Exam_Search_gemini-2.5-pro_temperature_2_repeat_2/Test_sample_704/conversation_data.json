    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue—which is green—and blue itself corresponds to the musical note G.\n\nNewton created a color wheel in 1704 where he linked the visible spectrum of colors to a musical scale. The color green is produced by mixing yellow and blue. In his system, Newton associated the colors of the rainbow with the notes of the Dorian musical mode, which begins on the note D.\n\nThe specific mapping of colors to musical notes in Newton's circle is as follows:\n*   Red corresponds to the note D.\n*   Orange corresponds to the note E.\n*   Yellow corresponds to the note F.\n*   Green corresponds to the note G.\n*   Blue corresponds to the note A.\n*   Indigo corresponds to the note B.\n*   Violet corresponds to the note C.\n\nTherefore, the musical note that falls within the range of green and blue is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
