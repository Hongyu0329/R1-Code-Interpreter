    "While specific video footage of Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance as Kitri in *Don Quixote* is not readily available for precise analysis, it is a well-documented and celebrated interpretation of the role. Without a definitive video of the 2008 Bolshoi production's Act I variation to count the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position, providing a precise count is not possible.\n\nChoreography for classical ballets like *Don Quixote* can vary between productions and even between individual performances. The number of pirouettes a dancer executes can be influenced by the specific staging, the conductor's tempo, and the dancer's own artistic choices on the day of the performance.\n\nHowever, it is widely acknowledged that Osipova's portrayal of Kitri is characterized by her exceptional technical prowess and dynamic energy. Her performances are known for their virtuosic and often daring displays of ballet technique. Dancers in the role of Kitri typically perform a series of fouett√© turns in the ballet's final act, but the specific number of single pirouettes in the Act I variation is not a standardized element. References from 2008 confirm her performance as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet, including a guest appearance in Novosibirsk. There are numerous videos and discussions about her performances of the Kitri variation in subsequent years, highlighting her powerful and energetic style.\n\nGiven these factors, and without access to the specific 2008 performance, a definitive number cannot be provided.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a specific number without video evidence of the 2008 performance.>>>"
