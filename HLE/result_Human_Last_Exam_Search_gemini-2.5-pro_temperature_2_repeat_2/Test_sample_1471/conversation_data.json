    "To solve the equation, first, we convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **xl** is converted to 40. In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (X = 10) comes before a larger value (L = 50), it is subtracted.\n*   **cvi** is converted to 106. This is calculated by adding the values of the individual numerals (C = 100, V = 5, I = 1).\n*   **mcmxcix** is converted to 1999. This is broken down as M (1000) + CM (900) + XC (90) + IX (9).\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the equation:\n40 / 106 - 1999\n\nFinally, we calculate the result:\n40 divided by 106 is approximately 0.37735849.\nSubtracting 1999 from this gives -1998.62264151.\n\n<<<−1998.62264151>>>"
