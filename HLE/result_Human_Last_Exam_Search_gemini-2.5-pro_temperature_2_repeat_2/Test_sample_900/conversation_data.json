    "## No \"Pas de Balanchine\" in Forsythe's Deconstructed Classicism\n\nIn the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" performed by Svetlana Gileva with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, there are no specifically designated \"pas de Balanchine\" steps. The nature of both the choreographic work and the term itself makes a quantitative answer to this question not applicable.\n\nThe phrase \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized term within the ballet lexicon, but rather a colloquial descriptor for a signature movement style associated with choreographer George Balanchine. This style is often characterized by dynamic, off-balance lunges with distinctive, often asymmetrical, arm movements. Notably, the School of American Ballet, founded by Balanchine, has stated that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a term used in their training.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" created in 1987, is a seminal work of contemporary ballet that is renowned for its deconstruction of the classical form. While Forsythe drew inspiration from Balanchine's neoclassicism, his intent was to extend and even subvert classical principles, not to quote them directly. His choreographic language involves pushing the body's lines to their extremes, exploring off-balance positions, and treating the academic vocabulary as a basis for new and complex athletic movement.\n\nTherefore, while the Jete Woman solo contains highly dynamic and athletic movements, including lunges and powerful jumps, these are products of Forsythe's unique choreographic method. They are not intended to be recognizable replications of another choreographer's signature steps. Svetlana Gileva, as a principal dancer of the Semperoper Ballett, would have performed these demanding movements as part of Forsythe's distinct style. Any resemblance to a \"pas de Balanchine\" would be coincidental, stemming from a shared exploration of ballet's dynamic potential, rather than a deliberate inclusion.\n\nWithout a publicly available video of the specific 2015 performance, a visual analysis to count any such perceived steps is impossible. A YouTube video that was listed with this performance is no longer available. However, based on the stylistic analysis of Forsythe's work and the informal, non-codified nature of the term \"pas de Balanchine,\" the number of officially recognized \"pas de Balanchine\" in the solo is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
