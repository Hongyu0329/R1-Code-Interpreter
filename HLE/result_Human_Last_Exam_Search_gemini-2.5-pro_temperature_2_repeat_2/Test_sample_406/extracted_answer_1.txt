The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point depend on the mathematical space in which the functions are defined. Generally, they require the space to be a complete metric space and the functions to satisfy a form of contractive condition. In the more specialized setting of partially ordered metric spaces, additional conditions like the mixed monotone property and the existence of a suitable initial point are necessary.
