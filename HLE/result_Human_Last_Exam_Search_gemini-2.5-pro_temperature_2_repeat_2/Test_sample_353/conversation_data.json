    "### Exact Value of the A($\\alpha$) Stability Angle for BDF4\n\nThe $A(\\alpha)$-stability of a numerical method is a crucial concept for solving stiff ordinary differential equations. A method is said to be $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its region of absolute stability contains the infinite wedge $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$, where $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$. For the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4), the angle $\\alpha$ is approximately $73.35^\\circ$.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region for a k-step BDF method is described by the root locus curve, which is given by the expression:\n$w(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j} (1 - z^{-1})^j$\nwhere $z = e^{i\\phi}$ lies on the unit circle.\n\nTo find the angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4, we need to find the tangent line to this curve from the origin in the complex plane. This involves finding the maximum of the angle formed by the points on the stability boundary with the negative real axis. A detailed analysis, as presented in the work of Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and simplified by Gander and Wanner, provides an exact expression for the tangent of this angle.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the stability polynomial is a polynomial of degree 4. The process to find the exact angle involves parametrizing the unit circle and finding the maximum of the ratio of the imaginary part to the negative real part of the root locus curve.\n\nThrough this analysis, the exact value of the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ for BDF4 has been found to be:\n$\\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\nFrom this, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ in radians is:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\n\nThis value corresponds to the angle of the sector in the left half-plane for which the BDF4 method is stable.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$>>>"
