It is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. The fundamental reason for this is that the mathematical and logical frameworks of the two concepts are entirely distinct and address different domains of reality. Quantum mechanics uses the language of functional analysis, Hilbert spaces, and probability theory to describe the behavior of physical systems. Gödel's ontological proof, on the other hand, is a work of modal logic that deals with abstract concepts of necessity, possibility, and properties. There is no established method for translating the metaphysical axioms and definitions of Gödel's proof into the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. While there are philosophical discussions connecting Gödel's work, particularly his incompleteness theorems, to the limits of physical theories, these do not constitute a proof of his ontological argument within the framework of quantum mechanics.
