In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a single numerical value but is defined by the Berezin integration rules. For a single Grassmann variable θ, these rules are:

*   ∫ dθ = 0
*   ∫ dθ θ = 1

These rules, in conjunction with the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables which ensures that the square of any such variable is zero (θ² = 0), enforce the Pauli exclusion principle.
