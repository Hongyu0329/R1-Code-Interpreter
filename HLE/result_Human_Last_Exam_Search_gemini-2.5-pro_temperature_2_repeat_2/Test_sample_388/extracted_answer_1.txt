Based on Allison's symptoms and medications, the pharmacist should recommend that she contact her prescribing physician to report the new onset of headache and olfactory hallucinations (smelling sea water). These may be side effects of her Fluoxetine. The pharmacist should also advise her to be cautious about using Excedrin due to a potential interaction between its aspirin component and Fluoxetine, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
