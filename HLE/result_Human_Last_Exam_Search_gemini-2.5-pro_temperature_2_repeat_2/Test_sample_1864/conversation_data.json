    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of **12 essential control samples** in addition to your fully stained experimental sample.\n\nThese controls are critical for accurate instrument setup, compensation of spectral overlap, and precise gating to identify your target cell population. The controls fall into three main categories:\n\n### 1. **Fundamental Setup and Viability Controls (2 tubes)**\nThese controls establish a baseline for your experiment and allow for the exclusion of dead cells, which can cause inaccurate results.\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 tube):** This sample contains only cells and is used to assess autofluorescence and to set the initial voltage settings for the forward and side scatter detectors (FSC/SSC).\n*   **Viability Dye Control (1 tube):** For cell sorting, it's crucial to distinguish live cells from dead ones. Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies and have higher autofluorescence. This sample contains cells stained only with a viability dye. It is also used as a single-color control for compensation.\n\n### 2. **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 tubes)**\nIn any multicolor experiment, the light from one fluorophore can spill into another detector, which must be corrected through a process called compensation. You need a single-stained control for each fluorophore in your panel.\n*   **AF350 Single Stain (1 tube)**\n*   **GFP Single Stain (1 tube):** This typically consists of cells known to express GFP.\n*   **PE Single Stain (1 tube):** If you are using a biotinylated antibody followed by a PE-conjugated streptavidin, this control would utilize that combination.\n*   **AF647 Single Stain (1 tube)**\n*   **AF750 Single Stain (1 tube)**\n\n***Note on beads:*** Compensation can be performed using either cells or antibody-capture beads. Beads are often preferred as they provide a consistently bright signal, which is ideal for calculating compensation. Streptavidin-coated beads can be used to prepare a compensation control for a biotinylated antibody.\n\n### 3. **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes)**\nFMO controls are used to accurately set the gates that define your positive and negative populations. An FMO sample includes all the fluorophores in your panel *except* for one. This accounts for the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the one being measured, which is critical for resolving dim or overlapping populations. For a five-color panel, you should prepare:\n*   **FMO minus AF350 (1 tube)**\n*   **FMO minus GFP (1 tube)**\n*   **FMO minus PE (1 tube)**\n*   **FMO minus AF647 (1 tube)**\n*   **FMO minus AF750 (1 tube)**\n\n### **Summary of Essential Controls:**\n\n| Control Type | Purpose | Number of Tubes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Unstained Cells | Set baseline fluorescence and scatter properties | 1 |\n| Viability Dye Only | Gate out dead cells & for compensation | 1 |\n| Single-Color Compensation | Correct for spectral overlap | 5 |\n| Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) | Accurate gating | 5 |\n| **Total** | | **12** |\n\nIn addition to these technical controls, you should also include appropriate **biological controls**, such as unstimulated or negative control cells, to interpret the biological significance of your findings.\n\n<<<12>>>"
