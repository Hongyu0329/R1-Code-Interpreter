    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n = 12345$ vertices. The chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for such a graph, given that it is not a complete graph.\n\nA complete graph $K_n$ is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The chromatic number of a complete graph with $n$ vertices is $n$, as every vertex must have a unique color. The problem specifies that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n\nIf a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than $n$. This is because if $\\chi(G) = n$, it implies that in any proper coloring with $n$ colors, every vertex requires a different color, which only occurs if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, meaning $G$ is a complete graph. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, we can conclude that $\\chi(G) < 12345$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nNow we need to determine if a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as follows:\n*   Take a complete graph with 12344 vertices, let's call it $K_{12344}$.\n*   Add one additional vertex to the graph, and leave this vertex isolated (with no edges connected to it).\n\nThis graph $G$ has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n\nLet's determine the chromatic number of this graph $G$. The graph has two connected components: the complete subgraph $K_{12344}$ and the single isolated vertex. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n*   The chromatic number of the complete subgraph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex is 1.\n\nThe chromatic number of $G$ is therefore $\\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have shown that for any non-complete graph with 12345 vertices, the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, and we have provided an example of such a graph that requires exactly 12344 colors, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nAnother important theorem in graph coloring is Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. In our example of $K_{12344}$ plus an isolated vertex, the graph is not connected. The maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is 12343 (the degree of any vertex within the $K_{12344}$ component). Here, the chromatic number is $12344 = \\Delta(G) + 1$, which is consistent with one of the exceptions to the main statement of Brooks' theorem, as a component of the graph is a complete graph.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
