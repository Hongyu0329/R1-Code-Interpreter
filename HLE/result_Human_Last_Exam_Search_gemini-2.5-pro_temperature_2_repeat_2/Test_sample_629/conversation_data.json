    "The minimal grid number for a knot, also known as its arc index, is the size `n` of the smallest `n x n` grid on which the knot can be represented. For an alternating knot, the arc index is its minimal crossing number plus two. The trefoil knot is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of three. Therefore, its minimal grid number is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nThe question is to find the number of distinct 5x5 grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalent.\n\nOne study shows that for the right-hand trefoil knot, there are exactly 5 such minimal grid diagrams. Another paper mentions that for grid number 5, there are a total of 10 diagrams that form the trefoil knot (which includes both left- and right-handed versions). Given the symmetry between a knot and its mirror image, it follows that the 10 total diagrams are split evenly, with 5 representing the right-handed trefoil and 5 representing the left-handed trefoil. A figure in another paper shows an example of a 5x5 grid diagram for a left-handed trefoil knot.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
