    "After a gene duplication event, there are several possible fates for the new gene copy. The process of retaining both copies while they become different from each other is crucial for the evolution of new gene functions. Let's examine the provided options to determine the most likely mechanism.\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between similar sequences, such as duplicated genes. Gene conversion tends to homogenize the two copies, meaning it makes them more similar. This action works against divergence, although it can help maintain the functionality of multiple copies. Therefore, it is not the primary mechanism for divergence.\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. It occurs when one copy accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes non-functional, turning into a \"pseudogene\". While this represents a form of divergence (functional vs. non-functional), it does not result in the *retention* of two active, diverging genes.\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This process occurs when one copy of the gene acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation, while the other copy maintains the original ancestral function. This is an adaptive process that leads to both the retention of the two genes (as they serve distinct, important roles) and their clear functional divergence.\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the two duplicate genes divide the original functions of their single ancestor. Each copy accumulates mutations that degrade or silence a different sub-function, making both copies necessary to carry out the complete set of tasks performed by the ancestral gene. This is also a powerful mechanism that leads to both the retention and divergence of the gene copies.\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary event where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill new ecological niches. Gene duplication is a key genetic mechanism that can provide the raw material to fuel adaptive radiation, but it is not itself the mechanism of retention and divergence at the gene level.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are the principal mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. Pseudogenization leads to loss of function, gene conversion prevents divergence, and adaptive radiation is a higher-level process. Between neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization, both are considered highly important. Subfunctionalization, which can occur through common, slightly deleterious mutations under neutral drift (a process sometimes called Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation), is thought to be a very common way to preserve duplicates immediately following duplication, as it does not require waiting for a rare beneficial mutation. Neofunctionalization represents the acquisition of a novel function, which is a key driver of evolution but may rely on rarer events.\n\nBoth C and D are excellent candidates as they are the two major models explaining this phenomenon. However, the subfunctionalization model provides a powerful explanation for the preservation of a large number of duplicates, as it partitions existing functions, making both copies indispensable.\n\nConsidering that the question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism, and subfunctionalization provides a neutral pathway for preservation through the partitioning of ancestral roles, which may be a more frequent initial outcome than the acquisition of a completely new function, it stands as a very strong candidate.\n\n<<<D>>>"
