    "In the context of disordered systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical tool. For systems belonging to symmetry class D, which are characterized by broken time-reversal and spin-rotational symmetries, the underlying mathematical structure is a specific type of supermanifold.\n\nWhen considering two replicas (n=2) to study higher moments of transport properties, the target manifold of the supersymmetric sigma-model for class D is given by the superspace SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2). The non-Grassmann variables, also known as bosonic variables, parametrize the bosonic sector of this manifold.\n\nTo determine the number of these variables, one needs to calculate the dimension of this bosonic part. The dimension of the bosonic submanifold is the difference between the dimension of the bosonic part of the numerator's Lie supergroup and that of the denominator's Lie supergroup.\n\nThe bosonic part of the Lie superalgebra of SpO(2n, R|2n) is so(2n) ⊕ sp(2n), and for U(n|n), it is u(n) ⊕ u(n). With n=2 for two replicas, we consider:\n\n*   The dimension of the special orthogonal group SO(4) is n(n-1)/2 = 4(3)/2 = 6.\n*   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(4) is n(2n+1) = 2(5) = 10.\n*   The dimension of the unitary group U(2) is n² = 4.\n\nThe dimension of the bosonic part of the numerator, SpO(4, R), is the sum of the dimensions of SO(4) and Sp(4), which is 6 + 10 = 16.\n\nThe dimension of the bosonic part of the denominator, U(2) x U(2), is the sum of the dimensions of two U(2) groups, which is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of the resulting bosonic coset space, which is the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the numerator and the denominator: 16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
