    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, the behavior of the system is analyzed using the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d, with 'd' being the number of spatial dimensions. The renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant is described by the beta function, β(u). A fixed point, u*, occurs when the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling constant no longer changes with the energy scale.\n\nTo find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling, one calculates the one-loop beta function for the ϕ⁴ coupling. In the vicinity of d=4 dimensions, the beta function for a dimensionless coupling 'u' takes the general form:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + B u² + O(u³)\n\nHere, 'B' is a constant that depends on the specific normalization conventions for the coupling constant 'u'. The non-trivial fixed point (the Wilson-Fisher fixed point) is found by setting β(u*) = 0 and solving for u*:\n\n-ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nIgnoring the trivial solution u* = 0 (the Gaussian fixed point), we find:\n\nu* = ϵ / B\n\nThis shows that, to the leading order, the fixed point coupling is directly proportional to ϵ. The specific value of the constant B depends on the conventions used for the coupling in the Lagrangian. For a common convention where the interaction term is written as (u/4!)ϕ⁴, the constant B is 3/(8π²). This gives the fixed point coupling:\n<br>\nu* = (8π²/3)ϵ\n<br>\nTherefore, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is directly proportional to ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (8π²/3)ϵ>>>"
