    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a Pummerer-type reaction. In this process, the sulfoxide is activated by the electrophilic triflic anhydride. This is followed by the introduction of a cyanide group from trimethylsilyl cyanide. The resulting product is (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile. It is also commonly referred to as (phenylthio)acetonitrile.\n\n<<<2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile>>>"
