    "In the context of fuzzy logic, the question asks for the result of an operation that combines the antecedent firing strength with the membership grade of the consequent. The fact that the fuzzy set is of interval type-3 signifies a high level of complexity in modeling uncertainty; however, since the given values are crisp numbers (`0.7` and `0.9`), the problem simplifies to a fundamental fuzzy inference calculation at a specific point.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the components:\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`**: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th fuzzy rule. It indicates the degree to which the input `x'` satisfies the condition of the rule.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`**: This is the membership grade of a specific output `y_j` in the fuzzy set of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule.\n*   **t-norm Operation**: A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" in fuzzy systems. In a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system, a t-norm is used to apply the firing strength of the antecedent to the membership function of the consequent. This process determines the output fuzzy set for the rule. This resulting value is what the prompt refers to as the \"rule activation level\".\n\nThe calculation depends on the specific t-norm used. Since one was not specified, the answer is calculated using the two most common t-norms: the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm)**: The result is the minimum of the two values.\n    *   `Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm**: The result is the product of the two values.\n    *   `Activation Level = Phi_k(x′) * μG_k_j(y_j)`\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nTherefore, depending on the t-norm applied, the rule activation level would be either 0.7 or 0.63.\n\n<<<Using the minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7. Using the product t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.63.>>>"
