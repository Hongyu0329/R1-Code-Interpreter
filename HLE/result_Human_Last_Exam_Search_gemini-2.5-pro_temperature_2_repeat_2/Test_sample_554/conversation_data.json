    "A perfluoronanocar would hypothetically contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The chemical formula for the original nanocar, a single-molecule vehicle, is C430H274O12. Therefore, a perfluorinated version of this nanocar would have all 274 hydrogen atoms replaced with fluorine atoms, resulting in a chemical formula of C430F274O12.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"nanocar\" can describe a class of molecules, and other nanocar structures with different chemical formulas exist. For instance, another synthesized nanocar has the formula C310H34, which, if perfluorinated, would contain 34 fluorine atoms. However, the most commonly referenced structure is the one containing 274 hydrogen atoms. Nanocars are molecular machines designed to roll across surfaces, with fullerene or other molecular groups acting as wheels.\n\n<<<274>>>"
