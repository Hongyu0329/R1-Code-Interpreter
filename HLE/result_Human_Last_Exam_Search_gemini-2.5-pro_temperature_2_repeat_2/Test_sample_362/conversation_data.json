    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that transforms aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a triphenyl phosphonium ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent. The reaction proceeds by the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde being replaced by the carbon group from the ylide, resulting in the formation of a new alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe specific reactants in this case are:\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This phosphorus ylide has the structure (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(Ph)₃.\n\nIn this reaction, the double bond of the carbonyl group in pivalaldehyde is replaced by a double bond with the ylide's carbanion. The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` portion of the pivalaldehyde molecule connects to the `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` portion of the ylide.\n\nThe resulting product is an alkene with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). The systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The reaction can produce both E and Z stereoisomers of the product. The specific stereochemical outcome often depends on the ylide's stability; non-stabilized ylides, like the one in this reaction, typically favor the Z-isomer.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
