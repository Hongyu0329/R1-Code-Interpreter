    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element; in other words, it is a cyclic subgroup. To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, we need to determine the number of its distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 2<sup>n</sup>, denoted Q<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub>, has a specific structure that allows for the calculation of its cyclic subgroups. For Q_128, we have n=7.\n\nThe number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group Q<sub>2<sup>n</sup></sub> (for n â‰¥ 3) can be calculated with the formula:\nNumber of cyclic subgroups = 2<sup>n-2</sup> + n.\n\nFor the generalized quaternion group of size 128, the order is 2<sup>7</sup>, so n = 7.\nPlugging n = 7 into the formula gives:\nNumber of cyclic subgroups = 2<sup>7-2</sup> + 7 = 2<sup>5</sup> + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39.\n\nThis can be broken down as follows:\n*   The group Q_128 contains a cyclic subgroup of order 64 (which is 2<sup>7-1</sup>). A cyclic group of order 2<sup>6</sup> has 6 + 1 = 7 cyclic subgroups (one for each divisor of 64).\n*   The remaining 64 elements of Q_128, those not in the aforementioned cyclic subgroup of order 64, each have an order of 4.\n*   These 64 elements form 32 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cyclic (or power) subgroups is 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
