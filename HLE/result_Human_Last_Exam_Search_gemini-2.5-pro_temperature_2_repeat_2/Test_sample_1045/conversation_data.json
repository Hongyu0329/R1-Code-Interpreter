    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set:\n*   Each carbon atom, a \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atom, has:\n    *   One core (1s) orbital represented by a contracted Gaussian function composed of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   One inner valence (2s, 2p) set of orbitals represented by a contracted Gaussian function made of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   One outer valence (2s, 2p) set of orbitals represented by a single primitive Gaussian function.\n    This results in a total of 9 contracted Gaussian functions per carbon atom (1 for 1s, 4 for the inner valence shell [2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz], and 4 for the outer valence shell [2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz]).\n*   Each hydrogen atom has:\n    *   One inner (1s) orbital represented by a contracted Gaussian function made of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   One outer (1s) orbital represented by a single primitive Gaussian function.\n    This gives a total of 2 contracted Gaussian functions per hydrogen atom.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) is calculated as follows:\n*   For the 7 carbon atoms: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   For the 8 hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   Total functions = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of how this number is calculated:\n\nFirst, the number of atoms of each element in toluene must be determined. The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, indicating it has seven carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms.\n\nNext, the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each type of atom in the 6-31G basis set is identified:\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   The core electrons (1s) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function composed of six primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The valence electrons (2s and 2p) are described by a \"split-valence\" representation. This means they are represented by two sets of basis functions:\n        *   An inner set (for 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals) consisting of four contracted Gaussian functions, each composed of three primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An outer set (also for 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals) consisting of four contracted Gaussian functions, where each is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Therefore, each carbon atom is described by a total of 9 contracted Gaussian functions (1 for the core + 4 for the inner valence + 4 for the outer valence).\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen atoms do not have core electrons. Their valence electron (1s) is also described by a split-valence basis set:\n        *   An inner contracted Gaussian function composed of three primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An outer contracted Gaussian function that is a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   This results in a total of 2 contracted Gaussian functions for each hydrogen atom.\n\nFinally, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule is calculated by multiplying the number of each type of atom by its respective number of basis functions and then summing the results:\n*   **Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 basis functions/atom = 63 basis functions\n*   **Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 basis functions/atom = 16 basis functions\n*   **Total for toluene:** 63 + 16 = 79 basis functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
