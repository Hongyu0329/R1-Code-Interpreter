    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron with the tagline \"Ask Why\" were Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, a recipient of the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles, has been identified as one of the figures in the advertising campaign. A Reddit thread discussing the commercial also identified Gell-Mann and described the other person as an \"Indian commentator.\"\n\nThe other Nobel laureate was Amartya Sen, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics. In 2000, Sen was a speaker at the Harvard Commencement, and his work focuses on humanitarian inquiry and freedom.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a significant marketing effort by Enron before its scandalous collapse. While video evidence of the specific commercial featuring both laureates is not readily available in the search results, the consistent identification of Murray Gell-Mann and the description of the other participant strongly point to Amartya Sen, a prominent Indian Nobel laureate at the time.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
