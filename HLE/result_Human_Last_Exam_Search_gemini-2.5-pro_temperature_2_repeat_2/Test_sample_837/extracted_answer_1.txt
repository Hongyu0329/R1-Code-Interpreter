The answer to whether the problem is decidable depends on the definition of "decidable". In the strict, technical sense of computability theory, a problem with no input and a single "yes" or "no" answer is trivially decidable, because a terminating algorithm that gives the correct answer exists (we just don't know which one it is). However, in the broader, more practical and philosophical sense, the problem is undecidable because there is no agreed-upon formal definition or effective procedure (be it logical, mathematical, or scientific) to determine a definitive and verifiable answer.
