    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees.\" Another less common name for this genus is \"miner bees.\"\n\nWhile the exact year the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not definitively documented in the provided search results, its use in publications becomes noticeable around the year 2000. The book \"Insects & Spiders: An Explore Your World Handbook,\" published in 2000, is one of the publications that uses this common name. A 2020 article mentions that common names for many bee genera are still in their early stages of adoption and standardization, which suggests that \"fairy bees\" is a relatively modern term. For example, a 2024 publication refers to *Perdita novaeangliae* as the \"New England Fairy Bee\" and *Perdita octomaculata* as the \"Eight-spotted Fairy Bee.\"\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2000>>>"
