    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Substrate and Reagents:** The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other. The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH3)3), is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. The solvent is its conjugate acid, tert-butyl alcohol. These conditions are classic for an E2 elimination.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism (E2):** The E2 mechanism requires a specific stereochemical arrangement: the leaving group (bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the hydrogen must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down), known as a trans-diaxial arrangement.\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis:**\n    *   For the cis-(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane to undergo the reaction, it must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n    *   When the bromine on carbon 1 is axial, there are two different beta-hydrogens that can be in a trans-diaxial position to it:\n        *   A hydrogen on carbon 2.\n        *   A hydrogen on carbon 6.\n\n4.  **Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev):**\n    *   **Zaitsev's Rule:** Generally, elimination reactions favor the formation of the more substituted (and therefore more stable) alkene. This is known as the Zaitsev product. In this case, removing the hydrogen from carbon 2 would lead to the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**, a trisubstituted alkene.\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule:** When a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide is used, the reaction favors the formation of the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product. This is because the bulky base has an easier time accessing the less sterically hindered proton. In this case, the proton on carbon 6 is more sterically accessible than the proton on carbon 2, which is near the methyl group. Removing the hydrogen from carbon 6 leads to the formation of **3-methylcyclohexene**, a disubstituted alkene.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Due to the use of the bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, the reaction will preferentially follow the Hofmann rule to avoid steric hindrance. The base will abstract the more accessible axial proton on carbon 6.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
