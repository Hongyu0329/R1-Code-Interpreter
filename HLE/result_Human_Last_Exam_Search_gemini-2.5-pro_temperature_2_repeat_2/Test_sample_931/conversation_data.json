    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predators. Multiple sources confirm that their diet consists of soft-bodied insects, with a particular preference for aphids.\n\nIn addition to being predatory, some adult snakeflies have also been recorded feeding on pollen and nectar. Pollen has been discovered in the digestive systems of adult snakeflies, although its exact role in their diet is not fully understood. Some non-predatory species are reported to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n\nBased on the available evidence:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies have been reported to feed on nectar.\n*   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While snakeflies do eat pollen, they are not naturally found in the Southern Hemisphere, including New Zealand, where the Māhoe tree grows. An attempt to introduce a species to New Zealand in the early 1900s was unsuccessful. Therefore, there is no record of them feeding on Māhoe pollen.\n*   **C. Fungus:** There is no scientific record of adult snakeflies consuming fungus.\n*   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not recorded as feeding on leaf tissue.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** As with Māhoe pollen, Raphidiopterans are not established in New Zealand where Totara trees and their specific aphids exist. However, snakeflies are well-documented as significant predators of aphids in general.\n\nGiven the options, adult Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on nectar and aphids (as a category of prey). Option F combines these two recorded food sources.\n\n<<<F>>>"
