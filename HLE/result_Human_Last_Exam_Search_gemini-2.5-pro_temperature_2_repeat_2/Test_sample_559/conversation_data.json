    "To find the separatrix of the system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. The system is given by:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\ge 0$.\n\n### 1. Finding Equilibrium Points\nEquilibrium points exist when $d'=0$ and $u'=0$.\nFrom $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we have $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$.\n    So, $(u,d) = (0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, $(u,d) = (1,0)$ and $(u,d) = (1,-1)$ are two other equilibrium points.\n\n### 2. Classifying the Equilibrium Points\nWe analyze the stability of these points using the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u,d)$:\nLet $f(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $g(u,d) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$.\nThe Jacobian is:\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u - 3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At **(0,0)**: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a degenerate case, and linearization is inconclusive.\n*   At **(1,0)**: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, (1,0) is an **unstable node**.\n*   At **(1,-1)**: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 & 4(-1) + 5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -7+1 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (1,-1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n### 3. Finding the Separatrix\nSeparatrices are curves in the phase plane that divide trajectories with different long-term behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices.\n\nLet's look for an invariant curve of the form $d=h(u)$. Such a curve would be a trajectory of the system. Let's test a simple polynomial relationship, for example $d = c u^k$. Trying $d = -u^2$.\nWe must verify if this is a solution to the system.\nIf $d = -u^2$, then using the chain rule, $d' = \\frac{d(d)}{du} u' = (-2u)u'$.\nSubstitute $d=-u^2$ into the first differential equation:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nNow compare this with $(-2u)u'$:\n$(-2u)u' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nThe expressions for $d'$ are identical. Thus, the curve defined by $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system, meaning it is composed of trajectories.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium points:\n*   At $u=0$, $d=-(0)^2=0$. It passes through (0,0).\n*   At $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$. It passes through the saddle point (1,-1).\n\nAn invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be its stable or unstable manifold. To determine which, we analyze the direction of flow on the curve. The flow direction is determined by $u' = u^2(u-1)$.\n*   For $0 \\le u < 1$, $u' \\le 0$, so trajectories move from $u=1$ toward $u=0$.\n*   For $u > 1$, $u' > 0$, so trajectories move away from $u=1$.\n\nSince trajectories on the curve $d=-u^2$ move away from the saddle point (1,-1) (both for $u<1$ and $u>1$), this curve constitutes the **unstable manifold** of the saddle point.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix. It divides the phase plane into regions with different dynamic behaviors.\n*   For $0 \\le u < 1$, trajectories starting above this curve ($d > -u^2$) are attracted to the origin (0,0). Trajectories starting below this curve ($d < -u^2$) diverge to $d \\to -\\infty$.\n*   For $u > 1$, trajectories starting above this curve ($d > -u^2$) escape to $d \\to +\\infty$, while those below ($d < -u^2$) escape to $d \\to -\\infty$.\n\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ acts as a boundary between these different long-term behaviors. The other separatrix is the stable manifold of the saddle point, which can be shown to be the line $u=1$ for $d<0$. However, the invariant curve $d=-u^2$ is the most significant separatrix describing the global structure of the phase portrait.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix is the curve given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
