    "### Functional Dependence of the Bare Green's Function on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues in Feynman Path Integral Formalism\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G₀, for a non-interacting system exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship arises from the definition of the Green's function as the propagator of a single particle, which can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian.\n\nThe bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), in frequency and momentum space, is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) ω and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. For a fermionic system, this is typically written as:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iη sgn(ϵₖ - μ))**\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum k and frequency (energy) ω.\n*   **ϵₖ** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with momentum k. This is an eigenvalue of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, H₀.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential.\n*   **η** is an infinitesimal positive number that ensures proper convergence and causality, dictating whether the pole is slightly above or below the real axis.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function, which determines the sign of the imaginary part depending on whether the state is above or below the Fermi level.\n\nThis functional form reveals that the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues. The physical interpretation is that the Green's function describes the propagation of a particle, and this propagation is most significant when the energy of the particle matches one of the allowed energy levels of the system.\n\nThe connection to the Feynman path integral formalism is established by expressing the Green's function as a vacuum expectation value of time-ordered fields. The path integral provides a method for calculating these expectation values. For a non-interacting theory, the action in the path integral is quadratic in the fields, which allows the integral to be solved exactly.\n\nThe derivation involves the following conceptual steps:\n1.  **Define the Green's function in the path integral formalism**: The two-point Green's function is defined as a functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the action.\n2.  **Use a non-interacting Hamiltonian**: The action for a bare Green's function corresponds to a non-interacting Hamiltonian, H₀, whose eigenstates are the single-particle states with energies ϵₖ.\n3.  **Evaluate the Gaussian integral**: For a non-interacting system, the path integral is a Gaussian integral. Performing this integral (often by transforming to frequency and momentum space) yields the algebraic form of the Green's function shown above.\n\nTherefore, while the Feynman path integral is a powerful tool for handling interacting systems through perturbation theory, its application to the non-interacting case directly yields a bare Green's function whose functional form is fundamentally determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. The dependence is explicitly a pole structure, where the locations of the poles in the complex frequency plane are given by the single-particle energies.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (energy) ω of the particle and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. Mathematically, for a given momentum k, the functional dependence is of the form G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵₖ). The poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting system.>>>"
