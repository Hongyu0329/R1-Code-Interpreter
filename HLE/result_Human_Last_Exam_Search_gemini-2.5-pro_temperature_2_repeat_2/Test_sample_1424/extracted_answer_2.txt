In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (energy) ω of the particle and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵₖ. Mathematically, for a given momentum k, the functional dependence is of the form G₀(k, ω) ∝ 1 / (ω - ϵₖ). The poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues of the non-interacting system.
