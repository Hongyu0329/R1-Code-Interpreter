The best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47-50 (S-E-E-D) to eliminate the negatively charged environment would be to substitute all of them with Alanine (A). This would create the sequence A-A-A-A at positions 47-50, effectively neutralizing the patch and removing the phosphorylation site.
