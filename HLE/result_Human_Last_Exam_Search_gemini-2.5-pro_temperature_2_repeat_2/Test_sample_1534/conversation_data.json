    "### Brain Regions Posterior to the Palliovisceral Lobe in Dwarf Cuttlefish Identified\n\nIn the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions situated adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. This anatomical arrangement is detailed in the comprehensive 3D brain atlas created for this species.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a crucial part of the subesophageal mass, a major division of the cephalopod brain that controls many motor and autonomic functions. The subesophageal mass is located below the esophagus and is responsible for, among other things, the movement of the arms, fins, and changes in skin coloration.\n\nDetailed 3D models and histological sections from the *Sepia bandensis* brain atlas reveal the spatial relationships of these lobes. The posterior view of the brain shows the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes located behind the palliovisceral lobe. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape responses, such as inking and jet propulsion via the funnel. The adjacent posterior chromatophore lobes govern the pigment-containing cells on the mantle, enabling the cuttlefish's remarkable camouflage abilities, while the fin lobes control the movement of the fins for locomotion.\n\nThe creation of the dwarf cuttlefish brain atlas, available through the interactive web tool Cuttlebase, has been a significant step in understanding the neural circuitry underlying the complex behaviors of cephalopods. This atlas provides a detailed neuroanatomical roadmap of the 32 distinct lobes in the dwarf cuttlefish brain.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
