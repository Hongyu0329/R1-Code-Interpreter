    "Medieval theologians, particularly in the High Scholastic period, developed specialized terminology to describe God's ability to act outside of the established laws of nature. The key distinction that addresses changes in the natural order, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations at the Fall, is the differentiation between God's absolute power (*potentia Dei absoluta*) and God's ordained power (*potentia Dei ordinata*). While this distinction was used by several thinkers, including Thomas Aquinas, it was **John Duns Scotus** (c. 1266-1308) who significantly developed and applied this framework in a way that is particularly relevant to both scenarios.\n\nThe specialized terminology can be understood as follows:\n\n*   ***Potentia Dei ordinata*** **(God's ordained power)**: This refers to God's power as it is expressed through the established order of nature and grace. This is the consistent and reliable way in which the world operates according to the laws God has ordained.\n*   ***Potentia Dei absoluta*** **(God's absolute power)**: This refers to God's power to do anything that does not involve a logical contradiction. This is the power by which God can act beyond or outside of the established natural laws He has ordained. Miraculous events fall under this category.\n\nThis framework allows for a theological explanation of both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth of Jesus**: This event is understood as an exercise of God's *potentia absoluta*. The natural law of human reproduction (*potentia ordinata*) was suspended, and God acted directly to bring about the incarnation.\n\n*   **Alterations in Natural Law at the Fall**: The state of nature before the Fall can be seen as operating under a different *potentia ordinata* than the world after the Fall. The changes in the natural world, such as the introduction of death and decay, can be understood as a shift in the ordained order. Duns Scotus, for instance, argued that the incarnation would have occurred even without the Fall, which implies a consideration of different possible ordained orders of the world.\n\nWhile the terminology was employed by earlier theologians, John Duns Scotus is a key figure who utilized this distinction to explore the contingency of the created order and God's freedom to act outside of it, providing a sophisticated framework applicable to events like the virgin birth and the differing states of nature before and after the Fall. William of Ockham would later expand upon this distinction.\n\n<<<John Duns Scotus>>>"
