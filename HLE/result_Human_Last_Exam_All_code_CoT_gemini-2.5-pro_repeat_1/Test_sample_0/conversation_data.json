    "My plan is to identify which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views in population ethics. I will first explain the core concepts and then use a Python script to demonstrate the violation.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define Critical-Level View:** A population's value is calculated by summing up the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" (c). The value of a population is Σ(uᵢ - c), where uᵢ is the welfare of person i. An action (like adding a person) is good only if it increases this total value. This means adding a person with welfare `u` is only good if `u > c`.\n\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Condition:** The Non-Elitism principle states that for any two positive welfare levels, `u` (very high) and `v` (lower than `u`), and for any population size `n` at level `u`, there exists some larger population size `m` at level `v` that is considered better. In essence, it says there's no \"elite\" level of welfare that is so good that a small number of people at that level is better than any number of people at a slightly lower level.\n\n3.  **Identify the Conflict:** The conflict arises when we choose the welfare levels in relation to the critical level `c`.\n    *   Let's set a critical level `c > 0`. For example, `c = 10`.\n    *   Let's choose an \"elite\" welfare level `u` that is *above* the critical level. For example, `u = 20`.\n    *   Let's choose a \"non-elite\" welfare level `v` that is *below* the critical level, but still positive. For example, `v = 5`.\n    *   So we have `u > c > v > 0`.\n\n4.  **Demonstrate the Violation:**\n    *   Consider an \"elite\" population A with one person at welfare level `u = 20`. Its value is `1 * (20 - 10) = 10`. This is a positive value.\n    *   Now, consider a \"non-elite\" population B with `m` people at welfare level `v = 5`. Its value is `m * (5 - 10) = -5m`. This value is negative for any `m > 0`.\n    *   Non-Elitism requires that we can find some number `m` that makes population B better than population A. This means we need to find an `m` such that `Value(B) > Value(A)`, or `-5m > 10`.\n    *   This inequality can never be satisfied for any positive `m`. A negative number can never be greater than a positive number.\n    *   Therefore, no matter how many people we add at the positive (but below-critical) welfare level `v`, the population will never be considered better than the single-person population at the \"elite\" level `u`. This is a clear violation of Non-Elitism.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations to demonstrate the violation.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates how critical-level views violate the\n    Non-Elitism principle from Arrhenius's impossibility theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
