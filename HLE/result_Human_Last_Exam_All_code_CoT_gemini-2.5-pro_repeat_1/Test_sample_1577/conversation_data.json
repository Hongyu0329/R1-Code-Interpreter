    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is a topological property that depends on the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it is determined by the number of non-equivalent, non-trivial loops on the surface, which in turn defines the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits.\n2.  The number of logical qubits `k` for the toric code on an orientable surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries (holes) is given by the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n3.  The problem specifies `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. A common and physically relevant interpretation for such a setup is a finite system on a plane, which is topologically equivalent to a disk with `n+m` holes punched into it.\n4.  Such a surface (a disk with holes) has a genus `g=0`. The total number of boundaries `b` is the sum of the `n` smooth inner boundaries, the `m` rough inner boundaries, and the single outer boundary of the disk itself. Thus, `b = n + m + 1`.\n5.  We can now calculate the number of logical qubits `k` by substituting `g=0` and `b=n+m+1` into the formula:\n    `k = 2*0 + (n + m + 1) - 1 = n + m`.\n6.  Therefore, the ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`.\n7.  I will write a Python script to calculate this value for given `n` and `m`, and display the formula with the specific numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a planar surface with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of logical qubits k is n + m for a planar surface\n    # with n smooth and m rough holes (which implies n+m+1 total boundaries).\n    # The GSD is 2^k.\n    \n    k = n + m\n    gsd = 2**k\n\n    print(f\"For a toric code with:\")\n    print(f\"  n = {n} (smooth holes)\")\n    print(f\"  m = {m} (rough holes)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is calculated as 2^(n + m).\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m})\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^{k}\")\n    print(f\"GSD = {gsd}\")\n\n\n# Example values for n and m.\n# You can change these to explore other cases.\nn_smooth_holes = 2\nm_rough_holes = 1\n\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
