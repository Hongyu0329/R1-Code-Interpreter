    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its braid index.

    # Step 2: Explain Vogel's algorithm for a closed n-braid.
    # When Vogel's algorithm is applied to a diagram of a closed n-braid,
    # it gives an upper bound of n. The calculation uses the maximum and minimum
    # winding numbers (w_max and w_min) of the arcs.
    # For a standard n-braid diagram, the winding number levels range from 0 to n-1.
