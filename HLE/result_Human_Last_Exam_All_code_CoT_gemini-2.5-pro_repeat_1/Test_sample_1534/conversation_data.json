    "Here is a plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I will identify the key anatomical structures mentioned in your question: the \"palliovisceral lobe\" and its location within the dwarf cuttlefish brain.\n2.  Next, I will access neuroanatomical knowledge about cephalopods to determine which structures are situated posteriorly (behind) this lobe.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information and prints the names of the adjacent posterior brain regions in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know which brain regions are posterior to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n# This script will provide the answer based on established cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n\ndef find_posterior_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the names of brain regions located posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    This information is based on anatomical studies of the cephalopod brain.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary lobe in question.\n    main_lobe = \"palliovisceral lobe\"\n    \n    # The regions located posteriorly to the main lobe.\n    posterior_adjacent_regions = [\"posterior chromatophore lobes\", \"magnocellular lobes\"]\n    \n    # Construct and print the answer.\n    print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {main_lobe} in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for region in posterior_adjacent_regions:\n        print(f\"- {region}\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_posterior_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the magnocellular lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
