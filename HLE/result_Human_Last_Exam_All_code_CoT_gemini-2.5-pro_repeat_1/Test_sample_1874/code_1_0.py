    # Let w(n) represent the cardinal omega_n (or aleph_n).
    # The universe of the sets is omega_2, i.e., w(2).
    
    # Step 1: Analyze the constraints on the cardinal delta.
    # The problem defines a tower <x_alpha : alpha < delta> of omega_2-sized subsets of omega_2.
    # The two main conditions are:
    # 1. For alpha < beta < delta, |x_beta \ x_alpha| < omega_2.
    # 2. There is no omega_2-sized y such that for all alpha, |y \ x_alpha| < omega_2.
    
    # Step 2: Show that delta must be greater than or equal to omega_2.
    # Assume delta < omega_2. Let y = union(x_alpha for alpha in delta).
    # For any given alpha_0 < delta, y \ x_alpha_0 = union(x_beta \ x_alpha_0 for beta in (alpha_0, delta)).
    # This is a union of |delta| sets, each of size less than omega_2.
    # Since delta < omega_2 and omega_2 is a regular cardinal (cf(omega_2) = omega_2),
    # the union has a cardinality strictly less than omega_2.
    # This means y is an upper bound for the tower, which contradicts condition 2.
    # Therefore, delta must be greater than or equal to omega_2.
    # So, the index 'n' for omega_n must be >= 2.
    
    smallest_n_candidate = 2
    
    # Step 3: Show that delta must be a regular cardinal.
    # If delta were a singular cardinal, its cofinality cf(delta) would be less than delta.
    # A tower of length delta can be used to construct a tower of length cf(delta).
    # This means that any possible value for delta must be a regular cardinal.
    
    # Step 4: Identify the possible values for delta.
    # Delta must be a regular cardinal and delta >= omega_2.
    # The regular cardinals are omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, ... (and regular limit cardinals).
    # The regular cardinals >= omega_2 are omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, ...
    # It is consistent with ZFC that towers of these lengths exist.
    
    # Step 5: Find the smallest and second smallest values.
    # The smallest possible value for delta is omega_2.
    # This corresponds to n = 2.
    
    smallest_n = smallest_n_candidate
    
    # The second smallest possible value for delta is the next regular cardinal, which is omega_3.
    # This corresponds to n = 3.
