    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the members:** I will identify the distinct members of the human let-7 microRNA family based on information from established biological databases and scientific literature. The let-7 family is defined by a group of microRNAs with highly similar sequences, particularly in their \"seed region\".\n2.  **List the members:** I will create a list containing the names of these identified let-7 family members. This list will include the canonical members `let-7a` through `let-7i` (excluding `let-7h`, which is not found in humans) and `miR-98`, which shares the same seed sequence and is universally considered part of the family.\n3.  **Count and display:** I will use a Python script to count the number of items in the list. To fulfill the prompt's requirement, the script will first display the individual members and then show an equation where each member contributes '1' to the sum, finally printing the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script lists the members of the human let-7 microRNA family and calculates the total number.\n    The list is based on established scientific consensus from microRNA databases.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The let-7 family in humans is composed of several distinct microRNAs.\n    # We list the unique mature members below. Note that some members, like let-7a,\n    # are encoded by multiple genes but produce the same mature microRNA.\n    # miR-98 is included as it shares the same seed sequence and is functionally related.\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n\n    count = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    print(\"The identified members of the human let-7 family are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo calculate the total, we sum each member:\")\n    \n    # Create an equation string showing each member as '1'\n    # e.g., \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\"\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in let7_family_members]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nBased on this, there are {count} members of the let-7 family identified in humans.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_let7_family_members()\n```\n<<<9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    To date, how many members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
