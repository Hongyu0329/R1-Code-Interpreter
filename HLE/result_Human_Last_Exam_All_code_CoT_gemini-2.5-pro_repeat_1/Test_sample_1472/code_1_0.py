    print("\nQ1: Is the molecule linear or does it have very high symmetry (e.g., Td, Oh)?")
    print("A1: No. The presence of the complex, puckered ligands prevents this.")

    print("\nQ2: What is the highest-order proper rotation axis (Cn), the principal axis?")
    print("A2: The two ligands are chemically identical. We can find an axis that passes through the Cu atom and relates the two ligands.")
    print("    A rotation of 180 degrees (n=2) around this axis will superimpose ligand 1 onto ligand 2.")
    print("    Therefore, a C2 axis exists. This is the principal axis, so n=2.")

    print("\nQ3: Are there 2 C2 axes perpendicular to the principal C2 axis?")
    print("A3: No. Let the principal C2 axis be the z-axis. Any potential C2 axis in the xy-plane would have to pass through the ligands.")
    print("    Due to the puckered, non-planar structure of the chelate rings (Cu-S-C-C-S) and the terminal methyl groups, such a rotation does not leave the molecule unchanged.")
    print("    This rules out the D point groups (D2, D2h, D2d).")

    print("\nQ4: Is there a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C2 axis?")
    print("A4: No. The ligands are arranged in a chiral, propeller-like fashion around the copper.")
    print("    A reflection through a plane perpendicular to the C2 axis would not result in an identical structure.")
    print("    This rules out the C2h point group.")

    print("\nQ5: Is there a vertical or dihedral mirror plane (σv or σd) that contains the C2 axis?")
    print("A5: No. A mirror plane requires that the reflection of the molecule is superimposable on the original.")
    print("    The molecule is chiral (like a propeller), meaning it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.")
    print("    Therefore, no mirror planes exist. This rules out the C2v point group.")

    print("\nQ6: Is there an improper rotation axis S2n (i.e., S4)?")
    print("A6: No. An S4 operation (90-degree rotation followed by reflection) would not superimpose the molecule onto itself.")
