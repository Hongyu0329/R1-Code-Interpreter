    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the Green's function describes the propagation of a particle. For a \"bare\" or non-interacting particle, its propagation is determined by the single-particle energy states of the system. The functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space.\n\nThe retarded bare Green's function $G_0^R(k, \\omega)$ is given by the formula:\n\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency (or energy) of the particle we are describing.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of a single-particle state with quantum number $k$ (like momentum).\n*   $i\\eta$ is a small positive imaginary term (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$) required for mathematical consistency (causality).\n\nThis formula shows that the bare Green's function $G_0$ is **inversely proportional** to the difference between the particle's frequency $\\omega$ and its energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The function has a \"pole\" (it diverges) when $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$, which physically means that the system strongly responds to a particle whose energy matches one of the available single-particle energy levels.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate $G_0$ for a given set of parameters based on this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the retarded bare Green's function G_0 for a given set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters for the calculation\n    omega = 2.5  # Frequency of the particle (in some energy units)\n    epsilon_k = 2.0  # Single-particle energy eigenvalue for state 'k'\n    eta = 0.1  # A small positive value for the imaginary part\n\n    # Explain the functional dependence\n    print(\"The retarded bare Green's function G_0(k, omega) depends on the single-particle energy\")\n    print(\"eigenvalue epsilon_k according to the formula:\")\n    print(\"\\n  G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\n    print(\"This shows an inverse relationship between G_0 and the term (omega - epsilon_k).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Perform and display a sample calculation ---\n    print(\"--- Example Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Given the parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency (omega) = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Energy Eigenvalue (epsilon_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal (eta) = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the denominator of the Green's function\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n\n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the final equation with all the numbers\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / (({omega} - {epsilon_k}) + {eta}j)\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator.real:.2f} + {denominator.imag:.2f}j)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value of the bare Green's function is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} + ({G0.imag:.4f})j\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$>>>"
