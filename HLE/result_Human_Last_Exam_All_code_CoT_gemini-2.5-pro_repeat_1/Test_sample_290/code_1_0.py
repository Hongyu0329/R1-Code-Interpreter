def solve_max_points():
    """
    Calculates the maximum number of points (n) based on the problem's geometric constraints.

    The problem states there is a set S of n points Pi equidistant from a point O.
    This means all points Pi lie on a circle C with center O.

    There are 9 straight lines available. The connectivity condition implies that every point
    in T = {O, P1, P2, ..., Pn} must lie on at least one of these lines.

    Therefore, the n points in S must be the intersection points of the 9 lines and the circle C.

    A single straight line can intersect a circle at a maximum of 2 points.
    With 9 lines, we can find the maximum possible number of such intersection points.
    This gives us the upper bound for n.

    The calculation is: num_lines * max_intersections_per_line.

    This maximum value is achievable. Consider the configuration where all 9 lines
    pass through the center O. Each line will intersect the circle at 2 distinct points,
    giving 9 * 2 = 18 unique points for the set S.
    In this arrangement, any two lines intersect at O. For any two points A and B in T,
    if A is on line Li and B is on line Lj, a path can be made from A to O (on Li)
    and then from O to B (on Lj). This path uses at most two lines, satisfying the condition.

    Thus, the maximum value of n is indeed the calculated upper bound.
