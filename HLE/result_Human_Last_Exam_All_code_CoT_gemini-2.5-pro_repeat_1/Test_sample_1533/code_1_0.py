# Define the side lengths of triangle ABC symbolically.
# a is the length of side BC
# b is the length of side AC
# c is the length of side AB
a = 'a'
b = 'b'
c = 'c'

# The problem asks for the ratio BM/MI.
# Based on the geometric derivation using Ptolemy's theorem and the
# property that M is the center of the circle through A, I, and C,
# we arrived at the equation: b * BM = (a + c) * MI.

# We can now express the final ratio.
print("The ratio BM/MI in terms of the side lengths a, b, and c is:")

# The final equation shows the numerator and the denominator.
# The numerator consists of the sum of side lengths 'a' and 'c'.
# The denominator consists of side length 'b'.
