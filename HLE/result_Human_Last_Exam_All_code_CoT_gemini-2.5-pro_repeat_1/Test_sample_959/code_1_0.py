# The user wants to compute the sum of the orders of the outer automorphism groups
# for all central extensions of a group G by a cyclic group C.
# Let this sum be S = sum_{E in Epsilon} o(E).

# Step 1: Analyze the groups G and C.
# C is the cyclic group of order 31, a prime number.
# G is given by the presentation:
# G = <a, b, c, d | aba^-1 = a^2, bcb^-1 = c^2, cdc^-1 = d^2, dad^-1 = a^2>
# The group G is a known example of an acyclic group. An acyclic group has the property
# that its integral homology groups H_n(G, Z) are trivial for all n >= 1.
# This implies G is perfect (H_1(G,Z)=0) and its Schur multiplier is trivial (H_2(G,Z)=0).

# Step 2: Classify the central extensions.
# The set E of central extensions is classified by the second cohomology group H^2(G, C).
# By the Universal Coefficient Theorem, H^2(G, C) is isomorphic to Hom(H_2(G, Z), C).
# Since G is acyclic, H_2(G, Z) = 0, which means H^2(G, C) is the trivial group.
# A trivial cohomology group implies that there is only one central extension up to isomorphism.

# Step 3: Identify the unique extension and simplify the sum.
# The unique extension is the split extension, which is the direct product E = C x G.
# The collection E contains only this single group, so the sum reduces to one term:
# S = o(E) = |Out(C x G)|.

# Step 4: Compute |Out(C x G)|.
# It can be shown that for C=Z_31 and G being an acyclic group (which implies G is perfect,
# torsion-free, and has a trivial outer automorphism group), the following holds:
# |Out(C x G)| = |Aut(C)| * |Out(G)|
# For the given group G, it is known that |Out(G)| = 1.
# Therefore, |Out(C x G)| = |Aut(C)|.

# Step 5: Final calculation.
# The task is now to compute the order of the automorphism group of C = Z_31.
# The order of Aut(Z_n) is given by Euler's totient function, phi(n).
# For a prime number p, phi(p) = p - 1.

# The prime number defining the order of the cyclic group C.
p = 31

# The final equation to solve is finding the value of phi(p).
result = p - 1
