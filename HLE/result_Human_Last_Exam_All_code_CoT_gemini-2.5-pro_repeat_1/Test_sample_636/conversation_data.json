    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, are located at the desired positions of `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues (poles) are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The corresponding characteristic polynomial is `(s - p1)(s - p2) = s^2 - (p1 + p2)s + p1*p2`.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = (-1 + j) + (-1 - j) = -2`\n    *   `p1 * p2 = (-1)^2 - (j)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`\n    *   So, the desired characteristic polynomial is `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Closed-Loop System:** The closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Since `B` is a 2x2 matrix, `F` must also be a 2x2 matrix for the dimensions to be compatible. Let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`. For a multi-input system like this, the solution for `F` is not unique. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\n3.  **Simplify and Solve:** We will assume that the second input is not used, which means the second row of `F` is all zeros. So, `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`. This reduces the number of unknowns from four to two.\n    *   Calculate `BF`: `[[1, 2], [1, 0]] @ [[f1, f2], [0, 0]] = [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]]`\n    *   Calculate `A_cl = A + BF`: `[[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1, f2], [f1, f2]] = [[-1+f1, 1+f2], [1+f1, f2]]`\n\n4.  **Find the Actual Characteristic Polynomial:** The characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(sI - A_cl) = s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`.\n    *   `trace(A_cl) = (-1+f1) + f2 = f1 + f2 - 1`\n    *   `det(A_cl) = (-1+f1)f2 - (1+f2)(1+f1) = -f2 + f1f2 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1f2) = -1 - f1 - 2f2`\n    *   The polynomial is `s^2 - (f1 + f2 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2f2) = 0`, which is `s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2)s + (-1 - f1 - 2f2) = 0`.\n\n5.  **Equate Coefficients:** By comparing the coefficients of our calculated polynomial with the desired one (`s^2 + 2s + 2`), we get a system of two linear equations:\n    *   `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`  => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n    *   `-1 - f1 - 2f2 = 2` => `f1 + 2f2 = -3`\n\n6.  **Solve for `f1` and `f2`:** Solving this system gives `f1 = 1` and `f2 = -2`.\n\n7.  **Construct F and Verify:** We can now construct the matrix `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]` and use the Python code below to display the final equation and verify that the eigenvalues of the resulting `A + BF` are indeed at `-1 Â± j`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the system matrices A and B\nA = np.array([[-1, 1], \n              [1, 0]])\nB = np.array([[1, 2], \n              [1, 0]])\n\n# We need to solve a system of linear equations to find the elements of F.\n# From the plan explained above, the equations are:\n# f1 + f2 = -1\n# f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n# This can be written as M * f = v\nM = np.array([[1, 1], \n              [1, 2]])\nv = np.array([-1, -3])\n\n# Solve for f = [f1, f2]\nf_solution = np.linalg.solve(M, v)\nf1 = f_solution[0]\nf2 = f_solution[1]\n\n# Construct the state feedback gain matrix F with the simplifying assumption F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]\nF = np.array([[f1, f2], \n              [0, 0]])\n\n# Calculate the closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B @ F\nA_cl = A + B @ F\n\n# Calculate the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system to verify the result\neigenvalues, _ = np.linalg.eig(A_cl)\n\n# --- Output the results ---\nprint(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\nprint(F)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation A + B @ F = A_cl is constructed as follows:\")\nprint(\"\\nA =\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nB =\")\nprint(B)\nprint(\"\\nF =\")\nprint(F)\n\nprint(\"\\nResulting closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B @ F:\")\nprint(A_cl)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\nprint(\"The eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix A_cl are:\")\n# Using np.round to clean up floating point inaccuracies\nprint(np.round(eigenvalues, decimals=5))\nprint(\"These values match the desired poles at -1.0 + 1.0j and -1.0 - 1.0j.\")\n\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
