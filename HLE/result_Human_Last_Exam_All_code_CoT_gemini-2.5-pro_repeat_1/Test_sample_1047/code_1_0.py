    # The scenario describes a classic conflict of interest involving a former client.
    # 1. NC LLP has a duty of confidentiality to its former client, Advanced Tech Inc.
    # 2. NC LLP possesses highly relevant and sensitive confidential information (financials, contracts, etc.)
    #    from the previous litigation matter.
    # 3. This information would give the new client, Six Wings Inc., a significant and unfair advantage
    #    in its acquisition of Advanced Tech Inc., thereby prejudicing the former client.
    # 4. Acting for an acquirer against a former client, where the firm holds such relevant confidential
    #    information, creates a direct conflict of interest.
    # 5. While firms can sometimes use "ethical walls" (like the separation between the litigation and
    #    commercial groups), these are not a guaranteed solution and are often insufficient to cure a
    #    direct conflict, especially when the prejudice to the former client is high.
    # 6. The most critical element is consent. A former client can waive such a conflict, but the problem
    #    explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. will NOT consent.
    # 7. Without the consent of the prejudiced former client, the law firm cannot ethically
    #    continue the representation.
