    explanation = """
The question is whether a program P exists that can compute def_superfast(10000).
The definitive answer is no. Such a program cannot exist. The function described is uncomputable.

Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **Analysis of the Function:**
    The function `def_superfast(n)` is a variant of the "Busy Beaver" problem. It's defined based on the output of all possible Python programs shorter than `n` symbols. To compute its value, one would need to:
    a) Generate every possible string of characters with length less than n.
    b) For each string, check if it's a valid Python program.
    c) For each valid program, determine if it will ever halt and return an integer.
    d) Keep track of the maximum integer returned by any of these halting programs (`Huge_int`).
    e) The result is `Huge_int + 1`.

2.  **The Connection to the Halting Problem:**
    Step (c) is the impossible part. Determining whether an arbitrary program will halt or run forever is the famous "Halting Problem," which was proven by Alan Turing to be undecidable. Since there is no general algorithm that can solve the Halting Problem, there can be no program that implements the logic for `def_superfast(n)`.

3.  **Proof by Contradiction:**
    We can formally prove that no program `P` can compute `def_superfast(10000)` using a logical argument called proof by contradiction.

    -   **Assumption:** Let's assume for a moment that such a program, `P`, *does* exist. This program `P` would be able to calculate and return the value of `def_superfast(10000)`.

    -   **Constructing a New Program:** If `P` exists, we could write a very simple new Python program, let's call it `Q`, that uses `P` to compute the value. For example, `Q`'s source code could be:
        `import P_module; print(P_module.run())`
        We can easily ensure the source code of this program `Q` is less than 10000 symbols long.

    -   **The Output of Program Q:** This program `Q` is a valid Python program, its length is less than 10000 symbols, and it returns an integer. The integer it returns is the result of `def_superfast(10000)`, which is defined as `Huge_int(10000) + 1`.

    -   **The Contradiction:** Now we have a paradox. By the very definition of `Huge_int(10000)`, it is the LARGEST integer that can be returned by any program shorter than 10000 symbols. Since our program `Q` is shorter than 10000 symbols, its output *must* be less than or equal to `Huge_int(10000)`.

    -   **The Impossible Equation:** This leads us to a clear mathematical contradiction. From our reasoning, we have two conflicting statements about the output of `Q`:
        1. Output(Q) = Huge_int(10000) + 1
        2. Output(Q) <= Huge_int(10000)

        If we combine these, we get the following impossible equation:
"""
    print(explanation)
    # The final equation with the numbers 10000 and 1, as requested.
    print("    Huge_int(10000) + 1 <= Huge_int(10000)")

    conclusion = """
This contradiction logically proves that our initial assumption must be false.

**Conclusion:**
Therefore, no program P that computes `def_superfast(10000)` can exist.
