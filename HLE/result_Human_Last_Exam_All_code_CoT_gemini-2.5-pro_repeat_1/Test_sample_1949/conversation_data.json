    "Here is a plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid:\n1.  First, create a list of major rivers that are mentioned in the epic poem. This requires knowledge of the text. Key rivers include the Nile, Danube, Euphrates, Rhine, Po (often identified with the mythical Eridanus), and the Tiber.\n2.  Next, find the approximate modern-day lengths of these real-world rivers.\n3.  Store this data, associating each river's name with its length.\n4.  Sort the rivers based on their length in descending order.\n5.  Finally, select and print the top three rivers from the sorted list to answer the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary containing rivers mentioned in the Aeneid\n    and their approximate lengths in kilometers. It then sorts them to find the\n    three longest and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of prominent rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their modern lengths in km.\n    # Mentions can be found throughout the text, notably on Aeneas's shield in Book VIII.\n    rivers_data = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Rhine\": 1233,\n        \"Po (Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Tiber\": 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the second element in each item tuple) in descending order.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    # Using a list to collect the names for the final answer format\n    final_answer_list = []\n    for river, length in top_three:\n        print(f\"- {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n        final_answer_list.append(river)\n\n    # The final answer is formatted as requested at the end.\n    # Note: The problem asks for the *names* of the rivers.\n    print(f\"\\n<<<The three longest rivers are the {final_answer_list[0]}, {final_answer_list[1]}, and {final_answer_list[2]}.>>>\")\n\nfind_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
