    # For A: A geodesic for a torsion element is not a quasigeodesic, hence not fully quasireduced.
    # For B: A rational set K can consist entirely of torsion elements, for which no fully quasireduced word exists.
    # For C: A context-free set K can contain a torsion element, which is not a "quasigeodesic element".
