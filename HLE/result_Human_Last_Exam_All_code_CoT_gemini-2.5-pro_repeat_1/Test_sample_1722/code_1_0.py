def solve_pomdp_memory_problem():
    """
    This function solves for the minimum hallway length 'n'.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the minimum length 'n' of two distinct binary sequences
    that cannot be distinguished by any 2-state deterministic finite automaton (DFA) but can be
    distinguished by at least one 3-state DFA.

    This is a known problem in algebraic automata theory. The minimum length for such a pair of
    sequences is 5.

    An example of such a pair of sequences of length 5 is:
    omega_1 = "00110"
    omega_2 = "01010"

    One can verify (by testing all 16 possible 2-state DFAs) that these two sequences
    always lead to the same final state. However, it's possible to construct a 3-state
    DFA for which they lead to different final states, allowing an agent with a 3-state
    memory to gain more reward.

    For lengths n < 5, any pair of distinct sequences can be distinguished by a 2-state DFA.
    Therefore, the minimum length 'n' where a 3-state memory offers an advantage over a
    2-state memory (which is no better than a 1-state memory) is 5.
