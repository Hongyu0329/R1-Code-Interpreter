    "My plan is to solve this question by encoding the fundamental techniques of each dance style into a data structure. The core distinction relevant to the question is between \"swing\" dances (like Waltz and Foxtrot) and \"non-swing\" or \"staccato\" dances.\n\n1.  **Data Representation:** I will create a Python dictionary to store information about each dance option. Each entry will contain the dance name and its core technique ('Swing' or 'Staccato').\n2.  **Logic:** The script will iterate through this data. In swing dances, the body's momentum and continuous, flowing movement (swing) can be exaggerated to \"overturn\" a figure. This is a common part of choreography. In a staccato dance, movement is sharp and executed without swing or rise and fall. A turn is a precise, measured action, often a swivel on the foot. Attempting to add more rotation in the manner of a swing dance would fundamentally violate the core staccato technique.\n3.  **Equation and Output:** To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation,\" I will assign a numerical value: `1` for techniques compatible with overturning (Swing) and `0` for techniques incompatible with it (Staccato). The code will find the dance where this \"compatibility score\" is `0` and print the step-by-step analysis, followed by the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes dance techniques to determine where overturning a reverse turn\n    is fundamentally against the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    dances = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Viennese Waltz', 'technique': 'Swing'},\n        'B': {'name': 'English Waltz', 'technique': 'Swing'},\n        'C': {'name': 'European Tango', 'technique': 'Staccato'},\n        'D': {'name': 'Slow Foxtrott', 'technique': 'Swing'},\n        'E': {'name': 'Quickstep', 'technique': 'Swing'}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing dance techniques to find which one is incompatible with overturning a turn.\")\n    print(\"Let's define a 'Compatibility Score for Overturning':\")\n    print(\"Swing Technique = Score of 1 (Overturning is possible via body swing)\")\n    print(\"Staccato Technique = Score of 0 (Overturning breaks the core technique)\\n\")\n\n    correct_answer = None\n    final_explanation = \"\"\n\n    for choice, properties in dances.items():\n        name = properties['name']\n        technique = properties['technique']\n        \n        # This represents the \"equation\" part of the logic\n        if technique == 'Swing':\n            compatibility_score = 1\n        else:\n            compatibility_score = 0\n            \n        print(f\"Equation for choice {choice}: {name} -> Technique: {technique} -> Compatibility Score = {compatibility_score}\")\n\n        if compatibility_score == 0:\n            correct_answer = choice\n            final_explanation = (\n                f\"\\nConclusion: The {name} is the correct answer. \"\n                \"Its technique is staccato, with no body swing or rise and fall. \"\n                \"Turns are sharp, controlled actions.
