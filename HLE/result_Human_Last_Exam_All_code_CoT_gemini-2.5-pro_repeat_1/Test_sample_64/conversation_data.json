    "My plan is to use a Python script to find the standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」. To do this, I will create a small, simulated dictionary within the script. This dictionary will hold pitch accent information for a few Japanese words, including 「弟」. The script will then look up the word and print its corresponding pitch accent pattern.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up a word in a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small dictionary mapping words to their readings and accent patterns.\n    # Pattern Notations:\n    # [0] -> Heiban (平板): Starts low, rises, and stays high. L-H-H-H...\n    # [1] -> Atamadaka (頭高): High on the first mora, then drops. H-L-L-L...\n    # [n] -> Nakadaka (中高): Rise and fall are within the word.
