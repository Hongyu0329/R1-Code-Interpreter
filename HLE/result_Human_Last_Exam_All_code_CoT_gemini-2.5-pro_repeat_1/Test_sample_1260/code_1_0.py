    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the phenomenon and its universality.
    # The observation describes asymmetric price impact: buy orders have a larger positive
    # impact on future prices than sell orders have a negative impact.
    # This is a well-documented phenomenon in financial markets worldwide, not just in Shenzhen.
    # The reasons are fundamental to market structure:
    # 1. Short-sale constraints make it harder/riskier to act on negative information.
    # 2. The pool of sellers includes liquidity-driven traders who are less price-sensitive,
    #    diluting the average information content of sell orders.
    # Therefore, the phenomenon should be observable in Shanghai, Nasdaq, and Hong Kong as well.
    # This points to a "Yes, Yes, Yes" answer for the first part.

    first_part_answer = "Yes, Yes, Yes"

    # Step 3: Evaluate the potential reasons for the "Yes, Yes, Yes" case.
    # - A. Nature of 15s return definition: Incorrect. The definition is symmetric.
    # - C. Information asymmetry: A valid component, but part of a larger picture.
    # - D/K. Momentum effect: Describes the price movement but doesn't explain the asymmetry itself.
    # - G. Orderbook imbalance: A symptom or proximate cause, not the fundamental reason for asymmetry.
    # - H. Investor sentiment: A general market bias, but the effect is about the differential impact of trades.
    # - L. Motivation of buyers and sellers are different: This is the most comprehensive reason.
    #   It encapsulates the effects of short-sale constraints, different risk profiles, and the
    #   mix of informed vs. liquidity-driven traders on the sell-side. It provides the best
    #   fundamental explanation for the observed asymmetry.

    1.  The described phenomenon, where buy orders have a greater price impact than sell orders, is a general characteristic of financial markets, known as asymmetric price impact. It is not unique to Shenzhen. Therefore, one would expect to see similar scenarios in the Shanghai, Nasdaq, and Hong Kong stock exchanges. This confirms the '{first_part_answer}' part of the answer.

    2.  The most fundamental reason for this asymmetry is that the aggregate motivations and constraints for buyers are different from those for sellers. Buyers are typically motivated by a belief the price will rise. Sellers are a more mixed group, including those who believe the price will fall, those taking profits, and those who need liquidity. Furthermore, regulations and risks associated with short-selling place greater constraints on sellers acting on negative information than on buyers acting on positive information.

    3.  This makes 'Motivation of buyers and sellers are different' the most complete and probable explanation among the choices.
