    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we need to analyze the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime outside a non-rotating, uncharged, spherically symmetric mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **Use Symbolic Computation:** We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the calculations symbolically. This avoids tedious manual algebra and potential errors.\n3.  **Define the Metric Tensor:** We'll define the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. For simplicity, we'll use natural units where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1.\n4.  **Calculate Christoffel Symbols:** The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ are calculated from the metric tensor and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n5.  **Count and Display Results:** The script will compute all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ Christoffel symbols. It will then filter out the ones that are zero, print each non-zero symbol with its indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ and its value, and finally output the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and the mass parameter M.
