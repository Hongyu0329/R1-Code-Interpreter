    "My plan is to determine the location of Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death by cross-referencing key historical dates and facts.\n\n1.  **Establish the date of death:** First, I will find the year Blanche of Lancaster died.\n2.  **Determine Chaucer's status:** Next, I will research Geoffrey Chaucer's known occupation and general location during that specific year.\n3.  **Connect the evidence:** I will look for specific evidence, such as his writings, that connect him to the event and confirm his location.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Finally, I will put these facts together to logically deduce the answer and present it through a Python script that explains the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes historical facts to determine where Geoffrey Chaucer\n    was when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the date and location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    year_of_death = 1368\n    location_of_death = \"England\"\n    print(f\"Fact 1: Blanche of Lancaster died in September {year_of_death} in {location_of_death}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Chaucer's known status at that time.\n    chaucer_status_year = 1367\n    print(f\"Fact 2: By the year {chaucer_status_year}, Geoffrey Chaucer was serving in the English royal court as an esquire.\")\n    print(\"This position required his presence in England unless he was on a specific, documented mission abroad.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Connect Chaucer to the event through his work.\n    print(\"Evidence: Following her death, Chaucer wrote 'The Book of the Duchess', an elegy and tribute to Blanche.\")\n    print(\"This poem was likely commissioned by her husband, John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's patron.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Synthesize the facts to reach a conclusion.\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The combination of Chaucer's role in the English court and his composition of a major poem about the event strongly indicates he was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\n    print(\"There is no historical record of him being abroad in that specific year.\")\n\nsolve_historical_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
