    # Hidi and Renninger's Four-Phase Interest Model describes how interest develops.
    # The key is to identify the phase where external support has the greatest
    # long-term impact on turning temporary interest into a lasting, individual one.

    reasoning = """
The Four Phases of Interest Development are:
1. Triggered Situational Interest: A fleeting spark. The student is mostly passive.
2. Maintained Situational Interest: Interest is held by external factors (e.g., a fun project).
3. Emerging Individual Interest: A critical transition where the student begins to self-initiate, valuing the topic personally but still needing support and guidance.
4. Well-Developed Individual Interest: The student is self-motivated and pursues the interest independently.

The intervention is 'concrete feedback that emphasizes immediate next steps'.

Let's evaluate the impact on each phase:
- For a student in phase 1 or 2, the interest is still primarily dependent on the situation. While feedback helps, it doesn't necessarily build the internal drive required for long-term development.
- For a student in phase 4, they are already self-directed. Feedback is useful for refinement, but their interest is already well-established.
- For a student in phase 3 (Emerging Individual Interest), they are at a crucial tipping point. They have the desire to engage but may lack the skills or confidence to proceed alone. Concrete, actionable feedback provides the exact scaffolding they need to experience success, build competence, and feel empowered. This success directly fuels the transition from situational to a lasting individual interest.

Therefore, this type of feedback has the most significant *long-term impact* on a student with an emerging individual interest.
