    "This is a fascinating problem in historical linguistics. To trace the PIE form `*seh₂giéti` through the Germanic languages, we need to apply a series of well-established sound laws.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic:** I will apply the rules for laryngeal consonants, the Germanic vowel shift (`*ā` > `*ō`), Grimm's Law (`*g` > `*k`), and the evolution of the PIE verb endings into Proto-Germanic.\n2.  **Proto-Germanic to Old Norse:** I will show the effects of i-umlaut (`*ō` > `œ`) and the development of the Proto-Germanic verb ending into its Old Norse equivalent.\n3.  **Proto-Germanic to Old English:** This involves applying i-umlaut (`*ō` > `*ē`), the palatalization of velar consonants (`*k` > `c` /tʃ/), and the evolution of the verb ending into Old English.\n4.  **Proto-Germanic to Old High German:** Here, I will apply vowel breaking (`*ō` > `uo`) and the High German Consonant Shift (`*k` > `hh`, `*þ` > `d`), along with the changes to the verb ending.\n\nThe Python script below will walk through these steps and print the resulting word for each language.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a PIE word through Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English,\n    and Old High German, explaining the sound changes at each step.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂giéti\"\n    \n    print(f\"Tracing the development of PIE '{pie_form}' ('(s)he seeks/tracks').\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Proto-Germanic\n    print(\"--- 1. Proto-Germanic ---\")\n    print(\"a. The root is *seh₂g-. The laryngeal *h₂ causes the preceding *e to become *a, giving *sāg-.\")\n    print(\"b. In Proto-Germanic, PIE long *ā regularly becomes *ō. The root is now *sōg-.\")\n    print(\"c. By Grimm's Law, the PIE voiced stop *g becomes a voiceless stop *k.

Old English (from PGmc *sōkiþi) ---\")\n    print(\"a. 'i-umlaut' also occurs here, fronting the root vowel *ō to ē.\")\n    print(\"b. The consonant *k is palatalized to /tʃ/ (written 'c') before a front vowel like the 'i' that followed.\")\n    print(\"c. The ending *-iþi becomes -eþ in Old English.\")\n    oe_form = \"sēceþ\"\n    print(f\"Result for Old English: {oe_form}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Old High German\n    print(\"--- 4. Old High German (from PGmc *sōkiþi) ---\")\n    print(\"a. The root vowel *ō 'breaks' into the diphthong 'uo'.\")\n    print(\"b. The High German Consonant Shift changes *k to the fricative 'hh' (often written 'h') and *þ to 'd'.\")\n    print(\"c. The ending evolves into -it. Combining these gives *suohh-id-it -> suohhit.\")\n    ohg_form = \"suohit\"\n    print(f\"Result for Old High German: {ohg_form}\\n\")\n\n    # Final Summary\n    final_answer = (f\"Proto-Germanic: {pgmc_form}, Old Norse: {on_form}, \"\n                    f\"Old English: {oe_form}, Old High German: {ohg_form}\")\n    \n    # The final answer is wrapped according to the format requirements.\n    print(\"--- FINAL SUMMARY ---\")\n    print(final_answer)\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function\ntrace_etymology()\n```"
