    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are brought together to form a single larger system without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. By connecting them laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, we are effectively creating a single, larger system. The Chern number of this new system (the junction) will be the sum of the Chern numbers of its parts.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_junction_chern_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Chern number of a junction formed by two Chern insulators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Chern number of the first insulator\n    c1 = 1\n    \n    # Chern number of the second insulator\n    c2 = 1\n    \n    # The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n    c_total = c1 + c2\n    \n    print(\"The Chern number of a junction of two topological insulators is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\")\n    print(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {c1}\")\n    print(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {c2}\")\n    print(\"The total Chern number (C_total) of the junction is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\n    # Outputting each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final Chern number is: {c_total}\")\n\ncalculate_junction_chern_number()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
