    Solves the geometric point placement problem through logical deduction.

    Let N_R, N_G, N_Y be the number of red, green, and yellow points.
    Let S_R, S_G, S_Y be the sets of points of each color.

    The problem states three conditions:
    1. In any triangle formed by three red points, there is at least one green point. (We'll call this P(R,G))
    2. In any triangle formed by three green points, there is at least one yellow point. (P(G,Y))
    3. In any triangle formed by three yellow points, there is at least one red point. (P(Y,R))

    The problem also states that no three points are collinear.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the geometric meaning of the conditions.
    # A crucial geometric lemma states: If a set of points A (with at least 3 points)
    # has the property that any triangle formed by its points contains at least one point from set B,
    # then every point in A must lie in the strict interior of the convex hull of B.
    # For the interior of the convex hull of B to be non-empty, B must have at least 3 points.

    # Step 2: Build a chain of logical implications.
    # From the lemma, condition P(R,G) ("any red triangle contains a green point") implies that
    # if the number of red points (N_R) is 3 or more, then the number of green points (N_G) must also be 3 or more.
    # So, (N_R >= 3) implies (N_G >= 3).
    #
    # Applying this logic to all three conditions gives us a cycle of implications:
    # (N_R >= 3) => (N_G >= 3)
    # (N_G >= 3) => (N_Y >= 3)
    # (N_Y >= 3) => (N_R >= 3)
    #
    # This means the statements (N_R >= 3), (N_G >= 3), and (N_Y >= 3) must either all be true, or all be false.

    # Step 3: Test the "all true" case.
    # Let's assume N_R, N_G, and N_Y are all 3 or greater. The lemma implies:
    # a) All red points are in the interior of the convex hull of green points: S_R ⊂ int(CH(S_G)).
    # b) All green points are in the interior of the convex hull of yellow points: S_G ⊂ int(CH(S_Y)).
    # c) All yellow points are in the interior of the convex hull of red points: S_Y ⊂ int(CH(S_R)).
    #
    # From these inclusions, the convex hulls themselves must be nested:
    # CH(S_R) ⊂ CH(S_G) ⊂ CH(S_Y) ⊂ CH(S_R).
    #
    # This leads to a contradiction. For example, considering the areas of the convex hulls, we would have:
    # Area(CH(S_R)) < Area(CH(S_G)) < Area(CH(S_Y)) < Area(CH(S_R)).
    # A value cannot be strictly less than itself. Thus, this case is impossible.

    # Step 4: Conclude the "all false" case must be true.
    # Since the "all true" case is impossible, the only alternative is that the statements are all false.
    # This means:
    # N_R is NOT >= 3  =>  N_R <= 2
    # N_G is NOT >= 3  =>  N_G <= 2
    # N_Y is NOT >= 3  =>  N_Y <= 2

    # Step 5: Calculate the maximum value of n.
    # We have found the maximum number of points for each color.
    max_R = 2
    max_G = 2
    max_Y = 2

    # The maximum total number of points, n, is the sum.
    n_max = max_R + max_G + max_Y

    # This configuration is valid. If we have at most 2 points of any given color,
    # no triangles of that color can be formed. Therefore, all three conditions
    # in the problem are vacuously satisfied. We just need to place 6 points on a
    # plane such that no three are collinear, which is easily achievable.

    print("The maximum number of green points (N_G) is {}.".format(max_G))
    print("The maximum number of yellow points (N_Y) is {}.".format(max_Y))
