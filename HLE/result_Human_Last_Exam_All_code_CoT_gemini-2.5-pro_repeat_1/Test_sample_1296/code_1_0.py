  # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  # G acting quasiprimitively on F implies its socle N is transitive on F.
  # The number of faces of the quotient D_N is the number of orbits of N on F.
  # Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit. Thus, D_N has one face.
  # So, D_N is unicellular. The condition on G/N is not even necessary.
  answer_a = "Yes"
  
  # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group.
  # The "smooth covering" property imposes strong conditions on the group G.
  # It is known that groups of type HA and AS can satisfy these conditions.
  # However, a theorem by Jones, Singerman, and Woldar shows that non-trivial
  # standard wreath products (type TW) cannot satisfy the smooth covering condition.
  answer_b = "HA, AS"

  # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
  # This follows directly from the reasoning for part (b). The theorem ruling out
  # type TW applies for any l > 1. The condition l <= 5 (and l>1) falls under this theorem.
  answer_c = "True"
