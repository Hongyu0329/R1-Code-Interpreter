# Let k be the number of r-vertices in (0,1).
# Let m be the integer from the valency definition.

# From the analysis of the function's structure on the real line, a minimal
# configuration to accommodate k poles in (0,1) is having q-vertices
# at the boundaries (x=0 and x=1) and p-vertices between the poles.
# This configuration leads to k-1 p-vertices in (0,1).
# Let's assume the q-vertices at 0 and 1 are simple preimages of 1.
# Let's also assume there are no other special vertices on the real line
# outside [0,1] except for a pole at infinity, and no non-real special vertices.

# N0 is the total order of zeros of phi.
# N1 is the total order of preimages of 1.
# The p-vertices in (0,1) have order m. There are k-1 of them.
# So, N0 = (k-1)*m
# The q-vertices are at 0 and 1, assumed to be simple.
# So, N1 = 1 + 1 = 2
# For a rational function, N0 must equal N1.
# So we get the equation: (k-1)*m = 2
