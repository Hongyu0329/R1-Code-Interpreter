# Step 1: Define the problem based on the analysis.
# We need to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + x - 1 = 0, where x = |α|².
# The coefficients for the quadratic formula ax^2 + bx + c = 0 are:
a = 1
b = 1
c = -1

# Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.
# x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
# Since x must be a probability, it must be non-negative, so we take the positive root.
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
alpha_sq = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

# Step 3: Print the reasoning and the result.
# The final output needs to show each number in the final equation.
