    "This is a knowledge-based question that cannot be solved with a calculation. The best approach is to directly provide the answer. I will write a simple Python script to store the names of the two Nobel laureates and print them in a sentence.\n\n```python\n# The two individuals in question are Paul Krugman and Robert C. Merton.\n# Paul Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n# Robert C. Merton won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997.\n# The commercial aired around the year 2000.\n\nlaureate1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate2 = \"Robert C. Merton\"\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were {laureate1} and {laureate2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Robert C. Merton>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
