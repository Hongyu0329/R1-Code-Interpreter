    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a specific interval within the 1D box. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`.\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position `x` is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a)`.\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability of finding the particle in the interval from `x1` to `x2` is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a) dx`.\n4.  **Substitute Values:** We are given `n = 2`, `x1 = 0.495a`, and `x2 = 0.505a`. The integral becomes:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2*π*x/a) dx`.\n5.  **Solve Numerically:** This integral can be solved analytically, but it's much simpler and less error-prone to solve it numerically using Python. We will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is a high-precision numerical integration tool. We can set `a=1` for the calculation, as the length unit will cancel out.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    within a specified interval for a given quantum state n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    # Quantum state\n    n = 2\n    # Length of the box.
