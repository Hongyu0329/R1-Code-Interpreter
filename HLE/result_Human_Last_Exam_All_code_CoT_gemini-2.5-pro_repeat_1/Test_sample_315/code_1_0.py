    # 1. Key physical principles
    principle_1 = "Optical Activity: D-glucose is a chiral molecule and rotates the plane of polarized light."
    principle_2 = "Optical Rotatory Dispersion (ORD): The angle of rotation is wavelength-dependent. Blue light rotates more than red light over the same distance."
    principle_3 = "Polarization-Dependent Scattering: Light is scattered towards a side-viewer most intensely when its polarization plane is oriented correctly relative to the viewer."

    # 2. Chain of events
    event_1 = "As polarized white light travels down the tube, the polarization plane for each color rotates at a different rate."
    event_2 = "This means at any distance 'z' into the tube, the polarization planes of the different colors are fanned out at different angles."
    event_3 = "An observer at the side sees the color that is most effectively scattered towards them. This depends on the polarization angle."
    event_4 = "The specific color that appears brightest depends on both the distance 'z' down the tube and the viewing angle 'phi' around the tube."

    # 3. The resulting pattern
    # The condition for a color to be at maximum brightness for a given viewing angle traces a spiral.
    # The relationship is phi = k * z, where 'phi' is the viewing angle, 'z' is the distance,
    # and 'k' is a constant that depends on the color (wavelength) and glucose concentration.
    # This equation, phi = k*z, is the mathematical description of a helix or spiral.
    conclusion = "The combination of these effects creates a visible rainbow gradient that progresses in a spiral along the tube."
