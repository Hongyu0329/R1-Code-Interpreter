    This function explains the reasoning to find the value of alpha.

    The problem asks for the asymptotic growth rate d_n = Theta(n^alpha)
    for the minimum degree d_n of a polynomial p_n satisfying certain conditions.

    Let S1 = {1, 2, ..., n^2} and S2 = {n^2+1, ..., n^10}.
    p_n(i) is in [0, 1] for i in S1.
    p_n(i) is in [2, 3] for i in S2.

    We can find a lower bound for the degree d_n by analyzing the necessary growth of the polynomial
    between the sets S1 and S2. This is done by using polynomial growth inequalities.

    Let's consider the constraint imposed by the behavior on S2 on the values at S1.
    1. Define a normalized polynomial q(x) = 2 * (p_n(x) - 2.5).
    2. For i in S2, p_n(i) is in [2, 3], so q(i) is in [-1, 1].
    3. The set S2 contains N2 = n^10 - n^2 points.
    4. A polynomial of degree d, bounded by 1 on N consecutive integers, has limited growth outside this set.
       At a distance of 1 from the set S2 (at point x=n^2), the value is bounded:
       |q(n^2)| <= T_d( -1 - 2/(N2-1) )
       where T_d is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree d.
    5. For large n and d, |T_d(-1-eps)| is approximately 0.5 * exp(d * sqrt(2*eps)).
       Here, eps = 2/(N2-1) which is approximately 2/n^10.
       So, |q(n^2)| <= 0.5 * exp(d_n * sqrt(4/n^10)) = 0.5 * exp(2*d_n / n^5).
    6. From the problem statement, for x=n^2 in S1, p_n(n^2) is in [0, 1].
       This implies q(n^2) = 2 * (p_n(n^2) - 2.5) is in [-5, -3].
       Therefore, |q(n^2)| must be at least 3.
    7. Combining these, we get: 3 <= 0.5 * exp(2*d_n / n^5).
    8. Solving for d_n gives: log(6) <= 2*d_n / n^5, which means d_n >= (log(6)/2) * n^5.
    9. This implies d_n = Omega(n^5), so alpha must be at least 5.

    A similar analysis starting from the set S1 gives d_n = Omega(n^1), which is a weaker condition.
    The most restrictive condition determines the asymptotic behavior.
    It can also be shown that a polynomial of degree O(n^5) can be constructed.
    Therefore, the tight asymptotic growth rate is Theta(n^5).
