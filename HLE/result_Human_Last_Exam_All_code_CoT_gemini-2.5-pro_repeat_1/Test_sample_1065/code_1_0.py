def calculate_center_of_mass():
    """
    This function calculates the dimensionless coordinates of the center of mass
    of the candy string based on the physical model derived from the problem statement.

    The model consists of two parts:
    1. A circular arc of radius R on the sphere, from the top (pole) to the equator.
       Its length is L1 = pi * R / 2.
    2. A vertical segment of length R hanging from the equator, which provides the
       tension to keep the arc in equilibrium. Its length is L2 = R.

    We calculate the center of mass (y_cm, z_cm) in a 2D plane, with y as the
    horizontal axis and z as the vertical axis. The origin is at the center of the sphere.
    The final output provides the dimensionless coordinates y_cm/R and z_cm/R.
