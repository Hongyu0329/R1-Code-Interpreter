    "To find the small molecules that interact with the target `CHEMBL4803817`, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Install necessary library**: First, ensure the `chembl_webresource_client` library is installed. This library allows programmatic access to the ChEMBL database.\n2.  **Connect to ChEMBL**: I will write a Python script to connect to the ChEMBL database.\n3.  **Query for Activities**: The script will query the bioactivity data associated with the target `CHEMBL4803817`.\n4.  **Filter Results**: I will filter the results to only include interactions involving 'Small molecule' types and where a standard activity value (like IC50, Ki, etc.) is recorded.\n5.  **Print Interacting Molecules**: The script will then print the ChEMBL IDs of the small molecules found to interact with the target.\n\n```python\n# First, you may need to install the ChEMBL web resource client\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Get the target resource\n        target = new_client.target\n        # Get the activity resource\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        print(f\"Searching for small molecule interactions with target: {target_chembl_id}\\n\")\n\n        # Query for activities related to the target\n        activities = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=target_chembl_id).only(\n            ['molecule_chembl_id', 'molecule_type', 'standard_type', 'standard_value', 'standard_units']\n        )\n\n        interacting_molecules = set()\n        for act in activities:\n            # Filter for small molecules with a standard activity value\n            if act['molecule_type'] == 'Small molecule' and act['standard_value'] is not None:\n                interacting_molecules.add(act['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        if interacting_molecules:\n            print(f\"Found {len(interacting_molecules)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_chembl_id}:\")\n            for molecule_id in sorted(list(interacting_molecules)):\n                print(molecule_id)\n        else:\n            print(f\"No small molecule interactions with a standard value were found for {target_chembl_id}.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the ChEMBL ID is correct and you have an internet connection.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_id)\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
