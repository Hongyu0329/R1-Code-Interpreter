# The task is to determine the number of 13C-labeled CO2 molecules
# released when 1,4-13C glucose undergoes the glycolysis pathway.

# Step 1: Analyze the net reaction of glycolysis.
# Glycolysis is the metabolic process that converts one 6-carbon glucose molecule
# into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. The key point is that there is no
# loss of carbon atoms during this process.
# The net chemical reaction for glycolysis is:
# C6H12O6 (Glucose) -> 2 C3H3O3- (Pyruvate) + other products (ATP, NADH)
# As the equation shows, CO2 is not a product of glycolysis.

# Step 2: Set up the calculation based on the stoichiometry of the pathway.
# We are starting with one molecule of glucose.
num_glucose_molecules = 1

# The number of CO2 molecules released per molecule of glucose *during glycolysis* is 0.
# The release of CO2 happens in later stages of cellular respiration, like the
# Krebs cycle, but not in glycolysis itself.
co2_released_per_glucose_in_glycolysis = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of labeled CO2 molecules released.
# Since the total number of CO2 molecules released is zero, the number of
# 13C-labeled CO2 molecules must also be zero, regardless of where the
# glucose was labeled.
total_labeled_co2 = num_glucose_molecules * co2_released_per_glucose_in_glycolysis

# Step 4: Print the final answer, showing the equation as requested.
