    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find the missing intermediate state in a three-step sequence of an elementary cellular automaton (ECA). The same rule must apply to both the first step (initial to intermediate) and the second step (intermediate to final).\n\n2.  **Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA):** An ECA evolves a line of cells (0s and 1s). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its own state and the state of its left and right neighbors. This 3-cell neighborhood has 2Â³ = 8 possible patterns (from '111' to '000'). An ECA is defined by a \"rule\", which is a number from 0 to 255. The 8-bit binary representation of this rule number specifies the output (0 or 1) for each of the 8 patterns.\n\n3.  **Strategy (Brute-Force):** Since there are only 256 possible rules, we can simply test each one. This approach is computationally fast and guaranteed to find the solution.\n\n4.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   Iterate through every rule from 0 to 255.\n    *   For each rule:\n        a.  Apply the rule to the given initial state (`01101001`) to generate a candidate intermediate state. We will assume periodic boundary conditions, where the grid wraps around (the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and vice-versa).\n        b.  Apply the *same rule* to this candidate intermediate state to generate a calculated final state.\n        c.  Compare the calculated final state with the given final state (`10000111`).\n    *   If they match, we have found the correct rule and the unique intermediate state. The program will print this intermediate state.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton sequence\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_state = \"01101001\"\n    final_state = \"10000111\"\n\n    def get_next_generation(state, rule_number):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the next generation of a 1D cellular automaton state\n        for a given rule, assuming periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Convert rule number to its 8-bit binary representation.\n        # This string maps outcomes to neighborhoods from '111' down to '000'.\n        rule_bits = format(rule_number, '08b')\n        \n        # Create a mapping from neighborhood patterns to outcomes\n        neighborhoods = {\n            \"111\": rule_bits[0], \"110\": rule_bits[1], \"101\": rule_bits[2],\n            \"100\": rule_bits[3], \"011\": rule_bits[4], \"010\": rule_bits[5],\n            \"001\": rule_bits[6], \"000\": rule_bits[7]\n        }\n        \n        n = len(state)\n        next_state = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get the 3-cell neighborhood, wrapping around at the edges\n            left = state[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = state[i]\n            right = state[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            pattern = f\"{left}{center}{right}\"\n            \n            # Append the corresponding outcome to the next state\n            next_state.append(neighborhoods[pattern])\n            \n        return \"\".join(next_state)\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible ECA rules\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # Step 1: initial_state -> intermediate_state\n        intermediate_state = get_next_generation(initial_state, rule)\n        \n        # Step 2: intermediate_state -> calculated_final_state\n        calculated_final_state = get_next_generation(intermediate_state, rule)\n        \n        # Check if we found the sequence that matches the given final state\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state:\n            # Print the solution for the intermediate step\n            print(intermediate_state)\n            return\n\n# Execute the solver\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n```\n<<<01011010>>>"
