    This function solves the topology problem and prints the answer.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T on a set X can have,
    where |X| = c (the cardinality of the continuum) and T is neither trivial nor discrete.
    
    The solution relies on a known theorem in set-theoretic topology.
    """
    
    # The cardinality of the set X is c, the continuum.
    # A topology S is a complement to T if T U S generates the discrete topology
    # and T intersect S is the trivial topology.
    
    # A result by V. I. Malyhin in set-theoretic topology states that for an infinite set X,
    # if a non-trivial, non-discrete topology T on X has at least one complement,
    # then the number of complements of T is at least 2^|X|.
    
    # Furthermore, it is possible to construct a topology T that has exactly 2^|X| complements.
    # Therefore, the minimum possible number of complements is 2^|X|.
    
    # In this problem, the cardinality of the set X is given as c.
    # So, the smallest possible number of complements is 2^c.
    
    # The final equation is: N = 2^c
    # We will print the components of this equation.
