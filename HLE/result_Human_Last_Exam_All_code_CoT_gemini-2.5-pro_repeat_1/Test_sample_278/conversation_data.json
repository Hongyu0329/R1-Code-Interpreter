    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the parametric curve:** The curve is defined in two pieces. I will analyze each piece to determine its range of x and y coordinates.\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is $x = \\cos(t), y = \\sin(t)$, which is the upper half of a unit circle.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is $x = \\cos(t), y = 5\\sin(t)$, which is the lower half of an ellipse.\n2.  **Find the bounding box:** I will combine the ranges from both pieces to find the overall minimum and maximum values for x and y. This defines the smallest rectangle that contains the entire figure.\n    *   `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`.\n3.  **Determine the dimensions of the enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that encloses the figure must be equal to the larger of the figure's width (`max_x - min_x`) and height (`max_y - min_y`).\n4.  **Calculate the area:** The area of the square is the square of its side length.\n5.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will implement these steps to calculate the final area and print the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For t in [0, pi], x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\n    # The range of cos(t) for t in [0, pi] is [-1, 1].\n    # The range of sin(t) for t in [0, pi] is [0, 1].\n    min_x_part1 = -1.0\n    max_x_part1 = 1.0\n    min_y_part1 = 0.0\n    max_y_part1 = 1.0\n\n    # For t in (pi, 2pi), x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\n    # The range of cos(t) for t in (pi, 2pi) is [-1, 1].\n    # The range of sin(t) for t in (pi, 2pi) is [-1, 0), so y is in [-5, 0).\n    min_x_part2 = -1.0\n    max_x_part2 = 1.0\n    min_y_part2 = -5.0\n    max_y_part2 = 0.0\n\n    # Overall range for the entire figure\n    min_x = min(min_x_part1, min_x_part2)\n    max_x = max(max_x_part1, max_x_part2)\n    min_y = min(min_y_part1, min_y_part2)\n    max_y = max(max_y_part1, max_y_part2)\n\n    # Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box\n    width = max_x - min_x\n    height = max_y - min_y\n\n    # The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    # The area of the square\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    print(f\"The range for x is [{min_x}, {max_x}].\")\n    print(f\"The range for y is [{min_y}, {max_y}].\")\n    print(f\"The width of the figure is {max_x} - ({min_x}) = {width}.\")\n    print(f\"The height of the figure is {max_y} - ({min_y}) = {height}.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n    print(\"The area of the square is side * side.\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\nsolve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
