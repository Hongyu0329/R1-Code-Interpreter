    "This is a multi-step riddle. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Haiku for Numbers:** I'll read through the haiku line by line to extract all the numerical clues.\n    *   \"An August tempest\": \"August\" is the 8th month of the year, giving us the number 8. The word \"tempest\" hints at a force of subtraction or turmoil.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\": This is a direct calculation, `2 * 15`, which equals 30.\n    *   \"A divine one yields\": This clearly indicates the number 1. The word \"yields\" suggests giving something up, reinforcing the idea of subtraction.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** Based on the clues, the words \"tempest\" and \"yields,\" and the title \"The Bays\" (which can be interpreted as indentations or removals), subtraction is the most likely operation. I will start with the largest number and subtract the others. The equation will be `30 - 8 - 1`.\n\n3.  **Solve the Riddle:**\n    *   I will calculate the result of the equation.\n    *   The result, `21`, corresponds to the 21st letter of the alphabet: `U`.\n    *   The title, \"The Bays,\" is a question. The shape of the letter `U` is a visual representation of a bay.\n    *   The final instruction, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\", confirms this. Another possible interpretation of the haiku could lead to the letter `W` (`30 + 1 - 8 = 23`), which also has bay-like shapes. However, `U` comes before `W` in the alphabet, making it the correct answer according to the prompt's rule.\n\n4.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the numbers from the haiku, performs the calculation, and prints the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# 1. Extract the numbers from the haiku.\n# \"Twice fifteen\"\nnum1 = 2 * 15\n# \"An August tempest\"\nnum2 = 8\n# \"A divine one\"\nnum3 = 1\n\n# 2. Formulate the equation and calculate the result.\n# The language suggests subtracting the smaller numbers from the largest.\nresult = num1 - num2 - num3\n\n# 3. Print the final equation, showing each number.\n# The result, 21, corresponds to the 21st letter of the alphabet, 'U',\n# which is shaped like a bay, answering the question in the title.\nprint(f\"The equation from the haiku is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} - {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<U>>>"
