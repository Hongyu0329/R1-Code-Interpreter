def find_greatest_negative_impact():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided meteorological data to find the single value
    that has the greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis.

    Based on the analysis, the environment is overwhelmingly favorable for tornadoes,
    with high CAPE, very high SRH, and strong shear. The most significant
    inhibiting factor is the high Downdraft CAPE (DCAPE).

    DCAPE represents the potential for a storm to create a strong, cold downdraft.
    This downdraft can spread out at the surface, cutting off the warm, moist inflow
    that is crucial for sustaining a low-level mesocyclone and a tornado.

    A DCAPE value of 994 J/kg is very high and represents a significant threat
    to the storm's ability to produce or maintain a tornado, despite the other
    favorable parameters.
