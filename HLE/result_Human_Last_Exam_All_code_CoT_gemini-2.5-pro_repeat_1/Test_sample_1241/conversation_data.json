    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stationary probabilities of the system as $t \\to +\\infty$. Let's denote $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** When the system reaches a steady state, the probabilities no longer change with time. This means all the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. The given system of differential equations then simplifies to a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Formulate the linear system:**\n    The equations for the stationary probabilities $p_i$ are:\n    $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    And the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n    $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:** I will solve this system by expressing $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n    *   From the first equation, we get an expression for $p_0$ in terms of $p_1$.\n    *   From the third equation, we get an expression for $p_2$ in terms of $p_1$.\n    *   From the fourth equation, we get an expression for $p_3$ in terms of $p_2$, which can then be related to $p_1$.\n\n4.  **Use the normalization condition:** Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation ($p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$). This will allow me to solve for the numerical value of $p_1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final result:** Once $p_1$ is found, I can calculate $p_0$. The final answer is the sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the values and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are 0.\n# Let p_i = P_i(+inf). We get a system of linear equations.\n# We solve it by expressing p0, p2, p3 in terms of p1.\n\n# From 0 = -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1  => p0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * p1\ncoeff_p0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# From 0 = lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 => p2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * p1\ncoeff_p2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n# From 0 = lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 => p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * p2\n# Substituting the expression for p2: p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_p2 * p1\ncoeff_p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_p2\n\n# Now use the normalization equation: p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# (coeff_p0 * p1) + p1 + (coeff_p2 * p1) + (coeff_p3 * p1) = 1\n# p1 * (coeff_p0 + 1 + coeff_p2 + coeff_p3) = 1\nsum_of_coeffs = coeff_p0 + 1 + coeff_p2 + coeff_p3\n\n# Solve for p1\np1 = 1 / sum_of_coeffs\n\n# Solve for p0\np0 = coeff_p0 * p1\n\n# The required sum is p0 + p1\nresult = p0 + p1\n\n# Print the final result in the requested format\nprint(\"The values of the stationary probabilities are:\")\nprint(f\"p0 = P0(+inf) = {p0}\")\nprint(f\"p1 = P1(+inf) = {p1}\")\np2 = coeff_p2 * p1\np3 = coeff_p3 * p1\nprint(f\"p2 = P2(+inf) = {p2}\")\nprint(f\"p3 = P3(+inf) = {p3}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
