# The user wants to identify the incorrect statement based on the provided text.
# Let's analyze the logic for each option.
#
# Text Summary:
# - Biotype CA (watermelon-adapted) thrives on a raffinose-rich diet. This implies CA has high galactosidase activity.
# - Biotype MA (cotton-adapted) thrives on a sucrose-only diet. This implies MA has low galactosidase activity.
# - Watermelon is inferred to be rich in raffinose.
# - Cotton is inferred to be rich in sucrose and low in raffinose.
#
# Evaluating the options:
# A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs (like raffinose) than MA biotypes.
#    - This is directly supported by their diet preferences. TRUE.
# B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
#    - The text says they "did well," which implies preference/adaptation. TRUE.
# C. Upon host transfer (CA to cotton), CA showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
#    - CA moves from a high-raffinose host (watermelon) to a low-raffinose host (cotton).
#    - A decrease in the substrate (raffinose) would lead to decreased activity of its specific enzyme (galactosidase). This is a direct and logical conclusion. TRUE.
# D. Upon host transfer (CA to cotton), CA showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
#    - The effect (decreased galactosidase activity) is correct.
#    - The cause ("owing to higher glucose levels") is questionable. The text never mentions glucose. While high glucose can inhibit other sugar metabolism (catabolite repression), the most direct cause based on the text is the lack of raffinose. This statement posits a cause not supported by the provided information. LIKELY NOT TRUE.
# E. Upon host transfer (MA to watermelon), MA showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
#    - MA moves from a low-raffinose host (cotton) to a high-raffinose host (watermelon).
#    - To adapt, it would need to increase its galactosidase activity to process the new food source. This is a logical adaptive response. TRUE.
#
# Conclusion: Statement D asserts a cause (glucose levels) that is not mentioned in or directly supported by the text, making it the statement that is "not true" in the context of the given information.

# Print the reasoning and the final answer.

print("A. True. The text states CA thrives on a raffinose-rich diet, unlike MA.")
print("B. True. The text states which diet each biotype 'did well' on, implying preference.")
print("C. True. When CA moves from a high-raffinose environment (watermelon) to a low-raffinose one (cotton), the enzyme for raffinose digestion (galactosidase) would naturally decrease in activity due to lack of substrate.")
print("D. Not True. While the effect (decreased galactosidase activity) is correct, the stated cause ('owing to higher glucose levels') is not supported by the text. The text focuses on the raffinose/sucrose difference, not glucose levels. The most direct cause is the lack of raffinose (as in option C), making this causal claim unsubstantiated by the context.")
print("E. True. When MA moves from a low-raffinose environment (cotton) to a high-raffinose one (watermelon), it would need to increase its galactosidase activity to adapt, which is a plausible biological response.")
print("\nThe statement that is not true, because its reasoning is not supported by the provided text, is D.")
