    # Step 1: Decompose h^1,1(M)
    # h^{1,1}(M) = h^{1,1}(Y) + N_blowup, where Y = (S x C) / g
    # h^{1,1}(Y) is the dimension of the g-invariant part of H^{1,1}(S x C).
    # By the KÃ¼nneth formula, H^{1,1}(S x C) is composed of parts from S and C.
    # The invariant part has dimension h^{1,1}(S)_+ + h^{1,1}(C)_+.
    # The involution psi on C is orientation-preserving, so it acts as +1 on H^{1,1}(C).
    # h^{1,1}(C) is 1-dimensional, so h^{1,1}(C)_+ = 1.
    # Therefore, h^{1,1}(Y) = h^{1,1}(S)_+ + 1.
    # We denote h^{1,1}(S)_+ as h11_plus.
    
    # Step 2: Determine h11_plus for the non-symplectic involution rho on K3 surface S.
    # The topological Lefschetz formula states e(Fix(rho)) = 2*h11_plus - 20.
    # The holomorphic Lefschetz formula implies that the fixed locus of rho must be a disjoint
    # union of elliptic curves (genus 1).
    # The Euler characteristic of an elliptic curve is 2 - 2*g = 2 - 2*1 = 0.
    # Thus, the Euler characteristic of the fixed locus, e(Fix(rho)), is 0.
    # 0 = 2 * h11_plus - 20
    h11_plus = 10
    
    # Now we can calculate h^{1,1}(Y)
    h11_Y = h11_plus + 1

    # Step 3: Maximize N_blowup = m * N_f
    # N_blowup is the number of components of the singular locus.
    # It equals m (number of components of Fix(rho)) times N_f (number of fixed points of psi).

    # 3a: Maximize N_f for the involution psi on the genus 2 curve C.
    # The Riemann-Hurwitz formula is 2*g(C) - 2 = 2 * (2*g(C/psi) - 2) + N_f.
    # For g(C)=2, this is 2 = 4*g(C/psi) - 4 + N_f, so N_f = 6 - 4*g(C/psi).
    # To maximize N_f, we must minimize the genus of the quotient, g(C/psi).
    # The minimum possible genus is g(C/psi) = 0.
    g_quotient = 0
    max_Nf = 6 - 4 * g_quotient

    # 3b: Maximize m, the number of components of Fix(rho).
    # Fix(rho) consists of m disjoint elliptic curves.
    # There is a constraint on the number of such curves related to h11_plus.
    # The result from algebraic geometry is that m <= h11_plus - 2.
    max_m = h11_plus - 2
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the maximal N_blowup
    max_N_blowup = max_m * max_Nf

    # Step 5: Calculate the final maximal h^{1,1}(M)
    max_h11_M = h11_Y + max_N_blowup

    # Output the final equation with all the calculated numbers
