    # The problem asks for the limit of a probability involving a random variable V_n.
    # V_n is the relative area of a disk B_n covered by the sausage of a conditioned Brownian motion.
    # The key is to determine the limiting behavior of V_n as n -> infinity.

    # 1. The process X_t is a complex Brownian motion conditioned to stay outside the unit disk.
    #    This conditioning introduces a radial outward drift, making the process transient.
    #    This means |X_t| -> infinity as t -> infinity, almost surely.

    # 2. V_n is defined as |B_n intersect Sausage| / |B_n|.
    #    As n -> infinity, the disk B_n moves to infinity. The value of V_n is expected
    #    to converge in probability to the asymptotic density of the sausage, let's call it delta.
    #    V_n -> delta (in probability).

    # 3. The asymptotic density delta is the probability that a point 'at infinity' is
    #    covered by the sausage. This is the limit of the probability that the process
    #    hits a unit disk centered at z, as |z| -> infinity.
    #    delta = lim_{|z|->inf} P(X_t hits D(z, 1)).

    # 4. Because the process is transient and moves towards infinity, it does not "fill up" the plane.
    #    The probability of hitting a small, fixed-size target D(z, 1) that is arbitrarily far away
    #    is zero. The process is 'thinned out' as it expands, so its path becomes increasingly
    #    sparse at large distances.
    #    Therefore, the asymptotic density of the sausage is delta = 0.

    # 5. Since V_n converges in probability to 0, for any positive constant c (like 2/3),
    #    the probability P(V_n > c) must converge to 0.
    
    limit_value = 0
