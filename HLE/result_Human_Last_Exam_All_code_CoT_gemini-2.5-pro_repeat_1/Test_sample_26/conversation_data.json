    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n1.  **Understand the object**: $X$ is a smooth surface of degree 5 in complex projective 3-space, $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. It is a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n2.  **Strategy**: A powerful method to study the topology of such varieties is to view them as a fiber in a universal family. This involves studying an auxiliary space called the incidence variety.\n\n3.  **The Incidence Variety**: We define the incidence variety $E$ as the set of pairs $([s], p)$, where $[s]$ is a quintic hypersurface and $p$ is a point in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ such that $p$ lies on the hypersurface defined by $s$.\n    $E = \\{ ([s], p) \\in \\mathbb{P}(H^0(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(5))) \\times \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\mid s(p)=0 \\}$\n\n4.  **Fibration 1**: $E$ can be viewed as a fiber bundle over $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. For each point $p \\in \\mathbb{CP}^3$, the fiber above it is the space of all quintic hypersurfaces that pass through $p$. This is a hyperplane in the space of all quintics, $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(5)))$.\n\n5.  **Compute Dimensions**: First, we find the dimension of the space of all homogeneous quintic polynomials in 4 variables ($x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3$). This is the dimension of the vector space $H^0(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}(5))$, which is given by the formula $\\binom{n+d}{d}$ for degree $d$ hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$.\n    For our case, $n=3$ and $d=5$, so the dimension is $N = \\binom{3+5}{5} = \\binom{8}{5} = 56$.\n    The projective space of all quintics is $\\mathbb{P}^{N-1} = \\mathbb{P}^{55}$. The fiber of $E \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a hyperplane, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^{N-2} = \\mathbb{P}^{54}$.\n\n6.  **Use the Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy**: We use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $\\mathbb{P}^{54} \\to E \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$. The relevant part is:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_3(\\text{Fiber}) \\to \\pi_3(\\text{Total Space}) \\to \\pi_3(\\text{Base}) \\to \\dots $$\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{P}^{54}) \\to \\pi_3(E) \\to \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\dots $$\n\n7.  **Compute Homotopy Groups**: We need the third homotopy groups of the fiber and base spaces.\n    *   For any $m$, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^m) \\cong \\pi_3(S^{2m+1})$ for $m \\ge 2$.\n    *   For the base $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we have $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$.\n    *   For the fiber $\\mathbb{P}^{54}$, we have $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{P}^{54}) \\cong \\pi_3(S^{109}) = 0$.\n\n8.  **Determine $\\pi_3(E)$**: Substituting these into the exact sequence, we get:\n    $$ 0 \\to \\pi_3(E) \\to 0 $$\n    This implies that $\\pi_3(E)$ must be the trivial group, $\\{0\\}$.\n\n9.  **Relate $\\pi_3(E)$ to $\\pi_3(X)$**: Our specific hypersurface $X$ is a fiber in another fibration, the universal family of smooth quintics. A deep result in algebraic geometry states that for a hypersurface of high enough degree (like our quintic), the inclusion of the fiber $X$ into the total space of the universal family induces an isomorphism on the third homotopy group. Therefore, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(E_{sm})$, where $E_{sm}$ is the part of $E$ corresponding to smooth quintics. Another application of Lefschetz-type theorems shows that $\\pi_3(E_{sm}) \\cong \\pi_3(E)$.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: Combining these facts, we have $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(E) = 0$. The third homotopy group of $X$ is the trivial group.\n\n11. **Final Answer**: The rank of a group is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in its abelian decomposition. The rank of the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ is 0.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef nCr_str(n, r):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to format nCr calculation string.\"\"\"\n    return f\"{n}! / ({r}! * ({n}-{r})!)\"\n\ndef nCr(n, r):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to compute nCr.\"\"\"\n    f = math.factorial\n    return f(n) // (f(r) * f(n-r))\n\ndef solve_pi3_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the object and strategy.\")\n    print(\"X is a smooth quintic (degree d=5) hypersurface in CP^n (n=3).\")\n    print(\"Strategy: Use the universal family of quintics and its incidence variety E.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the fibration E -> CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The incidence variety E fibers over CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The fiber is the space of quintics passing through a point, which is a hyperplane in the space of all quintics.\")\n    n = 3\n    d = 5\n    print(f\"The space of all degree-d={d} hypersurfaces in CP^n={n} is P^(N-1), where N = dim H^0(O(d)).\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Calculate N = (n+d C d).\")\n    N_val = nCr(n + d, d)\n    print(f\"N = ({n}+{d} C {d}) = {nCr_str(n+d, d)} = {N_val}\")\n    print(f\"The space of all quintics is P^{N_val-1} = P^55.\")\n    print(f\"The fiber of E -> CP^3 is P^(N-2) = P^54.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Use the long exact sequence of homotopy for the fibration P^54 -> E -> CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The sequence is: ... -> pi_3(P^54) -> pi_3(E) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> ...\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Determine the homotopy groups of the base and fiber.\")\n    print(\"For m >= 2, pi_3(CP^m) is isomorphic to pi_3(S^(2m+1)).\")\n    print(\"For the base CP^3: pi_3(CP^3) ~= pi_3(S^(2*3+1)) = pi_3(S^7) = 0.\")\n    print(\"For the fiber P^54: pi_3(P^54) ~= pi_3(S^(2*54+1)) = pi_3(S^109) = 0.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 6: Substitute these values into the exact sequence.\")\n    print(\"0 -> pi_3(E) -> 0\")\n    print(\"This implies that pi_3(E) is the trivial group {0}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 7: Relate pi_3(E) to pi_3(X).\")\n    print(\"A deep theorem in algebraic geometry shows that for a hypersurface of degree d>=2 (and not a quadric surface),\")\n    print(\"the inclusion X -> E induces an isomorphism on the third homotopy group.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, pi_3(X) is isomorphic to pi_3(E).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 8: Final conclusion.\")\n    print(\"pi_3(X) ~= pi_3(E) = {0}.\")\n    rank = 0\n    print(f\"The rank of the trivial group is {rank}.\\n\")\n    \n    final_answer = rank\n    print(f\"The final equation is essentially the result of the homotopy sequence analysis.\")\n    print(\"pi_3(P^54) -> pi_3(E) -> pi_3(CP^3)\")\n    print(\"0 -> pi_3(E) -> 0\")\n    print(\"pi_3(X) ~= pi_3(E) = 0\")\n    print(f\"Rank(pi_3(X)) = {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_pi3_rank()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
