    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of primitive Dirichlet characters.** For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. A non-principal character is any character that is not constantly 1, meaning its order is greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the order of the character.** The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6. So, we have $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r)) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**. We need to find the prime factors of $d = 53599$. This will determine the number of component characters, $r$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible orders for each component character.** The order of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the character group, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$. Additionally, from the lcm condition, its order must be a divisor of 6. Since $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1. So, for each component $\\chi_i$, its order must belong to the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. We need to verify that these orders are indeed possible for each prime factor $p_i$ (i.e., they divide $p_i-1$).\n\n5.  **Count the number of characters for each valid order.** The number of characters of a specific order $k$ in the cyclic group of characters modulo a prime $p_i$ (where $k$ divides $p_i-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\n6.  **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the final count.**\n    *   First, we'll calculate the total number of ways to choose the component characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that each has an order from the set $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   The condition $\\text{lcm}(\\dots) = 6 = 2 \\times 3$ requires that at least one component character has an order divisible by 2, and at least one has an order divisible by 3.\n    *   We will subtract the combinations where this condition is violated:\n        a. Cases where no order is divisible by 2 (i.e., all orders are 3).\n        b. Cases where no order is divisible by 3 (i.e., all orders are 2).\n    *   The sum of these counts gives the final answer.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime factors of a natural number.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    num_factors = len(prime_factors)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {prime_factors}.\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if and only if it is a product of non-principal characters for each prime factor.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine possible orders\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the possible orders for component characters.\")\n    print(f\"The order of the character is lcm(ord(chi_i), ...) = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies the order of each component character chi_i must be a divisor of {g}.\")\n    possible_orders = [k for k in range(2, g + 1) if g % k == 0]\n    print(f\"Since characters must be non-principal (order > 1), the possible orders are {possible_orders}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count characters and use inclusion-exclusion\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of valid characters using inclusion-exclusion.\")\n    \n    # Calculate choices for the full set of orders {2, 3, 6}\n    choices_per_component = {k: phi(k) for k in possible_orders}\n    num_choices_total = sum(choices_per_component.values())\n    total_combinations = num_choices_total ** num_factors\n    print(f\"The number of characters of order 2 is phi(2) = {choices_per_component[2]}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of characters of order 3 is phi(3) = {choices_per_component[3]}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of characters of order 6 is phi(6) = {choices_per_component[6]}.\")\n    print(f\"Total choices per component for an order in {{2, 3, 6}} is {choices_per_component[2]} + {choices_per_component[3]} + {choices_per_component[6]} = {num_choices_total}.\")\n    print(f\"With {num_factors} prime factors, the total combinations where orders are in {{2, 3, 6}} is {num_choices_total}^{num_factors} = {total_combinations}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Now, we exclude cases where the lcm is not 6.\")\n    \n    # Case A: lcm has no factor of 2.
