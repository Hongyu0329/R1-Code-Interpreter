    Analyzes the Go puzzle to find White's killing move.

    The board state is:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    It's White's move. The task is to find all first moves for White that
    initiate a guaranteed kill sequence against the corner Black group.
    """

    # Analysis of the position:
    # The Black stones form a single group in the corner. To live, this group
    # needs to create two separate, unfillable points called "eyes".
    # The group's potential eye space is in the corner, centered on the
    # point A1. This makes A1 the "vital point" for this group's life.

    # Case 1: White plays at the vital point, A1.
    # If White plays at A1, Black is prevented from making a simple eye in the
    # corner. Black must then try to create life in the remaining space.
    # However, after White plays A1, any attempt by Black to create eyes can be
    # systematically thwarted by White. The resulting shape is a well-known
    # dead shape (a "bulky five" with its vital point occupied).
    # Therefore, A1 is a successful killing move.

    # Case 2: White plays anywhere else (e.g., B1, B2, A3).
    # If White makes any other move, Black's correct response is to play at A1.
    # By playing at A1, Black secures one definite eye. The group is then
    # large and flexible enough that White cannot prevent Black from forming a
    # second eye. Thus, the Black group would live.

    # Conclusion:
    # The only move that guarantees a kill for White is to play on the vital point.
    killing_moves = ["A1"]

    # The final answer is the list of all killing moves in curly brackets.
    result = "{" + ",".join(killing_moves) + "}"
    print(result)
