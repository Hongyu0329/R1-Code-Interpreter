    print("Step 2: Determining the role and expression of Braveheart.")
    print(" - The function of Braveheart is to turn ON the genetic program for heart development.")
    print(" - Therefore, in undifferentiated ESCs, Braveheart expression is very low or absent.")
    print(" - As the cells begin to differentiate into heart cells, the expression of Braveheart must be significantly INCREASED to drive this process.")

    print(" - The transition from an embryonic stem cell to a differentiating heart cell involves a dramatic INCREASE in Braveheart expression.")
