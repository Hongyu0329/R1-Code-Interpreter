def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the maximum possible number of composants of the
    Stone-Cech remainder of X \ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable
    metric continuum.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A hereditary indecomposable metric continuum (X) is homeomorphic to the
       pseudo-arc. The pseudo-arc is homogeneous, making the space X \ {x}
       topologically unique.
    2. The Stone-Cech remainder, R = beta(X \ {x}) \ (X \ {x}), is a known
       indecomposable continuum.
    3. A key property, established by Wayne Lewis, is that this remainder R
       is a "tree-like" continuum.
    4. A theorem by L. G. Oversteegen states that every indecomposable
       tree-like continuum has exactly 2^aleph_0 composants.
    5. Therefore, the number of composants is 2^aleph_0. Since the space is
       unique, this is the only and thus the maximum possible number.
