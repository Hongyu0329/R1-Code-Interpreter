    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Introduce Duality**: The core of the problem is to use the principle of duality. This principle connects the observer design for a system `(A, C)` to the controller design for a \"dual\" system `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  **Controller Canonical Form for the Dual System**: We will transform the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into its controller canonical form `(A_dc, B_dc)` using a state transformation `z_c = T * z`. The transformed matrices are `A_dc = T * A_d * T^{-1}` and `B_dc = T * B_d`.\n3.  **Find the Transformation Matrix `T`**:\n    *   First, we'll determine the controllability of the dual system by constructing its controllability matrix `W_c`.\n    *   From `W_c`, we'll select a set of linearly independent vectors that define the controllability indices of the system.\n    *   Using these vectors and indices, we will construct the transformation matrix `T` following the standard procedure for multi-input systems.\n4.  **Determine the Observer Canonical Form**: Once `T` is found, we can apply the duality principle back. The new matrices for the original system in observer canonical form, `(A_o, C_o)`, are given by the transposes of the dual's canonical form matrices:\n    *   `A_o = A_dc^T`\n    *   `C_o = B_dc^T = (T * B_d)^T = B_d^T * T^T = C * T^T`\n5.  **Calculate and Display the Result**: The final step is to compute the new matrix `C_o = C * T^T` using Python and `numpy`. I will print the full equation with the numerical values of the matrices involved, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef reduce_to_observer_canonical():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [1, 1, 0],\n        [2, 1, 1],\n        [0, 2, 0]\n    ])\n    C = np.array([\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define the original system matrices A and C.\")\n    print(\"A =\\n\", A)\n    print(\"\\nC =\\n\", C)\n\n    # Form the dual system (Ad, Bd) where Ad = A^T and Bd = C^T\n    A_d = A.T\n    B_d = C.T\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Form the dual system with Ad = A.T and Bd = C.T.\")\n    print(\"Ad =\\n\", A_d)\n    print(\"\\nBd =\\n\", B_d)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the transformation matrix T for the dual system.\n    # This process is based on the controllability of the dual system (Ad, Bd).\n    # We find the controllability indices are v1=2, v2=1.\n    # The LI vectors are b1, Ad*b1, b2.\n    b1 = B_d[:, 0:1]\n    b2 = B_d[:, 1:2]\n    Adb1 = A_d @ b1\n    \n    # Construct the matrix Q from the linearly independent vectors\n    Q = np.hstack([b1, Adb1, b2])\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Construct the matrix Q from LI vectors of the controllability matrix.\")\n    print(\"Q =\\n\", Q)\n\n    # Invert Q to find the rows needed for T\n    Q_inv = np.linalg.inv(Q)\n    \n    # Construct the transformation matrix T\n    # The rows of T are based on the last vector of each controllability chain.\n    # Chain 1 (length v1=2): last vector is Ad*b1 (col 2 of Q).
