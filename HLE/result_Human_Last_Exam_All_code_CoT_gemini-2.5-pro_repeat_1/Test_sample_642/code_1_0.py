# The problem asks to compute the limit of the difference in state complexity
# for a Turing machine recognizing the language of strings where the number of '1's
# is a multiple of k.

# Step 1: Model the state complexity function f(k).
# As reasoned in the plan, an optimized Turing machine can use its tape to store
# the count of '1's (N) and the number k in binary.
# The number of states is dominated by the sub-procedure to write k on the tape.
# This leads to a logarithmic relationship between the number of states and k.
# We model the state complexity f(k) as: f(k) = A * log(k) + B
# where A and B are constants.

# Step 2: Set up the mathematical expression for the limit.
# We need to compute: lim_{k->oo} [f(k+1) - f(k)]
# Substituting our model for f(k):
# lim_{k->oo} [ (A*log(k+1) + B) - (A*log(k) + B) ]
# = lim_{k->oo} [ A*log(k+1) - A*log(k) ]
# = lim_{k->oo} [ A * (log(k+1) - log(k)) ]
# = lim_{k->oo} [ A * log((k+1)/k) ]
# = lim_{k->oo} [ A * log(1 + 1/k) ]

# Step 3: Use Python's sympy library to perform the symbolic calculation.
# We define our symbols.
k = sympy.Symbol('k')
A = sympy.Symbol('A', positive=True, constant=True)
B = sympy.Symbol('B', constant=True)

# Define the function f(k) based on our model.
# We use the natural logarithm, but any log base would yield the same result.
f_k = A * sympy.log(k) + B

# Define f(k+1).
f_k_plus_1 = A * sympy.log(k + 1) + B

# The expression inside the limit is the difference.
difference = f_k_plus_1 - f_k

# Compute the limit of the difference as k approaches infinity.
result = sympy.limit(difference, k, sympy.oo)

# Step 4: Output the reasoning and the final answer.
# The user wants to see the numbers in the final equation.
# Our final equation is the limit itself.
