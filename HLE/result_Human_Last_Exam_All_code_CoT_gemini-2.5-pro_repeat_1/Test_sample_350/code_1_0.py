    Wolfhart Pannenberg's theology of history is a critical engagement with German Idealism. His project to formulate a 'cosmic history' based on a contingent concept of time draws heavily from two key figures:

    1. Georg Hegel: Pannenberg adopted and adapted Hegel's idea of history as the place where the Absolute (God) is revealed. While critical of Hegel's closed, deterministic system, the Hegelian framework of history as a rational, unfolding process is foundational to Pannenberg's thought.

    2. Friedrich Schelling: Pannenberg was deeply influenced by Schelling's later 'philosophy of revelation,' which emphasized contingency, freedom, and the dynamic nature of God. This provided Pannenberg with the philosophical tools to argue for a history that is open-ended and contingent upon God's future.

    Therefore, the primary historical-philosophical influences for this aspect of Pannenberg's work are Hegel and Schelling.
