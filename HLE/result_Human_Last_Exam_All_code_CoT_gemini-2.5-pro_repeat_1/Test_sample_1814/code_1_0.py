def solve_dual_topology_problem():
    """
    Solves for the maximum number of distinct topologies from iterating the dual operator.

    This problem is a known result in general topology. The solution is derived from
    a mathematical theorem rather than direct computation over topologies. The theorem
    states that the dual operator 'd' satisfies the identity d^7(T) = d^5(T) for any
    topology T.

    This script demonstrates the logical consequence of this identity. It simulates
    the sequence of topologies T_n = d^n(T) and counts the maximum number of
    distinct topologies that can appear in such a sequence.
