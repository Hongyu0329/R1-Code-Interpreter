    # We will score each diagnosis out of 10 based on plausibility.
    # The clinical picture is classic for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
    # The key is to find the most likely cause of ARDS in this patient.

    # A. Acute transfusion reaction: Happens hours after transfusion, not 29 days.
    scores['A'] = 1 # Very low score due to timeline mismatch.
    
    # B. Iodine reaction: Possible if a recent scan was done, but not mentioned and less likely.
    scores['B'] = 2 # Unlikely without specific history of recent contrast.
    
    # C. Sensitivity reaction: Too vague to be a primary diagnosis.
    scores['C'] = 1 # Not specific.
    
    # D. Sepsis: Whipple procedure has high risk of infection. Sepsis is the #1 cause of ARDS. Timeline is appropriate.
    # Score breakdown for Sepsis:
    timeline_fit = 4 # Perfect fit for a post-op infection to develop.
    symptom_fit = 5  # Classic presentation for Sepsis-induced ARDS.
    risk_factor_fit = 1 # Patient is high-risk post-Whipple procedure.
    scores['D'] = timeline_fit + symptom_fit + risk_factor_fit

    # E. Myocyte necrosis: Cardiac cause is possible but sepsis is more likely given the context.
    scores['E'] = 3 # Less likely than sepsis as the primary trigger.

    # F. Deconditioning: Does not cause bilateral crackles and severe hypoxemia.
    scores['F'] = 1 # Does not fit the acute, severe picture.
    
    # G. Lung exhaustion: Not a standard medical term.
    scores['G'] = 0 # Vague, unscientific term.
    
    # H. Air pollution: Unlikely to cause this severe picture in a post-op patient.
    scores['H'] = 1 # A post-operative complication is far more probable.

# Execute the function and capture the final answer character.
final_answer = diagnose_hypoxemia()

# The final answer is then printed in the required format.
# print(f"\n<<<D>>>") # The code determined D is the answer. Let's make the final output follow the instruction strictly.
# As the instruction states, the final answer must be returned directly at the end of the response.
# The script above calculates and logically concludes 'D'.
# So I will hardcode it in the final format.
# I will assume the user doesn't want me to print it inside the python block.

# After re-reading the instructions, it's ambiguous if "<<<>>>" should be inside or outside.
# Let's put it outside the python block as the final concluding remark of the entire response.
# But the instruction also says "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response".
# This implies it should be the very last thing.
# Let's re-read again. "start the python block with ```python", "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response".
# This implies the answer is OUTSIDE and AFTER the python block.
# Okay, so I will generate the python block, and then on a new line, write the final answer.
# However, the user prompt I am acting as, the AI assistant, also says "Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response."
# And "Once you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response"
# This suggests that the final `<<<...>>>` is the *only* thing I should return once I am confident.
# But the prompt also says "suggest python code ... for the user to execute".
# This is a conflicting set of instructions.
# Let's try to interpret the user's intent. They want a code-based solution to a problem. The `<<<>>>` is the final deliverable.
# The most reasonable interpretation is to provide the thinking, provide the code block, and then provide the final answer tag.
# Let's check the very first user prompt again. "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills... Once you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response"
# Okay, I will stick to the plan: Thinking -> Code Block -> Final Answer Tag. This satisfies all constraints.
