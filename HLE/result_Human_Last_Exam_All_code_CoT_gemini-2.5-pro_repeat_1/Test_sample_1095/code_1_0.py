    Determines the condition on the radial wavevector (k_r) for a Bessel-Gauss (BG)
    beam to exhibit rotational propagation similar to a Laguerre-Gauss (LG) "light spring".
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Rotation in LG modes is due to the Gouy phase, which adds a phase term
       proportional to the topological charge, l.
    2. For BG modes to exhibit similar rotation, their propagation phase must also
       acquire a term that is linearly proportional to l. The propagation phase
       is governed by the longitudinal wavevector, k_z.
    3. In the paraxial approximation, k_z is related to the radial wavevector k_r by:
       k_z ≈ k - k_r^2 / (2*k), where k is the constant total wavenumber.
    4. To make the l-dependent part of the phase (k_z*z) linear in l, the term
       k_r^2 must be proportional to l.
       k_r^2 ∝ l
    5. Taking the square root gives the final condition.
