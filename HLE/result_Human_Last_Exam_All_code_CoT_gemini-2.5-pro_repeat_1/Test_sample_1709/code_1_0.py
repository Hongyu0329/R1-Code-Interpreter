    # Based on the step-by-step deduction, the complex expressions in the problem
    # are designed to simplify dramatically. The logic is as follows:
    # 1. The integrals defining the matrices are such that V_3=0, V_4=1, and V_2 = -V_1.
    #    This ensures the matrix P (constructed from V_3 and V_4) lies on the manifold M.
    # 2. The integral equation for the vector field V(P) simplifies to show that V(P) is
    #    proportional to the Riemannian gradient of the function F at point P.
    # 3. The problem is constructed such that the gradient vector is proportional to the matrix P itself.
    #    This means non-zero-elements(V(P)) is the same as non-zero-elements(P).
    # 4. The number of non-zero elements in the matrix P is determined by its definition:
    #    - k/2 elements on the main diagonal for 1 <= i = j <= k/2.
    #    - k/2 elements on a diagonal band for the lower-right block.
    #    The total is k/2 + k/2 = k.
    # Therefore, l(n,k) = k.
