    print("  - At each point p_n, attach another cyclic element, like a small circle C_n, tangent to S only at p_n.")
    print("  - If we ensure the resulting space X = S ∪ C_1 ∪ C_2 ∪ ... is compact and locally connected (e.g., by making the radii of C_n shrink to zero appropriately), we have a valid Peano continuum.")
    print("\nIn this example, the set of points in S that also belong to another cyclic element is precisely the set {p_1, p_2, p_3, ...}, which is countably infinite.")
