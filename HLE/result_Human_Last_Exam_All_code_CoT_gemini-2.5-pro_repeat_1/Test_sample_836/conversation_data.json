    "My plan is to first define the function in question, the generalized pair correlation function, and explain its physical meaning in the context of nuclear criticality. Then, I will describe the mathematical operation being performed, which is a double Fourier transform with respect to both space and time variables. Finally, by applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, which relates correlation functions to spectral densities, I will identify the common name for the resulting transformed function.\n\nThe entire explanation will be encapsulated within a Python script, as requested. The script will use `print` statements to walk through the logic and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and identifies the common name for the space-time,\n    double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\n    in the nuclear criticality community.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This program will determine the common name for a specific mathematical function used in nuclear criticality analysis.\")\n    print(\"=\"*80)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the function being transformed\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Generalized Pair Correlation Function\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The starting point is the generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as:\")\n    print(\"  G(r1, E1, t1; r2, E2, t2)\")\n    print(\"\\nThis function represents the joint probability of detecting a particle (neutron) at position r1 with energy E1 at time t1, AND another particle at position r2 with energy E2 at time t2.\")\n    print(\"It is a measure of the correlation in the neutron population between two distinct points in space, time, and energy.\")\n    print(\"In stationary and homogeneous systems, this function depends on the differences tau = t1 - t2 and r = r1 - r2.\")\n    print(\"  G -> g(r, tau; E1, E2)\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the transformation\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Space-Time Double Fourier Transform\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The task is to perform a Fourier transform on this function with respect to both the spatial separation (r) and the temporal separation (tau).\")\n    print(\"The transform converts the function from the space-time domain (r, tau) to the wavevector-frequency domain (k, omega).\")\n    print(\"The mathematical form of the transform is:\")\n    print(\"  S(k, omega) = Integral from -inf to +inf d(tau) * Integral over volume d^3(r) * g(r, tau) * exp[-i*(k.r - omega*tau)]\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify the common name of the result\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: The Common Name of the Resulting Function\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The Wiener-Khinchin theorem in signal processing states that the Fourier transform of a correlation function is the power spectral density.\")\n    print(\" - If the correlation is of a signal with itself (an auto-correlation), the result is the Auto-Power Spectral Density.\")\n    print(\" - If the correlation is between two different signals or points (a cross-correlation), the result is the Cross-Power Spectral Density.\")\n    print(\"\\nSince the generalized pair correlation function describes the relationship between two potentially different points (r1 and r2), its double Fourier transform is known as the:\")\n    print(\"\\n******************************************\")\n    print(\"***                                    ***\")\n    print(\"***   Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)  ***\")\n    print(\"***                                    ***\")\n    print(\"******************************************\")\n\n    print(\"\\nIn the special case where r1 = r2 and E1 = E2, the function is called the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD).\")\n    print(\"Another name, 'Dynamic Structure Factor', is also used, especially in theoretical contexts drawing analogies to condensed matter physics.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density>>>"
