    "A separatrix in a dynamical system is a trajectory that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. These are often the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. Therefore, to find the separatrix, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the system and classify them.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Find the equilibrium points of the system by setting the derivatives $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ to zero.\n2.  Linearize the system around these equilibrium points to classify them. This is done by computing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each point. The equilibrium points are (0, 0) (non-hyperbolic), (0, 1) (unstable node), and (-1, 1) (saddle point).\n3.  A separatrix is a special trajectory passing through a saddle point. The saddle point of this system is at (-1, 1). The separatrices are its stable and unstable manifolds.\n4.  By inspection or analysis of the phase plane ODE, I propose that the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory of the system.\n5.  I will verify that this proposed equation represents a valid trajectory by substituting it back into the original differential equations.\n6.  I will also verify that this trajectory passes through the saddle point (-1, 1), which confirms it is a separatrix (specifically, it is the unstable manifold of the saddle point).\n7.  The following Python code will perform this verification step and print the final equation for the separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the proposed separatrix for the given system of ODEs\n    and prints the final equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    # We use u as a symbol, not a function of t, for simplicity in phase plane analysis.\n    # d is treated as a function of u.\n    u = sp.Symbol('u')\n    d = sp.Function('d')(u)\n\n    # Define the system of ODEs in phase plane form: dd/du = d_prime / u_prime\n    # d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    # u_prime = u**2 * (u-1)\n    # So, dd/du = (2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)) / (u**2 * (u-1))\n\n    # We propose the separatrix is given by the equation d = -u**2.\n    # Let's verify if this is a solution to the phase plane ODE.\n    \n    proposed_d = -u**2\n    \n    # Calculate the left-hand side (LHS): dd/du\n    lhs = sp.diff(proposed_d, u)\n\n    # Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) by substituting d = -u**2 into the expression for dd/du\n    d_prime_subs = 2*proposed_d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*proposed_d - u**3*(1-u)\n    u_prime = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    \n    # We need to handle the case u=1 and u=0 where u_prime is zero.\n    # The simplification will work for u not equal to 0 or 1.\n    rhs = sp.simplify(d_prime_subs / u_prime)\n\n    print(\"Verifying the proposed separatrix: d = -u**2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"The derivative dd/du from the proposed solution is: {lhs}\")\n    print(f\"The expression for dd/du from the ODEs is: {rhs}\")\n    \n    # Check if the LHS and RHS are equal\n    if sp.simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0:\n        print(\"\\nThe verification is successful: LHS equals RHS.\")\n        print(\"This confirms that d = -u**2 is a trajectory of the system.\")\n        \n        # An equilibrium point is a saddle if its linearization has eigenvalues with opposite signs.\n        # This analysis (done manually) shows the point (-1, 1) is a saddle.\n        # Now, we check if our separatrix passes through the saddle point (-1, 1).\n        u_saddle, d_saddle = 1, -1\n        if proposed_d.subs(u, u_saddle) == d_saddle:\n            print(f\"The curve d = -u**2 passes through the saddle point ({d_saddle}, {u_saddle}).\")\n            print(\"Therefore, it is a separatrix.\")\n            \n            # Print the final equation with its coefficients as requested.\n            # The equation is d = -u**2, which can be written as d + u**2 = 0.\n            d_coeff = 1\n            u_sq_coeff = 1\n            exponent = 2\n            constant = 0\n            \n            print(\"\\nThe equation for the separatrix is:\")\n            print(f\"d = -u**{exponent}\")\n            print(\"In the standard form Ax + By = C, it can be written as:\")\n            print(f\"({d_coeff})*d + ({u_sq_coeff})*u**{exponent} = {constant}\")\n\n        else:\n            print(\"The curve does not pass through the saddle point.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nVerification failed.
