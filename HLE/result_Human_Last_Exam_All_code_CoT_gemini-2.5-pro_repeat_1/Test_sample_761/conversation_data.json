    "No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are fundamentally different types of biological polymers.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that prints a detailed explanation of the structural differences between these two molecules. The script will outline the differences in their basic building blocks (monomers), the structure of their backbones, and the types of chemical bonds that link the monomers together. This will clearly answer why a polynucleotide, even a homopolynucleotide, cannot be considered a polysaccharide.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed explanation of the structural differences between\n    polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"No, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not structurally polysaccharides.\")\n    print(\"\\nThey are two distinct classes of biological macromolecules with fundamental differences in their structure. Here is a breakdown:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1. Monomers (The Repeating Building Blocks):\")\n    print(\"   - Polysaccharides are polymers made of simple sugar units called 'monosaccharides' (e.g., glucose, fructose).\")\n    print(\"   - Polynucleotides are polymers made of 'nucleotides'.\")\n    print(\"   - A nucleotide itself is a composite molecule made of three parts: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\")\n    print(\"\\n2. Backbone Structure:\")\n    print(\"   - In a polysaccharide, the backbone is a chain of sugar units linked directly to each other via glycosidic bonds. The structure is essentially: Sugar-Sugar-Sugar...\")\n    print(\"   - In a polynucleotide, the backbone is a 'sugar-phosphate backbone'. The phosphate group of one nucleotide links to the sugar of the next via a phosphodiester bond. The structure is: Sugar-Phosphate-Sugar-Phosphate...\")\n    print(\"\\n3. Key Chemical Components:\")\n    print(\"   - Polynucleotides are defined by the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
