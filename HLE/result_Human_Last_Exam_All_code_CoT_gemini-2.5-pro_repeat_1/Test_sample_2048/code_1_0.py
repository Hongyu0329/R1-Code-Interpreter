# Based on the analysis, the complex machinery in the problem statement is a distraction.
# The problem simplifies under the hypothesis that the resulting random variable z follows a standard uniform distribution U(0,1).
# Let's calculate the components of l(k) under this hypothesis.

# For a U(0,1) distribution, the probability density function p(z) is 1 for z in (0,1).
# We interpret p_k(1) as the limit of the PDF as z approaches 1 from below.
p_k_at_1 = 1.0

# The differential entropy (in nats) of a U(0,1) random variable is calculated as:
# d_k = - integral from 0 to 1 of (p(z) * ln(p(z))) dz
# d_k = - integral from 0 to 1 of (1 * ln(1)) dz = - integral from 0 to 1 of 0 dz = 0
d_k = 0.0

# The function to be calculated is l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1.
# We substitute the values we found.
l_k_val_part1 = p_k_at_1
l_k_val_part2 = 2 * d_k
l_k_val_part3 = -1

l_k = l_k_val_part1 + l_k_val_part2 + l_k_val_part3

# Print the final equation with each number.
print(f"p_k(1) = {p_k_at_1}")
print(f"d_k = {d_k}")
print(f"l(k) = {l_k_val_part1} + 2 * {d_k} - 1 = {l_k}")

# The final answer is the value of l(k).
# We use the special format for the final answer.
print(f"\n<<<The exact value of l(k) is>>>")
print(f"<<<{l_k}>>>")
