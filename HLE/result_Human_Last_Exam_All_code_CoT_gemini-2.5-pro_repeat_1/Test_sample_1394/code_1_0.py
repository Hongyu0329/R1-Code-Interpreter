# The original differential equation is:
# x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * (dy/dx) + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x * y * (dy/dx) + 9 * x^2
# This equation is likely to have a typo, as it's not solvable by standard elementary methods.
# A plausible corrected form that is solvable is:
# y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + 6*x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2 - x^2*y^2 = 0
# This factors into two separate first-order ODEs.

# The general solution consists of two families of curves.
# We will print the implicit equations for these families.

# Solution to the first ODE: y*dy/dx + 3x - x*y = 0
# y + 3*ln|y-3| = x^2/2 + C1
# Rewriting to avoid fractions: 2*y + 6*ln|y-3| = x^2 + C
