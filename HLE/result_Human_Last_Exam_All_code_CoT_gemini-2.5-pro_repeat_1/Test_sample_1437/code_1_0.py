# Step 1: State the physical relationship.
# In the static, long-wavelength limit (k -> 0, omega = 0), the Lindhard
# polarization function Pi(k, omega) for a 3D electron gas at T=0 is equal
# to the negative of the density of states at the Fermi energy, D(epsilon_F).
# Pi(k->0, omega=0) = -D(epsilon_F)

# Step 2: Address the non-universality of the result.
# The density of states D(epsilon_F) depends on the electron density of the
# gas, so Pi(0,0) is not a universal constant. The request for a single
# "numerical value" points towards finding a dimensionless value by normalizing
# the function by the density of states.

# Step 3: Define the normalized quantity to be calculated.
# Normalized Pi = Pi(0,0) / D(epsilon_F)

# Step 4: Perform the calculation.
# To show the calculation, we can use a symbolic placeholder for D(epsilon_F).
# Since it cancels out, its value can be set to 1.0 without loss of generality.
density_of_states_at_fermi_energy = 1.0

# Calculate the un-normalized Lindhard function based on the physical law.
lindhard_function_value = -density_of_states_at_fermi_energy

# Calculate the normalized value.
normalized_lindhard_value = lindhard_function_value / density_of_states_at_fermi_energy

# Step 5: Print the final result and the equation.
