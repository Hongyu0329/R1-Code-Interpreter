    "My plan is to demonstrate through a mathematical proof that no such lattice can exist. The proof relies on analyzing the properties of the lattice's Gram matrix and using a fundamental theorem that connects a lattice's signature to the norms of special vectors called characteristic vectors. I will show that the existence of such a lattice leads to a logical contradiction, forcing us to conclude that the number of such lattices is zero.\n\nThe Python code below will not perform a numerical calculation but will print out the step-by-step logical argument that solves the problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to determine the number of positive definite\n    even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, we will use a proof by contradiction.\")\n    print(\"The plan is to assume such a lattice exists and show that this assumption leads to a logical impossibility.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Properties from the definition ---\")\n    print(\"Let's assume such a lattice L exists.\")\n    print(\" - It has dimension n = 17.\")\n    print(\" - It is positive definite, so its signature is s = 17.\")\n    print(\" - Its determinant is d = 2.\")\n    print(\" - It is an 'even' lattice, meaning the squared length (norm) of any vector in L is an even integer.\")\n    print(\"Let G be the Gram matrix of this lattice.
