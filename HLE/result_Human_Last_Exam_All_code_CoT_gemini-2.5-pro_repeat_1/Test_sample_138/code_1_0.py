    print("To find the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2, we will use a proof by contradiction.")
    print("The plan is to assume such a lattice exists and show that this assumption leads to a logical impossibility.\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Properties from the definition ---")
    print("Let's assume such a lattice L exists.")
    print(" - It has dimension n = 17.")
    print(" - It is positive definite, so its signature is s = 17.")
    print(" - Its determinant is d = 2.")
    print(" - It is an 'even' lattice, meaning the squared length (norm) of any vector in L is an even integer.")
    print("Let G be the Gram matrix of this lattice. G is a 17x17 symmetric integer matrix with det(G) = 2, and all its diagonal entries G_ii are even.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Analysis modulo 2 ---")
    print("Consider the matrix G modulo 2, which we call G_2.")
    print(" - G_2 is a 17x17 matrix over the field F_2 = {0, 1}.")
    print(" - Since all G_ii are even, the diagonal of G_2 is all zeros.")
    print(" - A symmetric matrix with a zero diagonal is called 'alternating'.")
    print(" - The rank of G_2 can be found. Since det(G)=2, the Smith Normal Form of G is diag(1, ..., 1, 2).")
    print(" - The rank of G mod 2 is the number of invariant factors not divisible by 2, which is 16.")
    print(" - The nullity of G_2 is dim(ker(G_2)) = 17 - rank(G_2) = 17 - 16 = 1.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: The existence of a characteristic vector ---")
    print("Since G_2 has a 1-dimensional null space, there is a non-zero vector 'w' (with 0/1 entries) such that G*w is a vector of all even numbers (i.e., G*w = 0 mod 2).")
    print("This vector 'w' corresponds to a special vector 'v' in the lattice L, called a characteristic vector.")
    print("A key property of a characteristic vector 'v' in an even lattice is that its norm (v.v) must be congruent to the lattice signature modulo 8.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: The contradiction ---")
    print("We now have two ways to evaluate the norm of this characteristic vector v, which we'll call N = v.v.")
    print("1. From the theorem for characteristic vectors:")
    print("   N must be congruent to the signature (17) modulo 8.")
    print("   Equation 1: N \u2261 17 (mod 8)  =>  N \u2261 1 (mod 8). This implies N is an odd number.")
    print("\n2. From the definition of 'w':")
    print("   We know G*w = 2*z for some integer vector z. The norm N = v.v is given by w^T*G*w.")
    print("   N = w^T * (G*w) = w^T * (2*z) = 2 * (w^T*z).")
    print("   Since w and z are integer vectors, w^T*z is an integer. Thus, N must be an even number.")
    print("   Equation 2: N \u2261 0 (mod 2).\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The two derived equations for the number N are contradictory. A number cannot be both odd and even.")
    print("The contradiction stems from the initial assumption that such a lattice exists.")
    print("Therefore, no such lattices exist.\n")

    print("The numbers in the final contradictory equations are:")
    print("From the first equation, N \u2261 1 (mod 8), the numbers are:")
