    "Here is the plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  **Identify Mountains:** First, I will compile a list of the historical mountains mentioned in Homer's Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the request. The primary mountains are Mount Athos, Mount Ida (the one near Troy), Mount Pelion, and the peak on the island of Samothrace.\n2.  **Gather Elevation Data:** Next, I will find the current-day elevations (in meters) for each of these mountains.\n3.  **Store and Compare:** I will store this information in a Python dictionary, with mountain names as keys and their elevations as values.\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** The code will then programmatically iterate through the dictionary to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n5.  **Output the Result:** Finally, the script will print a comparison of all the mountain heights and declare the tallest one as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain_in_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary containing the mountains mentioned in the Iliad\n    # (excluding Olympus) and their respective elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611\n    }\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\\n\")\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Find the mountain with the maximum elevation.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Step 5: Output the final result, showing the numbers used in the comparison.\n    # We construct a string that looks like an equation to fulfill the prompt's requirement.\n    height_values = list(mountains.values())\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal comparison equation:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum of the heights ({height_values[0]}, {height_values[1]}, {height_values[2]}, {height_values[3]}) is {tallest_mountain_height}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_in_iliad()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
