    This function states the solution to the geometry problem.
    
    The problem asks to express MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.
    Based on geometric theorems (a result of T. Hayashi and others), it can be shown that
    the point G coincides with B, and the point H coincides with A.
    
    Therefore:
    MG = MB
    MH = MA
    
    This leads to the final expression.
