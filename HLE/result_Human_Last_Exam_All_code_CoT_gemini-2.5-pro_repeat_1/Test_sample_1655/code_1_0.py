    print("Step 1: Define the controllable input.")
    print("The input beam has a fixed linear polarization but a controllable phase and amplitude.")
    print("This means the input can be described by a single complex scalar field, E_in(x, y).")
    print("A complex field has 2 degrees of freedom at each point: amplitude and phase.")
    print("\nInput Degrees of Freedom = 2 (per spatial point)\n")

    print("Step 2: Define the desired output.")
    print("The desired output is an *arbitrary* vector beam.")
    print("A vector beam has a spatially varying polarization state. To be described fully, it requires two independent complex scalar fields, one for each orthogonal polarization component (e.g., Ex_out(x, y) and Ey_out(x, y)).")
    print("Each complex field has 2 degrees of freedom (amplitude and phase). Since the two fields must be independently controllable for the output to be 'arbitrary', we need 2 + 2 = 4 degrees of freedom.")
    print("\nDesired Output Degrees of Freedom = 4 (per spatial point)\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyze the system's function.")
    print("The entire optical path (propagation, random medium, inverse medium, etc.) acts as a linear operator that transforms the input field to the output field.")
    print("While a depolarizing random medium can create a second polarization component from a single input polarization, the two output components (Ex_out and Ey_out) are not independent.")
    print("Both Ex_out and Ey_out are generated from the *same* single input field, E_in. They are deterministically linked by the system's transmission properties.")
    print("For example, Ex_out = L_xx(E_in) and Ey_out = L_yx(E_in), where L_xx and L_yx are fixed linear operators representing the system.")
    print("You cannot choose E_in to produce a desired Ex_out and then independently choose a different E_in to produce a desired Ey_out. You must use the same E_in for both.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion based on the mismatch in degrees of freedom.")
    print("To create an arbitrary output, the number of controllable degrees of freedom in the input must be at least equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the output.")
    print("Here, we have 2 input degrees of freedom and require 4 output degrees of freedom.")
    print("This fundamental mismatch makes it impossible to generate an ARBITRARY vector beam.")
    print("Therefore, the answer is No.\n")
