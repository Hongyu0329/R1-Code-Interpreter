    Calculates the exact value of l(d).

    Based on the analysis, the limit expression f(d, p, o) evaluates to 0 for any
    valid d, p, and o. The numerator tends to 0 while the denominator tends to
    -infinity as x approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit is 0.

    The function l(d) is the minimum of f over all o. Since f is constantly 0,
    the minimum value is also 0.
