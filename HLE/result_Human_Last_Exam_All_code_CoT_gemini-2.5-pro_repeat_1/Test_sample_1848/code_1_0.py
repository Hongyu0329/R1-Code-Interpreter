    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print("We have constructed a family A meeting the criteria with cardinality 2^omega_4, and we have shown that no such family can have a larger cardinality.")
    print("Thus, the largest possible cardinality is 2^omega_4.")

    print("\nThe final equation representing the answer is:")
    print("Let |A| be the cardinality of the collection. The final result is:")
