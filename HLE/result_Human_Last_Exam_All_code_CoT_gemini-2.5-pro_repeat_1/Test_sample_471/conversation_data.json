    "To determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$), we can use a powerful tool from differential topology called Morse theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** I will start by explaining that Morse theory connects the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topological properties.\n2.  **Betti Numbers and the Morse Inequalities:** For a special class of \"nice\" functions called Morse functions, the number of critical points of each type (minima, saddles, maxima) is related to the Betti numbers of the manifold. A fundamental result states that for any smooth function on a compact, orientable manifold without boundary (like the torus), the total number of critical points must be at least the sum of its Betti numbers.\n3.  **Betti Numbers of the Torus:** The Betti numbers ($b_k$) of the 2-torus are:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent non-contractible loops, like latitude and longitude).\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one \"void\" or 2-dimensional hole).\n4.  **Calculation:** I will write a Python script to sum these Betti numbers to find the theoretical minimum number of critical points.\n5.  **Conclusion:** This theoretical minimum of 4 is indeed achievable. For example, the function $f(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\cos(\\theta_1) + \\cos(\\theta_2)$ on the torus (defined by angles $\\theta_1, \\theta_2$) has exactly four critical points: one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number.\n\n```python\n# The minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold\n# is bounded below by the sum of its Betti numbers.\n# For the 2-torus (T^2), the Betti numbers are well-known.\n\n# b_0 is the number of connected components.\nb0 = 1\n\n# b_1 is the number of 1-dimensional or \"circular\" holes.\nb1 = 2\n\n# b_2 is the number of 2-dimensional \"voids\" or \"cavities\".\nb2 = 1\n\n# The sum of the Betti numbers gives the minimal number of critical points.\nmin_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n\nprint(\"The minimal number of critical points is the sum of the Betti numbers: b0 + b1 + b2.\")\nprint(f\"For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are b0 = {b0}, b1 = {b1}, and b2 = {b2}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: {b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
