    "To solve this problem, we will determine the structure of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga and then use principles of linear algebra to find its maximal possible rank. The values `a` (for red pixels) and `b` (for white pixels) can be chosen freely to maximize this rank.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix**: The flag of Tonga is red, with a white canton in the top-left corner. The canton contains a red \"couped\" cross (a cross that doesn't touch the edges of the canton). We can express the matrix `M` for the flag as a linear combination of simpler matrices.\n2.  **Simplify the Problem**: Let `M_R` be a matrix with 1 for red pixels and 0 for white, and `J` be the matrix of all ones. The flag matrix `M` can be written as `M = (a - b) * M_R + b * J`. To find the maximal rank, we can choose convenient values for `a` and `b`. Setting `a=1` and `b=0` simplifies the problem to finding the rank of `M_R`, as `rank(M) <= rank(M_R)` for other choices.\n3.  **Decompose `M_R`**: The matrix `M_R` can be viewed as a block matrix. The top-left block, `A'`, corresponds to the canton (a red cross on a white background, represented by 1s on a 0s background). The other blocks are composed entirely of 1s (since the rest of the flag is red).\n4.  **Calculate the Rank of `M_R`**: We will find the rank of `M_R` by analyzing its column space and row space. The rank depends on the rank of the canton block `A'`.\n5.  **Determine the Rank of `A'`**: The block `A'` represents the red couped cross. A standard cross shape is formed by a horizontal rectangle and a vertical rectangle. The rows corresponding to the horizontal part are identical, and the rows corresponding to the vertical-only parts are also identical. These two types of rows are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of `A'` is 2.\n6.  **Combine Results**: By combining the ranks of the components, we can determine the total rank of `M_R`, which will be the maximal possible rank of `M`.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the Tonga flag.\n\n    The method involves analyzing the structure of the matrix and using linear\n    algebra principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the matrix M.\")\n    print(\"Let every red pixel have value 'a' and every white pixel have value 'b'.\")\n    print(\"Let M_R be a matrix with 1 for red pixels and 0 for white.\")\n    print(\"Let J be the matrix of all ones.\")\n    print(\"The flag matrix M can be written as: M = (a - b) * M_R + b * J.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the problem to finding rank(M_R).\")\n    print(\"To find the maximal rank, we can choose a and b freely.\")\n    print(\"Choosing a=1 and b=0 gives M = M_R.
