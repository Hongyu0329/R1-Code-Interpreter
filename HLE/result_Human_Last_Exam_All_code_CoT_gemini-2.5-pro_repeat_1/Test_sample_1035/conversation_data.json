    "This problem asks for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all edges of the complete graph $K_n$. Although the question uses the term \"number of vertices,\" this is widely interpreted as a slight misstatement of a classic problem in extremal graph theory. The actual question is to find the minimum size of a family of bipartite subgraphs whose edge sets collectively cover the edge set of $K_n$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The core task is to find the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs of $K_n$ such that every edge of $K_n$ belongs to at least one of these subgraphs.\n2.  **State the Theorem:** The solution to this problem is a well-known result. The minimum number of bipartite graphs, let's call it $k$, needed to cover $K_n$ is given by $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n3.  **Explain the Logic:**\n    *   To cover all edges, we must be able to distinguish any two vertices. We can assign a unique binary vector (a \"code\") of length $k$ to each of the $n$ vertices.\n    *   Each of the $k$ positions in the binary code corresponds to one of the $k$ bipartite graphs. For the $i$-th graph, we create a bipartition by splitting the vertices into two sets: those with a '0' in the $i$-th position of their code and those with a '1'.\n    *   An edge $(u, v)$ exists in the $i$-th bipartite graph if and only if vertices $u$ and $v$ are in different partitions (i.e., their codes differ at the $i$-th position).\n    *   Since every pair of distinct vertices must have a unique binary code, their codes must differ in at least one position. This guarantees that every edge $(u,v)$ in $K_n$ is present in at least one of the $k$ bipartite graphs.\n    *   The number of unique binary codes of length $k$ is $2^k$. To assign a unique code to each of the $n$ vertices, we must have $2^k \\ge n$.\n    *   Solving for $k$ gives $k \\ge \\log_2 n$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the minimum value is $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n4.  **Implement the Calculation:** Write a Python script to calculate this value for $n=35$. The script will explain the logic and print the final result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover\n    all edges of a complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    print(\"This problem asks for the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of the complete graph K_n.\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet k be the minimum number of bipartite graphs. According to a classic theorem in graph theory, k is the smallest integer satisfying the inequality 2^k >= n.\")\n    print(\"This can be written as k = ceil(log2(n)).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nHere is the reasoning:\")\n    print(\"1. We need to assign a unique binary code (e.g., '01101') to each of the n vertices.\")\n    print(\"2. Let the length of these binary codes be k.\")\n    print(\"3. Each of the k positions in the code corresponds to one bipartite graph. For the i-th graph, vertices are partitioned based on whether the i-th bit of their code is 0 or 1.\")\n    print(\"4. For any two vertices u and v, their codes must be different. This means their codes differ in at least one bit position, say the i-th position.\")\n    print(\"5. This ensures the edge (u, v) is included in the i-th bipartite graph, thus covering all edges of K_n.\")\n    print(f\"6. The number of unique k-bit codes is 2^k. To give each of the {n} vertices a unique code, we need 2^k >= {n}.\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation\n    k = math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n    print(\"\\nLet's calculate the value for n = 35:\")\n    print(f\"We need to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k >= {n}.\")\n    print(\"Let's test powers of 2:\")\n    power_of_2_low = 2**5\n    power_of_2_high = 2**6\n    print(f\"2^5 = {power_of_2_low}\")\n    print(f\"2^6 = {power_of_2_high}\")\n    print(f\"Since {power_of_2_low} < {n} and {power_of_2_high} >= {n}, the smallest integer k must be 6.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the numbers is:\")\n    print(f\"ceil(log2({n})) = {k}\")\n\nsolve_graph_covering()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
