    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix using Python. I will use the `numpy` library, which is the standard for numerical and matrix operations in Python.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  Import the `numpy` library.\n2.  Define the matrix `A` as a `numpy` array based on the provided values.\n3.  Use the `numpy.linalg.det()` function to calculate the determinant.\n4.  To fulfill the requirement of showing the numbers in the final equation, I will also print the manual calculation of the determinant for a 3x3 matrix, which is given by the formula: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n5.  Finally, I will print the computed determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\nprint(\"The given matrix A is:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix [a,b,c; d,e,f; g,h,i] is:\n# a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Print the calculation steps\nprint(\"Calculating the determinant using the formula:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nterm1 = a * (e * i - f * h)\nterm2 = b * (d * i - f * g)\nterm3 = c * (d * h - e * g)\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1} - ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\ndet_manual = term1 - term2 + term3\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1} + {-term2} + {term3} = {det_manual}\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Calculate the determinant using numpy\ndet_A = np.linalg.det(A)\n\nprint(\"The determinant of the matrix A is:\")\n# The result from numpy might be a very small floating point number close to zero\n# due to floating point inaccuracies, so we can round it.\nprint(round(det_A))\n```\n<<<0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Compute the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\), where:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
