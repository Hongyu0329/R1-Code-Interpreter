# 1. The problem is to find the maximum number of distinct non-real eigenvalues
#    for a matrix A where A^3 = A^*.
# 2. As outlined in the plan, this matrix property implies that every eigenvalue
#    lambda must satisfy the equation: lambda^3 = conjugate(lambda).
# 3. We solve this equation by letting lambda = x + i*y, where x and y are real.
#    (x + i*y)^3 = x - i*y
#    (x^3 - 3*x*y^2) + i*(3*x^2*y - y^3) = x - i*y
# 4. This gives a system of two polynomial equations by equating the real and imaginary parts:
#    eq1: x^3 - 3*x*y^2 = x
#    eq2: 3*x^2*y - y^3 = -y
# 5. We use sympy to solve this system for real x and y.

# Define x and y as real symbolic variables
x, y = sympy.symbols('x y', real=True)

# Define the system of equations
equation1 = sympy.Eq(x**3 - 3*x*y**2, x)
equation2 = sympy.Eq(3*x**2*y - y**3, -y)
