    "This problem is a classic question in the geometry of numbers. To find the minimal area of the convex domain, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the Condition**: A convex domain `K` containing the origin intersects a line `px + qy = 1` if and only if its support function `h_K(p, q) >= 1`. Since the set of coprime integer pairs `(p, q)` is symmetric (if `(p,q)` is coprime, so is `(-p,-q)`), the domain must also intersect the line `-px - qy = 1`. This leads to the stronger condition that for every coprime integer pair `(p, q)`, the support function of `K` must satisfy `h_K(p, q) >= 1` and `h_K(-p, -q) >= 1`.\n\n2.  **Using Duality**: It is a known result that the minimal area is achieved by a centrally symmetric domain. The conditions on the support function `h_K` are equivalent to stating that the polar body `K*` must not contain any coprime integer points `(p, q)` in its interior.\n\n3.  **Applying Minkowski's Theorem**: If `K*` does not contain any coprime integer points in its interior, it cannot contain any non-zero integer point `(p, q)` in its interior either. This is because any non-zero integer point is an integer multiple of a coprime integer point, and if it were in the interior of the convex set `K*`, the corresponding coprime point would be too. Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies states that any centrally symmetric convex set in the plane with an area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer point in its interior. Therefore, the area of `K*` must be at most 4.\n\n4.  **Finding the Optimal Shape**: According to the Blaschke-Santal√≥ inequality, for a centrally symmetric convex body `K`, `Area(K) * Area(K*) <= pi^2`. To minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K*)`. The maximum possible area for `K*` is 4, which is achieved by the square `C = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`. The minimal domain `K` is thus the polar of this square `C`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Area**: The polar of the square `C = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]` is the set `K = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| <= 1 }`. This shape is also a square, but rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`. We can calculate its area by treating it as a rhombus. The diagonals of this rhombus run along the x and y axes, and their lengths are `d1 = 1 - (-1) = 2` and `d2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`. The area of a rhombus is given by `(d1 * d2) / 2`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal area.\n\n```python\n# The minimal area corresponds to the convex set K defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\n# This shape is a square rotated by 45 degrees, or a rhombus, with vertices\n# at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n\n# The length of the horizontal diagonal (from x=-1 to x=1) is d1.\nd1 = 2\n\n# The length of the vertical diagonal (from y=-1 to y=1) is d2.\nd2 = 2\n\n# The area of a rhombus is calculated as (d1 * d2) / 2.\ndenominator = 2\narea = (d1 * d2) / denominator\n\nprint(\"The minimal area of the convex domain is found for the shape defined by |x| + |y| <= 1.\")\nprint(\"This shape is a rhombus with diagonals d1 and d2.\")\nprint(f\"The length of the first diagonal d1 is: {d1}\")\nprint(f\"The length of the second diagonal d2 is: {d2}\")\nprint(\"The area is calculated using the formula: (d1 * d2) / 2\")\nprint(f\"Area = ({d1} * {d2}) / {denominator} = {area}\")\nprint(f\"The minimal area is: {area}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
