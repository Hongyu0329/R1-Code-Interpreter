# The problem asks for the smallest dimension n for which a specific Fourier restriction inequality fails.
# The failure of such an inequality is shown by constructing a counterexample.
# The standard counterexample (Bourgain's "hairbrush") relies on a geometric construction.

# This construction requires choosing two "transverse" families of patches on the paraboloid.
# These families are defined in the space of the first n-1 coordinates, which is R^(n-1).
# To choose two transverse families (e.g., along two different coordinate axes),
# the dimension of this space, n-1, must be at least 2.

# Therefore, the condition for the counterexample to be possible is:
# n - 1 >= 2

# We need to find the smallest integer n (where n>=2) that satisfies this condition.
# This occurs when n-1 is at its minimum possible value, which is 2.
# So, we solve the equation n - 1 = 2.

required_dimension = 2
constant_term = 1

# Solving the equation n - 1 = 2 for n.
n = required_dimension + constant_term
