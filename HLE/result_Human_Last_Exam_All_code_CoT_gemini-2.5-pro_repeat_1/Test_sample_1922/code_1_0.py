    # Analysis of the options:
    # A. Correct. Augustine's later works on predestination are seen as a precursor to Calvinism.
    # B. Incorrect. The historian R. A. Markus is a prominent scholar of Augustine. It is inaccurate to claim he "ignored" the central concepts of predestination and grace in his analysis of Augustine's view on freedom. Scholarly work interprets these complex ideas; it does not ignore them.
    # C. Correct. Augustine developed the concept of the 'voluntas' (will) as a key part of the human psyche, engaging with classical thought (e.g., Seneca).
    # D. Correct. The fusion of philosophy and theology is a hallmark of Augustine's thought.
    # E. Correct. This accurately describes Ã‰tienne Gilson's influential interpretation of Augustine's concept of grace.
    # F. Correct. This accurately summarizes Augustine's early argument in "On Free Choice of the Will" with Evodius.
