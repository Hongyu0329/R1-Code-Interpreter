    # Option A
    print("A. Fifth position, third position in arms:")
    print("   - RBS 'Fifth position' typically refers to the feet.")
    print("   - Vaganova 'third position in arms' refers to the arms.")
    print("   - Result: Not equivalent as they describe different body parts.\n")

    # Option B
    print("B. First arabesque, third arabesque:")
    print("   - RBS 'First arabesque' has the arm opposite the supporting leg extended forward.")
    print("   - Vaganova 'Third arabesque', according to Vaganova's foundational teaching, has the same configuration.")
    print("   - Result: Equivalent. The fundamental pose is the same.\n")

    # Option C
    print("C. Assemblé, brisé:")
    print("   - 'Assemblé' is a jump from one foot landing on two feet.")
    print("   - 'Brisé' is a different, beaten jump.")
    print("   - Result: Not equivalent.\n")

    # Option D
    print("D. Pirouette en dedan, pirouette en dehor:")
    print("   - 'En dedan' (inward) and 'en dehor' (outward) are opposite directions of turning.")
    print("   - Result: Not equivalent; they are opposites.\n")

    # Option E
    print("E. Temps levé, sissonne:")
    print("   - 'Temps levé' is a hop from one foot, landing on the same foot.")
    print("   - 'Sissonne' is a jump from two feet.")
    print("   - Result: Not equivalent due to different takeoffs.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The correct pair of equivalent terms is First arabesque (RBS) and Third arabesque (Vaganova).")
