    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking for the name of an Oscar-nominated film featuring a specific, poignant scene. My plan is to identify the film and the character based on the user's description and then present this information using a simple Python script, as requested.\n\n1.  **Identify the film:** The scene described—where a character says \"Thank you\" on a bus and subsequently dies, sealing his fate—is one of the most famous endings in cinema history. This occurs in the film *Midnight Cowboy* (1969).\n2.  **Identify the character:** The character is Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman. His health has been declining throughout the film, and his dream is to go to Florida.\n3.  **Describe the scene:** His friend, Joe Buck (played by Jon Voight), finally gets the money to take him. On the bus to Florida, after Joe buys him new clothes, a very ill Ratso says \"Thank you\" to Joe. He passes away in his sleep on the bus shortly after, making those words his last.\n4.  **Confirm Oscar nomination:** *Midnight Cowboy* was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including Best Picture.\n5.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script that uses `print()` statements to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film and scene based on the user's query\n    and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Midnight Cowboy\"\n    character_name = \"Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo\"\n    context = (\n        \"In the Oscar-winning film 'Midnight Cowboy' (1969), the character \"\n        f\"{character_name} (played by Dustin Hoffman) is gravely ill. \"\n        \"His friend Joe Buck (Jon Voight) takes him on a bus to Florida to fulfill his dream. \"\n        \"After Joe buys him new clothes for the trip, a weak Ratso settles into his seat and \"\n        \"sincerely says 'Thank you' to Joe. He dies on the bus shortly after, \"\n        \"making this his final, fate-sealing line.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The film you're referring to is: {film_title}\")\n    print(\"\\nScene Description:\")\n    print(context)\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<Midnight Cowboy>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
