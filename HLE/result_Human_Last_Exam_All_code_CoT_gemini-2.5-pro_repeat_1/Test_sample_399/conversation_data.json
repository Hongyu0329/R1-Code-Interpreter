    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Separate the Variables**: The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$. We can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$. The equation is separable, so we can rearrange it to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n    $$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n\n2.  **Integrate Both Sides**: Now, we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\n    The integration yields:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the Initial Condition**: We use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of $C$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n4.  **Find the Particular Solution**: Substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    To find $x(t)$, we can solve for $x$:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\n    $$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\n    To simplify, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 8:\n    $$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\n\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$.\n    $$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final value.\n\n```python\n# The value of t for which we want to find x(t)\nt = 1\n\n# The equation for x(t) is x(t) = 8 / (-4*t^2 + 8*t - 1)\n# Let's calculate the numerator and denominator for t=1\n\n# Numerator is constant\nnumerator = 8\n\n# Terms in the denominator\nterm1_coeff = -4\nterm2_coeff = 8\nterm3_coeff = -1\n\n# Calculate the denominator value\ndenominator_val = term1_coeff * (t**2) + term2_coeff * t + term3_coeff\n\n# Calculate the final value of x(1)\nx_1 = numerator / denominator_val\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in\nprint(f\"The solution to the differential equation is x(t) = 8 / (-4*t^2 + 8*t - 1).\")\nprint(f\"To find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1_coeff}*({t})^2 + {term2_coeff}*({t}) + {term3_coeff})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term1_coeff * (t**2)} + {term2_coeff * t} + {term3_coeff})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / {denominator_val}\")\nprint(f\"The final value is: {x_1}\")\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
