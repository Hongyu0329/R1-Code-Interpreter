    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of a set S of Diophantine equations.
    Let's analyze the conditions for a Diophantine equation D to be in S:
    1. D has no solutions in the natural numbers.
    2. The unsolvability of D is unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC).
    3. The unsolvability of D is provable in ZFC + psi, where psi is a statement that is true in a generic extension M[G] of a model M where psi is false.

    Step 1: Find an upper bound for the cardinality of S.
    A Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. The set of all such polynomials is countably infinite. Since S is a subset of the set of all Diophantine equations, its cardinality can be at most countably infinite (aleph_0).

    Step 2: Show that a countably infinite cardinality is achievable.
    To do this, we need to construct an infinite sequence of Diophantine equations D_n that all belong to S for a suitable choice of psi.

    - Let ZFC_0 = ZFC.
    - Let ZFC_{n+1} = ZFC_n + Con(ZFC_n), where Con(T) is the Pi_1 arithmetical statement asserting the consistency of a theory T.
    - Let phi_n be the statement Con(ZFC_n). By the MRDP (Matiyasevich) theorem, each Pi_1 statement is equivalent to the unsolvability of a specific Diophantine equation D_n.

    - Condition 1 (Unsolvability): Assuming ZFC is consistent (which is a basic premise of the question), each theory ZFC_n is consistent, making each statement phi_n true. Thus, each corresponding equation D_n has no solution.

    - Condition 2 (Unprovability in ZFC): By GÃ¶del's second incompleteness theorem, if ZFC_n is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency. That is, ZFC_n does not prove phi_n. Since ZFC is a subtheory of ZFC_n, ZFC also cannot prove phi_n. This holds for all n, and the phi_n are distinct statements, so we have an infinite set of unprovable statements.

    - Condition 3 (Provability in ZFC + psi): We need to find a single statement psi, independent of ZFC, such that ZFC + psi proves phi_n for all n in N. A suitable choice for psi is a large cardinal axiom, for example, "there exists an inaccessible cardinal" (IC).
        - The axiom IC is known to be independent of ZFC. The premise of the problem requires that we can find a countable transitive model M of ZFC + not(IC) and a generic extension M[G] where IC holds. This is a standard result in modern set theory. (Note: The term "non-standard" in the prompt contradicts "transitive" and is likely a typo. The argument holds for a standard countable transitive model).
        - The theory ZFC + IC is powerful enough to prove the consistency of ZFC (phi_0), ZFC + Con(ZFC) (phi_1), and so on for any standard natural number n. Thus, ZFC + IC proves phi_n for all n.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    We have constructed an infinite sequence of Diophantine equations {D_n}_{n in N} that belongs to S for a valid choice of psi. This means the cardinality of S can be at least aleph_0.
    Since the cardinality is at most aleph_0 and can be at least aleph_0, the maximum possible cardinality of S is aleph_0.
