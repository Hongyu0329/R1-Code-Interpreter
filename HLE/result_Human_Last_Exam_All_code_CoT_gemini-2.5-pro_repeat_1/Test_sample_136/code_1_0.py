# The problem asks for the limit of a conditional probability for a simple random walk on a 2D torus.
# Let E_v be the event that vertex v is not visited by the random walk up to time t_n.
# We are asked to find the limit as n -> infinity of P(E_{x_0} | E_0).
# This can be written as P(E_{x_0} and E_0) / P(E_0).

# This type of problem, involving conditioning on a rare event for a random walk on a large graph,
# can be related to a problem on an infinite lattice (Z^2 in this case).
# The limit of the conditional probability is equivalent to the probability that a simple random walk on Z^2,
# starting from "infinity", hits the vertex 0 before it hits the vertex x_0.
# Let this probability be p = P_inf(H_0 < H_{x_0}), where H_v is the hitting time of vertex v.

# The vertex x_0 has exactly two common neighbours with 0=(0,0).
# The neighbours of 0 are {(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)}.
# If x_0 = (1,1), its neighbours are {(0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2)}.
# The common neighbours are (1,0) and (0,1), which are two. So x_0=(1,1) is a valid choice.

# We need to calculate p = P_inf(H_0 < H_{x_0}) for x_0 = (1,1).
# We can solve this using a symmetry argument.
# Let p(y) = P_y(H_0 < H_{x_0}) be the probability of hitting 0 before x_0, starting from y.
# Let q(y) = P_y(H_{x_0} < H_0) be the probability of hitting x_0 before 0, starting from y.
# Since a random walk on Z^2 is recurrent, it will eventually hit any finite set, so p(y) + q(y) = 1.

# Consider a symmetry transformation S(z) = x_0 - z. This transformation maps 0 to x_0 and x_0 to 0.
# The simple random walk has symmetric increments, so the law of the walk is invariant under this transformation.
# The probability of an event for a walk starting at y is the same as the probability of the transformed event for a walk starting at S(y).
# p(y) = P_y(H_0 < H_{x_0}) = P_{S(y)}(H_{S(0)} < H_{S(x_0)}) = P_{x_0-y}(H_{x_0} < H_0) = q(x_0-y).
# So, we have the relation p(y) = q(x_0-y).

# Using p(y) + q(y) = 1, we get q(x_0-y) = 1 - p(x_0-y).
# Thus, p(y) = 1 - p(x_0-y).

# We are interested in the limit as the starting point y goes to infinity. Let L = lim_{|y|->inf} p(y).
# As |y| -> inf, we also have |x_0-y| -> inf.
# Taking the limit of the equation p(y) = 1 - p(x_0-y), we get:
# L = 1 - L
# 2 * L = 1
# L = 1 / 2

# The limit of the conditional probability is 1/2.
# The final equation demonstrates this result.

p_inf_H0_lt_Hx0 = 1 / 2
result = p_inf_H0_lt_Hx0

# The problem asks for the probability of NOT visiting x_0 given we did NOT visit 0.
# This corresponds to the probability of hitting 0 before x_0 for a walk coming from infinity.
# So the result is L itself.
