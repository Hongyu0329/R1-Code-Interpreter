    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\nSecond, I will find the formula the game uses to scale boss health based on the number of players.\nThird, I will determine the maximum number of players the game's code accounts for in this calculation, as a truly infinite number would result in infinite health. The game architecture caps the player count for health scaling purposes.\nFinally, I will use these values in a Python script to calculate the theoretical maximum health and print the full equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n\n    In Expert Mode, boss health scales with the number of players. While the prompt asks for\n    an infinite number of players, the game's health scaling is capped at the value for 256 players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n\n    # Health bonus per player (after the first) in Expert Mode.\n    player_health_bonus = 0.35\n\n    # The game caps the player count for health scaling at 256.\n    max_players_for_scaling = 256\n\n    # The health scaling formula is: BaseHealth * (1 + PlayerBonus * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    # We substitute the values to find the maximum health.\n    \n    # Calculate the multiplier\n    health_multiplier = 1 + player_health_bonus * (max_players_for_scaling - 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the final health\n    max_health = base_health * health_multiplier\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation\n    print(\"The formula for boss health scaling in Expert Mode is: BaseHealth * (1 + PlayerBonus * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is based on the game's maximum player scaling cap of {max_players_for_scaling} players.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # Using int() for health values as the game uses integers for health.\n    print(f\"{base_health} * (1 + {player_health_bonus} * ({max_players_for_scaling} - 1)) = {int(max_health)}\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_max_health()\n```\n<<<328490>>>"
