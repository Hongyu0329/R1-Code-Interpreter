# The problem is to find x0 such that y(x0) = -3.
# Based on the analysis of the differential equation and its initial conditions y(0)=-1 and y'(0)=-1,
# a candidate solution y(x) = -sqrt(2x+1) was derived.
# We solve for x0 using this solution.

y0 = -3

# The equation to solve is y0 = -sqrt(2*x0 + 1)
# Step 1: Square both sides
# y0^2 = 2*x0 + 1
# Step 2: Isolate x0
# x0 = (y0^2 - 1) / 2

x0 = (y0**2 - 1) / 2
