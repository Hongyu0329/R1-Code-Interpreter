    "The song you are referring to is **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul* (1965).\n\nWhile the song doesn't start with this chord change from the very first beat, this specific and musically sophisticated progression is the core of its famous bridge section. Here is a breakdown of the musical theory:\n\n1.  **The Key:** The song's bridge section, which begins with the lyrics \"I love you, I love you, I love you...\", shifts into the key of F minor.\n2.  **The Tonic Chord (i):** In the key of F minor, the tonic or \"home\" chord is **F minor**.\n3.  **The Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The fifth note of the F minor scale is C. A minor chord built on this note is a **C minor** chord. In classical harmony, the fifth chord is typically major (the dominant V), so using a minor fifth (v) is a distinct and evocative choice.\n4.  **The Progression:** On the words \"I love you\", the harmony jumps from the tonic F minor (i) to the minor fifth C minor (v), perfectly matching your description.\n\nThe following Python script will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song that uses a\n    tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key_of_section = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F minor\"\n    roman_numeral_tonic = \"i\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor\"\n    roman_numeral_minor_fifth = \"v\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that features a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis progression is a key feature of the song's bridge ('I love you, I love you, I love you...').\")\n    print(f\"In the key of {key_of_section} for that section, the progression is as follows:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The Tonic Chord ({roman_numeral_tonic}): {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"The Minor Fifth Chord ({roman_numeral_minor_fifth}): {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The chord change from '{tonic_chord}' to '{minor_fifth_chord}' on the words 'I love' is the moment you are asking about.\")\n\nsolve_beatles_riddle()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
