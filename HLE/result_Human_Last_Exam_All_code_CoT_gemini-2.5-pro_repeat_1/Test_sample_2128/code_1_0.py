# The problem is to find the value of 1/p_1000.
# The index n for the sequence is 1000.
n = 1000

# Based on the derivation, the formula for 1/p_n is 4 * cos^2(pi / (n + 2)).
# For n = 1000, the final equation for the value we want is 1/p_1000 = 4 * cos^2(pi / 1002).

# The numbers in this final equation are:
coefficient = 4
denominator = n + 2
exponent = 2

# We print the numbers as requested.
print(f"The calculation is based on the equation: {coefficient} * (cos(pi / {denominator}))^{exponent}")

# Calculate the numerical value.
value = coefficient * (math.cos(math.pi / denominator)) ** exponent

# Print the final result.
print(f"\nThe value of 1/p_1000 is: {value}")
