    Explains how a bacterium with a stable genome can acquire drug resistance

    """
    explanation = """
The core of the question is to explain how a seemingly slow process (vertical inheritance of mutations) can match the speed of a fast process (lateral gene transfer) for acquiring drug resistance.

Let's break down why option B is the most complete answer:

1.  **Rare Resistance Mutations:** This is the necessary starting point for a bacterium without lateral transfer. A random mutation must occur that confers resistance.

2.  **Compensatory Mutations & Fitness:** Resistance mutations often come with a "fitness cost," meaning they might make the bacterium grow slower or be less robust in other ways. A compensatory mutation is a second mutation that alleviates this cost. This makes the new resistant strain highly competitive, allowing it to spread rapidly through the population once it appears.

3.  **Cross-Resistance:** This is the key to matching the *pace*. Cross-resistance is when a single mutation confers resistance to multiple, often related, drugs. While the bacterium with lateral transfer might need to acquire three different plasmids to resist three different drugs, the second bacterium could achieve the same outcome with a single mutational event (or a small number of them).

4.  **Putting It Together (The Power of Option B):** Option B combines all these powerful concepts. A rare mutation occurs that provides cross-resistance to several drugs at once. This event is then followed by compensatory mutations that eliminate any fitness cost, creating a "super-fit" and multi-drug resistant strain. This new strain can then proliferate so rapidly that the overall pace of acquiring resistance in the population matches that of the bacterium using lateral gene transfer. The other options are incomplete as they miss one or more of these crucial accelerating factors.
