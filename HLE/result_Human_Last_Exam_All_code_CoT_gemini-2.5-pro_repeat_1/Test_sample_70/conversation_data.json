    "To find the African national flags with the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag**: First, we'll represent the Danish flag as a matrix. Its design consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. This structure can be simplified into a 3x3 matrix where the central row and column represent the white cross. To ensure the rank is maximal as per the problem statement, we'll assign distinct numerical values to the different colors. This structure fundamentally creates two unique row patterns and two unique column patterns, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\n2.  **Model African Flags as Matrices**: We will represent the geometric structure of various African flags as matrices. The goal is to capture the essential patterns that determine the flag's rank:\n    *   **Rank 1**: Flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Gabon) will have a rank of 1, as all rows (or columns) are linearly dependent.\n    *   **Rank 2**: Flags with more complex structures, like a vertical bar combined with horizontal stripes (e.g., Madagascar, Benin) or a canton on a striped field (e.g., Liberia, Togo), create exactly two linearly independent patterns, resulting in a rank of 2. An emblem on a plain field (e.g., Somalia) also results in rank 2.\n    *   **Rank 3 or higher**: Flags with complex diagonal elements or multiple distinct fields (e.g., South Africa, Namibia) will have three or more linearly independent patterns, resulting in a rank of 3.\n\n3.  **Calculate and Compare Ranks**: Using Python and the NumPy library, we will programmatically calculate the rank of the matrix for the Danish flag and for each of the modeled African flags.\n\n4.  **Identify and Print Matches**: The code will then compare the rank of each African flag to the rank of the Danish flag and print the names of the countries whose flags have the same rank.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_matrix_rank(matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the rank of a given matrix.\"\"\"\n    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(np.array(matrix))\n\n# --- Define Flag Matrices ---\n# The matrices represent the geometric structure of the flags.\n# We assign unique numbers to distinct color/pattern regions to ensure maximal rank.\n\n# Denmark's flag has a Scandinavian cross structure, which creates two\n# independent row/column patterns.\n# Let Red=1, White=2.
