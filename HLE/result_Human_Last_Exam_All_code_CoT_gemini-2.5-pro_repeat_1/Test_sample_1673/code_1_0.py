    1.  **Reaction Analysis:**
        The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the primary alcohol group (-OH) of {reactant_1} on the electrophilic carbon of {reactant_2}. Pyridine acts as a base to neutralize the HCl byproduct. This reaction forms an O,O-disubstituted thionocarbonate ester.

    2.  **Product Identification:**
        Based on the reaction mechanism, Compound 1 is {product_name}.

    3.  **NMR Evidence:**
        The provided NMR data strongly supports this conclusion. The proton being observed is the vinylic proton at the C2 position of the geraniol backbone, which is adjacent to the C1-OH group where the reaction occurs.

        - In Geraniol, this proton's signal is at: {initial_proton_shift}
        - In Compound 1, this proton's signal is at: {product_proton_shift}

        The formation of the new, electron-withdrawing thionocarbonate group at C1 significantly deshields the adjacent C2 proton. This deshielding effect causes its signal to shift downfield (to a higher ppm value) from ~5.35 ppm to 5.97 ppm. This large shift confirms that the reaction occurred at the C1 position as predicted.
