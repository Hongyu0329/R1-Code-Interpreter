    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the problem from a topological perspective. The problem statement involves concepts like \"closed sets,\" \"connected sets,\" and \"components,\" which are fundamental in topology.\n2.  I will refer to a known mathematical theorem that directly addresses this question for sets in a plane or higher-dimensional spaces. This theorem provides a definitive theoretical answer.\n3.  The prompt requires a solution using coding skills. A mathematical theorem isn't code. Therefore, I will construct a sophisticated example of two sets, A and B, that fit the criteria. This construction will be designed in a way that intuitively might lead to a disconnected intersection. This will be a strong test case.\n4.  I will write a Python script to implement this construction on a discrete grid, representing the unit square. The script will use the `numpy` library for grid manipulation and `scipy.ndimage` for computational analysis of connectivity.\n5.  The script will perform the following steps:\n    *   Create a grid representing the unit square.\n    *   Define the two closed, connected sets A and B on this grid using an \"interlocking fingers\" or \"comb\" design. This design is a good candidate for creating multiple intersection components.\n    *   Verify that both A and B are indeed connected by counting their connected components.\n    *   Compute their intersection, C = A ∩ B.\n    *   Count the number of connected components of the intersection C.\n6.  The code's output will demonstrate that even for this complex construction, the intersection remains a single connected component, providing a computational illustration of the mathematical theorem.\n7.  Finally, based on the theorem and the computational evidence, I will state the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef solve_intersection_components():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and analyzes two closed connected sets whose union is a square,\n    to find the number of components in their intersection.\n\n    The problem is a classic one in topology. A theorem states that for any two\n    closed, connected sets in the plane whose union is a simply connected region\n    (like a square), their intersection must also be connected. This implies the\n    number of connected components is 1.\n\n    This script provides a computational illustration of this theorem. We construct\n    a non-trivial example of sets A and B that are closed and connected and whose\n    union is the square. We then computationally find their intersection and count its\n    connected components. The expectation is to find exactly one component.\n\n    We use an \"interlocking fingers\" design, which is a good candidate for\n    potentially creating a disconnected intersection.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
