def solve_mutual_inductance_change():
    """
    This function symbolically derives the expression for the change in mutual inductance (ΔM)
    between two circuits when enclosed by a magnetic concentrator.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. Define the mutual inductance for bare circuits (M1) using the dipole approximation.
    2. Model the effect of the concentrator on the inductance.
    3. Calculate the new inductance (M2).
    4. Compute the change ΔM = M2 - M1.
