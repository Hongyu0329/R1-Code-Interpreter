    # Step 1: Analyze the condition A+A is a subset of A x A.
    # A is a finite set of positive integers.
    # A+A = {a + b | a in A, b in A}. The elements of A+A are integers.
    # A x A = {(a, b) | a in A, b in A}. The elements of A x A are ordered pairs (tuples in Python).

    # In mathematics and in Python, integers and tuples are distinct types.
    # An integer can never be equal to an ordered pair.
    # For example, 4 is not equal to (2, 2).
    # print(f"Is the integer 4 equal to the tuple (2, 2)? {4 == (2, 2)}")

    # Step 2: Conclude on the nature of A.
    # The condition "A+A is a subset of A x A" means every element in A+A
    # must also be in A x A.
    # Since the set of integers A+A and the set of tuples A x A are disjoint,
    # their intersection is the empty set.
    # The subset condition can therefore only hold if A+A is the empty set.
    # A+A is empty if and only if A is empty.

    # So, the only set A satisfying the condition is A = set().

    # Step 3: Analyze the definition of Sigma.
    # Let B = {A | A is a finite subset of positive integers and A+A is a subset of A x A}.
    # From our analysis, B = {set()}.
    # Sigma is defined as B without the empty set and without the set {2}.
    # Sigma = B \ {set(), {2}}
    # Sigma = {set()} \ {set(), {2}}
    # This results in an empty set for Sigma.

    # Step 4: Determine the final result.
    # The problem asks for min(max(A) for A in Sigma) if Sigma is not empty,
    # and to return 0 otherwise.
    # Since Sigma is empty, the result is 0.

    result = 0
    print("The logical analysis shows that the set Sigma is empty.")
    print(f"The problem requires returning 0 in this case.")
    print(f"The final result is: {result}")
