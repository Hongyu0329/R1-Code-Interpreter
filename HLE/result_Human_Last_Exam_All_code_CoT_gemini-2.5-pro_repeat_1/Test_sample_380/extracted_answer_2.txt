The local magnetic field at L1 is generally not radial due to the Parker Spiral. The use of Y and Z components for helicity is a common but simplified approach based on a standard coordinate system (like GSE) where the X-axis is radial; a more rigorous calculation requires finding the components truly perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field vector.
