# Plan:
# 1. Define the effect of the first compound on ALDH levels. Electrophiles like (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal activate the Nrf2 pathway, which increases the expression of detoxifying enzymes like ALDH.
# 2. Define the relative effect of the second compound, 4-OI. 4-OI is a known potent Nrf2 activator, likely causing a stronger response.
# 3. Identify the key protein in this pathway, which is the sensor for electrophiles.
# 4. Combine the findings and print the result.

# Step 1: Determine ALDH change
aldh_change = "increase"

# Step 2: Compare with 4-OI
comparison = "more"

# Step 3: Identify the key protein
protein = "Keap1"

# Step 4: Print the final answer components
print(f"When 50 uM (2E)-4-Hydroxy-2-nonen-8-ynal was treated in raw 264.7 cells, the amount of ALDH will {aldh_change}.")
print(f"If we use 50 uM 4-OI, the change will be {comparison}.")
print(f"The protein involved in this process is {protein}.")
