    "Of course. Ignoring Gettier problems, the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge faces two significant issues when our only epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". These problems arise from the nature of the \"Justification\" and \"Truth\" conditions themselves.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to model the JTB definition and then demonstrate these two problems with concrete examples.\n\n1.  **Problem 1: The Justification-Truth Gap.** This problem deals with beliefs that are well-justified but happen to be false. Our justification for a belief can be incredibly strong, but that doesn't guarantee the belief is actually true.\n2.  **Problem 2: The Regress Problem of Justification.** This problem deals with true beliefs that lack proper justification. It exposes the difficulty in defining what counts as *sufficient* justification. If every justification needs its own justification, we face an infinite regress, making it impossible to definitively ground any piece of knowledge.\n\nThe following Python code will define a JTB classifier and then use it to illustrate these two problematic cases.\n\n```python\ndef jtb_classifier(belief_statement, is_true, is_justified):\n    \"\"\"\n    Classifies a belief as Knowledge or Belief based on the JTB definition.\n    A belief is Knowledge if and only if it is Justified and True.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing Belief: \\\"{belief_statement}\\\"\")\n    print(f\"Is it true? {is_true}\")\n    print(f\"Is it justified? {is_justified}\")\n\n    if is_justified and is_true:\n        epistemic_state = \"Knowledge\"\n    else:\n        epistemic_state = \"Belief\"\n\n    print(f\"JTB Conclusion: This is a '{epistemic_state}'.\")\n    return epistemic_state\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the two main problems with the JTB definition of knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- JTB Knowledge Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Ignoring Gettier problems, let's examine two issues with the JTB model.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Problem 1: Justified False Beliefs (The Justification-Truth Gap) ---\n    print(\"--- Problem 1: Justified False Beliefs ---\")\n    print(\"This problem occurs when a belief is strongly justified but is ultimately false. Justification does not guarantee truth.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    belief1 = \"The sun revolves around the Earth.\"\n    # For centuries, this was justified by the best available evidence (Ptolemaic system).\n    is_true1 = False\n    is_justified1 = True\n    jtb_classifier(belief1, is_true1, is_justified1)\n    print(\"Explanation: Even a perfectly rational and well-supported belief is not knowledge if it turns out to be false. This highlights a gap between our best justifications and reality.\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Problem 2: The Regress Problem of Justification ---\n    print(\"--- Problem 2: The Regress Problem of Justification ---\")\n    print(\"This problem occurs with true beliefs that are not properly justified (e.g., a lucky guess). It raises the question: what is sufficient justification?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    belief2 = \"My lottery ticket number 12345 will win.\"\n    # Let's say, by pure luck, it does win.\n    is_true2 = True\n    # The belief was based on a guess, not evidence.\n    is_justified2 = False\n    jtb_classifier(belief2, is_true2, is_justified2)\n    print(\"Explanation: This is a 'True Belief', but not knowledge. To make it knowledge, it needs justification. But any justification (e.g., 'because a psychic told me') would itself require another justification, leading to a potential infinite regress.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1.
