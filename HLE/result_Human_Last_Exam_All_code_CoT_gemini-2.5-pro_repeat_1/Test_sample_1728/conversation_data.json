    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define the Graph and the Operation**: Understand the graph \\( G \\) as the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), denoted \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The \"sum\" here refers to the disjunctive product (or tensor sum) of graphs. For \\( G = G_1 + G_2 \\), two vertices \\( (u_1, u_2) \\) and \\( (v_1, v_2) \\) are adjacent if \\( u_1 \\) is adjacent to \\( v_1 \\) in \\( G_1 \\) or \\( u_2 \\) is adjacent to \\( v_2 \\) in \\( G_2 \\).\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: We can establish an upper bound on the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) using a product coloring. A coloring can be constructed by assigning a color tuple \\( (c_1, c_2, c_3) \\) to each vertex \\( (v_1, v_2, v_3) \\), where \\( c_i \\) is the color of \\( v_i \\) in an optimal coloring of \\( C_n \\). This shows that \\( \\chi(G) \\le (\\chi(C_n))^3 \\).\n3.  **Analyze based on \\( n \\)**: The chromatic number of a cycle, \\( \\chi(C_n) \\), depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\), giving an upper bound of \\( \\chi(G) \\le 2^3 = 8 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\), giving an upper bound of \\( \\chi(G) \\le 3^3 = 27 \\).\n4.  **Establish a Lower Bound**: A lower bound for the chromatic number is given by \\( \\chi(G) \\ge \\frac{|V(G)|}{\\alpha(G)} \\), where \\( |V(G)| \\) is the number of vertices and \\( \\alpha(G) \\) is the independence number (size of the maximum independent set).\n    *   For \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), we have \\( |V(G)| = n^3 \\) and \\( \\alpha(G) = (\\alpha(C_n))^3 \\).\n    *   Since \\( \\alpha(C_n) = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\), the lower bound is \\( \\frac{n^3}{(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)^3} \\).\n5.  **Evaluate for Specific Cases**:\n    *   For even \\( n \\), the lower bound is \\( \\frac{n^3}{(n/2)^3} = 8 \\). Combined with the upper bound, this proves \\( \\chi(G) = 8 \\) for even \\( n \\).\n    *   For \\( n=3 \\), the cycle \\( C_3 \\) is a complete graph \\( K_3 \\). The graph \\( G \\) becomes \\( K_3 + K_3 + K_3 \\). The sum of complete graphs is a complete graph on the product of the vertex sets. Thus, \\( G = K_{3^3} = K_{27} \\), and its chromatic number is 27.\n6.  **Conclude the Maximum**: We have shown that for even \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(G)=8 \\), and for odd \\( n \\), \\( \\chi(G) \\le 27 \\). Since the value 27 is achieved for \\( n=3 \\), the maximal chromatic number is 27.\n\nThis logic will be implemented in the Python script below to derive the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    It does so by reasoning about the properties of the graph sum and cycles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the maximal chromatic number of G = C_n + C_n + C_n:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Upper Bound Analysis\n    print(\"\\n1.
