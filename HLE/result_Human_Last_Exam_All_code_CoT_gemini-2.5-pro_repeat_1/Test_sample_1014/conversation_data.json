    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will write a Python script that performs prime factorization on the number.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  The script will first handle the smallest prime factor, 2, by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until it's no longer even.\n3.  Then, it will iterate through odd numbers, starting from 3, up to the square root of the remaining `n`. For each odd number `i`, it will repeatedly divide `n` by `i` to find all instances of that factor.\n4.  If, after these steps, the value of `n` is still greater than 2, the remaining `n` must be a prime number itself, and it will be the largest prime factor.\n5.  Throughout this process, all prime factors found will be collected.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the prime factorization in an equation format and then state the largest prime factor found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of a given number, prints the factorization equation,\n    and then prints the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_number = number\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle factor 2\n    while number % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        number //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors from 3 up to sqrt(number)\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(number)) + 1, 2):\n        while number % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            number //= i\n\n    # If the remaining number is a prime greater than 2\n    if number > 2:\n        factors.append(number)\n\n    if not factors:\n        # This case happens if the original number is prime\n        factors.append(original_number)\n\n    # Construct the equation string\n    equation = f\"{original_number} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(equation)\n    \n    # Find and print the largest prime divisor\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for numbers less than 2\n        print(f\"There are no prime divisors for {original_number}\")\n\n# The number to be factored\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(8139881)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
