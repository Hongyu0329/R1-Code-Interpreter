    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the System:** I will model the light quanta (photons) in a single mode as a system of Bose particles. The energy levels are discrete and given by `ε_j = j * ε`, where `ε` is the energy of a single quantum (`hν`) and `j` is an integer (0, 1, 2, ...).\n2.  **Apply Maximum Entropy Principle:** The equilibrium state of a system is the one with the maximum entropy, subject to physical constraints. This principle is justified by Large Deviation Theory. The **Boltzmann-Sanov theorem** shows that the probability of observing an empirical distribution `p` far from the equilibrium distribution `p*` is exponentially small, `P(p) ≈ exp(-N * D_KL(p || p*))`, where `D_KL` is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Maximizing the statistical entropy `S = -k Σ p_j ln(p_j)` is equivalent to finding the most probable distribution `p_j` that the system will be in at equilibrium.\n3.  **Set up Constraints:** The maximization of entropy will be subject to two constraints:\n    *   **Normalization:** The probabilities must sum to one: `Σ p_j = 1`.\n    *   **Fixed Mean Energy:** The average energy per particle `<u>` is constant: `Σ p_j * ε_j = <u>`. The **Cramer-Chernoff theorem** provides the probability of large deviations for the sample mean, reinforcing that the system will overwhelmingly be found at its calculated mean energy.\n4.  **Derive the Equilibrium Formulas:** Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, I will solve the constrained optimization problem. This yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for this system, `p_j = exp(-β*ε_j) / Z`, where `Z` is the partition function and `β` is the Lagrange multiplier related to temperature (`β = 1/(kT)`).\n5.  **Calculate Mean Energy and Entropy:** From the derived probability distribution, I will first calculate the partition function `Z`. Then, I will derive the analytical formulas for the equilibrium mean energy `<u>` and the equilibrium entropy `s` per particle.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that first prints the derived symbolic formulas for mean energy `<u>` and entropy `s`. It will then calculate and display the numerical results for a specific example, showing the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_and_display_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta, based on large deviation principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables for printing equations\n    beta_sym = \"β\"\n    epsilon_sym = \"ε\"\n    k_b_sym = \"k\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Symbolic Derivation Display ---\n    print(\"---[ Symbolic Derivation ]---\\n\")\n\n    # Derivation of Mean Energy\n    print(\"1.
