    Step 1: Understanding Somatic Instability in Myotonic Dystrophy
    In Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1), the disease is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat in the DMPK gene. This repeat is unstable in somatic cells, meaning it tends to expand further throughout an individual's lifetime, which correlates with disease progression. This process is called somatic instability.

    Step 2: The Mechanism of Repeat Expansion
    This instability primarily occurs during DNA replication. The repetitive CTG sequence on the template for the lagging strand can form a stable hairpin structure. When the replication machinery synthesizes the new strand, this hairpin can cause slippage, leading to the synthesis of extra CTG repeats.

    Step 3: The Role of DNA Ligase I (LIG1)
    LIG1 is an essential enzyme whose primary job is to seal single-strand breaks ('nicks') in DNA, most notably joining Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand replication.

    Step 4: Connecting LIG1 to CTG Expansion
    For the newly synthesized extra repeats (the expansion) to become a permanent part of the chromosome, the DNA flap containing them must be fully integrated. LIG1 performs the critical final step: it ligates the fragment containing the expansion to the rest of the newly synthesized DNA strand. By sealing the nick, LIG1 finalizes and perpetuates the expansion.

    Step 5: The Impact of Knocking Out LIG1
    If LIG1 is knocked out or its function is significantly reduced, this final ligation step is blocked. The expanded DNA flap cannot be sealed into the new DNA strand. This unligated intermediate is recognized by the cell's repair machinery as an error and is typically removed.

    Conclusion:
    By preventing the permanent incorporation of newly expanded repeats, the absence of LIG1 leads to a significant reduction in the frequency of expansion events. Therefore, knocking out LIG1 results in reduced somatic instability of the CTG repeat.
