    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Count Total Edge Squares:** I will first calculate the total number of squares on the perimeter of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  **Analyze Bishop Placement:** The key to placing the maximum number of bishops is to remember that bishops only attack other bishops on squares of the same color. Therefore, I can analyze the white edge squares and black edge squares as two separate problems.\n3.  **Find Maximum Bishops Per Color:** On an 8x8 board, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares. I will determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on each set of 14 squares. This involves identifying pairs of squares that lie on the same diagonal.\n    *   For the 14 white edge squares, only the corners `a1` and `h8` are on the same diagonal. Thus, we can place a maximum of `14 - 1 = 13` bishops on the white edge squares.\n    *   For the 14 black edge squares, only the corners `h1` and `a8` are on the same diagonal. Thus, we can also place a maximum of `14 - 1 = 13` bishops on the black edge squares.\n4.  **Calculate Total Placed Bishops:** The total maximum number of bishops is the sum of the maximums for each color (`13 + 13 = 26`).\n5.  **Find Empty Squares:** Finally, I will subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find the answer. The code will print this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishops_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of an 8x8 chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An N x N board has 4 sides of N squares, but the 4 corners are counted twice.\n    # So, the formula is 4 * N - 4.\n    total_edge_squares = 4 * board_size - 4\n\n    # Step 2: The edge squares are split evenly between two colors.\n    white_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n    black_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: For each color, find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # On the white edge squares, only the corners a1 and h8 attack each other.\n    # So we must leave one of them empty.\n    # Number of conflicting pairs on white squares is 1.\n    max_white_bishops = white_edge_squares - 1\n\n    # On the black edge squares, only the corners a8 and h1 attack each other.\n    # So we must leave one of them empty.\n    # Number of conflicting pairs on black squares is 1.\n    max_black_bishops = black_edge_squares - 1\n\n    # Step 4: The total maximum number of bishops is the sum for both colors.\n    total_max_bishops = max_white_bishops + max_black_bishops\n\n    # Step 5: The number of empty squares is the total minus the number of placed bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_max_bishops\n\n    print(\"This puzzle is about placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\")\n    print(f\"A standard {board_size}x{board_size} board has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these squares is {total_max_bishops}.\")\n    print(\"The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of placed bishops.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    # The final equation as requested by the user\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {total_max_bishops} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishops_puzzle()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
