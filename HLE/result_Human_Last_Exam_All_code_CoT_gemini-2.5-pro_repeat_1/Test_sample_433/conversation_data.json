    "Based on pharmaceutical compounding standards, specifically USP Chapter <797>, I will create a Python script to explain and provide the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the variables for the container type (single-dose ampule) and the environment (sterile).\n2.  Explain the rule for handling opened ampules. An ampule is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\n3.  Based on this rule, determine the BUD. Since it cannot be resealed, its contents must be used immediately, and it cannot be stored.\n4.  The script will print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the scenario\ncontainer_type = \"single-dose container ampule\"\nenvironment = \"sterile environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n\n# Explain the reasoning based on pharmaceutical standards (USP <797>)\nprint(f\"Scenario: Determining the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a {container_type}.\")\nprint(f\"Opened in a: {environment}.\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"Guideline based on United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards:\")\nprint(\"1. An ampule is a sealed glass container that is broken open to access its contents.\")\nprint(\"2.
