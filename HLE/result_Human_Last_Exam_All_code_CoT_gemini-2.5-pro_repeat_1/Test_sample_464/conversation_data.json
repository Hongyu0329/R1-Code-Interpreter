    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is the step-by-step reasoning, followed by a Python script that illustrates the underlying principles.\n\n### Plan and Mathematical Proof\n\n1.  **State the Goal:** We want to prove that if a Schwartz function $f(x)$ has all its moments equal to zero, then the function itself must be the zero function. We will assume the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ includes 0, so the condition is $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all integers $k \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **Use the Fourier Transform:** The key to this proof is to analyze the properties of the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. Let's denote the Fourier transform of $f$ as $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n    A fundamental property of Schwartz functions is that the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is also a Schwartz function. This means $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is infinitely differentiable and decays rapidly.\n\n3.  **Relate Moments to Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:** Let's compute the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ with respect to $\\xi$. By differentiating under the integral sign (which is permissible for Schwartz functions), we get:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\n\n4.  **Evaluate at the Origin:** Now, let's evaluate this $k$-th derivative at the point $\\xi = 0$:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{0} \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\n    This equation establishes a direct link between the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin and the moments of the original function $f(x)$.\n\n5.  **Apply the Given Condition:** The problem states that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero.\n    $$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n    Substituting this into our derivative formula, we find that:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ge 0 $$\n    This means that the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n\n6.  **Use Analyticity:** A crucial property of Schwartz functions is that they are analytic on the real line. This means that the function is equal to its Taylor series expansion around any point. The Taylor series for $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$ is:\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\n    Since we found that $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, every term in this series is zero.\n    $$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{0}{k!} \\xi^k = 0 $$\n    Therefore, the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero for all $\\xi$.\n\n7.  **Invert the Fourier Transform:** The Fourier transform is an invertible map on the space of Schwartz functions. This means that if the transform of a function is zero, the original function must also have been zero. Since $\\hat{f} = 0$, it follows that $f = 0$.\n\nThis completes the proof. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to computationally illustrate that a non-zero Schwartz function will have at least one non-zero moment, which supports the conclusion of the proof.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import integrate, exp, oo, Symbol, pi\n\ndef illustrate_moments():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that a non-zero Schwartz function generally has non-zero moments.\n    It serves as a computational illustration for the proof that if all moments are zero,\n    the function must be zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Let's choose a simple, non-zero Schwartz function: a Gaussian.\n    # f(x) = exp(-x^2)\n    # This function is non-zero, so according to our proof, it must have at least one non-zero moment.\n    f_x = exp(-x**2)\n    \n    print(f\"Testing the non-zero Schwartz function f(x) = {f_x}\")\n    print(\"According to the theorem, this function must have at least one non-zero moment.\")\n    \n    # We will calculate its moments for k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    # The k-th moment is the integral of x^k * f(x) from -oo to oo.\n    \n    max_k_to_check = 5\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating moments for k = 0 to {max_k_to_check}:\")\n    \n    all_moments_zero = True\n    for k in range(max_k_to_check + 1):\n        integrand = x**k * f_x\n        # Use sympy to perform the symbolic integration\n        moment = integrate(integrand, (x, -oo, oo))\n        \n        # The equation for the k-th moment is:\n        # Integral(x^k * exp(-x^2), (x, -oo, oo)) = moment\n        print(f\"Moment k={k}: ∫(x^{k} * e^(-x²)) dx = {moment}\")\n        \n        if moment != 0:\n            all_moments_zero = False\n            \n    print(\"\\n--- Illustration Conclusion ---\")\n    if not all_moments_zero:\n        print(\"As shown above, not all moments are zero (e.g., for k=0, 2, 4).\")\n        print(\"This is consistent with the fact that our chosen function f(x) is not identically zero.\")\n    else:\n        # This case won't be reached for our chosen function\n        print(\"All tested moments were zero. This is unexpected.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Result from Proof ---\")\n    print(\"The rigorous proof shows that if ALL moments were zero, the function would have to be f(x)=0.\")\n    # The prompt asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is f(x) = 0.\n    final_rhs = 0\n    print(f\"The resulting equation is: f(x) = {final_rhs}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    illustrate_moments()\n```\n<<<Yes, it follows that f = 0.>>>"
