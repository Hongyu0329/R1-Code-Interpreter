    This function calculates the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area
    to the square of the volume for the region traversed by particles from an emitter.

    The derivation shows that the ratio to be minimized is:
    Ratio = (16*pi/27) * [ (3*y + 1) + 2*(y+2)**(3/2) ]**3 / (y+1)**4
    where y = 2*g*h/v^2 is a dimensionless parameter.

    The minimum occurs at y_min = 11 + 4*sqrt(3). This code substitutes this
    value into the expression and simplifies it.
