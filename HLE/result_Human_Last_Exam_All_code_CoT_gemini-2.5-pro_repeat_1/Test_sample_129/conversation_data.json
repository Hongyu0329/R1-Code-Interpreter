    "An elegant way to solve this is to generate all possible combinations of the symbols, then for each combination, check if it forms a syntactically correct boolean expression, and if so, evaluate it.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the set of allowed symbols: `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`.\n2.  Generate all possible strings of length 5 using these symbols. There are 7^5 = 16,807 such strings.\n3.  For each generated string, convert it into a Python-evaluatable format. This involves replacing `T` with `True`, `F` with `False`, `&` with `and`, `|` with `or`, and `!` with `not`. We must add spaces around the operators to ensure correct parsing.\n4.  Use a `try-except` block to attempt to evaluate the converted string using Python's `eval()` function. This will filter out syntactically incorrect expressions (e.g., `T(F&`), which will raise a `SyntaxError`.\n5.  If an expression is successfully evaluated and results in a boolean value (`True` or `False`), we count it as a valid boolean expression.\n6.  We will keep separate counts for expressions that evaluate to `True` and those that evaluate to `False`.\n7.  Finally, to satisfy the user's request to \"output each number in the final equation\", we will print a summary equation showing the number of true expressions, false expressions, and the total number of valid expressions found. The final answer is the count of true expressions.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n    This function generates all possible 5-symbol strings from the set\n    {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, checks each for syntactic validity as a\n    boolean expression, and evaluates the valid ones. It then prints a\n    summary of the counts.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    length = 5\n\n    true_count = 0\n    false_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of the given length\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=length)\n\n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        expr_str = \"\".join(combo)\n\n        # Convert to a Python-evaluatable string\n        py_expr = expr_str.replace('T', ' True ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', ' False ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n        # 'not' is a prefix operator, space after is important\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the expression\n            result = eval(py_expr)\n\n            # Check if the result is a boolean\n            if isinstance(result, bool):\n                if result is True:\n                    true_count += 1\n                else:\n                    false_count += 1\n        except (SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError):\n            # Ignore invalid expressions\n            pass\n\n    valid_count = true_count + false_count\n    \n    # Print the \"final equation\" as requested\n    print(f\"Found {true_count} true expressions and {false_count} false expressions.\")\n    print(f\"This makes a total of {valid_count} valid boolean expressions.\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: {true_count} + {false_count} = {valid_count}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of true boolean expressions is: {true_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_true_boolean_expressions()\n\n<<<450>>>\n```"
