    # The problem concerns a tame functor f from an upper semilattice J to the category of vector spaces.
    # The key is understanding the implications of the term "tame" in representation theory.
    
    # Step 1: The existence of a "tame functor" implies the category of representations is of tame type.
    print("Step 1: The category of functors, Func(J, Vect_K), is of tame representation type.")
    
    # Step 2: Tame categories are characterized by the existence of so-called "regular" representations.
    print("Step 2: A tame category contains 'regular' representations (or functors).")
    
    # Step 3: These characteristic regular representations have a specific homological property.
    print("Step 3: A key property of these regular functors is that they have infinite projective dimension.")
    
    # Step 4: We connect this property to the definition of "n-resolvable".
    # A functor `f` is n-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length n.
    # An infinite projective dimension means that the minimal projective resolution is infinitely long:
    # ... -> P_n -> P_{n-1} -> ... -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0
    print("Step 4: A functor with infinite projective dimension has a projective resolution of any arbitrary length n.")

    print("\nConclusion: A tame functor (of the regular type) is n-resolvable for any non-negative integer n.")
    
    # The "final equation" describes the set of all possible values for n.
    # We output the numbers by describing the set.
    print("The final answer for n is the set of all non-negative integers.")
