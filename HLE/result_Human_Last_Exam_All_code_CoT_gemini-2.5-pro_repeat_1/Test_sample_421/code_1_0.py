    This function analyzes the topological puzzle and prints the solution.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct paths between the two ends of a
    line segment that intersects a circle twice.

    Let's define the key points in the space:
    - P: The starting end of the line segment.
    - Q: The other end of the line segment.
    - A, B: The two points where the line segment intersects the circle.

    A path from P to Q must proceed through these points. Assuming the points
    are ordered P, A, B, Q along the line, any path from P to Q is composed of:
    1. A segment from P to A.
    2. A path from A to B.
    3. A segment from B to Q.

    The number of distinct paths is therefore determined by the number of ways
    one can travel from A to B.

    The phrase "allowed to self intersect" could imply that loops are permitted,
    which would lead to an infinite number of paths (by repeatedly traversing
    any loop). However, in the context of such puzzles, "distinct paths" often
    refers to simple paths that do not revisit junction points. We adopt this
    interpretation to find a finite answer.
