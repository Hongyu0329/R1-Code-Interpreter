    "My plan is to first identify the architectural feature in question based on the historical context of the Piazza della Rotonda. While the user's prompt mentions the year 1950, historical records point to a different date for the removal of the most famous and controversial addition to the Pantheon. I will create a Python script that stores this historical information in a data structure and then prints a descriptive answer, clarifying the feature and the correct timeline.\n\n```python\ndef solve_piazza_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and retrieves historical information\n    about the Piazza della Rotonda to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical data about the feature removed from the Pantheon\n    removed_feature_data = {\n        'name': \"Twin bell towers\",\n        'nickname': \"The donkey's ears (le orecchie d'asino)\",\n        'architect': \"Gian Lorenzo Bernini (common attribution)\",\n        'reason_for_removal': \"Considered out of harmony with the classical facade of the Pantheon.\",\n        'actual_removal_year': 1883\n    }\n\n    feature_name = removed_feature_data['name']\n    nickname = removed_feature_data['nickname']\n    removal_year = removed_feature_data['actual_removal_year']\n    \n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature in question was a set of {feature_name}.\")\n    print(f\"They were added in the 17th century and were widely known by their derogatory nickname: '{nickname}'.\")\n    print(f\"Although the prompt mentions 1950, historical records show they were actually removed in {removal_year}.\")\n\nsolve_piazza_riddle()\n```\n<<<A pair of twin bell towers, often nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino).

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
