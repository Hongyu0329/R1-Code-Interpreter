# Step 1: Define the number of pas de Balanchines based on choreographic analysis.
# William Forsythe's choreographic language is distinct from and a deconstruction
# of the neoclassical style of George Balanchine. The "pas de Balanchine" is a
# signature step of Balanchine and is not a component of Forsythe's vocabulary.
# Therefore, the number of pas de Balanchines in this solo is 0.
pas_de_balanchines_count = 0

# Step 2: Create a simple equation to fulfill the output requirement.
# We will use a simple multiplication to display the count as an equation.
multiplier = 1
total_count = pas_de_balanchines_count * multiplier

# Step 3: Print the result and the equation.
# The prompt requires that the code outputs each number in a final equation.
print(f"The number of pas de Balanchines performed is {total_count}.")
print("The calculation is as follows:")
print(f"{pas_de_balanchines_count} * {multiplier} = {total_count}")
