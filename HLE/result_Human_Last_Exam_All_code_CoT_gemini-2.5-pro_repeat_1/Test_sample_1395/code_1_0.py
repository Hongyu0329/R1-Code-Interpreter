    Solves the graph theory problem regarding the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

    and the planarity factor (beta) of the Asian country map graph.

    # Step 1: Determine the chromatic number before the dissolution.
    # A map of countries is a planar graph. The Four Color Theorem states that the chromatic
    # number of any planar graph is at most 4. Large, complex political maps are generally
    # considered to require 4 colors.
    chromatic_number_before = 4
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian sovereign state graph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
    # The dissolution broke the USSR node into multiple new nodes (Kazakhstan, etc.).
    # This process, a node subdivision, does not change the graph's planarity.
    # The map remained a complex, planar graph, still requiring 4 colors.
    chromatic_number_after = 4
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian sovereign state graph after the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_after}.")

    # Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change.
    delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
    print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is the difference: {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

    # Step 4: Determine beta by analyzing the change in planarity.
    # A geographical map of contiguous countries on a sphere is inherently planar.
    # Dividing a country does not alter this fundamental property.
    # The problem states to set beta=1 if planarity did not change.
    beta = 1
    print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, hence beta is {beta}.")

    # Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
    final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
    print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
