    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The user wants to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n=128 vertices.\n2.  **Analyze the Core Graph Theory Concept:** I will analyze what it means for a clique to be an \"induced subgraph\". The key property of an induced subgraph is that it contains all the edges that were present in the original graph between its vertices.\n3.  **Identify the Key Insight:** I'll show that if a graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`), then it's always possible to find an induced clique of size `k-1` within it. This is done by simply selecting `k-1` vertices from the `k` vertices of the original clique.\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Set of Clique Sizes:** Based on the insight from step 3, I will deduce that the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any non-empty graph is not an arbitrary collection of numbers, but must be a continuous sequence of integers starting from 1, i.e., `{1, 2, 3, ..., m}`, where `m` is the size of the largest induced clique in the graph.\n5.  **Simplify the Problem:** This means the problem of maximizing the *number* of different clique sizes is equivalent to maximizing the size `m` of the *largest* induced clique.\n6.  **Find the Maximum Value:** For a graph with `n` vertices, the largest possible clique size is `n`. This is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n7.  **Construct the Final Solution:** For `n = 128`, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128. This is realized by the complete graph `K_128`, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n8.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that explains this step-by-step reasoning and prints the final answer, as requested by the user.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n    on n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices in the graph.
