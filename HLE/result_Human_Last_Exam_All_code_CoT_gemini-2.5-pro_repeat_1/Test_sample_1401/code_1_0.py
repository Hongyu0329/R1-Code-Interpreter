    print("1. The Goal: Find the minimum number of queries for any Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm to learn a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network to a squared loss of 1/poly(d).")
    print("   - A 'two-hidden-layer ReLU network' is a function of the form f(x) = W_2 * ReLU(W_1 * x + b_1) + b_2.")
    print("   - 'poly(d)-sized' means the number of neurons is a polynomial in the dimension d.")
    print("   - 'SQ algorithm' is a learning model where the algorithm queries an oracle for statistical properties of the data, rather than seeing individual examples.")
    print("   - A lower bound for a simpler class of functions (one-hidden-layer networks) also applies, since they are a special case of two-hidden-layer networks.\n")

    # Step 2: Introduce the relevant theoretical result
    print("2. The Theoretical Tool: We use a known lower bound from Song, Vempala, Wilmes, and Xie (2017).")
    print("   - Their result states that for learning a sum of 'k' ReLU neurons, any SQ algorithm needs a specific minimum number of queries.")
    print("   - The lower bound Q (number of queries) is given by the formula:")
    print("     Q >= (d / k)^Omega(k)")
    print("   - This bound holds for achieving a squared error 'epsilon' of O(k/d).\n")

    # Step 3: Instantiate parameters to match the problem
    print("3. Matching the Parameters: We choose 'k' (number of neurons) to fit the problem's constraints.")
    print("   - The network size must be poly(d). Let's choose a simple, slowly growing polynomial: k = log(d).")
    k_expr = "log(d)"
    print(f"     - Our choice for k is: {k_expr}. This is a polynomial in d (specifically, polylogarithmic).")

    print("   - The required squared loss must be 1/poly(d). Let's check the error for our choice of k.")
    epsilon_expr = "O(k/d) = O(log(d)/d)"
    print(f"     - For k = {k_expr}, the error 'epsilon' is {epsilon_expr}. This is of the form 1/poly(d), which matches the requirement.\n")

    # Step 4: Calculate the final lower bound

    print("   - log(d): The natural logarithm of the dimension d.")
    print("   - Omega(log(d)): Big-Omega notation. It means the exponent is a function that grows at least as fast as c*log(d) for some constant c > 0.")
    print("   - Interpretation: The number of queries must be at least d raised to a power proportional to log(d). This is a 'quasi-polynomial' complexity, which is super-polynomial (grows faster than any polynomial) but not fully exponential.")
