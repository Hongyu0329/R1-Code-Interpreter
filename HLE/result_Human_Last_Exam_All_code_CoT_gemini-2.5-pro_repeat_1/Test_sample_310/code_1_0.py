# This script analyzes the physical effects of using a laser with
# Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) for proton acceleration.

# 1. Define the modification to the laser beam.
modification = "Imbuing photons with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)"
print(f"Initial Change: {modification}")

# 2. Describe the physical consequence of OAM on the laser's structure.
# OAM creates a helical wavefront and a doughnut-shaped intensity profile.
laser_intensity_profile = "Doughnut-shaped (annular)"
print(f"Resulting Laser Profile: {laser_intensity_profile}")

# 3. Determine the effect on the resulting proton beam's shape.
# The annular laser profile creates a ring-like plasma sheath,
# which in turn accelerates protons into a hollow, dispersed beam.
effect_on_beam_shape = "Dispersion"
print(f"Effect on Proton Beam Shape: {effect_on_beam_shape}")

# 4. Determine the effect on the proton energy.
# Spreading the laser power over a larger ring area reduces peak intensity,
# generally leading to less efficient acceleration and lower maximum proton energy.
effect_on_proton_energy = "Decreases"
print(f"Effect on Proton Energy: {effect_on_proton_energy}")

# 5. Formulate the final conclusion based on the analysis.
# The final equation combines the effect on shape and energy.
print("\n--- Final Equation ---")
print(f"Proton Beam Effect = {effect_on_beam_shape} + Proton Energy {effect_on_proton_energy}")
print("--------------------")

# Based on this, the correct choice is C.
