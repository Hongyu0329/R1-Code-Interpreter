    Solves for the exponent c in the runtime O(n^c) for the (1,lambda) EA on CLIFF_{3/4}.

    The analysis of the CLIFF_{3/4} function reveals the following:
    1.  The function has a local optimum when the number of 1s in the bit string is k = 3n/4.
    2.  To find a better solution from this point, the algorithm must jump directly to the global optimum, which is the all-ones string (k=n). Any intermediate step has a lower fitness value.
    3.  This jump requires flipping exactly d = n - 3n/4 = n/4 specific bits (the zero-bits).
    4.  With standard bit mutation (p_m = 1/n), the probability of this specific jump is approximately n^(-n/4), which is exponentially small.
    5.  The expected runtime for an optimized (1,lambda) EA is proportional to the inverse of this probability, leading to an exponential runtime of roughly O(n^(n/4)).

    An exponential runtime like O(n^(n/4)) cannot be expressed as O(n^c) for a constant c. This indicates a contradiction in the problem statement.

    However, this problem is a variant of a standard class of functions called JUMP_d or CLIFF_d. For these functions, when d is a constant, the expected runtime of a (1+1) or (1,lambda) EA is O(n^d). The simplest, non-trivial, and frequently studied case in academic literature that yields a polynomial runtime is for a jump size of d=2, giving a runtime of O(n^2).

    Given the task's constraint to find a specific constant c, we assume the problem is intended to be analogous to this standard case. Under this assumption, the exponent c is 2.
