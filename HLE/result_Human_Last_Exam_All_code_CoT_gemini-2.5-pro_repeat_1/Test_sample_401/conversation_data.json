    "This is a fascinating and deep question in the field of point-set topology. To answer it, we need to carefully define the terms and consider some profound results from the mathematical literature.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Core Concepts:** First, I'll clarify what a \"continuum,\" an \"indecomposable continuum,\" and a \"composant\" are in this context, paying special attention to the user's note that the continuum is \"not necessarily metric.\"\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** I will reason why an indecomposable continuum cannot have just one composant. This will establish that the minimum number must be at least two.\n3.  **Establish an Achievable Minimum:** I will refer to known mathematical constructions to show that it is possible for an indecomposable continuum to have exactly two composants. This involves advanced results in topology that go beyond the standard metric cases.\n4.  **Formulate the Python Code:** I will create a Python script that programmatically presents this reasoning and prints the final answer, as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n*   **Continuum:** In general topology, a continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff space. The user's note \"not necessarily metric\" is key, as it allows us to consider more exotic, non-separable spaces.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** This is a continuum `X` that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. In other words, if `X = A âˆª B` where `A` and `B` are both continua, then either `A = X` or `B = X`.\n*   **Composant:** For any point `x` in an indecomposable continuum `X`, the composant of `x` is the set of all points `y` in `X` such that `x` and `y` are contained together in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. The collection of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X` (they are pairwise disjoint, and their union is `X`).\n*   **Lower Bound (Why not 1?):** Could an indecomposable continuum `X` have only one composant? If it did, then this single composant would have to be the entire space `X`. However, by its very definition, a composant is a union of *proper* subcontinua (subcontinua that are not equal to the whole space). If `X` were its own composant, it would mean `X` could be formed by a union of its proper subcontinua. A theorem in topology states that the composant of any point in an indecomposable continuum is a *proper* subset of the space. Therefore, `X` cannot be its own (and only) composant. This proves that an indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants.\n*   **Achievable Minimum (Is 2 possible?):** For the familiar *metric* indecomposable continua (like the Knaster \"buckethandle\" continuum or the pseudo-arc), it is a classic theorem that they have uncountably many composants. However, the user's problem allows for non-metric spaces. The question of whether an indecomposable continuum could have a finite number of composants was a long-standing open problem. The celebrated topologist Mary Ellen Rudin solved this by constructing, under the assumption of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), an indecomposable continuum that has exactly **two** composants.\n\n**Conclusion:** The smallest number cannot be one. Since a space with two composants has been shown to be possible (contingent on certain set-theoretic axioms), the minimum number is 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composant_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the topological problem regarding the minimum number of composants\n    in an indecomposable continuum.\n\n    This script explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the terms ---\n    print(\"Problem: What is the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"1.
