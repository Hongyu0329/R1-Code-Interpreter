  This script provides the solution to the algorithmic complexity puzzle.
  Based on a theoretical analysis, the time complexity for the given MIS algorithm
  on all three specified graph classes (cycles, bounded-degree trees, and general
  bounded-degree graphs) is Theta(log n).

  The reasoning is that the path graph P_n presents a worst-case scenario with an
  Omega(log n) lower bound for local algorithms, and it belongs to all three classes.
  The general O(log n) upper bound for bounded-degree graphs matches this lower bound.

  A complexity of Theta(log n) falls into category 9: f(n) = Omega(log n).
