(a)
Yes.
The problem statement defines g's action with the formula g ⋅ eᵢ = e_{n-d-i}, which is the definition of a reflection. Therefore, the property that 'g acts by a reflection' is a premise of the problem. In logic, a premise is trivially implied by any consequence derived from it.

(b)
The question asks for a condition on d for which σ(a) ≠ 0 must hold for all a. This is problematic as the zero map (σ=0) always satisfies the given axioms. However, we can provide a condition on d that prevents σ(a) from being forced to 0 for any arrow a, under the common assumption that λ = -1 and the characteristic of the field k is not 2.

Derivation:
A situation that forces σ(a) = 0 is when an arrow 'a' is a fixed point of g (i.e., g⋅a = a) and λ = -1.
1. An arrow a: i→i can only be a fixed point if its vertex i is a fixed point, meaning g⋅eᵢ = eᵢ.
2. This implies n-d-i = i, which rearranges to n-d = 2i.
3. This is only possible if n-d is an even number.
4. If λ=-1 and 'a' is a fixed point, the condition σ(a) = λ⁻¹ g⋅σ(a) becomes σ(a) = -g⋅σ(a). For a fixed point, g acts as the identity on σ(a), leading to σ(a) = -σ(a), which means 2σ(a) = 0, so σ(a) = 0.
To avoid this forced zero, we can impose a condition on d that prevents fixed points from existing. This is achieved by requiring n-d to be an odd number.

The resulting condition can be expressed with the following equation, where n and d must have different parity:
(n - d) % 2 = 1
