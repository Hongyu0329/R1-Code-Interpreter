# The problem asks for the smallest natural number N such that every anisotropic
# quadratic form in N variables over a field K is surjective.
# This number N is the u-invariant of the field K, denoted u_hat(K).

# The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
# with a residue field k that is a local field of characteristic 2.
# An example is K = F_q((t))((u)).

# The u-invariant of K is related to the u-invariant of its residue field k by the formula:
# u_hat(K) = 2 * u_hat(k)

# The residue field k is a local field of characteristic 2 (e.g., F_q((t))).
# For such a field, the u-invariant is known.
u_hat_k = 4

# Now we calculate u_hat(K).
u_hat_K = 2 * u_hat_k

# Print the final equation with the numbers.
