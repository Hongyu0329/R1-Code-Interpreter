    "A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed using the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) protocol. This scheme is provably secure against forgery attacks and is efficient in terms of communication rounds.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the design, followed by a Python implementation that simulates the entire process.\n\n### Scheme Design: Two-Phase Protocol\n\nThe protocol consists of two main phases: a one-time **Key Generation Phase** and a repeatable **Two-Round Signing Phase**.\n\n**Phase 1: Key Generation (One-Time Setup)**\n\nThis phase, typically using a Pedersen Distributed Key Generation (DKG), is performed once to establish the keys.\n1.  **Setup**: All `n` parties agree on a cryptographic group (like an elliptic curve group) with a generator `P` and order `q`.\n2.  **Commitment**: Each party `i` secretly creates a random polynomial of degree `t-1`. They then broadcast public commitments to the coefficients of their polynomial.\n3.  **Share Distribution**: Each party `i` computes secret shares for every other party `j` by evaluating its polynomial at point `j` and sends the shares securely.\n4.  **Verification & Key Creation**: Each party verifies the shares it received. They then sum up all their received shares to compute their final long-lived secret share, `x_i`. The group's public key, `Y`, is the sum of the public commitments to the constant term of each party's polynomial. The full secret key `x` (corresponding to `Y`) is never reconstructed.\n\n**Phase 2: Two-Round Signing (For each signature)**\n\nWhen a group of at least `t` participants wants to sign a message `m`:\n\n**Round 1: Commitment**\n1.  Each of the `t` participating signers `i` generates two fresh, secret random numbers called nonces (`d_i`, `e_i`).\n2.  Each signer computes public commitments to these nonces: `D_i = d_i * P` and `E_i = e_i * P`.\n3.  Each signer broadcasts their pair of commitments `(D_i, E_i)` to the other participants.\n\n**Round 2: Signature Share Generation**\n1.  After receiving all commitments from the other `t-1` signers, each signer `i` has the full set of commitments.\n2.  Each signer computes a group commitment `R`. This is done by first calculating a \"binding factor\" `rho_j` for each participant `j` (which is a hash of the message and all commitments) and then computing `R = sum(D_j + rho_j * E_j)`. This step is critical for preventing forgery attacks.\n3.  Each signer computes a common challenge value `c` by hashing the group public key `Y`, the message `m`, and the group commitment `R`.\n4.  Each signer `i` then calculates their individual signature share: `z_i = d_i + e_i*rho_i + c*lambda_i*x_i`, where `x_i` is their long-lived secret share and `lambda_i` is their unique Lagrange coefficient for this signing group.\n5.  Each signer sends their share `z_i` to a designated signature aggregator (who can be one of the signers or an external party).\n\n**Finalization: Aggregation and Verification**\n\n1.  **Aggregation**: The aggregator collects all `t` signature shares and sums them to create the final value `z = sum(z_i)`. The final signature is the pair `(R, z)`.\n2.  **Verification**: Anyone can verify the signature `(R, z)` on the message `m` using the group's public key `Y` by checking if the equation `z * P == R + c * Y` holds.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this entire process. For simplicity and to avoid external dependencies, it uses modular arithmetic instead of a real elliptic curve group, but the mathematical principles are identical.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\nimport json\n\ndef design_threshold_signature_scheme():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function designs and demonstrates a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme\n    based on FROST.
