def find_lexicographically_least_tuple():

    This function solves the problem by searching for the minimal tuple.

    The problem reduces to finding the minimal integer l and the lexicographically
    smallest tuple (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l) such that:
    1. For all i, a_i, b_i are non-negative integers, a_i != 1 and b_i != 1.
    2. 2 * sum_{i=1 to l} (1-a_i)*(1-b_i) = l - 1

    This implies l must be odd. We test l=1, 3, 5, ...
    l=1 fails as it requires a_1=1 or b_1=1.
    The minimal l is 3. The equation becomes:
    (1-a_1)*(1-b_1) + (1-a_2)*(1-b_2) + (1-a_3)*(1-b_3) = 1
