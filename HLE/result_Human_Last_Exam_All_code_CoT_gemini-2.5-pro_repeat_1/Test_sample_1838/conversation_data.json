    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the central pixel using Bresenham's line algorithm:\n\nFirst, I will implement Bresenham's algorithm for the line segment between (1, 1) and (11, 5). Since the slope of the line is positive and less than 1 (m = (5-1)/(11-1) = 0.4), the algorithm will step along the x-axis from 1 to 11 and, at each step, decide whether to increment the y-coordinate. This process will generate a list of all the integer coordinates (pixels) that form the line.\n\nOnce I have the complete list of pixels, I will determine the total number of pixels in the list. The central pixel will be the one at the middle index of this list. Finally, I will print the coordinates of this central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the pixels for a line using Bresenham's algorithm\n    and prints the coordinates of the central pixel.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the differences in x and y\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # For this specific case, slope is 0 < m < 1, so we iterate along x\n    \n    # Initialize the decision parameter\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    \n    # Initialize starting coordinates\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    \n    # Store all pixels on the line\n    pixels = []\n    \n    # Loop to generate all points until the end point is reached\n    while x <= x2:\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n        \n        # Increment x for the next step\n        x += 1\n        \n        # Update the decision parameter and y coordinate\n        if p < 0:\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n        else:\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n            y += 1\n            \n    # Find the middle index\n    mid_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    \n    # Get the central pixel from the list\n    central_pixel = pixels[mid_index]\n    \n    # The final equation is finding the central pixel's coordinates.\n    # The following line outputs each number (coordinate) of that final result.\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\n# Define the start and end points of the line\nstart_point = (1, 1)\nend_point = (11, 5)\n\n# Run the function\nfind_central_pixel_bresenham(start_point[0], start_point[1], end_point[0], end_point[1])\n```\n<<<(6, 3)>>>"
