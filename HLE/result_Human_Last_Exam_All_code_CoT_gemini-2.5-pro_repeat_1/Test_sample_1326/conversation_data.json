    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx$ must be split into two parts according to the function's definition:\n1.  The integral of the first part of the function from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n2.  The integral of the second part of the function from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe total integral is the sum of these two parts:\n$\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\nI will write a Python script to compute these two integrals numerically and add them together. The script will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is a robust tool for numerical integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the two parts of the function p(x)\ndef part1(x):\n    \"\"\"Function p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3\"\"\"\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef part2(x):\n    \"\"\"Function p(x) for 3 <= x <= 5\"\"\"\n    # Ensure we are using floating point division\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first interval [0, 3]\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error. We only need the result.\nintegral1, error1 = quad(part1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second interval [3, 4]\nintegral2, error2 = quad(part2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(\"The integral of p(x) from 0 to 4 is the sum of the integral from 0 to 3 and the integral from 3 to 4.\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3: {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4: {integral2}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{integral1} + {integral2} = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4721531024344>>>"
