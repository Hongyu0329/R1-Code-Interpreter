    "To find the volume of the intersection of the two shifted cubes, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes' Positions:** I will place the first cube (C1) in a 3D coordinate system with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). This cube occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Shift:** The second cube (C2) is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first. The main diagonal of C1 connects (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, C2 occupies the space where `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region that belongs to both cubes. I will find the overlapping range for each coordinate:\n    *   **x-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **y-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **z-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`. The volume is calculated by cubing this side length. I will use a Python script to perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes of side length 1,\n    shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters from the problem description.\n    side_length = 1.0\n    shift = 0.5\n\n    # The intersection of the two cubes forms a smaller cube.\n    # Its side length is the original side length minus the shift along any one axis.\n    intersection_side_length = side_length - shift\n\n    # The volume of this intersection cube is its side length cubed.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The problem describes two cubes of side length 1, shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\")\n    print(\"This creates an overlapping region which is also a cube.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of this intersection cube is the original side length ({side_length}) minus the shift ({shift}).\")\n    print(f\"Side length of intersection = {side_length} - {shift} = {intersection_side_length}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated by cubing its side length.\")\n    print(f\"Volume = {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
