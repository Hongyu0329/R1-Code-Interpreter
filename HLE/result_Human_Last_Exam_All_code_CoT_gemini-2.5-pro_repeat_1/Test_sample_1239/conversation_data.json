    "The problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a question from mathematical physics, and its answer can be subtle.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Acknowledge ambiguity:** The full Lie group of point symmetries is technically infinite-dimensional. This arises from a \"gauge-like\" symmetry in the pressure term, as only its gradient affects the fluid's velocity. Specifically, one can transform the pressure $p \\to p + g(t)$, where $g(t)$ is an arbitrary function of time, without changing the equations of motion for the velocity field.\n2.  **Focus on the standard finite-dimensional subgroup:** In most physical and mathematical contexts, the question refers to the maximal finite-dimensional Lie subgroup of physically significant symmetries that act on spacetime and the velocity field. This subgroup is often called the Galilei-similitude group, sometimes extended with a pressure shift symmetry.\n3.  **List the symmetry generators:** I will list the types of transformations that form this finite-dimensional group and count the number of independent generators for each type.\n    *   Time translations\n    *   Space translations\n    *   Space rotations\n    *   Galilean boosts\n    *   Scaling transformations\n    *   Constant pressure shifts\n4.  **Sum the dimensions:** The total dimension is the sum of the number of generators from each category.\n5.  **Provide a Python script:** The script will programmatically define these counts, print a summary of each symmetry component, and compute the final sum, displaying the full equation as requested.\n\nFollowing this plan, we can determine the standard answer for the dimension of this symmetry group.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the standard finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries\n    for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The full point symmetry group is infinite-dimensional due to the pressure symmetry\n    p -> p + g(t). However, the physically non-trivial subgroup, which acts on\n    the velocity field, spacetime, and includes a constant pressure shift, is finite-dimensional.\n    This script calculates the dimension of this standard subgroup.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the number of generators for each type of symmetry.\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Space translations\": 3,\n        \"Space rotations\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling transformation\": 1,\n        \"Constant pressure shift\": 1\n    }\n\n    # Calculate the total dimension by summing the number of generators.\n    total_dimension = sum(symmetries.values())\n\n    # Print the breakdown of symmetries and their contributions.\n    print(\"The dimension of the standard Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is the sum of the dimensions of its component symmetry groups:\")\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} generator(s)\")\n\n    # Construct the final calculation string.\n    calculation_string = \" + \".join(str(d) for d in symmetries.values())\n\n    # Print the final calculation and the result.\n    print(\"\\nThe total dimension is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension = {calculation_string} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
