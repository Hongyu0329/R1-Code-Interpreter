    # Step 1: Determine the symmetry and generators in the gas phase.
    # The theory has Nf=3 quarks (u, d, s) with isospin symmetry (m_u = m_d).
    # The chemical potential is for the strange quark (s).
    # The iso-vector symmetry G of the Lagrangian must commute with the mass matrix M = diag(m_ud, m_ud, m_s)
    # and the strangeness charge matrix Q = diag(0, 0, 1).
    # These conditions restrict the general SU(3) vector symmetry to a U(2) symmetry that acts on the (u, d) quark sector.
    # The symmetry group in the gas phase is G = U(2).
    # The number of generators for the group U(n) is n^2.
    gas_phase_generators = 2**2

    # Step 2: Determine the symmetry and generators in the condensed phase.
    # In the condensed phase, a kaon condensate forms. This is a condensate of a strange quark
    # and a light antiquark, for instance, <s_bar * d>.
    # This condensate spontaneously breaks the U(2) symmetry that acts on the (u, d) quarks.
    # The condensate involves the 'd' quark, so any symmetry transformation that affects the 'd' quark is broken.
    # The 'u' quark is not part of the condensate. Therefore, the symmetry transformations that act
    # only on the 'u' quark remain unbroken. This corresponds to a U(1) subgroup of the original U(2).
    # The residual symmetry group in the condensed phase is H = U(1).
    # The number of generators for the group U(n) is n^2.
    condensed_phase_generators = 1**2

    # Step 3: Apply Goldstone's theorem.
    # The number of Goldstone bosons is the number of broken generators, which is the difference
    # between the number of generators in the gas phase and the condensed phase.
