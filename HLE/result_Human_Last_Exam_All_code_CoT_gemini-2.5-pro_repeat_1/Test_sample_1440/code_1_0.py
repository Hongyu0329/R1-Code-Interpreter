    # Let N be the smallest possible number of equivalence classes.

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound for N.
    # The problem defines two points, a and b, in X such that any subcontinuum
    # containing both must be X itself (Property 2).
    # Let's assume a and b are in the same equivalence class, i.e., a ~ b.
    # By definition of ~, this means there exists a nowhere dense subcontinuum K
    # such that {a, b} is a subset of K.
    # From Property (2), K must be equal to X.
    # For K=X to be nowhere dense in X, the interior of its closure must be empty.
    # The closure of X is X. The interior of X is X.
    # A continuum X is non-empty, so its interior is non-empty.
    # This contradicts the requirement that K=X is nowhere dense.
    # Therefore, the assumption (a ~ b) is false.
    # Since a and b are in different equivalence classes, there must be at least two classes.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Show that N=2 is achievable.
    # We need to find an example of a space X that satisfies the given properties
    # and has exactly 2 equivalence classes.
    # A space where every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense would be a good candidate.
    # The "pseudo-arc" is a continuum that is hereditarily indecomposable, which implies
    # all its proper subcontinua are nowhere dense.
    # The pseudo-arc also satisfies properties (1) and (2).
    # For a space X irreducible between a and b (Property 2), we know X = C_a U C_b,
    # where C_a and C_b are the 'composants' of a and b.
    # A point x is in C_a if {x, a} is contained in a proper subcontinuum.
    # In our chosen space (the pseudo-arc), any such proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense.
    # This means any x in C_a is equivalent to a (x ~ a).
    # Similarly, any x in C_b is equivalent to b (x ~ b).
    # Since X = C_a U C_b, every point in X is equivalent to either a or b.
    # This shows that there are at most two classes: [a] and [b].
    achievable_number = 2

    # Step 3: Conclude the final answer.
    # From Step 1, N >= 2.
    # From Step 2, N = 2 is possible.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of equivalence classes is 2.
    final_answer = 2
    
    # In this problem, the final "equation" is simply the resulting number.
