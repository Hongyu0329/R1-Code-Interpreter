    Solves the given topology problem by analyzing the properties of the space X.

Step 1: Analyze the given properties of the space X.
X is a metric space, locally compact, and a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R.
Let the map be f: R -> X. This map is a continuous bijection.

Step 2: Use the properties to classify X.
The domain R is a locally compact Hausdorff space.
The codomain X is also a locally compact Hausdorff space (since it's a metric space and locally compact).
A key theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection between two locally compact Hausdorff spaces is a homeomorphism.
Therefore, the map f must be a homeomorphism, which implies X must be homeomorphic to R.

Step 3: Conclude the number of homeomorphism classes.
Since any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R, there can be at most one homeomorphism class.

Step 4: Verify that R itself satisfies the conditions.
- R is a metric, locally compact, and a one-to-one continuous image of itself.
- For any two distinct points x, y in R, let d = |x - y|. The closed interval K = [x - d/2, x + d/2] is a closed connected set.
- The interior of K, (x - d/2, x + d/2), contains x.
- The point y is not in K.
Thus, R satisfies all the given properties.

Step 5: Final Conclusion.
Since any such space X must be homeomorphic to R, and R is a valid example, there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.
