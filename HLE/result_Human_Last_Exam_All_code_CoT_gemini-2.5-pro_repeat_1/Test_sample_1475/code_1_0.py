    print("Step 1: Characterize the space P(X).")
    print("X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point (e.g., [0,1]).")
    print("P(X) is the subspace of 2^X (the space of all non-empty closed subsets of X)")
    print("consisting of sets that are the union of a non-trivially convergent sequence and its limit.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Establish key topological properties of P(X).")
    print("a) P(X) has the Baire Property: P(X) is an 'analytic set' in the complete metric space 2^X.")
    print("   A theorem in descriptive set theory states that all analytic sets have the Baire property.")
    print("   This means any countable intersection of open dense subsets of P(X) is itself dense in P(X).")
    print("b) P(X) is a perfect space: It has no isolated points. For any element S in P(X), we can always find another distinct element S' arbitrarily close to it.")

    print("\nStep 3: Deduce the cardinality of P(X).")
    print("A space that is both perfect and has the Baire property must be uncountable.")

    print("From the Baire property, G is a dense subset of P(X).")
    print("A dense subset of a perfect Baire space can be proven to have the same cardinality as the space itself.")
    print("A more direct argument: Since P(X) is an uncountable analytic set, it contains a perfect subset K (of cardinality c).")
    print("The intersection G restricted to K (G_K) is comeager in K. For a perfect Polish space like K, a comeager subset must have cardinality c.")
    print("Since G_K is a subset of G, the cardinality of G must be at least c.")
    print("Since G is a subset of P(X), its cardinality is at most c.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The cardinality of the intersection is precisely c, the cardinality of the continuum.")
    
    # In mathematics, c is defined as 2 to the power of aleph_null (the cardinality of natural numbers).
