    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine what the word \"sister\" would be without Norse influence.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Origin of \"Sister\":** First, I'll confirm the etymology of our current word \"sister\". It comes from the Old Norse word *systir*, which was brought to England by Viking invaders.\n2.  **Find the Native Old English Word:** Next, I'll identify the original, native Old English word for \"sister\" that was displaced by the Norse term. This word was *sweostor*.\n3.  **Trace the Linguistic Evolution:** Finally, I'll trace the likely sound changes that would have transformed the Old English *sweostor* into a Modern English word. This involves two main steps:\n    *   **Old to Middle English:** Vowels and unstressed syllables were simplified, likely turning *sweostor* into *swester*.\n    *   **Middle to Modern English:** The Great Vowel Shift, a major change in the pronunciation of English long vowels, would have altered *swester*. The long /eː/ sound in *swester* would have become a long /iː/ sound (like in \"feet\").\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to print this entire process, showing the transformation from the Old English word to the hypothetical modern one.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if the Old Norse language had not influenced Old English.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The current word for sister comes from Old Norse.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    norse_origin = \"systir\"\n    \n    # The original, native word in Old English.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    # In the transition from Old to Middle English, vowels were simplified.\n    # The 'eo' became a simple 'e' and the unstressed 'o' in the second syllable\n    # was reduced.\n    middle_english_word = \"swester\"\n    \n    # The Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700) changed the pronunciation of long vowels.\n    # The long 'e' sound in \"swester\" (pronounced sways-ter) would have shifted\n    # to a long 'ee' sound (like in \"feet\").\n    # The spelling would likely have adapted to reflect this.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"sweester\"\n    \n    print(\"This program determines the modern word for 'sister' without Norse influence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The current word '{current_word}' is not native to English.\")\n    print(f\"It was adopted from the Old Norse word: '{norse_origin}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"\\nThe native Old English word would have evolved as follows:\")\n    \n    # The user requested to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We will show the evolution step-by-step.\n    print(f\"1. The original Old English word was: {old_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"2. Through vowel simplification, it would become the Middle English word: {middle_english_word}\")\n    print(f\"3. After the Great Vowel Shift, the final Modern English word would be: {hypothetical_modern_word}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Therefore, without Norse influence, the Modern English word for 'sister' would likely be '{hypothetical_modern_word}'.\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<sweester>>>"
