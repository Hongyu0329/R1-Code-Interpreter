# Based on the derivation, the value of l(b) is constant for all b in (-1, 1).
# The complex definitions simplify significantly.
# 1. The condition on the space of matrices L simplifies to M being symmetric,
#    making Image(f) the set of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices.
# 2. The minimization expression inside l(b) simplifies to the trace of a matrix plus 101.
# 3. The infimum of the trace term over all SPD matrices is 0.
# 4. This leads to l(b) = 101 for any valid b.

l_half = 101
l_neg_half = 101

# The expression to compute is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2))
val1 = 6
val2 = l_half
val3 = l_neg_half
result = val1 * (val2 + val3)

# Print the final equation with all numbers
print(f"{val1} * ({val2} + {val3}) = {result}")

# The final answer
print("<<<1212>>>")
