    # Step-by-step reasoning

Here is the step-by-step reasoning for determining liability:

1.  **Analysis of Mark's Incident (Pool Damage):**
    *   **Mark's Liability:** Mark was negligent. He breached his duty to perform his work with reasonable care by getting distracted while operating a riding lawnmower. This negligent act was the direct cause of him falling and the mower subsequently damaging the pool and cover. Therefore, Mark is directly liable.
    *   **Evergreen Grass Care Ltd.'s Liability:** Under the legal doctrine of vicarious liability, an employer is held responsible for the negligent acts of an employee if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment. Mark was on the job, using company equipment, at a client's site. Thus, Evergreen is vicariously liable for the damage Mark caused. Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable, meaning the client (Bruce) can seek full compensation from either party.
    *   **Neighbours' Liability:** The neighbours are not liable. While their dog was a source of distraction, Mark's negligent decision to engage with the dog was an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation. The presence of the dog and the short fence are considered conditions, not the proximate cause of the damage.

2.  **Analysis of Lincoln's Incident (Car Damage):**
    *   **Lincoln's Liability:** Lincoln was also negligent. A reasonable person would foresee that using a powerful blower on small rocks near an expensive car would likely propel the rocks and cause damage. He breached his duty of care to the client's property. Therefore, Lincoln is directly liable for the scratches on the Ferrari.
    *   **The "Minimal Damage" Argument:** The argument that liability is avoided because the damage was "minimal" is incorrect. In tort law, once a negligent act and resulting damage are established, liability exists. The extent of the damage ("minimal") only affects the monetary amount of the compensation, not the existence of liability itself.
    *   **Evergreen Grass Care Ltd.'s Liability:** As with Mark, Lincoln was an employee acting within the scope of his employment. Therefore, Evergreen is also vicariously liable for the damage Lincoln caused to the car. Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for this damage.

3.  **Conclusion and Evaluation of Answer Choices:**
    *   Based on the analysis, for the first incident, Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.
    *   For the second incident, Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.
    *   This matches the description in answer choice E.

The final conclusion is that option E provides the most accurate description of liability.
