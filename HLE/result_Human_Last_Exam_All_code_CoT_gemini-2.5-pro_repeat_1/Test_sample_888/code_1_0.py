# Step 1: Define the constants based on the derivation.
K1 = 2
K2 = 1
K3 = -1/2
K4 = 2

# The problem asks for the product K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4.
# As derived in the text, the term K is ambiguous.
# The most likely interpretation is that the question seeks the value of the product of the four determined constants,
# as this product is a well-defined number independent of the problem's free parameters.

# Step 2: Calculate the product of the four constants.
product = K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 3: Print the result.
# The problem asks to output the final equation.
print(f"The values of the constants are: K1 = {K1}, K2 = {K2}, K3 = {K3}, K4 = {K4}")
print(f"The product K1 * K2 * K3 * K4 is calculated as:")
print(f"{K1} * {K2} * ({K3}) * {K4} = {product}")

# Assuming the question intended to ask for the product K1*K2*K3*K4.
# The final answer is the value of this product.
# We will output just the final numerical answer as requested by the format.
# print(f"Final Answer: {product}")
