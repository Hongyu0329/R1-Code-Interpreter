    This function identifies the error in the C code and provides the fix location.
    The C program has a critical error on line 5.
    Line 5: char c;
    The program uses scanf with the format specifier "%d", which expects a pointer to an integer (int *).
    However, it passes &c, which is a pointer to a char (char *). This type mismatch leads to undefined behavior,
    as scanf will try to write sizeof(int) bytes into a memory location that only holds sizeof(char) byte.
    This will corrupt the stack and cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably, thus failing the test.

    The minimal fix is to change the type of 'c' from 'char' to 'int'.
    This changes line 5 from "char c;" to "int c;".
    The word 'char' has 4 letters, and 'int' has 3. Let's count the edits as changing 'char' to 'int', which is 3 edits (r->t, a->n, h->i, and removing c). A simpler view is 3 edits: change 'h' to 'n', 'a' to 't', and remove 'r'. Let's stick to the simplest interpretation of 3 edits for changing the type name.
