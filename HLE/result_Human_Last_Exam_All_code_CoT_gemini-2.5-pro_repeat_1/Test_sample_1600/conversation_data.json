    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  The problem asks for the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n2.  These numbers are the result of complex calculations in theoretical physics and are not derived from a simple mathematical formula. They are well-established results in the field.\n3.  This sequence of numbers is famously cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A000781.\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores the first few known values of this sequence in a dictionary.\n5.  The script will then retrieve the value corresponding to `n=3` and print it in the format of a simple equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the value:\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagram_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing\n    Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators\n    in quantum electrodynamics (QED).\n\n    The number of these diagrams is a known sequence from physics research. The\n    calculation of these numbers is highly complex and is beyond a simple script.\n    This function uses the pre-computed and verified values from this sequence,\n    which is cataloged as sequence A000781 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of\n    Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\n    The sequence a(n) for n=0, 1, 2, 3, ... begins: 1, 1, 7, 72, 891, ...\n    - a(0) corresponds to order 0 (0-loop or tree level)\n    - a(1) corresponds to order 2 (1-loop)\n    - a(2) corresponds to order 4 (2-loop)\n    - a(3) corresponds to order 6 (3-loop)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary mapping 'n' to the number of diagrams 'a(n)'\n    # Source: OEIS A000781\n    a_n_values = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 7,\n        3: 72,\n        4: 891,\n        5: 12672\n    }\n\n    # The problem asks to find a(3).\n    n = 3\n    result = a_n_values.get(n)\n\n    if result is not None:\n        # The final instruction is to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n        # We will print the result as a simple statement.\n        print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not available in the pre-computed list.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nsolve_feynman_diagram_count()\n```\n<<<72>>>"
