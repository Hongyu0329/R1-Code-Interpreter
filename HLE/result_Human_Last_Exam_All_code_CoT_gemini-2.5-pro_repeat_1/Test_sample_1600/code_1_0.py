def solve_feynman_diagram_count():
    """
    This function finds a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing
    Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators
    in quantum electrodynamics (QED).

    The number of these diagrams is a known sequence from physics research. The
    calculation of these numbers is highly complex and is beyond a simple script.
    This function uses the pre-computed and verified values from this sequence,
    which is cataloged as sequence A000781 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of
    Integer Sequences (OEIS).

    The sequence a(n) for n=0, 1, 2, 3, ... begins: 1, 1, 7, 72, 891, ...
    - a(0) corresponds to order 0 (0-loop or tree level)
    - a(1) corresponds to order 2 (1-loop)
    - a(2) corresponds to order 4 (2-loop)
    - a(3) corresponds to order 6 (3-loop)
