    # (a) Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # The vertex algebra V(p), also known as the triplet algebra W_p, is a key example
    # in logarithmic conformal field theory. It is a well-known result that these algebras are
    # not simple for any integer p >= 1. They possess a non-trivial ideal structure,
    # which is generated by singular vectors.
    answer_a = "No"

    # (b) If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # An ideal I in a vertex algebra V is a subspace that is closed under the action of all
    # fields in V. The algebra V(p) contains the affine Lie algebra L_k(sl_2) as a subalgebra.
    # Therefore, any ideal of V(p) must also be a module for L_k(sl_2).
    # Additionally, in a VOA graded by conformal weight (as V(p) is), any non-trivial
    # ideal must contain a highest-weight vector. This highest-weight vector is what is
    # referred to as a singular vector.
    # Thus, an ideal must satisfy both conditions.
    answer_b = "both"

    # (c) Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Simplicity of a VOA V means that it is irreducible as a module over itself.
    # Irreducibility as a module for a subalgebra A is a different, and stronger, condition.
    # An L_k(sl_2)-submodule of V(p) is a subspace closed under the action of L_k(sl_2),
    # but not necessarily under the action of all other fields in V(p).
    # Therefore, it is possible for a VOA to be simple, yet contain proper submodules for
    # one of its subalgebras. Thus, simplicity does not imply irreducibility as an L_k(sl_2)-module.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Format the final answer string as requested.
    formatted_answer = f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}"
    print(formatted_answer)
    # The final answer is also enclosed in <<<...>>> for the system to parse it correctly.
