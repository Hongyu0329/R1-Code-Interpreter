# The user's request is a theoretical question about computational complexity.
# As such, there is no practical code to execute to find the answer.
# The reasoning provided above explains the choice based on established results
# in parameterized complexity theory.
#
# The analysis leads to the following conclusion:
# 1. The problem is W[1]-hard on general graphs, as shown by a reduction from k-Disjoint Paths.
# 2. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on planar graphs, due to the Erdos-Posa
#    property and the relationship between circumference and treewidth in planar graphs.
#
# This matches choice B.
#
# As per the instruction format, the final answer is printed below.
# This code block is a placeholder to satisfy the output format requirement.

# Final Answer selection
# A. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable
# B. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, but W[1]-complete on general graphs
# C. DisjointCycles is W[2]-complete
# D. DisjointCycles is coNP-hard
# E. DisjointCycles is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded degree, but W[1]-complete on general graphs
