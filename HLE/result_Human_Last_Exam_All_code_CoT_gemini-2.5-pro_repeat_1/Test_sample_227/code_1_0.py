# Let d(t) be the distance at time t. We set d(0) = 0.
# The total distance is d(7).
# Our goal is to maximize d(7) by finding the maximum possible value for d(4).

# We established that d(7) = d(4) + 3.
# We also found the possible range for d(4) is [3, 5].

# To maximize d(7), we choose the maximum value for d(4).
d4_max = 5

# Calculate the maximum total distance d(7).
d7_max = d4_max + 3

# We can demonstrate that this scenario is possible.
# If d(4) = 5, then d(2.5) must be in the range [d(4)-2, d(4)-1], which is [3, 4].
# But we also know d(2.5) must be in [2, 3].
# The only value that satisfies both is d(2.5) = 3. This confirms our logic.
