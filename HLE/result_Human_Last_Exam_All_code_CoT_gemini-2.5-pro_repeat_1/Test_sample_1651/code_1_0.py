# The problem asks for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of the
# Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R, where the fixed points
# are in the Stone-Cech remainder (the part of the compactification "at infinity").

# Let N be this number. We need to find the minimum possible value for N, given N > 0.

# 1. It is possible for N to be 0. The function f(x) = x + 1 gives an extension F
#    that has no fixed points at all.
#
# 2. It is possible for N to be very large (infinite). The function f(x) = x
#    makes every point a fixed point, so all points in the remainder are fixed.
#
# 3. The crucial part is finding the minimum *positive* value.
#    According to a result by topologist E. K. van Douwen, it is possible to
#    construct a continuous function on a non-compact space (like the real line)
#    whose Stone-Cech extension has exactly one fixed point, which lies in the remainder.
#
# 4. This means that N=1 is an achievable number of fixed points.
#
# 5. Since N must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value for N is 1.

smallest_nonzero_fixed_points = 1

# Final equation representing the solution:
# Smallest_Possible_Nonzero_Number_of_Fixed_Points = 1
