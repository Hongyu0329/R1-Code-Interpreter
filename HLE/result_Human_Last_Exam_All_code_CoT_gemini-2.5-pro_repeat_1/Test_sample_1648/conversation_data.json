    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is non-zero, we need to understand the structure of these groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: We are dealing with the algebraic K-groups, specifically `K_{2n}(R)` for the ring `R = Z/27`.\n2.  **Consult known results**: The structure of the K-groups of rings `Z/p^k` has been determined. For an odd prime `p`, and for `n, k ≥ 1`, there is a formula for the order of the group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)`.\n3.  **Apply the formula**: We will apply this formula to our specific case, where `p=3`, `k=3` (since `27 = 3^3`), and the index is `2n`.\n4.  **Analyze the result**: The formula shows that the order of `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is always greater than 1 for any natural number `n`. This contradicts the premise of the question that there is a \"largest\" such `n`.\n5.  **Formulate a hypothesis**: This contradiction suggests there is a hidden constraint in the problem statement. In number theory and K-theory, there are often \"stability\" conditions related to the order of the group of units of the ring. For `Z/27`, the group of units is `(Z/27Z)^*`, and its order is given by Euler's totient function, `φ(27)`.\n6.  **Solve under the hypothesis**: We will assume the problem is only considering indices `2n` that are less than `φ(27)`. We will calculate `φ(27)` and find the largest `n` that satisfies this new condition.\n7.  **Provide the code**: The python code will implement the calculation based on this hypothesis.\n\n### Execution:\n\nThe formula for the order of the K-group in question is:\n`|K_{2n}(Z/p^k)| = p^(ν_p(n) + k)`\nwhere `ν_p(n)` is the exponent of the highest power of `p` that divides `n`.\n\nFor `R = Z/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`. The formula becomes:\n`|K_{2n}(Z/27)| = 3^(ν_3(n) + 3)`\n\nSince `n` is a natural number (`n ≥ 1`), `ν_3(n) ≥ 0`. Therefore, the exponent `ν_3(n) + 3` is always at least `3`. This means the order of the group `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is always at least `3^3 = 27`, so the group is never zero.\n\nThis leads us to the hypothesis of a hidden constraint. We'll assume the index `2n` must be less than the order of the group of units `(Z/27Z)^*`.\n\nThe order is `φ(27) = 27 * (1 - 1/3) = 27 - 9 = 18`.\nThe constraint becomes `2n < 18`, which simplifies to `n < 9`.\nThe largest natural number `n` that satisfies `n < 9` is `8`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the problem based on a hypothesis about a hidden constraint.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is about the ring Z/mZ, where m=27.\n    m = 27\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n\n    # According to modern results in algebraic K-theory, the order of the group\n    # K_{2n}(Z/p^k) for an odd prime p is given by |K_{2n}(Z/p^k)| = p^(nu_p(n) + k).\n    # For Z/27, this means |K_{2n}(Z/27)| = 3^(nu_3(n) + 3), which is never 1 for n>=1.\n    # This suggests a hidden constraint in the problem statement.\n    # We hypothesize the constraint is that the K-group index, 2n, must be less\n    # than the order of the group of units (Z/mZ)^*, which is phi(m).\n\n    # Calculate Euler's totient function for m = p^k.\n    # phi(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1)\n    phi_m = m - p**(k-1)\n\n    # The hypothesized inequality is 2n < phi(m).\n    # We need to find the largest integer n that satisfies this.\n    # 2n < phi_m  =>  n < phi_m / 2\n    bound = phi_m / 2\n    largest_n = math.floor(bound - 1e-9)\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the largest natural number n such that the (2n)-th K-group of Z/27 is non-zero.\")\n    print(\"Based on established formulas, this group is non-zero for all natural numbers n.\")\n    print(\"We hypothesize a hidden constraint related to the order of the group of units of Z/27.\")\n    print(f\"The order of (Z/27Z)^* is phi(27) = {phi_m}.\")\n    print(f\"The constraint is assumed to be 2 * n < {phi_m}.\")\n    print(f\"This inequality simplifies to n < {bound}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest natural number n satisfying n < {bound} is {largest_n}.\")\n\nsolve_k_theory_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
