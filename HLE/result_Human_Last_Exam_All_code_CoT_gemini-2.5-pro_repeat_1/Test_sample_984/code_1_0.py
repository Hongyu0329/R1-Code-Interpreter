    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most compelling explanation is B. The frequency of B cells that produce a specific antibody against a particular antigen is known to be extremely low. A cell sorter can identify that a tumor cell (RFP) and a B cell (FITC) are physically close (a doublet), but it CANNOT distinguish between a true antigen-specific bond and a random, non-specific collision. Therefore, it is overwhelmingly likely that the vast majority of the 95 sorted doublets were random pairings, not the biologically relevant ones. The low final efficiency directly reflects the rarity of the true antigen-specific B cells in the initial population.")
    
    print("\nBased on this analysis, the most likely reason is:")
    print("B. True antigen-specific interactions are rare events, and many observed doublets are probably random associations rather than specific binding pairs.")
