    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider all possible constructions of such groups. Any finite Weyl group can be expressed as a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of this direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nTherefore, our task is to find all partitions of the number 4. For each partition, we count how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed based on the classification of irreducible Weyl groups for the required ranks.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Consider all partitions of the number 4:\n    *   4 (an irreducible group of rank 4)\n    *   3 + 1 (a product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group)\n    *   2 + 2 (a product of two rank 2 groups)\n    *   2 + 1 + 1 (a product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 groups)\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (a product of four rank 1 groups)\n3.  For each partition, calculate the number of possible non-isomorphic group combinations.\n4.  Sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \n    This is done by considering all partitions of the number 4 and counting the\n    number of ways to form a Weyl group for each partition based on the\n    classification of irreducible Weyl groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank n.\n    # Rank 1: A_1\n    # Rank 2: A_2, B_2, G_2\n    # Rank 3: A_3, B_3 (since D_3 is isomorphic to A_3)\n    # Rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4\n    num_irreducible_types = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 3,\n        3: 2,\n        4: 4,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Counting non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 based on partitions of 4:\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 1: 4 (irreducible groups)\n    # These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4: A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4.\n    count_p4 = num_irreducible_types[4]\n    print(f\"Partition 4: {count_p4} groups (A_4, B_4, D_4, F_4)\")\n\n    # Partition 2: 3 + 1\n    # Product of one rank 3 group and one rank 1 group.\n    # Rank 3 types: A_3, B_3.
