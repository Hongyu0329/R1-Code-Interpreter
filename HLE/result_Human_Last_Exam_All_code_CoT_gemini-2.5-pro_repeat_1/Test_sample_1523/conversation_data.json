    "Of course. This is a theoretical physics question that can be represented using symbolic computation. Here is my plan to provide you with a coded solution:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the expression for the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` from the standard Euclidean action for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory. The operator `D` is derived from the quadratic (free) part of the action, which is `S₀ = ½ ∫ d⁴x ϕ [-∂² + m²] ϕ`.\n2.  From this, we can see that the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` corresponds to the integral `∫ d⁴x ϕ(x) [-∂² + m²] ϕ(x)`.\n3.  I will then use Python's `sympy` library to construct this expression symbolically. This approach allows us to represent the field `ϕ` as a function, the differential operator `∂²`, the mass `m`, and the integral itself without performing a numerical calculation, which isn't possible without a specific field configuration.\n4.  The final code will print a symbolic representation of this inner product, detailing its components to satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the expression:\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically computes and displays the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral\n    scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define spacetime coordinates and mass as symbolic variables\n    # τ is imaginary time, x_1, x_2, x_3 are spatial coordinates\n    tau, x1, x2, x3 = sympy.symbols('τ x_1 x_2 x_3')\n    m = sympy.Symbol('m', positive=True)\n\n    # Define the scalar field ϕ as a function of the spacetime coordinates\n    phi = sympy.Function('ϕ')(tau, x1, x2, x3)\n\n    # Define the 4-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian operator acting on ϕ.\n    # The Laplacian ∂² is (∂²/∂τ² + ∂²/∂x₁² + ∂²/∂x₂² + ∂²/∂x₃²)\n    laplacian_phi = (\n        sympy.Derivative(phi, tau, 2) +\n        sympy.Derivative(phi, x1, 2) +\n        sympy.Derivative(phi, x2, 2) +\n        sympy.Derivative(phi, x3, 2)\n    )\n\n    # The operator D in the quadratic action S₀ = ½ ∫ ϕ D ϕ is D = [-∂² + m²].\n    # We now find the expression for D applied to ϕ.\n    D_phi = -laplacian_phi + m**2 * phi\n\n    # The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is defined as the integral of ϕ * (D_ϕ)\n    # over 4D Euclidean spacetime.\n    integrand = phi * D_phi\n\n    # We represent the full inner product symbolically using sympy.Integral.\n    # The integral is over d⁴x which is represented by the coordinates.\n    inner_product_expression = sympy.Integral(integrand, (tau, x1, x2, x3))\n\n    # Print the final symbolic expression for the inner product.\n    # sympy.pprint provides a nicely formatted output.\n    print(\"The symbolic expression for the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(inner_product_expression)\n\n    # To fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we can explicitly print the terms of the integrand.
