    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: Determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 will have a transitive Galois group, which narrows down the possibilities.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the group is a subgroup of $A_4$.\n3.  **Find the Resolvent Cubic**: The reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides further constraints on the structure of the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze and Conclude**: Using the information from the previous steps, we can identify the specific Galois group from the list of possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ and determine its order. The possibilities are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n### Execution:\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    The final answer is the order of the group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the polynomial variables\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    y = sympy.Symbol('y')\n    \n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    f = x**4 + p*x + q\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n\n    # Step 1: Check irreducibility over Q\n    print(\"Step 1: Check Irreducibility\")\n    # Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2:\n    # 1.
