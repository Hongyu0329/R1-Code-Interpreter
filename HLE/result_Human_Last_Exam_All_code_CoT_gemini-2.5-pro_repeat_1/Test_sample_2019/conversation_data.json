    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Attacks:** The problem involves a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. \"Toroidal\" means the board wraps around on all sides (top connects to bottom, left connects to right). This changes how queens attack.\n    *   **Rows/Columns:** A queen at `(r, c)` attacks all cells in row `r` and column `c`, just like a standard board.\n    *   **Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, the diagonals also wrap around. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other diagonally if their coordinates satisfy one of the following conditions (using modulo 5 arithmetic):\n        *   ` (r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5 `\n        *   ` (r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5 `\n\n2.  **Choose a Method:** This problem is a combinatorial search problem. A backtracking algorithm is an excellent fit. The strategy is to place queens one by one, and if a placement leads to a conflict, we \"backtrack\" and try a different position.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a recursive Python function, let's call it `solve()`, that attempts to place the required number of queens.\n    *   The function will take the number of queens left to place, the board positions already tried, and the current list of queen placements as input.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of 4 positions in different orders (e.g., placing a queen at (0,0) then (1,2) is the same as placing at (1,2) then (0,0)), I will enforce an ordering. We can imagine the 25 cells are numbered 0 to 24. When we place a queen, we will only look for the next spot in cells with a higher number.\n    *   The recursion's base case is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. In this case, we have found one valid solution and return 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will iterate through available cells. For each cell, it checks if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (i.e., not attacked by any existing queens based on the toroidal rules).\n    *   If the cell is safe, it places the queen and makes a recursive call to place the next one. The results of these calls are summed up.\n    *   The final result will be the total count returned by the initial call to the function.\n\nThis approach will systematically explore all valid combinations of 4 queens on the board.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # Size of the board\n    Q = 4  # Number of queens\n\n    def is_safe(pos, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at `pos` is safe with respect to `placements`.\n        A position is safe if it's not on the same row, column, or toroidal diagonal\n        as any queen already in the placements list.\n        \"\"\"\n        r_new, c_new = pos\n        for r_old, c_old in placements:\n            # Check row and column\n            if r_new == r_old or c_new == c_old:\n                return False\n            # Check toroidal diagonals using modulo arithmetic\n            if (r_new - c_new) % N == (r_old - c_old) % N:\n                return False\n            if (r_new + c_new) % N == (r_old + c_old) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_solutions(queens_to_place, start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds the number of ways to place the remaining queens.\n        - queens_to_place: How many more queens we need to place.\n        - start_index: The linear index (0-24) to start searching from.
