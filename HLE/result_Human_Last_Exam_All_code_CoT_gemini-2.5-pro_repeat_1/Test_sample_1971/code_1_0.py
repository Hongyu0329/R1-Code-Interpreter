# Define symbols for the parameters and constants
alpha_sq, R = sympy.symbols('alpha^2 R')

# Step 1 & 2: Derive the on-shell value of the auxiliary field S.
# The Lagrangian terms involving S are L_S = -e/3 * S^2 + alpha*e*S.
# The equation of motion dL/dS = 0 gives -2*e/3 * S + alpha*e = 0.
# This yields S = 3*alpha / 2.

# Step 3: Find the effective cosmological constant Lambda.
# Substitute S back into the potential V(S) = e/3 * S^2 - alpha*e*S.
# The Lagrangian has a cosmological constant term L_Lambda = -V(S_on_shell).
# Lambda_term = e * (alpha * (3*alpha/2) - (1/3) * (3*alpha/2)**2)
#             = e * (3*alpha**2/2 - 3*alpha**2/4)
#             = e * (3/4) * alpha**2
# So, the cosmological constant Lambda = (3/4) * alpha**2.
# Since Lambda > 0 (for real alpha), this describes a de Sitter (dS) spacetime.

# Step 4 & 5: Find the gravitino mass `m` and enforce consistency.
# Substitute S into the gravitino transformation rule:
# delta_psi_mu = (1/kappa)*D_mu(epsilon) + (1/6)*gamma_mu*S*epsilon
#              = (1/kappa)*D_mu(epsilon) + (1/6)*gamma_mu*(3*alpha/2)*epsilon
#              = (1/kappa)*D_mu(epsilon) + (alpha/4)*gamma_mu*epsilon
# The standard form for dS supergravity is:
# delta_psi_mu = (1/kappa)*D_mu(epsilon) - (m / (2*kappa))*gamma_mu*epsilon
# Comparing the two gives: -m/(2*kappa) = alpha/4  => m = -alpha*kappa/2.
# The dS consistency relation is Lambda = 3 * (m/kappa)**2.
# (3/4)*alpha**2 = 3 * ((-alpha*kappa/2)/kappa)**2 = 3 * (-alpha/2)**2 = 3*alpha**2/4.
# This is consistent. Note: some conventions relate Lambda and m with kappa,
# leading to kappa^2 = 1, which we assume.

# Step 6: Determine beta.
# The gravitino mass term in the Lagrangian from L_cos is `alpha*e*kappa*beta * (psi-bar*gamma*psi)`.
# With kappa=1, this is `alpha*e*beta * (psi-bar*gamma*psi)`.
# The standard mass term in the dS Lagrangian is `-m*e*(psi-bar*gamma*psi)`.
# Equating the coefficients: alpha * beta = -m.
# With m = -alpha/2 (from step 5 with kappa=1), we get:
# alpha * beta = -(-alpha/2) = alpha/2.
# Solving for beta gives:
beta = sympy.Rational(1, 2)

# Step 7: Relate alpha^2 to the Ricci scalar R.
# For a dS spacetime, the relation between the Ricci scalar and Lambda is R = 4*Lambda.
# R = 4 * (3/4 * alpha**2) = 3 * alpha**2.
# Solving for alpha^2 gives:
alpha_sq_expr = R / 3

# Final Output
print("The value of beta is:")
print(beta)
print("\nThe expression for alpha^2 in terms of the constant curvature R is:")
# The problem asks for the equation, so we print the full relation.
print(f"{alpha_sq} = {alpha_sq_expr}")

print(f"beta = 1 / 2")

# The final answer format is <<<answer content>>>. The user wants to find alpha^2 and beta.
# Since alpha^2 is an expression and beta is a number, I will provide them separately.
# The problem is a multi-part question, but the final answer seems to be the numerical values.
# Let's format the answer clearly.

# The prompt is a bit ambiguous on how to format two answers. Let's provide them clearly.
# Let's provide the number for beta as requested.
# <<<1/2>>>

# Let's re-read the prompt on the final answer format. "return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>>".
# It doesn't specify how to handle multiple parts. I will output the value of beta as it is a pure number.
# Let's give both answers in the final tag.
