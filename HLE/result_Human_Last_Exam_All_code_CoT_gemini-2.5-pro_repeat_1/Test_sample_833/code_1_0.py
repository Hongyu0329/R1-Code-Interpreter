# The problem is a symbolic mathematical derivation.
# The following code prints the result of this derivation.

# The expression to be bounded is E = (d/dt + (1-2u)*u_bar*d/dx) * u_bar
# where u_bar is a non-local term.
# Through a series of derivations detailed in the thinking process, we find
# the lower bound 'a' for the expression E.

# The derivation involves:
# 1. Finding a local relation between u and u_bar: u_x = u_bar - u_bar_xx
# 2. Deriving an expression for the time derivative of u_bar:
#    d(u_bar)/dt = u(1-u)u_bar - K * (u(1-u)u_bar)
#    where K is the convolution operator with kernel 1/2*exp(-|z|).
# 3. Substituting this into the expression E.
# 4. Performing algebraic manipulations and using symmetry arguments to find the bound.

# The final result of the derivation is that the constant lower bound is -1/8.
a = -1/8

# We are asked to express the answer in the form a <= expression.
# The value of 'a' is what we have determined.
print(f"The lower bound 'a' is determined to be: {a}")
print(f"So, we have the inequality: {a} <= (d/dt + (1-2u)*u_bar*d/dx) * u_bar")

# The problem asks to return the answer in a specific format.
# Let's represent the number as a fraction for precision.
a_frac = sympy.S(a)
print(f"The constant a is: {a_frac}")
