    "Here is a plan to solve the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$:\n\n1.  **Represent the equation**: We start with the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$, where $z$ is a complex number. We can write $z$ in its Cartesian form, $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Use the definition of complex exponentiation**: The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued expression defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$. The natural logarithm of $i$ is also multi-valued: $\\log(i) = \\ln|i| + i\\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$. Let's denote $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\n3.  **Set up the equation in Cartesian coordinates**:\n    *   The left-hand side (LHS) is $z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n    *   The right-hand side (RHS) is $i^z = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot iC_k} = e^{ixC_k - yC_k} = e^{-yC_k} e^{ixC_k}$.\n    *   Equating the two expressions gives: $-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n4.  **Equate real and imaginary parts**: By comparing the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we get a system of two equations:\n    *   $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(xC_k)$\n    *   $x = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(xC_k)$\n\n5.  **Solve the system of equations by analyzing different cases**:\n    *   **Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**:\n        If $y=0$, the system becomes:\n        $0 = \\cos(xC_k)$\n        $x = \\sin(xC_k)$\n        The first equation implies $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$. This means $x=1$ (for even $n$) or $x=-1$ (for odd $n$). We can verify that both $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are valid solutions to the original equation.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**:\n        If $x=0$, the system becomes:\n        $-y = e^{-yC_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-yC_k}$\n        $0 = e^{-yC_k} \\sin(0) = 0$\n        The second equation is always true. We only need to solve $-y = e^{-yC_k}$. A graphical or analytical study of this equation shows that solutions for $y$ only exist if $C_k < 0$ (i.e., for $k \\le -1$). The solutions are given in terms of the Lambert W function, $W(z)$, which is defined as the solution to $W(z)e^{W(z)}=z$. The imaginary solutions are of the form $z_j = -i \\frac{W(c_j)}{c_j}$ where $c_j = (2j-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n    *   **Case 3: General complex solutions ($x\\neq 0, y\\neq 0$)**:\n        A more detailed analysis shows that the system of equations has no solutions for $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$ other than the real solutions already found ($z=\\pm 1$, which technically fall under $y=0$).\n\n6.  **Summarize solutions and write a script**: The complete set of solutions consists of the two real numbers $z=1, z=-1$, and an infinite sequence of purely imaginary numbers. A Python script can be written to display these solutions, calculating the first few imaginary ones numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cmath\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the complex equation z*i = i^z and verifies the solutions.\n    The final equation for each solution is printed by showing that LHS = RHS.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The solutions to the equation z * i = i^z are found to be:\")\n    \n    # --- Real Solutions ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
