    # (a) Provide an expression for the minimum number of vertices a genus-g A-marked
    # graph must have for M_trop(g,A) to be non-empty.
    # The space is non-empty iff at least one stable graph exists. A stable graph
    # has all vertices with valency >= 3. This is possible iff 2g + |A| >= 3.
    # When this condition is met, one can construct a graph with a single vertex
    # (having g loops and |A| legs), making the minimum number of vertices 1.

    # (b) Is it true that if g = 0, the moduli space M_trop(g,A) is always a simplicial fan?
    # Yes, for g=0, M_trop(0,A) is the space of phylogenetic trees, which is a simplicial fan.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # (c) For g > 0, will M_trop(g,A) be a tropical variety? If so, what is its
    # complex dimension? If not, will it still form a partially open polyhedral complex?
    # Yes, it is a tropical variety. Its dimension is that of the maximal cones,
    # which correspond to trivalent graphs. The dimension is the number of internal edges.
