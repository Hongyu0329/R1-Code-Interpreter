    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can follow a systematic plan.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Identify Fixed Morphisms:** A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each object. These are `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms.\n2.  **Place the Remaining Morphisms:** We are left with 2 non-identity morphisms. These morphisms must be placed into one of the four \"hom-sets\":\n    *   `Hom(A, A)`: Morphisms from `A` to `A`\n    *   `Hom(A, B)`: Morphisms from `A` to `B`\n    *   `Hom(B, A)`: Morphisms from `B` to `A`\n    *   `Hom(B, B)`: Morphisms from `B` to `B`\n3.  **Enumerate Hom-Set Distributions:** We will list all the possible ways to distribute the 2 non-identity morphisms into these four sets. For example, both could be in `Hom(A, A)`, or one could be in `Hom(A, B)` and the other in `Hom(B, A)`, etc.\n4.  **Count Non-Isomorphic Structures:** For each distribution, we determine how many unique (non-isomorphic) ways there are to define the composition rules that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n5.  **Sum the Counts:** The final answer is the sum of the counts from each distinct case.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan by defining the number of categories found for each case and summing them up. The comments in the code explain the reasoning for the number derived from each case.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    The calculation is based on a case-by-case analysis of how the 4 morphisms\n    are distributed among the four hom-sets of a 2-object category {A, B}.\n    Two morphisms are always the identities id_A and id_B. We analyze the placement\n    of the remaining two non-identity morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\")\n    print(\"This involves summing the number of non-isomorphic structures for each possible distribution of morphisms.\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: The two non-identity morphisms are both endomorphisms on object A.\n    # The hom-set sizes are (3, 0, 0, 1).
