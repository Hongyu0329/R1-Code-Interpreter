# The problem is to find the number of connected components of the space of
# non-self-intersecting 6-sided polygons in R^3.

# This is a problem of classifying such polygons by their knot type.
# The number of connected components is equal to the number of distinct knot types
# that can be formed with 6 edges. A knot type can be formed if its "stick number"
# (the minimum number of edges required) is less than or equal to 6.

# 1. The Unknot (also known as the trivial knot)
# The stick number of the unknot is 3 (a triangle).
stick_number_unknot = 3
# Since 3 <= 6, the unknot can be formed.
# The unknot is achiral (its mirror image is equivalent to itself).
# Therefore, it contributes one connected component.
num_components_unknot = 1
print(f"Knot Type: Unknot")
print(f"Stick Number: {stick_number_unknot}")
print(f"Possible with 6 edges: {stick_number_unknot <= 6}")
print(f"Number of components for this type: {num_components_unknot}\n")

# 2. The Trefoil Knot (the simplest non-trivial knot)
# The stick number of the trefoil knot is 6.
stick_number_trefoil = 6
# Since 6 <= 6, the trefoil knot can be formed.
# The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image.
# The left-handed and right-handed trefoils are distinct knot types.
# Therefore, it contributes two connected components.
num_components_trefoil = 2
print(f"Knot Type: Trefoil Knot")
print(f"Stick Number: {stick_number_trefoil}")
print(f"Possible with 6 edges: {stick_number_trefoil <= 6}")
print(f"Number of components for this type: {num_components_trefoil} (left-handed and right-handed)\n")

# 3. Other knots
# The next simplest knot is the figure-eight knot, which has a stick number of 7.
# Since 7 > 6, it and any more complex knots cannot be formed.
print("All other knot types have a stick number greater than 6 and are not possible.\n")

# 4. Total number of components
# The total number of connected components is the sum of the components from all possible knot types.
total_components = num_components_unknot + num_components_trefoil

print("The total number of connected components is the sum of the components from each possible knot type.")
print(f"Total Components = (Components from Unknot) + (Components from Trefoil Knot)")
print(f"Total Components = {num_components_unknot} + {num_components_trefoil} = {total_components}")
