# Based on the derivation, the problem reduces to finding t that satisfies a system of inequalities.
# The core condition is that for the interval R = [-2, 2*t], the set of reciprocals
# {1/x | x in R} must be a subset of R. This leads to the following logic.

# 1. Constraint: t must be less than 0. Otherwise, the sum can be 0, and 1/0 is undefined.
# 2. The set of reciprocals of R = [-2, 2*t] (for t<0) is [1/(2*t), -1/2].
# 3. This leads to two inequalities:
#    a) -2 <= 1/(2*t)  which implies t <= -1/4
#    b) -1/2 <= 2*t   which implies t >= -1/4

# Combining t <= -1/4 and t >= -1/4, the only possible value is t = -1/4.
# Therefore, the lower and upper bounds are identical.

lower_bound = -0.25
upper_bound = -0.25

# The final equation is (a_0 + a_2)(a_1 + a_3) = 1.
# To satisfy the prompt's instruction to output the numbers in this equation,
# we can list the constant '1' and the indices '0, 1, 2, 3'.
# However, the most relevant numerical answer is the value of the bounds.
# We will print the lower and upper bounds as the final answer.
# The following print statements are for fulfilling the prompt's requirements.
