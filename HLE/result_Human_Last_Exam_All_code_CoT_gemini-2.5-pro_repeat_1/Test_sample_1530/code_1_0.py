    Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poem to find the correct answer:

    1.  The poem describes a female entity ("she") who is "Naked" and "cold." This points towards a natural phenomenon associated with cold temperatures.

    2.  She "knits a veil" and creates something that is "lace and glass." This metaphorical language describes a delicate, intricate, and crystalline pattern. The word "glass" is a key clue, suggesting the structure is made of ice crystals.

    3.  This creation is formed on plants like "grass and meadowsweet." This is consistent with how and where frost forms.

    4.  The creation is temporary. It "waits for pelted Autumn" (personified as a rough, wild figure) to "fray each feather stitch." This perfectly describes how the delicate patterns of frost are destroyed by the wind, rain, or sun that comes with the progression of the autumn season.

    5.  Considering the options:
        - A. The intricate, lace-like patterns of frost during Autumn: This aligns perfectly with all the clues: cold, lace, glass, formation on plants, and its temporary nature in Autumn.
        - C. A spider spinning her web: While a web is lace-like, it is not "cold" or "glass."
        - B, D, E: These options do not fit the collective imagery of the poem.

    Therefore, the poem is describing frost.
