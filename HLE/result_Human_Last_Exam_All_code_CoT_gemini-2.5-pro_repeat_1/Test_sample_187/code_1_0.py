# The analysis identifies errors in the `center_of_mass` method.
# The specification requires precise arithmetic, but lines 22 and 23 use
# standard Python integer division `/`, which results in floating-point numbers,
# contradicting the requirement for exact results (like the fraction 1/3).
# Therefore, lines 22 and 23 are the sources of the errors.
