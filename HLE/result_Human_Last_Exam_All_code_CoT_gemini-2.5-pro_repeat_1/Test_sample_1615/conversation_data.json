    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** We are given a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices. We know that $G$ is not a complete graph ($K_n$). We need to find the maximum possible number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of such a graph. This value is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that fits the description.\n\n2.  **Recall Graph Coloring Principles:**\n    *   The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$.\n    *   A graph requires exactly $n$ colors if and only if it is the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Apply the Principles to the Problem:**\n    *   Our graph $G$ is explicitly stated to *not* be a complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Value:** To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n\n5.  **Construct an Example Graph:**\n    *   Consider a graph $G'$ which is a complete graph on $n$ vertices from which a single edge has been removed. Let's say the removed edge was between vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   This graph $G'$ is not complete.\n    *   Let's determine its chromatic number, $\\chi(G')$. The subgraph formed by the vertices $\\{v_3, v_4, \\ldots, v_n\\}$ is a complete graph $K_{n-2}$. These vertices are all connected to each other, and also to $v_1$ and $v_2$.\n    *   We can start coloring $G'$. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are not adjacent, we can give them the same color, say Color 1.\n    *   Now, every other vertex $v_i$ (for $i > 2$) is adjacent to both $v_1$ and $v_2$, so none of them can be Color 1.\n    *   Furthermore, the remaining $n-2$ vertices all form a clique (a $K_{n-2}$ subgraph), meaning they must all have distinct colors from each other.\n    *   So, we need $n-2$ new, distinct colors for these vertices.\n    *   The total number of colors required is $1$ (for $v_1$ and $v_2$) + $(n-2)$ (for the other vertices) = $n-1$ colors.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that any non-complete graph on $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors, and that there exists such a graph that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation:** With $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G.\nn = 12345\n\n# The problem asks for the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring\n# of a graph G with n vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n\n# 1. A complete graph with n vertices, K_n, is the only graph that requires n colors.\n#    In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n# 2. Since the graph G is not a complete graph, it means there is at least one pair of\n#    vertices that are not connected by an edge. This implies its chromatic number,\n#    chi(G), must be less than n. Thus, chi(G) <= n - 1.\n\n# 3. To find the maximum number of colors, we need to check if it's possible for a\n#    non-complete graph to require n - 1 colors. Consider a graph G' that is a\n#    complete graph K_n with just one edge removed. This graph is not complete,\n#    and it can be shown that its chromatic number is exactly n - 1.\n\n# 4. Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed for a non-complete graph with\n#    n vertices is n - 1.\n\n# Calculate the result for n = 12345.\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation.\nprint(f\"For a non-complete graph with {n} vertices, the maximum number of colors required for a proper coloring is {n} - 1.\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
