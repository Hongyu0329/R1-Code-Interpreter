    "My plan to find the closed form for the given sum is as follows:\n1.  I will define a general sum $S_n(f) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} f(k) \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$. The given sum is of this form with $f(k) = (2k+1)^5$.\n2.  This sum is a convolution of two sequences. The generating function for the sum is the product of the generating functions of the two sequences.\n3.  I will focus on the case where $f(k) = k^m$ for $m=0, 1, \\dots, 5$. Let this sum be $S_n(k^m)$.\n    *   The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $\\binom{2k}{k}$ is $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for the sequence $k^m \\binom{2k}{k}$ can be found by applying the operator $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$ m times to $B(x)$, i.e., $\\theta^m B(x)$.\n    *   The generating function for $S_n(k^m)$ is the product $(\\theta^m B(x)) \\cdot B(x)$.\n4.  By expanding these generating functions, I can find closed-form expressions for $S_n(k^m)$. It turns out that $S_n(k^m) = P_m(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $P_m(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$. I will derive these polynomials for $m=0, 1, \\dots, 5$.\n5.  Next, I will expand the polynomial $(2k+1)^5$ in the original sum:\n    $(2k+1)^5 = 32k^5 + 80k^4 + 80k^3 + 40k^2 + 10k + 1$.\n6.  Using the linearity of summation, the original sum can be expressed as a linear combination of the $S_n(k^m)$ terms:\n    $S_n = 32 S_n(k^5) + 80 S_n(k^4) + 80 S_n(k^3) + 40 S_n(k^2) + 10 S_n(k) + S_n(1)$.\n7.  I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic polynomial algebra. This involves substituting the expressions for $S_n(k^m)$ and simplifying the result to obtain a final polynomial $Q(n)$ such that the sum is $4^n \\cdot Q(n)$.\n8.  Finally, the Python code will print the resulting closed-form expression, ensuring all the numerical coefficients in the final equation are explicitly shown as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and prints the closed form for the sum:\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')\n\n    # These are the polynomials P_m(n) such that the sum for k^m is P_m(n) * 4^n.\n    # These have been derived using the generating function method described in the plan.\n    P = [0] * 6\n    P[0] = sympy.sympify(1)\n    P[1] = n / 2\n    P[2] = n * (3*n + 1) / 8\n    P[3] = n**2 * (5*n + 3) / 16\n    P[4] = n * (35*n**3 + 30*n**2 + n - 2) / 128\n    P[5] = n**2 * (63*n**3 + 70*n**2 + 5*n - 10) / 256\n\n    # The polynomial (2k+1)^5 is expanded into a sum of powers of k.\n    # The coefficients are for k^0, k^1, ..., k^5.\n    coeffs = [1, 10, 40, 80, 80, 32] \n\n    # The final closed form is 4^n * Q(n), where Q(n) is a polynomial in n.\n    # Q(n) is calculated as a linear combination of the polynomials P_m(n).\n    Q_n = sum(c * p for c, p in zip(coeffs, P))\n    \n    # Simplify the resulting polynomial Q(n)\n    Q_n_simplified = sympy.simplify(Q_n)\n\n    # For printing, extract the numerator and denominator to format as 4^n * (1/d) * (polynomial)\n    num, den = Q_n_simplified.as_numer_denom()\n    \n    # Create a polynomial object from the numerator for easier coefficient access\n    poly = sympy.Poly(num, n)\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    \n    # Build the string representation of the final equation\n    # The format will be: 4**n * (1/denominator) * (c5*n**5 + c4*n**4 + ... + c0)\n    equation_str = f\"4**{n} * (1/{den}) * (\"\n    \n    # Iterate through the coefficients and powers to build the polynomial string\n    terms = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(poly.all_coeffs()):\n        power = poly.degree() - i\n        \n        # Skip terms with zero coefficient\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Format the term based on its power and coefficient\n        if power > 1:\n            term = f\"{coeff}*{n}**{power}\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            term = f\"{coeff}*{n}\"\n        else: # power == 0\n            term = f\"{coeff}\"\n        \n        terms.append(term)\n    \n    # Join the terms with ' + ' and handle negative signs for cleaner output\n    polynomial_str = \" + \".join(terms)\n    polynomial_str = polynomial_str.replace('+ -', '- ')\n    \n    equation_str += polynomial_str + \")\"\n    \n    print(equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closed_form()\n```\n<<<4**n * (1/8) * (63*n**5 + 245*n**4 + 355*n**3 + 235*n**2 + 70*n + 8)>>>"
