    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a literary question based on the poem \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\" by James Russell Lowell. My plan is to identify the relevant passage from the poem that mentions the books Sir Launfal's own book was kept with. Then, I will create a simple Python script to store this information and print the answer clearly, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the literary question based on\n    James Russell Lowell's poem, \"The Vision of Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # In the prelude to the poem, the narrator describes where Sir Launfal's own book was kept.\n    # It \"slept\" alongside the works of two famous authors and another specific book.\n    accompanying_book = \"the great Book of the Duke\"\n    \n    # The poem states: \"...Wherein with Gower and Chaucer slept, Along with the great Book of the Duke...\"\n    \n    print(f\"In the poem, Sir Launfal's own book was preserved alongside 'the great Book of the Duke.'\")\n\nfind_book_title()\n```\n<<<the great Book of the Duke>>>"
