    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Graph:** First, I'll model the 10-node barbell graph. This graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (cliques) connected by a single \"bottleneck\" edge.\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:** I'll calculate the degree of the two specific nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. A node at the end of the bottleneck is connected to all 4 other nodes in its own clique and to 1 node in the other clique, making its total degree 5.\n3.  **Apply Gossiping Probability:** The randomized uniform gossiping protocol involves two steps: (a) pick a node uniformly at random from all 10 nodes, and (b) pick one of its neighbors uniformly at random.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   Scenario A: Picking the node on one side of the bottleneck first, then its neighbor across the bottleneck.\n    *   Scenario B: Picking the node on the other side first, then its neighbor.\n    I will calculate the probability of each of these two scenarios and add them together to find the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. The final code will print out this step-by-step calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossiping_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # The barbell graph has two cliques.
