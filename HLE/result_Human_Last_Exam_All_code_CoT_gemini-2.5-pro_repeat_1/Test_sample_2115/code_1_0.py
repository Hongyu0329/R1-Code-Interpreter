# The problem is to calculate the integral of u(x,y,-y,1) from x=0 to 1.
# We assume the value of this integral is a conserved quantity.
# Therefore, the value at t=1 is the same as at t=0.
# The integral at t=0 evaluates to the analytical expression:
# 3 * (ln(3) - ln(e^2 + e + 1))

# Let's calculate the numerical values for each part of the final equation.
C = 3.0
ln_A = math.log(3)
ln_B = math.log(math.e**2 + math.e + 1)

# The final equation is C * (ln_A - ln_B)
final_result = C * (ln_A - ln_B)

print("The final equation is C * (ln(A) - ln(B))")
print(f"The value for C is: {C}")
print(f"The value for ln(A) is: {ln_A}")
print(f"The value for ln(B) is: {ln_B}")
print(f"The final result of {C} * ({ln_A} - {ln_B}) is:")
print(final_result)
