    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we need to determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions:** The problem provides six boundary conditions. Let's list them:\n    1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$\n    6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\n2.  **Group Conditions by Variable:** We can observe that these conditions constrain three different components of the vector $x(t)$: $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_{2024}$. Since these components are independent, we can analyze the conditions for each component separately and then sum the results.\n    *   **For $x_1$:** We have one condition: $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$.\n    *   **For $x_2$:** We have four conditions:\n        *   $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n        *   $5(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$\n        *   $100(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$\n        *   $-1000(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$\n        All these conditions are scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, they represent only one linearly independent condition.\n    *   **For $x_{2024}$:** We have one condition: $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Determine Linear Independence using Matrix Rank:** The number of linearly independent conditions in each group can be formally determined by finding the rank of the matrix of coefficients for the variables in that group (i.e., $[x_i(0), x_i(T)]$).\n    *   For $x_1$, the condition is $-1 \\cdot x_1(0) + 1 \\cdot x_1(T) = 0$. The coefficient matrix is `[[-1, 1]]`. Its rank is 1.\n    *   For $x_2$, the conditions form a coefficient matrix. Its rank will tell us the number of independent conditions.\n    *   For $x_{2024}$, the condition is $-100 \\cdot x_{2024}(0) + 100 \\cdot x_{2024}(T) = 0$. The coefficient matrix is `[[-100, 100]]`. Its rank is 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Index:** The total index of the problem is the sum of the ranks for each group of variables.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by creating the coefficient matrices for each variable group and calculating their ranks to find the total number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\nNote: There is a discrepancy in the problem description regarding the dimension of the system ($n=2024$ for $x(t)$ vs $n=202000$ for matrix $A$). However, this does not affect the calculation of the index, which only depends on the provided boundary conditions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The index of the problem is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n# We can group the conditions by the variable they affect: x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n# The total index is the sum of the number of independent conditions for each variable.\n\n# --- Conditions for x_1 ---\n# Equation 1: x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0  => -1*x_1(0) + 1*x_1(T) = 0\n# The variables are (x_1(0), x_1(T)). The coefficient matrix is:\nM1 = np.array([\n    [-1, 1]\n])\nrank1 = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M1)\n\n# --- Conditions for x_2 ---\n# Equation 2: x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0        => -1*x_2(0) + 1*x_2(T) = 0\n# Equation 3: 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0      => -5*x_2(0) + 5*x_2(T) = 0\n# Equation 4: 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0  => -100*x_2(0) + 100*x_2(T) = 0\n# Equation 5: 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0 => 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n# The variables are (x_2(0), x_2(T)). The coefficient matrix is:\nM2 = np.array([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [-5, 5],\n    [-100, 100],\n    [1000, -1000]\n])\nrank2 = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M2)\n\n# --- Conditions for x_2024 ---\n# Equation 6: 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0 => -100*x_2024(0) + 100*x_2024(T) = 0\n# The variables are (x_2024(0), x_2024(T)). The coefficient matrix is:\nM3 = np.array([\n    [-100, 100]\n])\nrank3 = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M3)\n\n# The total index is the sum of the ranks from each independent group of variables.\ntotal_index = rank1 + rank2 + rank3\n\n# Print the final equation showing how the total index is calculated\n# from the number of independent equations in each group.\nprint(f\"{rank1} + {rank2} + {rank3} = {total_index}\")\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
