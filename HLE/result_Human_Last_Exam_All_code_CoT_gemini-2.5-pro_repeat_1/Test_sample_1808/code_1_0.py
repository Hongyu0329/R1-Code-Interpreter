    # Explanation of terms and the impact of gene flow
    print("Step 1: Understanding Fst (Fixation Index)")
    print(" - Fst measures genetic differentiation between populations.")
    print(" - Fst ranges from 0 (no differentiation) to 1 (complete differentiation).")
    print(" - Gene flow involves the exchange of alleles, which makes populations more genetically similar.")
    print(" - Therefore, gene flow acts to *decrease* Fst.")
    print(" - Conclusion: High gene flow is inconsistent with maintaining a high Fst. A high Fst implies a lack of gene flow.\n")

    print("Step 2: Understanding Dxy (Absolute Divergence)")
    print(" - Dxy measures the average number of nucleotide differences between two populations.")
    print(" - It reflects the historical divergence time. If two populations were isolated for a long time before forming a hybrid zone, they will have a high Dxy.")
    print(" - While gene flow will eventually reduce Dxy, this process can be slow. Thus, populations can have both ongoing gene flow and a high Dxy from their past history.")
    print(" - Conclusion: High Dxy *can* occur in a hybrid zone.\n")

    print("Step 3: Understanding Fis (Inbreeding Coefficient)")
    print(" - Fis measures the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within a population, specifically a deficit or excess of heterozygotes.")
    print(" - A high positive Fis indicates a deficit of heterozygotes.")
    print(" - In a hybrid zone, if individuals prefer to mate with others of similar ancestry (assortative mating) or if hybrids have lower fitness, there can be a deficit of heterozygous hybrid offspring.")
    print(" - Conclusion: High Fis *can* occur in a hybrid zone.\n")

    print("Step 4: Understanding μ (Mutation Rate)")
    print(" - μ is the fundamental rate at which new mutations arise per gene per generation.")
    print(" - This rate is an intrinsic biological property of an organism and is not directly caused or changed by the process of gene flow between populations.")
    print(" - Conclusion: Gene flow does not cause a 'high μ'. While a population experiencing gene flow might also have a high mutation rate, one does not cause the other.\n")

    print("Step 5: Understanding Pi (π, Nucleotide Diversity)")
    print(" - Pi measures the average genetic diversity *within* a single population.")
    print(" - Gene flow from a genetically different population introduces new alleles into the recipient population.")
    print(" - This introduction of new genetic variants increases the overall genetic diversity.")
    print(" - Conclusion: High Pi *can* occur (and is often expected) in a population within a hybrid zone.\n")

    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The question asks what *cannot* occur when there is gene flow. Gene flow's primary effect is to homogenize populations, which directly counteracts and reduces differentiation (Fst).")
    print("Therefore, the presence of significant gene flow is fundamentally at odds with maintaining a high level of Fst.")
    print("The correct answer is A.")
