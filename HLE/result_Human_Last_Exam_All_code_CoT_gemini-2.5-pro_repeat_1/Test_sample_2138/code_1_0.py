# The problem format suggests a single final answer.
# Since the exact symbolic value appears to have no simpler form,
# we provide the high-precision numerical value as the result.
# No simple symbolic value like a combination of pi, e, etc. is known for this integral.
# The numerical value is the most practical "analytical value" in this case.
# The problem might be intended to test the ability to derive the special function expression and compute it.
# Let's assume the final answer requested is the numerical value.
# The required format is <<<answer content>>>. The value is complex.
# We will present it as a string.

# However, the user prompt implies a single code block and use of 'print' for output.
# The best I can do is to print the final numerical value.
# The problem might have a typo and a much simpler answer exists with a small change.
# For example, 4*pi/sqrt(3) is approx 7.255, which is close but not identical.
# Lacking a simple symbolic answer, the numerical result is the best response.
# The prompt is "Find the analytical value", and I have found it in terms of special functions.
# The code computes this value.
# I will output the final computed value as the answer.
# The value is purely imaginary.
# Let's format the output clearly.

# It seems the final value might be a trick. But after extensive search, no trick is apparent.
# Let's assume the question is as stated and the answer is the numerical value of the Hurwitz Zeta expression.

final_answer_str = f"{final_value.imag}*i"
# Since the output format is <<<...>>>, I will output the numerical imaginary part.
# The question asks for the analytical value, which is a complex number.
# Let's output the imaginary part as the final answer, since the real part is zero.
# Let's re-read the instructions: "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>>"
# and "Don't include multiple code blocks".
# I'll just print the final numeric value.
