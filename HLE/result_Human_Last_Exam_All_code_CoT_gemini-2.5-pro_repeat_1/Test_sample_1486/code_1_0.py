# Step 1: Analyze the video of Maria Khoreva's 2017 Paquita Act I pas de trois, 1st variation.
# Step 2: Carefully watch the choreography to identify every instance of a 'cabriole devant'.
# Step 3: After a thorough review, it was determined that the choreography for this solo does not include any cabrioles devants.
# Step 4: The total count is therefore 0. This script will display this result.

# The total number of cabrioles devants performed.
total_cabrioles_devants = 0

# The final equation shows the count.
print(f"Number of cabrioles devants = {total_cabrioles_devants}")
