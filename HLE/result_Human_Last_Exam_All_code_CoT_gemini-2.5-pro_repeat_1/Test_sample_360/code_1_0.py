    # The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) coordinates
    # through a pyridyl nitrogen and a thiazole nitrogen.

    # This means it has two distinct ways of orienting itself when it binds.

    # Step 3: Calculate the number of isomers formed from ONE enantiomer of the starting complex.
    # Let's take the Delta (Δ) enantiomer. The asymmetric ligand 'L' can bind in two
    # different orientations relative to the chiral [Ru(bpy)2] framework.
    # This results in two products that are diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).

    # formation of two diastereomeric products, we multiply the numbers.
