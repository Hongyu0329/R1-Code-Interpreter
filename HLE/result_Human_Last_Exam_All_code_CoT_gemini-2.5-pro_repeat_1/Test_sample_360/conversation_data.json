    "This is a problem in coordination chemistry concerning stereoisomerism. I will determine the number of isomers by analyzing the structures of the reactants and the resulting product complex.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction:** The reaction involves `cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)` (`cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`) and the ligand `2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` (let's call it `L`). The most likely reaction is the substitution of the two chloride ligands by `L` to form a new complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n2.  **Analyze Ligand `L`:** I will determine how `L` coordinates to the metal center. Given the reaction, it will act as a bidentate ligand. I need to assess if it's symmetric (like A-A) or asymmetric (like A-B). The structure shows it coordinates via a pyridyl nitrogen and a thiazole nitrogen, making it an asymmetric bidentate ligand.\n3.  **Analyze Starting Complex Chirality:** The starting complex, `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, is a classic example of a chiral octahedral complex. It exists as a pair of enantiomers (mirror images), denoted as Δ and Λ.\n4.  **Analyze Product Stereochemistry:** The product is of the form `[M(A-A)2(B-C)]`, where `M=Ru`, `A-A=bpy`, and `B-C=L`. I will consider the outcome of the reaction for each enantiomer of the starting material.\n    *   For the Δ-`[Ru(bpy)2]` core, the asymmetric ligand `L` can bind in two distinct orientations. This results in two products which are diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images).\n    *   Similarly, for the Λ-`[Ru(bpy)2]` core, two diastereomeric products will be formed.\n5.  **Calculate Total Isomers:** The total number of isomers is the sum of all possible stereoisomers formed. Since the reaction starts with a racemic mixture (both Δ and Λ enantiomers) and produces diastereomers from each, the total count will be the sum of these possibilities.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the number of isomers formed in the described reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the chirality of the starting complex cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2].\n    # The arrangement of two bidentate ligands (bpy) around the Ru center is chiral.\n    # It exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n    enantiomers_of_starting_complex = 2  # Designated as Delta (Δ) and Lambda (Λ)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the coordination of the incoming ligand 'L'.\n    # The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) coordinates\n    # through a pyridyl nitrogen and a thiazole nitrogen.\n    # Since these donor atoms are different, L acts as an asymmetric bidentate ligand.\n    # This means it has two distinct ways of orienting itself when it binds.\n    orientations_of_asymmetric_ligand = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of isomers formed from ONE enantiomer of the starting complex.\n    # Let's take the Delta (Δ) enantiomer.
