    # The problem asks for the exponent alpha in the best upper bound N^alpha for the measure of the set X.
    # X = {x in [0, 1] : exists t such that |sum_{n=1 to N} a_n e^{2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t)}| > N^(3/8)}
    # where sum_{n=1 to N} |a_n|^2 = 1.

    # Let M(x) = max_t |sum_{n=1 to N} a_n e^{2*pi*i*(n*x + n^2*t)}|.
    # The set is X = {x in [0, 1] : M(x) > N^(3/8)}.

    # We use Chebyshev's inequality. For a power p > 0:
    # |X| * (N^(3/8))^p <= integral from 0 to 1 of M(x)^p dx.

    # Let's choose p = 2.
    # |X| * N^(3/4) <= integral from 0 to 1 of M(x)^2 dx.

    # The key is to find the best upper bound for the integral on the right.
    # A simple bound can be obtained by using the triangle inequality and Cauchy-Schwarz:
    # M(x) <= sum(|a_n|) <= sqrt(N) * sqrt(sum(|a_n|^2)) = sqrt(N).
    # This gives integral M(x)^2 dx <= N, and |X| <= N^(1/4). So alpha <= 1/4.

    # However, this simple bound ignores the specific structure of the phase (nx + n^2*t).
    # A deep result in harmonic analysis (the sharp restriction theorem for the parabola) gives a much stronger bound:
    # integral from 0 to 1 of M(x)^2 dx <= C * N^(1/2) * sum(|a_n|^2),
    # for some constant C.

    # Since sum(|a_n|^2) = 1, we have:
    # integral from 0 to 1 of M(x)^2 dx <= C * N^(1/2).

    # Substituting this into the Chebyshev inequality:
    # |X| * N^(3/4) <= C * N^(1/2).

    # Solving for |X|, we get:
    # |X| <= C * N^(1/2 - 3/4) = C * N^(-1/4).

    # This implies that the exponent alpha in the best upper bound is -1/4.
