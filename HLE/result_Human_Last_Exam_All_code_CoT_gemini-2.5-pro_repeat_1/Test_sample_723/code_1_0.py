    # Step 1: Determine the function of the host gene 'xy'.

    print("Conclusion: The bacterial count is lower in mice with gene 'xy'. This means the product of gene 'xy' is a host defense factor that reduces bacterial numbers.")

    # Step 2: Determine the function of virulence factors A and B.
    print("Step 2: What is the role of virulence factors A and B?")

    print(f"However, removing both A and B reduces the count to {data['wtL_dAdB']}/ml.")
    print("This indicates A and B have a redundant function.")
    print("Since removing A and B allows the 'xy' defense to work (as seen in Step 1), the function of A and B must be to disable the 'xy' gene product.")
    print("Conclusion: Virulence factors A and B redundantly deactivate the host defense product of gene 'xy'.")

    # Step 3: Determine the function of virulence factor C.
