    Calculates the minimum hidden-layer width for a shallow neural network
    with GeLU activation to compute the squared norm of an N-dimensional vector.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Lower Bound: The Hessian of the target function ||x||^2 is 2*I, which has rank N.
       The Hessian of the network is a sum of H rank-1 matrices, so its rank is at most H.
       For the approximation to be possible, the ranks must match, so H >= N.
    2. Upper Bound: A constructive proof shows that N neurons are sufficient. Each neuron can be
       configured to approximate one x_i^2 term, and the results are summed.
       
    Therefore, the minimum width is N.

    # The result is the variable N itself, representing the dimension of the input vector.
    # The final equation is: Minimum Width = N
    # We print the variable part of the equation as requested.
