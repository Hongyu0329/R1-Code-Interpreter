    "To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes gives an upper limit, but doesn't account for the physical constraints of packing. A better method is to split the cube into sections that are easier to pack.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Decompose the 15x15x15 cube into two rectangular slabs based on the block's largest dimension (9). This gives us a 9x15x15 slab and a 6x15x15 slab.\n2.  Calculate the number of blocks that can fit into the 9x15x15 slab. Since one dimension of the slab (9) is a multiple of the block's length (9), this slab can be packed perfectly without any wasted space.\n3.  Calculate the number of blocks for the 6x15x15 slab. Since no dimension is a multiple of 9, this requires a more clever packing strategy. We can maximize the blocks by using different orientations. I'll model this by packing a 15x15 area with 9x1 tiles and then stacking these layers to the slab's height of 6.\n4.  Sum the blocks from both slabs to find the total.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Decompose the 15x15x15 cube into a 9x15x15 slab and a 6x15x15 slab.\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate blocks in the 9x15x15 slab.\n    # This slab can be packed perfectly.\n    # The number of blocks is the volume of the slab divided by the volume of a block.\n    blocks_in_slab1 = (9 * 15 * 15) // 9\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate blocks in the 6x15x15 slab.\n    # We treat this as stacking 6 layers, each being a 15x15 square to be tiled.\n    # In each 15x15 layer, we can place blocks in two orientations to maximize space.\n    # First, fill a 9x15 area with 9x1 blocks.\n    tiles_part1 = 15\n    # Then, fill the remaining 6x15 area with 1x9 blocks (rotated).\n    # We can fit floor(6/1) * floor(15/9) = 6 * 1 = 6 blocks.\n    tiles_part2 = 6\n    # Total blocks per layer is the sum.\n    tiles_per_layer = tiles_part1 + tiles_part2\n    # The slab is 6 units high, so we multiply the blocks per layer by 6.\n    blocks_in_slab2 = tiles_per_layer * 6\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum the blocks from both slabs for the final total.\n    total_blocks = blocks_in_slab1 + blocks_in_slab2\n    \n    print(\"To find the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks in a 15x15x15 cube, we can split the cube.\")\n    print(\"1.
