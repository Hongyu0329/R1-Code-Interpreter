    "Of course. Here are the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point, along with a Python script to check these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\nFirst, let's clarify the problem. You have provided three functions, but the last two have some ambiguity. Based on common structures in fixed-point theory, I will assume the system of functions is:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed by an extension of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n\n#### Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness\n\nA unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists if the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **(Complete Metric Spaces):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **(Contraction Mappings):** The functions F, G, and H are Lipschitz continuous with respect to all their variables. This means there exist non-negative constants (Lipschitz constants) such that for any points `(x1, y1, z1)` and `(x2, y2, z2)`:\n\n    *   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ k_f1·d_X(x1, x2) + k_f2·d_Y(y1, y2) + k_f3·d_Z(z1, z2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ k_g1·d_Y(y1, y2) + k_g2·d_X(x1, x2) + k_g3·d_Y(y1, y2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ k_h1·d_Z(z1, z2) + k_h2·d_Y(y1, y2) + k_h3·d_X(x1, x2)`\n\n3.  **(Overall Contraction):** The combined effect of these functions must be a contraction on the product space `W`. By defining a composite operator `T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x))` and using a suitable metric on `W` (like the sum metric), we can derive a single condition on the Lipschitz constants. The condition is that the maximum of the summed coefficients for each space's metric must be less than 1:\n\n    `max( (k_f1 + k_g2 + k_h3), (k_f2 + k_g1 + k_g3 + k_h2), (k_f3 + k_h1) ) < 1`\n\n### Python Code to Verify the Conditions\n\nThe following Python code defines a function that takes the nine Lipschitz constants as input and checks if the main contraction condition is satisfied. It prints the full equation with the substituted values.\n\n```python\ndef check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_condition(k_f1, k_f2, k_f3, k_g1, k_g2, k_g3, k_h1, k_h2, k_h3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n    The fixed point (x, y, z) is defined by the system:\n    F(x, y, z) = x\n    G(y, x, y) = y\n    H(z, y, x) = z\n\n    The condition is based on the Lipschitz constants for F, G, and H.\n\n    Args:\n        k_f1, k_f2, k_f3: Lipschitz constants for F w.r.t. its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd arguments.\n        k_g1, k_g2, k_g3: Lipschitz constants for G w.r.t. its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd arguments.\n        k_h1, k_h2, k_h3: Lipschitz constants for H w.r.t. its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd arguments.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- FGH-Tripled Fixed Point Condition Check ---\")\n    print(\"The condition for a unique fixed point is: max(S_x, S_y, S_z) < 1\")\n    print(\"Where S_x, S_y, S_z are the sums of the Lipschitz constants affecting each space.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Calculate the sums for each component of the product space\n    sum_x = k_f1 + k_g2 + k_h3\n    sum_y = k_f2 + k_g1 + k_g3 + k_h2\n    sum_z = k_f3 + k_h1\n\n    # Print the equation with the numbers substituted in\n    print(f\"S_x = k_f1 + k_g2 + k_h3 = {k_f1} + {k_g2} + {k_h3} = {sum_x:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"S_y = k_f2 + k_g1 + k_g3 + k_h2 = {k_f2} + {k_g1} + {k_g3} + {k_h2} = {sum_y:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"S_z = k_f3 + k_h1 = {k_f3} + {k_h1} = {sum_z:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Final condition check\n    overall_k = max(sum_x, sum_y, sum_z)\n    \n    print(\"Final Equation Check:\")\n    print(f\"max({sum_x:.4f}, {sum_y:.4f}, {sum_z:.4f}) < 1\")\n    \n    is_met = overall_k < 1\n\n    print(f\"Result: {overall_k:.4f} < 1 is {is_met}\")\n\n    if is_met:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: The condition is MET.
