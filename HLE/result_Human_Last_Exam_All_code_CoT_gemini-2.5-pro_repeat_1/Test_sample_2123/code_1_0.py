# 1. The puzzle hinges on a pun in the Russian language.
# The setting is Vienna, famous for its wide boulevards.

# 2. In Russian, a question about the boulevards, "Are they wide?",
# can be phrased as "Широки ли?"
russian_question = "Широки ли?"
pronunciation_russian_question = "Shiroki li?"

# 3. This phrase sounds phonetically similar to the Russian transliteration
# of a famous English poet's surname.
poet_surname_russian = "Шелли"
pronunciation_poet_surname = "Shelli"

# 4. In English, this surname is spelled as follows:
poet_surname_english = "Shelley"

# 5. The "equation" of the pun is the similarity in sound.
# We print the components of this linguistic equation.
