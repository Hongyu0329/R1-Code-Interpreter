    "This is a classic linguistic puzzle that relies on a pun in the Russian language. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the key phrase:** The puzzle mentions \"wide boulevards\" in Vienna. I'll need to consider how this phrase, or a question about it, is expressed in Russian.\n2.  **Find the pun:** The Russian translation is the crucial part. I will look for a Russian phrase related to \"wide boulevards\" that sounds like the surname of a famous English poet.\n3.  **The Russian Phrase:** The question \"Are [the boulevards] wide?\" can be phrased in Russian as \"Широки ли?\" (pronounced \"Shiroki li?\").\n4.  **The Poet's Surname:** This Russian phrase sounds very similar to the way the surname \"Shelley\" is pronounced and written in Russian: \"Шелли\" (pronounced \"Shelli\"). Percy Bysshe Shelley is a major English Romantic poet.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that demonstrates this linguistic connection and prints the final surname in English.\n\n```python\n# 1. The puzzle hinges on a pun in the Russian language.\n# The setting is Vienna, famous for its wide boulevards.\n\n# 2. In Russian, a question about the boulevards, \"Are they wide?\",\n# can be phrased as \"Широки ли?\"\nrussian_question = \"Широки ли?\"\npronunciation_russian_question = \"Shiroki li?\"\n\n# 3. This phrase sounds phonetically similar to the Russian transliteration\n# of a famous English poet's surname.\npoet_surname_russian = \"Шелли\"\npronunciation_poet_surname = \"Shelli\"\n\n# 4. In English, this surname is spelled as follows:\npoet_surname_english = \"Shelley\"\n\n# 5. The \"equation\" of the pun is the similarity in sound.\n# We print the components of this linguistic equation.\nprint(\"The Pun Explained:\")\nprint(f\"The Russian question '{russian_question}' (pronounced '{pronunciation_russian_question}')\")\nprint(\"sounds like\")\nprint(f\"The Russian name '{poet_surname_russian}' (pronounced '{pronunciation_poet_surname}')\")\nprint(\"\\nThis corresponds to the English surname:\")\nprint(poet_surname_english)\n\n```\n<<<Shelley>>>"
