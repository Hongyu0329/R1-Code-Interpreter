    # In this scenario, all 9 individuals guess at the same time.
    # The optimal strategy is based on parity. The group splits into two teams.
    # Team A (4 people) assumes the total count of one hat type is EVEN.
    # Team B (5 people) assumes the total count of that same hat type is ODD.
    # If the actual count is EVEN, Team A (4 people) is correct.
    # If the actual count is ODD, Team B (5 people) is correct.
    # The number of *guaranteed* correct guesses is the minimum of the two outcomes.

    # --- Part 2: Finding M (One Person Guesses First) ---
    # The first person's guess is used to convey information to the other 8.
    # The first person observes the 8 other hats and announces the parity (even/odd)
    # of a specific hat type via their guess.
    # Each of the other 8 individuals hears this information. They can see the other 7
    # hats and, using the announced parity, can deduce their own hat color with certainty.
    # This guarantees that the 8 listeners will be correct. The first person is not guaranteed
    # to be correct.
    M = num_individuals - 1

    # --- Part 3: Calculate the difference ---
