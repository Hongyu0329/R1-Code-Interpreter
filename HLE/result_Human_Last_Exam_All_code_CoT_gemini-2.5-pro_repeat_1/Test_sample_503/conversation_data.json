    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that satisfy a specific universal property. In the context of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category, this property simplifies to the following conditions:\n1.  $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ must be order-preserving maps.\n2.  The maps must satisfy the adjunction inequality: $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis pair of conditions implies that the existence of such an adjunction is determined entirely by properties of either the map $f$ or the map $g$.\nA key result from category theory states that a functor (in this case, an order-preserving map) has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all colimits (suprema). For a map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between posets which are finite total orders, this condition simplifies significantly. The only non-trivial colimit to check is the empty colimit, which corresponds to the least element. Preservation of this colimit means that the map must send the least element of $[m]$ to the least element of $[n]$.\n*   The objects in $\\Delta$ are $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n*   The least element of $[m]$ is $0$.\n*   The least element of $[n]$ is $0$.\nTherefore, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $f(0) = 0$.\nLet $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nAn order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is defined by a sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(m)$ such that $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(m)$, where each $f(i)$ is an element of $[n]=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nWith the additional constraint $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of non-decreasing sequences of the form $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(m) \\le n$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing the $m$ values for $f(1), \\dots, f(m)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ (of size $n+1$) with replacement, where the order of selection doesn't matter as they will be arranged into a unique non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $N$ with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{N \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case, we are choosing $k=m$ values from a set of size $N=n+1$.\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{(n+1)+m-1}{m} = \\binom{n+m}{m}$.\n\nFor this specific problem, $m=23$ and $n=37$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Set the parameters of the problem\nm = 23\nn = 37\n\n# The number of adjunctions from [m] to [n] is given by the binomial\n# coefficient C(n+m, m).\n# For m=23 and n=37, this is C(37+23, 23) = C(60, 23).\nresult = math.comb(n + m, m)\n\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the formula C(n+m, m).\")\nprint(f\"For n={n} and m={m}, this is C({n}+{m}, {m}) = C({n+m}, {m}).\")\nprint(f\"The calculated number of adjunctions is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<55533310238112320>>>"
