    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name, and there are no public records of him ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\". The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that clarifies this misconception by printing an explanatory statement.\n\n```python\n# This script addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan and the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\n# The full name of the former president.\nfull_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n\n# The name in the user's query.\nqueried_name_part = \"Azikiwe\"\n\n# Explanation message\nprint(f\"Based on available records, the full name of the former president is {full_name}.\")\nprint(f\"The name '{queried_name_part}' is not part of his official name.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, there is no record of a year when he publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe'.\")\nprint(\"You might be thinking of Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as it is not part of his name.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
