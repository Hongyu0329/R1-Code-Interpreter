    print("  - Conclusion: This is NOT iambic pentameter (D), which requires 10 syllables per line.\n")

    # Trimeter (E) check
    print("  - A rhythmic scan of the lines reveals about three strong stresses each:")
    print("      - '& all the STARS are PALaces'")
    print("      - 'the WORLD a HOLlow ROAD'")
    print("  - Conclusion: The rhythm can be described as trimeter (E). This is a plausible metrical description, but 'form' is a broader concept.\n")

    print("2. Rhyme Analysis:")
    last_word1 = "palaces"
    last_word2 = "road"
    print(f"  - The last words are '{last_word1}' and '{last_word2}', which do not rhyme.")
    print("  - Conclusion: The lack of rhyme makes a form like a ballad (B) unlikely.\n")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Style (for choices A and C)
    print("3. Stylistic and Form Analysis:")
    print("  - The lines display unconventional stylistic choices:")
    print("    - Use of an ampersand ('&') for 'and'.")
    print("    - Omission of the verb 'is' in the second line ('the world [is] a hollow road'), a device called ellipsis.")
    print("  - These techniques, along with a lack of a strict, sustained meter or rhyme scheme, are characteristic of free verse (A).")
    print("  - 'Modernist free verse' (C) is a specific category of free verse known for exactly these kinds of experimental and fragmented techniques.\n")

    print("--------------------")
    print("Final Verdict:")
    print("--------------------")
    print("While the lines momentarily fall into a trimeter rhythm (E), this isn't the overall form, which also considers style and structure.")
    print("The non-rhyming, rhythmically loose, and stylistically unconventional nature of the lines firmly places them in the category of free verse.")
    print("Because of the specific use of an ampersand and ellipsis, 'modernist free verse' (C) is the most precise and descriptive answer.")
