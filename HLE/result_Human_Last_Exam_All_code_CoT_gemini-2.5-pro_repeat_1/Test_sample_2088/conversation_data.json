    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The expression is a difference of two integrals, $I_1 - I_2$.\n    $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    $I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n2.  I will use the property of definite integrals that $\\int_a^b f(x) dx = \\int_a^b f(a+b-x) dx$. In this case, for the integral $I_1 - I_2$, I'll apply the substitution $u = 1-x$. This will transform the complicated denominators into a common, simpler form, and combine the numerators.\n3.  The combined integral, let's call it $I$, will be $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$. This integral is still not trivial to solve directly.\n4.  The key to solving this integral is to find its antiderivative. By observing the structure of the integrand, I'll deduce that the antiderivative is likely of the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^k \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$ for some constants $C$ and $k$.\n5.  I will determine these constants by differentiating this hypothesised form of the antiderivative and matching it with the integrand. This process will reveal that the antiderivative of the integrand is $\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{1/4}$.\n6.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I$ by computing $F(1) - F(0)$.\n7.  Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final result.\n8.  I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to programmatically perform these steps, including verifying the antiderivative, evaluating the integral, and computing the final expression, printing the full final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the mathematical expression by first simplifying the integral,\n    finding its antiderivative, evaluating the definite integral, and then computing\n    the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the symbol and simplify the integral expression.\n    # The original expression is (12)^4 * (I1 - I2)^4.\n    # Let's first simplify I = I1 - I2.\n    # I1 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n    # I2 = integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n    # Using the substitution u = 1-x, the expression I1 - I2 simplifies to:\n    # I = integral from 0 to 1 of (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n    x = sp.Symbol('x')\n    integrand = (x**9 - x**5 + x) / (3*x**8 - 4*x**4 + 6)**(sp.S(3)/4)\n\n    # Step 3, 4 & 5: Find the antiderivative and verify it.\n    # We hypothesize the antiderivative of the integrand is of the form C * x^k * (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(1/4).\n    # By differentiating this form and matching it with the integrand, we find\n    # the antiderivative of the integrand is F(x) = (1/12) * x^2 * (3*x**8 - 4*x**4 + 6)**(1/4).\n    # Let's define the core part of the antiderivative G(x), where the full antiderivative is G(x)/12.\n    G = x**2 * (3*x**8 - 4*x**4 + 6)**(sp.S(1)/4)\n\n    # Let's verify by differentiating G(x).
