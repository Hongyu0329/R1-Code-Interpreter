    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I'll briefly explain what a cap set is and the notation used, which is $r_3(n)$ for the maximum size of a cap set in the vector space $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$.\n2.  I'll use the \"product construction\" method, which is a straightforward way to find a good lower bound for the size of a cap set. This method states that $r_3(a+b) \\ge r_3(a) \\times r_3(b)$.\n3.  I will write a Python script that uses the known exact sizes of cap sets for dimensions 1 through 6 to calculate the best possible lower bound for dimension 8 using the product construction.\n4.  The script will show the calculations for different ways to split dimension 8 (e.g., $2+6$, $3+5$, $4+4$).\n5.  Finally, after the script demonstrates a calculated bound, I'll provide the best-known lower bound from current mathematical research, which was found using more advanced techniques and is the correct answer to your question. The script will print this final value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates a lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8\n    and then presents the best-known lower bound from mathematical research.\n\n    A cap set is a collection of points in the vector space (Z/3)^n such that no\n    three distinct points are collinear (i.e., for any distinct x, y, z in the set, x + y + z != 0).\n    The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is denoted by r_3(n).\n\n    Lower bounds can be found using the product construction rule:\n    r_3(a + b) >= r_3(a) * r_3(b).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # These are the exact sizes of cap sets for dimensions n=1 to 6.\n    r3_known_values = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112,\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Calculating Lower Bounds for r_3(8) using Product Construction ---\")\n    print(\"The rule is: r_3(a + b) >= r_3(a) * r_3(b)\\n\")\n\n    n = 8\n    best_product_bound = 0\n    best_equation = \"\"\n\n    # We check all partitions of 8 into two numbers 'a' and 'b' for which we know r_3(a) and r_3(b).\n    for a in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n        b = n - a\n        if a in r3_known_values and b in r3_known_values:\n            bound = r3_known_values[a] * r3_known_values[b]\n            \n            # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n            # We will show the equation for each product calculation.\n            equation_str = f\"For n = {a} + {b}: r_3({a}) * r_3({b}) = {r3_known_values[a]} * {r3_known_values[b]} = {bound}\"\n            print(equation_str)\n\n            if bound > best_product_bound:\n                best_product_bound = bound\n                best_equation = equation_str\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe best lower bound found using the simple product construction is {best_product_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"This comes from the calculation: {best_equation.split(': ')[1]}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Best Known Lower Bound ---\")\n    print(\"While the product construction gives a bound of 448, more advanced constructions\")\n    print(\"have established a better lower bound.\")\n    \n    # This is the current record from mathematical literature (Y.
