    # Step 1: Analyze the information for the first frame of reference.
    # The problem states that "the apparent angle between any pair of stars is equal."
    # Let this common angle be alpha.
    # So, theta_ij = alpha for all i != j.

    # Step 2: Identify the specific angles in the expression.
    # The expression is (1 - cos(theta_14)) / (1 - cos(theta_34)).
    # From the condition in Step 1, we have:
    # theta_14 = alpha
    # theta_34 = alpha

    # This means their cosines are also equal.
    # cos(theta_14) = cos(theta_34)

    # Note: For four points to be equidistant on a sphere, they form a regular
    # tetrahedron when viewed from the center. The angle alpha between any two
    # points satisfies cos(alpha) = -1/3. We can use this value to make the
    # calculation concrete, but the result is independent of the actual value,
    # as long as the angles are equal.
    cos_alpha = -1.0 / 3.0

    # Assign the cosine values for the angles in the expression.
    cos_theta_14 = cos_alpha
    cos_theta_34 = cos_alpha

    # Step 3: Calculate the numerator and denominator.
    # The information about the second reference frame is not needed for this calculation,
    # as the expression only contains angles from the first frame.
    numerator = 1 - cos_theta_14
    denominator = 1 - cos_theta_34

    # The denominator is non-zero because the stars are distinct, so alpha is not 0,
    # and cos(alpha) is not 1.

    # Step 4: Calculate the final result.
    result = numerator / denominator

    # Step 5: Print the explanation and the final equation.
