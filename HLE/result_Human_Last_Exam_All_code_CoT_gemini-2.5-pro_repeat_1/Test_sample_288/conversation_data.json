    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will retrieve the complete chemical synapse connectome data for the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite from a reliable online source (WormWiring.org).\n2.  Using Python, I will parse this data to isolate all the outgoing connections (projections) from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  For these connections, I will group them by the target neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  Finally, I will identify the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ pair and display this cell, along with the breakdown of synapses from ASJL and ASJR.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_main_synapse_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the main projection target of a specified neuron class\n    in the C. elegans connectome based on the number of synapses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the N2U adult hermaphrodite chemical synapse data (Cook et al., 2019)\n    url = \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRk_91nJ7_BH_6A2ssI2x5X3_dCslxS25y3SCp7Sy2W1242n7i52Byl2-wH3zLp_VTr2D35l2jV8hX5/pub?gid=2040523384&single=true&output=csv\"\n    \n    source_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n    try:\n        # Fetch the data from the URL\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors\n        \n        # Read the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame\n        connectome_df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text))\n        connectome_df.columns = ['Source', 'Target', 'SynapseCount']\n        \n        # Filter for connections where the source is in our list of source neurons\n        source_outputs = connectome_df[connectome_df['Source'].isin(source_neurons)]\n        \n        if source_outputs.empty:\n            print(f\"No connections found from neurons: {', '.join(source_neurons)}\")\n            return\n            \n        # Group by the target neuron and sum the synapse counts\n        target_synapse_counts = source_outputs.groupby('Target')['SynapseCount'].sum()\n        \n        # Find the target with the maximum number of synapses\n        main_target_cell = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n        total_synapses = target_synapse_counts.max()\n        \n        # Get the individual synapse counts from each source neuron to the main target\n        breakdown = source_outputs[source_outputs['Target'] == main_target_cell]\n        \n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is '{main_target_cell}'.\")\n        print(\"\\nThis is calculated by summing the synapses from ASJL and ASJR to the target cell:\")\n        \n        equation_parts = []\n        for index, row in breakdown.iterrows():\n            print(f\"Synapses from {row['Source']} to {row['Target']}: {row['SynapseCount']}\")\n            equation_parts.append(str(row['SynapseCount']))\n            \n        final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        \n        print(f\"\\nFinal equation: {final_equation} = {total_synapses}\")\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not retrieve data from the network.
