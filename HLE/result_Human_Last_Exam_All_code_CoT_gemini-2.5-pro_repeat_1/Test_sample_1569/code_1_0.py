    # --- Analysis ---
    # The key to this question is the interpretation of the lab result.
    # The lab result is an "Elevated IgM with negative IgG Lyme serology titer".
    # An elevated IgM titer is a positive result indicating an acute infection.
    # Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.
    # Therefore, the titer that is positive is the one for Borrelia burgdorferi.
    # The patient's symptoms (neurologic and cardiac involvement) are also classic
    # for early disseminated Lyme disease.
