# The problem asks for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse
# of a right triangle with area 263, all of whose sides are rational.

# The area is A = 263.
# 263 is a prime number.

# According to the theory of congruent numbers, for a prime number p,
# if p is a congruent number and p is congruent to 5, 6, or 7 modulo 8,
# then the smallest possible common denominator for the sides of the corresponding
# rational right triangle is 2*p.

# First, let's find the remainder of 263 when divided by 8.
p = 263
remainder = p % 8

# The theorem applies if the remainder is 5, 6, or 7.
# For p = 263, the remainder is 7.
# So, the theorem applies.

# The smallest possible denominator is 2*p.
denominator = 2 * p
