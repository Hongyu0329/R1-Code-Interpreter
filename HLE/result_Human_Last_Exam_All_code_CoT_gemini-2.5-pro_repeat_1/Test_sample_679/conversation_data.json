    "Here is a thinking process to determine the structure of the unknown hydrocarbon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is C7H14. For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be CnH2n+2, which is C7H16. The difference in hydrogen atoms is 16 - 14 = 2. The degree of unsaturation is this difference divided by 2, which is 2/2 = 1. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data**:\n    *   There are 7 carbon atoms in the molecule but only 6 signals in the NMR spectrum. This indicates that the molecule has some symmetry, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    *   Let's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift (position) and multiplicity (s, d, t, q, which indicates the number of attached hydrogens: s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H).\n\n3.  **Interpret Individual Signals**:\n    *   **145(s)**: The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means it's a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens. This is a `>C=` carbon in a double bond.\n    *   **112(t)**: The shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) means it's a CH2 group. This must be a terminal alkene, a `=CH2` group.\n    *   Combining these two signals, we can identify a `>C=CH2` fragment. This confirms the presence of a double bond, so there is no ring.\n    *   **48(t)**: This is an aliphatic CH2 group. Its relatively high chemical shift suggests it might be adjacent to the electron-withdrawing double bond.\n    *   **27(d)**: This is an aliphatic CH group.\n    *   **22(q)**: This is an aliphatic CH3 group.\n    *   **21(q)**: This is another, chemically distinct, aliphatic CH3 group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We have identified fragments corresponding to 6 carbon atoms from the 6 signals. Since the molecule has 7 carbons, one signal must represent two equivalent carbons.\n    *   Let's list the expected carbon types from the multiplicities: one C(quat), two CH2, one CH, and two types of CH3.\n    *   The structure that fits all this data is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n    *   Let's verify this structure:\n        *       CH3\n        *      /\n        *   CH - C - CH2 - CH3\n        *  /     ||\n        * CH3    CH2\n    *   **Carbon Count & Formula**: It has 7 carbons. The hydrogens are 3+1+0+2+3+2 = 11. Wait, let's recount based on the structure. Isopropyl methyls (6H) + Isopropyl CH (1H) + Quaternary C (0H) + Ethyl CH2 (2H) + Ethyl CH3 (3H) + Alkene CH2 (2H) = 14H. The formula C7H14 is correct.\n    *   **NMR Signals Verification**:\n        *   **C1 (=CH2)**: A terminal alkene CH2. This matches the **112(t)** signal.\n        *   **C2 (>C=)**: A quaternary alkene carbon, attached to C1, C3, and an ethyl group. This matches the **145(s)** signal.\n        *   **C3 (-CH-)**: An aliphatic CH group. This matches the **27(d)** signal.\n        *   **Ethyl group (-CH2CH3)**:\n            *   The `-CH2-` is adjacent to the double bond. This matches the deshielded **48(t)** signal.\n            *   The `-CH3` is a methyl group. This corresponds to one of the 'q' signals, **22(q)** or **21(q)**.\n        *   **Isopropyl group on C3 (-CH(CH3)2)**:\n            *   The two methyl groups are chemically equivalent due to free rotation around the C2-C3 bond. They will produce a single signal. This signal accounts for two carbons. It corresponds to the other 'q' signal, **22(q)** or **21(q)**.\n    *   The structure perfectly explains the 6 signals for 7 carbons, with the two equivalent methyls of the isopropyl group causing the signal overlap. It also matches all chemical shifts and multiplicities.\n\n5.  **Final IUPAC Name**: The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a butene chain. Numbering starts from the right to give the double bond the lowest position (1). The substituents are an ethyl group on carbon 2 and a methyl group on carbon 3. The name is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided 13C NMR data for a C7H14 hydrocarbon to determine its IUPAC name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Define the given data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    num_carbons_formula = 7\n    num_signals = len(nmr_signals)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Print the analysis ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Spectroscopic Data ---\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n\n    # Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    h_saturated = 2 * num_carbons_formula + 2\n    h_actual = 14\n    dou = (h_saturated - h_actual) // 2\n    print(f\"Degree of Unsaturation: {dou}.
