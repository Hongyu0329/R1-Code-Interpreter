    # The scale is composed of Jins Rast on the root and Jins Nahawand on the 5th.

    # Step 2: Define the 4 descending intervals of the modified scale.

    # with Jins Nahawand on the 4th degree.
    # - Jins Nahawand on the 4th (e.g., F) creates the notes F, G, Ab, Bb.
    # - The path of descent is from the Octave (e.g., C) down to the 4th (e.g., F).
    # - The notes in this path are C -> Bb -> Ab -> G -> F.
    # - The intervals are:
    #   - C to Bb: Whole Tone (1.0)
    #   - Bb to Ab: Whole Tone (1.0)
