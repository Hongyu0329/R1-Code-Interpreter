    "This is a complex endgame position. I need to find the best move for White by carefully analyzing the threats and opportunities for both sides.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:**\n    *   White has a queen on f2, a king on g1, and a very dangerous passed pawn on d6. This pawn is the key to White's winning chances.\n    *   Black has a queen on c5, a king on b6, and pawns that are less threatening. Black's queen is very active, controlling important squares and putting pressure on White's position.\n    *   The main conflict revolves around White's d6 pawn. It is blocked by Black's d7 pawn, and the promotion square d8 is controlled by the black queen.\n\n2.  **Evaluate White's candidate moves:**\n    *   White's only mobile piece is the queen. The goal is to find a queen move that either checkmates the black king or facilitates the promotion of the d-pawn.\n    *   Simple checks like `Qf7+` are not decisive. After `Qf7+ Kb7`, if White plays `Qe7` to attack the d7 pawn, Black can respond with `Qd5`. This leads to a queen trade (`Qxd7+ Qxd7`) and a drawn pawn endgame after `d7+ Kxd7`.\n    *   The most effective strategy is to target the relationship between the black king and queen.\n\n3.  **Identify the winning move:**\n    *   The move `Qe5` is the strongest. It places the white queen on a square where it pins the black queen on c5 against the black king on b6.\n    *   With its queen pinned, Black cannot move it. Black's only legal moves are with the king (or irrelevant pawn moves).\n    *   Let's see what happens if Black moves the king, for example, to `Kb7`.\n    *   White can then play `Qxc5`. Black is forced to recapture with `Kxc5`.\n    *   After the queens are exchanged, White's d-pawn is no longer hindered. White simply plays `d7`.\n    *   The black king on c5 is too far away to stop the pawn from reaching d8 and promoting to a new queen. This leads to a winning position for White.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move `Qe5` forces a winning sequence for White.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the best move for White in the given chess position.\n# The FEN for the position is: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\n#\n# Analysis Summary:\n# 1. White's main advantage is the passed pawn on d6.\n# 2. Black's queen on c5 is active and prevents the pawn from promoting.\n# 3. The winning move for White is Qe5.\n# 4. Qe5 pins the black queen to the black king, forcing a king move.\n# 5. After the king moves (e.g., to b7), White plays Qxc5.\n# 6. After the forced recapture Kxc5, White plays d7, and the pawn will promote to a new queen, leading to a win.\n\nbest_move = \"Qe5\"\nprint(f\"The best move for White is {best_move}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Qe5>>>"
