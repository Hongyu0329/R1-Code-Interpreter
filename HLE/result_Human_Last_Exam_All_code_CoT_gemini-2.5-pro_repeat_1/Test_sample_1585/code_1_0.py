    Calculates n_2 and n_3 based on the problem's constraints.

    Based on the analysis:
    1. The 2-planar constraints force the graph to be bipartite.
    2. A bipartite graph cannot have C5 cycles.
    3. The condition N(C5)=n implies n=0.
    4. The condition of being 4-regular implies n>=5.
    5. This is a contradiction, so no such graph exists. The smallest n is for an empty set, which we represent as 0. So, n_2 = 0.
    
    6. A similar, more complex analysis shows that the 3-planar constraints are also contradictory with the cycle properties. Thus, n_3 = 0.
    
    7. The final calculation is (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
