# Step-by-step Derivation

The problem is solved by analyzing the direct consequences of the given conditions within the standard framework of module actions.

1.  **Module Axioms:** We are given an action of a Hopf algebra A on a ring R. For this to be a left module action, it must satisfy:
    (i) `(uv) . r = u . (v . r)` for all u, v in A and r in R.
    (ii) `1_A . r = r` for all r in R, where `1_A` is the multiplicative identity in A.
    We also assume the action is linear, meaning `u . 0 = 0`.

2.  **Given Conditions:**
    *   `g` is a group-like element in A (`g in G(A)`).
    *   `g` has a finite order `d`, such that `g^d = 1_A`.
    *   The action of `g` on the identity element of R is `g . 1_R = 0`.

3.  **Logical Deduction:** Let's compute the action of powers of `g` on `1_R`.
    *   For `k=1`: `g^1 . 1_R = g . 1_R = 0` (this is given).
    *   For `k=2`: `g^2 . 1_R = (g * g) . 1_R`. Using axiom (i), this is `g . (g . 1_R)`. Since `g . 1_R = 0`, this becomes `g . 0`, which is `0` by linearity.
    *   By induction, `g^k . 1_R = 0` for all integers `k >= 1`.

4.  **The Contradiction:** Now consider `k=d`.
    *   From our deduction, `g^d . 1_R = 0`.
    *   From the given condition `g^d = 1_A`, we can substitute `1_A` for `g^d`, so `1_A . 1_R = 0`.
    *   However, module axiom (ii) states that `1_A . 1_R = 1_R`.
    *   Comparing these two results, we get `1_R = 0`.

5.  **Conclusion:** If the identity element `1_R` of a ring `R` is `0`, the ring `R` must be the trivial or zero ring, `R = {0}`. This means that any element `r` from `R` must be `0`.

# Answering the Questions

With the conclusion that `r = 0`, we can now address the specific questions.

(a) Under what condition does `x^d a . r = 0`?
    Since `r = 0`, the expression is `x^d a . 0`. For any linear action, this is `0`. Thus, the equation `x^d a . r = 0` is always true, regardless of any other conditions. A condition that is always true in this context is `w = 0`, since `w = x . 1_R = x . 0 = 0`.

(b) Derive the expression for `x^d . r`.
    Since `r = 0`, the expression is `x^d . 0`, which evaluates to `0`.

(c) State whether `xja . r` for `j >= M` can be zero under these conditions.
    Since `r = 0`, the expression `xja . r` is `xja . 0`, which is always `0`. Therefore, it can be zero.
