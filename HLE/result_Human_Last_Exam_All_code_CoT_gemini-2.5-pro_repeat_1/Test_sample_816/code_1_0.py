    print("The problem states that in a GTAW weld pool of 304 stainless steel, the outer portions flow inwards.")
    print("Let's evaluate the forces listed:\n")

    print("1. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Gradient):")
    print("   - This force is caused by variations in surface tension across the liquid metal surface, primarily due to temperature gradients.")
    print("   - For most pure metals, surface tension decreases as temperature increases. This would cause an outward flow from the hot center to the cooler edge.")
    print("   - However, 304 stainless steel contains surface-active elements like sulfur and oxygen. These elements can cause the surface tension to INCREASE with temperature.")
    print("   - When surface tension is highest at the hot center, it pulls the surrounding liquid from the cooler outer edges INWARDS. This perfectly matches the observation.\n")

    print("2. Arc Drag Force and Arc Pressure Force:")
    print("   - The high-velocity plasma jet from the arc pushes down and drags the surface of the molten pool. Both of these effects cause a flow that is radially OUTWARD from the center, which is the opposite of the observed flow.\n")

    print("3. Lorentz (Electromagnetic) Force:")
    print("   - The welding current diverging into the workpiece interacts with its own magnetic field, creating an inward and downward 'pinch' force. While this force does contribute to an inward flow, the Marangoni force is the primary driver for the specific phenomenon of INWARD SURFACE FLOW, especially in stainless steels.\n")

    print("4. Buoyancy Force:")
    print("   - This force is due to density differences from temperature gradients. While present, it is generally considered much weaker than the Marangoni and Lorentz forces in driving the primary circulation in a GTAW weld pool.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The inward flow from the outer portions of the weld pool is the classic signature of the Marangoni effect in steels containing surface-active elements. This makes the Marangoni Force the dominant mechanism for the described flow pattern.")
