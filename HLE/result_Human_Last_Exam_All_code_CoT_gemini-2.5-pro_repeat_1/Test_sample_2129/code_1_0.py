# Step 1: Define the parameters based on the problem's logic.
# Based on the hypothesis that the problem is designed for a major simplification,
# we assume a = lambda. This is the key insight.
a_equals_lambda = True

# We don't need the specific values of N, a, or lambda, but we can represent them.
# Let's use placeholder strings for the variables that cancel out.
N = "N" 
# Let's represent lambda and a as a single variable 'k' since they are equal.
k = "k" 

# Step 2: Calculate the coefficient in the diffusion equation under the assumption a = lambda.
# The coefficient is (a - lambda) / lambda**a.
# Since a = lambda, the numerator a - lambda is 0.
coefficient_val = 0

# Step 3: Solve for y3(x).
# The diffusion equation becomes d^(1/2)y3/dx^(1/2) = 0.
# With the initial condition y3(0) = 0, the solution is y3(x) = 0 for all x.
y3_x0_val = 0

# Step 4: Calculate the exponent in the final expression.
# The exponent is lambda / a. Since a = lambda, the exponent is 1.
exponent_val = 1

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
# The expression is (N + lambda) * (y3(x0))**(lambda/a)
final_result = 0 # Since y3(x0) is 0 and the exponent is positive.

# Step 6: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.
