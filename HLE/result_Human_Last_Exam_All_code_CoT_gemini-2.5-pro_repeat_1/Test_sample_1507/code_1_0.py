# The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate the
# outer-hull of the great icosahedron.
# The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.

# A regular icosahedron's surface is already made of triangles. So, the minimal
# number of triangles for triangulation is simply its number of faces.

# We can find the number of faces (F) using Euler's formula for polyhedra:
# V - E + F = 2
# where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

# For a regular icosahedron:
# Number of vertices (V)
V = 12
# Number of edges (E)
E = 30

# We can rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:
# F = 2 - V + E
F = 2 - V + E
