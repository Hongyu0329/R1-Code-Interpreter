    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triangular faces on the convex hull of the great icosahedron.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, identify the geometric shape of the \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\". The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron whose vertices are the same as those of a regular icosahedron. Its convex hull (the smallest convex shape containing it) is therefore a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Second, understand what \"triangulating the outer-hull\" means. The surface of a regular icosahedron is already composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles. Thus, the surface is already triangulated in the most minimal way possible. The number of triangles required is simply the number of faces of the icosahedron.\n3.  Third, I will write a Python script to calculate the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron using Euler's famous formula for polyhedra: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. For a regular icosahedron, V=12 and E=30. The script will show the calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate the\n# outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n# The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n# A regular icosahedron's surface is already made of triangles.
