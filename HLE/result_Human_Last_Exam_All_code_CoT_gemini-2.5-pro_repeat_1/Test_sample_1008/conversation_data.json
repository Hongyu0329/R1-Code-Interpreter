    "In a dance scene, the primary driver is the music, which dictates the rhythm, mood, and choreography. Sound effects, such as footsteps or the rustle of clothing, add a layer of realism and texture, making them secondary but still important. Speech or dialogue is typically minimized or absent during the dance itself to avoid distracting from the musical and visual storytelling. Therefore, the hierarchy of importance is Music, followed by Sound Effects, and finally Speech.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n  \"\"\"\n  Determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in film dance scenes.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The hierarchy is based on the role each sound element plays in a typical dance scene.\n  # Music is the foundation for the choreography and mood.\n  # Sound effects add realism and texture.\n  # Speech is usually minimal or absent to not distract from the dance.\n  hierarchy = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n  \n  # The problem asks to output the final equation, which I interpret as the final ranked list.\n  # \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n  # I will print the elements of the hierarchy.\n  print(\"The hierarchy of sound importance in dance scenes is:\")\n  print(\", \".join(hierarchy))\n\nget_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
