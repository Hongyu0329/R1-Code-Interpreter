    "The user wants to find the Hopf charge of a given 3D vector field.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The Hopf charge is a topological invariant, which means it's an integer that characterizes the \"knottedness\" of the vector field. Instead of calculating it with the complicated Whitehead integral formula directly, I will analyze the topological structure of the field.\n2.  The vector field `(nx, ny, nz)` is defined using two angles, `G` and `f`, which correspond to the polar and azimuthal angles on a sphere.\n    *   `f = atan2(y, x)` is the standard cylindrical angle `phi`. It winds once (`k=1`) as we go around the z-axis.\n    *   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)` depends on the distance `r2` from a circle `x*x+y*y=0.5, z=0`.\n3.  This structure, where the field twists azimuthally (`f=phi`) and has a non-trivial profile in the poloidal plane (`rho-z` plane), is known as an axially symmetric hopfion or a \"toron\".\n4.  The Hopf charge `Q` for such a configuration can be calculated as `Q = -k * N`, where `k` is the azimuthal winding number and `N` is the degree (a 2D winding number) of the profile map.\n5.  I will calculate the degree `N` of the profile map. This map can be viewed as a 2D skyrmion in a plane defined by coordinates `u = x*x+y*y-0.5` and `v=z`. The degree `N` can be calculated with a 2D integral, which simplifies to a 1D integral over the radial coordinate `R = sqrt(u*u+v*v) = r2`.\n6.  I will use Python's symbolic mathematics library `sympy` to perform this integral and find the integer value of `N`.\n7.  Finally, I will combine `k` and `N` to find the Hopf charge `Q`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define symbols\nR = sympy.Symbol('R', real=True, positive=True)\npi = sympy.pi\n\n# The Hopf charge for this axially symmetric field configuration is given by\n# the formula Q = -k * N.\n# k is the winding number of the azimuthal angle 'f'.\n# N is the degree (topological charge) of the profile map in the poloidal plane.\n\n# 1. Determine the azimuthal winding number, k.\n# The field's azimuthal angle is f = atan2(y, x). This is the standard\n# cylindrical angle phi. As one circles the z-axis, f sweeps from 0 to 2*pi.\n# Therefore, the winding number k is 1.\nk = 1\n\n# 2. Determine the degree of the profile map, N.\n# The profile is determined by the polar angle G, which depends on\n# r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z).\n# This structure corresponds to a 2D skyrmion in a plane defined by coordinates\n# u = x*x+y*y-0.5 and v=z.\n# The radial coordinate in this plane is R = sqrt(u^2+v^2), which is exactly r2.\n# The degree N is calculated by the integral:\n# N = (1 / (4*pi)) * integral( sin(G) dG wedge dTheta ) over the (u,v) plane.\n# This simplifies to N = (1/2) * integral_from_0_to_inf( sin(G(R)) * dG/dR ) dR.\n\n# Define G as a function of R\nG_of_R = pi * sympy.exp(-10 * R)\n\n# Calculate the derivative dG/dR\ndG_dR = sympy.diff(G_of_R, R)\n\n# The integrand is sin(G(R)) * dG/dR\nintegrand = sympy.sin(G_of_R) * dG_dR\n\n# Perform the symbolic integration from R=0 to R=infinity\n# This corresponds to integrating over the entire (u,v) plane.\n# The limits for G are: R=0 -> G=pi; R=inf -> G=0.\nintegral_val = sympy.integrate(integrand, (R, 0, sympy.oo))\n\n# The degree N is half of the integral value.\nN = integral_val / 2\n\n# 3. Calculate the Hopf charge Q.\nQ = -k * N\n\n# Print the results of each step and the final equation.\nprint(f\"The azimuthal winding number is k = {k}\")\nprint(f\"The degree of the profile map is N = {N}\")\nprint(f\"The Hopf charge is given by the equation Q = -k * N\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values, we get:\")\nprint(f\"Q = -({k}) * ({N})\")\nfinal_Q = -k * N\nprint(f\"Q = {final_Q}\")\n\n<<<1>>>\n```"
