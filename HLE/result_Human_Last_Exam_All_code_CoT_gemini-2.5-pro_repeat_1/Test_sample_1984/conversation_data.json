    "To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, denoted by $m$.\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. We set the given differential equation to zero:\n$$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$$\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can factor the expression:\n$$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$$\nThis gives us two equilibrium points: $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**2. Determining Stability**\n\nTo determine the stability of these equilibrium points, we analyze the sign of the derivative of the function $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. An equilibrium point $x_{eq}$ is stable if trajectories starting near $x_{eq}$ move towards it. This can often be checked with the sign of the first derivative of $f(x)$ at the equilibrium point.\n\nLet's find the derivative, $f'(x)$:\n$$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n*   **For x = 0:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at **x = 0 is stable**.\n\n*   **For x = 1:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    The first derivative test is inconclusive. We must examine the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ around $x=1$.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease towards 1.\n    *   If $x$ is slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) < 0$. This means $x(t)$ will decrease, moving away from 1.\n    Since trajectories from one side ($x<1$) move away from the point, **x = 1 is not a stable equilibrium** (it is semi-stable).\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, $x=0$. This means $m=1$.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nWe need to calculate $m - 2^{4048}$. With $m=1$, the expression is:\n$$1 - 2^{4048}$$\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# The number of stable equilibrium points.\nm = 1\n\n# The exponent in the expression.\nn = 4048\n\n# Calculate 2^4048. Python handles large integers automatically.\npower_of_two = 2**n\n\n# Calculate the final result.\nresult = m - power_of_two\n\n# The final result will be a very large negative number.\n# We print the equation as requested.\nprint(f\"{m} - 2**{n} = {result}\")\n\n# The final answer is the numerical result of the calculation.\nprint(f\"\\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>\")\n```"
