# The number of stable equilibrium points.
m = 1

# The exponent in the expression.
n = 4048

# Calculate 2^4048. Python handles large integers automatically.
power_of_two = 2**n

# Calculate the final result.
result = m - power_of_two

# The final result will be a very large negative number.
# We print the equation as requested.
