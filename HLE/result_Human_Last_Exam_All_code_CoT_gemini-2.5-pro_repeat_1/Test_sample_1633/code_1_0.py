    This function provides a reasoned solution to the network transformation problem.

    The problem requires identifying a correct statement about the transformation of a 
    Watts-Strogatz network into an ultra-small-world network under specific constraints.

    The key insight lies in understanding the structural requirements for a network to have an
    average path length of L ~ log(log(n)) while respecting a maximum degree constraint of ⌈log(n)⌉.

    1.  Ultra-Small World Property (L ~ log(log(n))): This is characteristic of networks with a
        deep hierarchical structure. Paths are short because information can be routed up and down
        the levels of the hierarchy.

    2.  Max Degree Constraint (<= ⌈log(n)⌉): This prevents the formation of a single, dominant central
        hub. Instead, the hierarchy must be built from many "smaller" hubs, each respecting the
        degree limit.

    3.  Necessary Structure: To build an efficient hierarchy under these degree constraints, the
        high-degree vertices (hubs) must be connected to form a backbone. The most efficient
        way to connect these hubs to guarantee network-wide routing while minimizing the
        number of connections on each hub is a sparse, acyclic structure. A tree is the
        archetype of such a structure.

    4.  Conclusion: Therefore, any successful transformation must result in a graph where the
        high-degree vertices are connected in a tree-like fashion. This describes the
        fundamental nature of the solution. Option C captures this insight directly.
