    "My plan is to analyze Geoffrey Chaucer's poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" to determine which of the provided words does not have a rhyme within the text.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Fetch the Poem**: I will first retrieve the complete text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg public repository.\n2.  **Process the Text**: I'll clean up the text by splitting it into individual lines and preparing it for analysis.\n3.  **Analyze Each Word**: For each word in the answer choices (Wente, Here, Fool, Hool, Countour), I will perform the following checks:\n    a.  **Presence Check**: First, I'll verify if the word even exists within the poem's text. A word cannot be rhymed if it's not present.\n    b.  **Rhyme Check**: If the word is present, I will locate it at the end of a line and examine the adjacent lines to find its rhyming partner. The poem is primarily written in rhyming couplets, which makes this straightforward.\n4.  **Report Findings**: I will print the results of my analysis for each word, showing the rhyming couplet if one is found.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, I will identify the word that does not have a rhyme in the poem.\n\nThis process will definitively determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport requests\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes \"The Book of the Duchess\" to find which word from a list is not rhymed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
