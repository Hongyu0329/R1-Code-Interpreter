    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, we first need to identify all the noble gases and then find their abundance in terrestrial matter. The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a data structure containing the estimated mass fraction of each noble gas in the Earth's crust. Abundance in the crust is a good proxy for \"all terrestrial matter\" when comparing the rarity of these specific elements. The specified year, 2002, doesn't change these fundamental geological values.\n2.  Programmatically iterate through this data to find the element with the lowest abundance.\n3.  Convert this minimum abundance (which is a mass fraction) into a percentage.\n4.  Print the name of the rarest gas and its calculated percentage in a clear, formatted output. Radon is radioactive with a very short half-life, making its steady-state concentration extremely low, and thus it is expected to be the rarest.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    abundance in terrestrial matter and calculates its percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on the abundance of noble gases in the Earth's crust by mass fraction.\n    # Crustal abundance is a good proxy for comparing the rarity of these elements\n    # in \"all terrestrial matter\". The values for stable elements do not change\n    # significantly over decades, so 2002 data is effectively the same as current data.\n    # Source: CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, and other geological sources.\n    noble_gas_abundances = {\n        'Helium': 8e-9,      # 8 parts per billion\n        'Neon': 7e-11,       # 70 parts per trillion\n        'Argon': 3.5e-6,     # 3.5 parts per million\n        'Krypton': 1e-10,    # 100 parts per trillion\n        'Xenon': 3e-11,      # 30 parts per trillion\n        'Radon': 4e-19       # 0.4 parts per quintillion (from radioactive decay)\n    }\n\n    # Find the rarest gas by identifying the minimum abundance value.\n    # The 'min' function with a 'key' argument finds the dictionary key\n    # associated with the minimum value.\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances, key=noble_gas_abundances.get)\n    min_abundance_fraction = noble_gas_abundances[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert the mass fraction to a percentage by multiplying by 100.\n    abundance_percentage = min_abundance_fraction * 100\n\n    # Print the final result in a clear format.\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth as of 2002 (and today) is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is calculated as follows:\")\n\n    # Print the calculation as requested, showing the numbers involved.\n    # Using scientific notation for clarity due to the extremely small value.\n    print(f\"Mass Fraction: {min_abundance_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"Percentage = {min_abundance_fraction} * 100\")\n    print(f\"Result: {abundance_percentage:.1e} %\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
