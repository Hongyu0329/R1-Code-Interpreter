The laboratory's mistake was trusting a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. The evidence (no bacterial growth in the QC) was misleading because the test was not sensitive enough to detect that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by adding it before autoclaving, which is the incorrect procedure for a heat-sensitive antibiotic.
