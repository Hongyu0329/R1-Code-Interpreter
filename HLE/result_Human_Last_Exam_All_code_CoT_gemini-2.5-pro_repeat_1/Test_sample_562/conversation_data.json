    "To identify the radical (bushu) for the Japanese character 謄, we first need to analyze its structure. The character can be deconstructed into its components to find the primary classifier.\n\n1.  **Character Deconstruction**: The character 謄 is composed of two main parts: 月 on the left and 朕 on the right.\n2.  **Radical Identification**: In the standard classification of Kanji, the part on the left, 月, serves as the radical for this character.\n3.  **Radical Name**: The radical 月 has two identities. When it means \"moon\", it's called 'tsuki' (つき). However, when it's a variant form of the radical 肉 (meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\"), it's called 'nikuzuki' (にくづき). In the character 謄, as in many other characters where 月 appears on the left (e.g.,  Bauch (腹), Gehirn (脳)), it is the \"flesh\" variant.\n4.  **Hepburn Transcription**: The name にくづき is transcribed into Hepburn romanization as \"Nikuzuki\".\n\nTo fulfill the request for a coded solution, I will provide a Python script that stores this information in a dictionary and prints the name of the radical for the character '謄'.\n\n```python\ndef find_kanji_radical(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Hepburn transcription of the radical name for a given Kanji character.\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary for lookup.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping Kanji characters to their radical's Hepburn name.\n    # The name \"Nikuzuki\" is used for the '月' radical when it represents 'flesh' (肉).\n    radical_database = {\n        '謄': 'Nikuzuki',\n        '媛': 'Onnahen', # Example from the prompt\n        '海': 'Sanzui',\n        '森': 'Ki'\n    }\n\n    if character in radical_database:\n        radical_name = radical_database[character]\n        print(f\"The bushu/radical for the character '{character}' is '{radical_name}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the radical for '{character}' is not in our database.\")\n\n# The specific character requested by the user.\ntarget_character = '謄'\nfind_kanji_radical(target_character)\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
