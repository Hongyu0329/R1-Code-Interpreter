    This function provides the solution to the stated problem concerning the

    # The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of
    # nonprincipal ultrafilters on N, all of which are below a fixed
    # ultrafilter V in a specific partial order.

    # As explained in the thinking steps, this is a non-computational problem
    # from set theory. The solution relies on mathematical theorems regarding
    # the structure of the Rudin-Keisler order and the combinatorics of
    # P(N)/I, where I is a non-principal ideal.

    # The largest possible cardinality of such an antichain is 2^{\aleph_0},
    # the cardinality of the continuum.

    # We format the answer as requested.
    # The final equation for the cardinality (C) is C = 2^{\aleph_0}.
