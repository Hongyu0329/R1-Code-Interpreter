    # A. Skin biopsy: More invasive, used when the diagnosis is unclear.
    # B. KOH preparation: Tests for fungus, which is less likely given the rash distribution.
    # C. Topical steroid: This is a treatment, not a diagnostic test.
    # D. Patch test: This is the gold standard for identifying the specific cause of allergic contact dermatitis.
