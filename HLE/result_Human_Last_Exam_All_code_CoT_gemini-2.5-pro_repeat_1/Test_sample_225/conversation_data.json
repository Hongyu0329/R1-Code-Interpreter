    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve Type**: The given parametric equations `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)` describe a shape known as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  **Recall the Formula**: There is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve of the form `x = A*cos(at)` and `y = B*sin(bt)`. The formula is `N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`.\n3.  **Check Conditions**: This formula is applicable when `a` and `b` are coprime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1) and both are odd. For our curve, `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   `GCD(9, 5) = 1`, so they are coprime.\n    *   Both 9 and 5 are odd numbers.\n    *   Since the conditions are met, the formula can be applied directly.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script that defines `a` and `b`, verifies the conditions, and then uses the formula to compute the number of self-intersections, printing out each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_self_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    defined by x = cos(at) and y = sin(bt).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parameters from the curve equations x = cos(9t), y = sin(5t)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(f\"The curve is a Lissajous curve with parameters a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    \n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections is (a-1)(b-1)/2,\n    # given that a and b are odd and coprime.\n    \n    # Verify conditions\n    is_coprime = math.gcd(a, b) == 1\n    a_is_odd = a % 2 != 0\n    b_is_odd = b % 2 != 0\n\n    if is_coprime and a_is_odd and b_is_odd:\n        print(\"Conditions met: 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime.\")\n        \n        # Calculate the number of self-intersections\n        numerator = (a - 1) * (b - 1)\n        num_intersections = numerator // 2\n        \n        print(\"\\nCalculating the number of self-intersections using the formula N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2:\")\n        print(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {a - 1} * {b - 1} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {num_intersections}\")\n        \n        print(f\"\\nThe total number of self-intersection points is {num_intersections}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The conditions for the simple formula are not met.\")\n\nfind_self_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
