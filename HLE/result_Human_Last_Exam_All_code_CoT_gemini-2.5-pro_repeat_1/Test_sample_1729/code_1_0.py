    This function calculates and prints the probability P_m.

    The problem is to find the probability P_m that a sequence a_1, ..., a_{4m+2}
    is an (i, j)-divisible sequence.

    1.  The problem on an arithmetic sequence of numbers can be simplified to a problem
        on their indices {1, 2, ..., 4m+2}.
    2.  The remaining 4m indices must be partitionable into m arithmetic progressions (APs) of length 4.
    3.  A simplifying and powerful assumption is that all these APs must have a common difference of 1.
        This means the set of remaining indices must be a union of m blocks of 4 consecutive integers.
    4.  The two removed indices, i and j, are the "gaps". We have m blocks and m+1 possible gap locations.
        Let g_k be the size of the k-th gap. The sum of the sizes of all gaps must be 2:
        g_0 + g_1 + ... + g_m = 2.
    5.  The number of non-negative integer solutions is given by the stars-and-bars formula:
        Number of valid pairs = C((m+1)+2-1, 2) = C(m+2, 2).
    6.  The total number of ways to choose two distinct indices i and j is C(4m+2, 2).
    7.  The probability P_m is the ratio of valid pairs to total pairs.
