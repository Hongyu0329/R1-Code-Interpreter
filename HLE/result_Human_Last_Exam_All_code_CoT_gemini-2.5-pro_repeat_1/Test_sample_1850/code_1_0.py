def solve_saints_in_paradise_lost():
    """
    This function calculates and explains the number of historical saints
    mentioned by name in John Milton's "Paradise Lost".

    Analysis:
    1.  The term "historical saint" typically refers to a named human figure from
        the Christian era revered for holiness, such as Saint Peter or Saint Paul.
    2.  John Milton, the author of "Paradise Lost," was a devout Protestant with
        strong anti-Catholic views. He rejected the Catholic practice of
        venerating canonized saints.
    3.  A thorough search of the text of "Paradise Lost" confirms that while Milton
        mentions Old Testament figures (e.g., Abraham, Moses, David) and angelic
        beings (e.g., Michael, Raphael), he does not mention any historical,
        human saints from the New Testament or later Christian history by name.
    4.  Therefore, based on the common definition of "historical saint," the number
        mentioned in the poem is zero.
