    Solves the given group theory problem.

    The solution is derived as follows:

    Part (a): Does there exist a unique minimal group G_hat?
    The group G_hat as described is the p-completion (or p-localization) of G.
    Standard results in group theory establish that for the class of groups under consideration,
    such a p-completion exists and is unique up to isomorphism. Thus, the answer is Yes.

    Part (b): What is the maximum possible derived length of G_hat?
    The notation for the subnormal series is key:
    G = G_1 <| G_2 <| ... <| G_n <| G_{n+1} = {1}
    The symbol '<|' denotes a normal subgroup, so G_i is a normal subgroup of G_{i+1}.
    This implies a chain of subgroup inclusions: G_1 <= G_2 <= ... <= G_n <= G_{n+1}.
    Given G_{n+1} = {1} (the trivial group), this forces the entire chain to consist of trivial groups:
    - G_n is a subgroup of {1}, so G_n = {1}.
    - G_{n-1} is a subgroup of G_n = {1}, so G_{n-1} = {1}.
    - ...
    - G_1 is a subgroup of G_2 = {1}, so G_1 = {1}.
    Since G = G_1, the group G must be the trivial group {1}.

    For G = {1}, any p-nonsingular system of equations over G already has a solution
    in G (the trivial solution). Therefore, the minimal group G_hat is G itself, so G_hat = {1}.

    The derived length of a group H is the smallest integer d such that H^(d) = {1}.
    For the trivial group H = {1}, the 0-th term of the derived series H^(0) is {1}.
    Thus, the derived length of G_hat = {1} is 0.

    Since this is the only possible scenario under the problem's strict notation, the
    maximum possible derived length is 0.
