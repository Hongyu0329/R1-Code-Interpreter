# Plan:
# 1. Define a variable for the number of pirouettes from fifth in the Act I variation.
# 2. Based on the choreography, this number is 0.
# 3. Define a variable for the number of sequences of these turns.
# 4. Create an equation to calculate the total.
# 5. Print the equation and the final result.

# Number of sequences of "pirouettes from fifth" in the Act I variation choreography.
number_of_sequences = 1

# Number of pirouettes from fifth performed in that sequence.
turns_in_sequence = 0

# Calculate the total.
total_turns = number_of_sequences * turns_in_sequence

# Print the final equation, showing each number.
