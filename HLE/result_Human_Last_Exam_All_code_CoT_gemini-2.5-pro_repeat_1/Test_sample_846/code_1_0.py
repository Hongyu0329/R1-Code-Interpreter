    Explains the functional behavior of a hypothetical azobenzene-shaped picnic table.
    """
    explanation = """To be functionally accurate, the azobenzene-shaped picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight, mimicking the molecule's photoisomerization.

Azobenzene exists in two forms (isomers):
1.  **trans-azobenzene:** This is the more stable, lower-energy form. It is relatively flat.
2.  **cis-azobenzene:** This is the less stable, higher-energy form. It has a distinct bent or V-shape.

The table's functionally accurate actions should be as follows:

*   **At Sunrise:** When the sun rises, it emits ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This light provides the energy to switch the molecule from its stable, flat **trans** form to the less stable, bent **cis** form. Therefore, the picnic table should physically change its configuration from flat to bent.

*   **At Sunset:** When the sun sets, the UV light source is removed. In the dark, the molecule will naturally relax back to its more stable state. This process, called thermal relaxation, returns the bent **cis** form to the flat **trans** form. Therefore, the picnic table should straighten out, returning from its bent shape to its original flat shape as night falls.
