    print(f"C. {options['C']}: These 'jumping genes' are a source of mutation, not a structured defense against it.")
    print(f"E. {options['E']}: This provides massive redundancy by duplicating the entire genome, which is a valid but very large-scale mechanism.")
    print(f"D. {options['D']}: These are groups of similar genes created by gene duplication. This directly provides functional redundancy. If one gene copy is inactivated by a mutation, other copies in the family can perform its function. This is a key hypothesized mechanism allowing ancient asexual lineages to avoid extinction.")
