The core of the question is to identify the evolutionary force that stabilizes the genomic mutation rate around a constant value. The mutation rate is a fundamental biological trait, and its evolution is governed by the fitness consequences it has on the organism.

Let's evaluate the choices:

A. Natural selection for fitness optimality:
   - A mutation rate that is too high increases the 'mutational load'—the accumulation of harmful mutations—which reduces the average fitness of a population.
   - A mutation rate that is too low is metabolically costly to maintain (e.g., proofreading and repair mechanisms require energy and may slow down replication) and can limit a population's capacity to adapt to changing environments.
   - Therefore, there is a trade-off. Natural selection will act to favor a mutation rate that represents an optimal balance between these opposing pressures. This provides a powerful mechanism for maintaining the rate at an approximately constant, optimal level. This is a very strong candidate.

B. Genetic drift in small populations:
   - Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies. It is a destabilizing force, causing traits to 'drift' or wander randomly over time. It does not act to maintain a constant rate.

C. Equilibrium between beneficial and deleterious mutations:
   - This describes the mutation-selection balance, which is the result of a given mutation rate acting on genes. It does not explain what evolutionary force sets the value of the mutation rate itself.

D. Homogeneous mutation distribution across genomic sites:
   - This describes the spatial pattern of mutations (i.e., where they occur in the genome), not the overall temporal rate at which they occur. It is not relevant to the stability of the rate itself.

E. The stochastic nature of mutational events:
   - The fact that mutations are random events is a fundamental property, but it is not an evolutionary force that regulates or maintains their average rate.

Conclusion:
Natural selection for an optimal trade-off between the costs of deleterious mutations and the costs of high-fidelity DNA maintenance is the dominant factor that maintains an approximately constant genomic mutation rate.
