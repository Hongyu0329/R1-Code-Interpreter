    "To phonetically transcribe how the English phrase \"shock absorber\" would be adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish, we need to apply the specific phonological rules of that dialect to the original English pronunciation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Original English Pronunciation**: First, we start with the standard American English pronunciation of the phrase, which in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is: `/ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/`.\n\n2.  **Key Puerto Rican Spanish (PRS) Phonological Rules**: We must consider several key features of PRS that affect borrowings:\n    *   **Substitution of /ʃ/**: Spanish lacks the \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/). The most common substitution is the \"ch\" sound, or /t͡ʃ/.\n    *   **Lateralization of /r/**: In syllable-final position (e.g., at the end of a word or before another consonant), the /r/ sound is frequently pronounced as an /l/. This is one of the most prominent features of PRS.\n    *   **Vowel Adaptation**: English has more vowel sounds than Spanish. Unstressed English vowels like the schwa (/ə/) are typically replaced with one of the five full Spanish vowels (/a, e, i, o, u/), usually /a/ or /e/. The English /ɑ/ (as in \"shock\") is often perceived as a Spanish /o/.\n    *   **Adaptation of /b/**: Between vowels, the /b/ sound is softened to a fricative, [β].\n\n3.  **Applying the Rules to \"shock\"**:\n    *   The initial /ʃ/ becomes /t͡ʃ/.\n    *   The vowel /ɑ/ is adapted to /o/.\n    *   The final /k/ is retained.\n    *   This results in: `/ʃɑk/` → `[t͡ʃok]`\n\n4.  **Applying the Rules to \"absorber\"**: This word is more complex. The English pronunciation is /əbˈsɔrbər/.\n    *   **Vowels**: The initial /ə/ becomes /a/. The stressed /ɔ/ becomes /o/. The final /ər/ becomes /el/ (the schwa /ə/ becomes /e/, and the syllable-final /r/ becomes /l/ due to lateralization).\n    *   **Consonants**: The first /b/ is between the new /a/ and /o/ sounds, so it becomes the soft fricative [β]. The /r/ in the stressed syllable /ˈsɔr/ is syllable-final, so it undergoes lateralization to /l/. The second /b/ is also between vowels, becoming [β].\n    *   **Stress**: The English stress on the \"sor\" syllable is typically maintained in the borrowing.\n    *   Putting it together: /əbˈsɔrbər/ → `[aβˈsolβel]`\n\n5.  **Final Combined Transcription**: Combining the two adapted parts gives us the full phonetic transcription for the borrowed phrase.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_shock_absorber():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the phonetic transcription of \"shock absorber\"\n    as it would be pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish, explaining each part.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the phonetic components\n    word1 = \"shock\"\n    transcription1 = \"[t͡ʃok]\"\n    \n    word2 = \"absorber\"\n    transcription2 = \"[aβˈsolβel]\"\n    \n    # The final combined transcription\n    full_transcription = f\"{transcription1} {transcription2}\"\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the transcription process\n    print(f\"The phonetic transcription of the first word, '{word1}', is:\")\n    print(transcription1)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe phonetic transcription of the second word, '{word2}', is:\")\n    print(transcription2)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the complete phonetic transcription for 'shock absorber' in Puerto Rican Spanish is:\")\n    print(full_transcription)\n\ntranscribe_shock_absorber()\n```\n<<<[t͡ʃok aβˈsolβel]>>>"
