    "The story described in the question is a well-known anecdote in the history of physics and microscopy. The physicist is Paul Kirkpatrick, a pioneer in the field of X-ray microscopy. The accidental observation was made by a janitor, Oscar Lundquist, who noticed the strange line-like images formed by large concave searchlight mirrors he was cleaning. This observation of astigmatism helped Kirkpatrick and his student Albert Baez develop the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system, which uses two cylindrical mirrors to focus X-rays, a fundamental technique still used today.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on several key facts:\n    1. Worked in the microscopy field.\n    2. Discovered an optical effect.\n    3. The discovery was prompted by an observation from a custodial worker.\n    4. The context involved concave mirrors.\n    These clues point to one specific individual in the history of physics.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"
