# This question is about the theoretical relationship between two concepts in genetics.
# SNP Heritability (hÂ²_SNP) is the total proportion of phenotypic variance
# that can be explained by all common SNPs in aggregate. It represents the
# theoretical maximum predictive power achievable with these SNPs.
#
# A Polygenic Score (PGS) uses effect sizes estimated from a GWAS to try
# to predict the phenotype. Because these effect sizes are estimated from a
# finite sample, they are not perfect and contain statistical error.
#
# Therefore, the predictive power of a PGS (measured as R-squared in a
# new sample) will be lower than the theoretical maximum potential, which is
# the SNP heritability.

# The statement is True.
