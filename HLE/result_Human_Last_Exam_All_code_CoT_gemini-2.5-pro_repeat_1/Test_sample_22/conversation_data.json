    "This is a knowledge-based question regarding statistical genetics. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the additive effects of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a study (typically common SNPs on a genotyping array). It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling of how much variance can be predicted using only these SNPs. It's a property of the population and the set of SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:** A polygenic score is a tool built to predict a phenotype. It is constructed using effect size estimates for individual SNPs, which are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The predictive ability of this score is then tested in a *separate, independent* sample and is typically measured by R², the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain in that new sample.\n\n3.  **Compare the Two:**\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the theoretical maximum. It assumes you know the true, underlying effects of all SNPs.\n    *   A PGS is a practical implementation. It uses *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS of a *finite* sample size. These estimates contain statistical noise and are not perfect.\n    *   Because the effect sizes used to build the PGS are imperfect estimates, not the true values, the predictive ability (R²) of the PGS will inevitably be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP). The gap between R² and h²_SNP is influenced by factors like the size of the GWAS used to train the score (larger GWAS leads to better estimates and higher R²) and the genetic architecture of the trait.\n\nTherefore, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n```python\n# This question is about the theoretical relationship between two concepts in genetics.\n# SNP Heritability (h²_SNP) is the total proportion of phenotypic variance\n# that can be explained by all common SNPs in aggregate. It represents the\n# theoretical maximum predictive power achievable with these SNPs.\n#\n# A Polygenic Score (PGS) uses effect sizes estimated from a GWAS to try\n# to predict the phenotype. Because these effect sizes are estimated from a\n# finite sample, they are not perfect and contain statistical error.\n#\n# Therefore, the predictive power of a PGS (measured as R-squared in a\n# new sample) will be lower than the theoretical maximum potential, which is\n# the SNP heritability.\n\n# The statement is True.\nprint(\"True\")\n```\n<<<True>>>"
