    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the representation theory of algebras, specifically for path algebras of type $A_n$. We are looking for a special module in the category of modules over the path algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Algebra and its Indecomposable Modules:** The algebra is the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. Its indecomposable modules are well-known and can be represented by their dimension vectors. There are 6 such modules.\n2.  **Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules:**\n    *   A **$\\tau$-tilting module** is a generalization of a classical tilting module. For a hereditary algebra like this one, a module is a (classical) **tilting module** if it is sincere (its support is all simple modules), has no self-extensions ($\\text{Ext}^1(T,T)=0$), and consists of $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. All tilting modules are $\\tau$-tilting modules. Non-sincere $\\tau$-tilting modules also exist, but the uniqueness in the question suggests we should focus on the sincere ones (the tilting modules).\n    *   A **slice module** is a special type of tilting module. Its indecomposable summands form a \"slice\" (or \"section\") in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. A key property of a slice/section is that the subquiver of the AR quiver induced by the summands is connected.\n3.  **List all Tilting Modules:** We will list all the tilting modules for the $A_3$ path algebra. There are 4 such modules.\n4.  **Check for the Slice Property:** For each tilting module, we will check if its summands form a connected set in the AR quiver. The one whose summands do not form a connected set is not a slice module.\n5.  **Identify the Unique Module:** By checking all tilting modules, we will find the unique one that does not satisfy the connectivity property of a slice module.\n6.  **Format the Output:** The final answer will be presented as a Python script that prints the constituent indecomposable modules of the resulting non-slice module, represented by their dimension vectors.\n\n### Execution\n\n1.  **Indecomposable Modules and the AR Quiver:**\n    The path algebra of $Q: 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ has 6 indecomposable modules. We can denote them by their dimension vectors over the vertices $(1, 2, 3)$:\n    *   $P_1 = S_1 = (1,0,0)$ (Projective/Simple at 1)\n    *   $P_2 = (1,1,0)$ (Projective at 2)\n    *   $P_3 = I_1 = (1,1,1)$ (Projective at 3 / Injective at 1)\n    *   $S_2 = (0,1,0)$ (Simple at 2)\n    *   $I_2 = (0,1,1)$ (Injective at 2)\n    *   $S_3 = I_3 = (0,0,1)$ (Simple/Injective at 3)\n\n    The Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver for this algebra is:\n    ```\n        P_3\n       / \\\n      P_2 I_2\n     / \\ / \\\n    P_1 S_2 S_3\n    ```\n    The arrows represent irreducible maps (e.g., $P_1 \\to P_2$, $S_2 \\to P_2$, $P_2 \\to P_3$).\n\n2.  **Tilting Modules:**\n    The literature confirms there are 4 tilting modules for this algebra. Let's list their summands:\n    *   $T_A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$\n    *   $T_B = S_2 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$\n    *   $T_C = S_3 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_3$\n    *   $T_D = P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_3$\n\n3.  **Check for Slice Property (Connectivity):**\n    *   **$T_A = \\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$:** This set is connected in the AR quiver via the path of irreducible maps $P_1 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. It is a **slice module**.\n    *   **$T_B = \\{S_2, P_2, P_3\\}$:** This set is connected via the path $S_2 \\to P_2 \\to P_3$. It is a **slice module**.\n    *   **$T_C = \\{S_3, I_2, P_3\\}$:** This set is connected via the path $S_3 \\to I_2 \\to P_3$. It is a **slice module**.\n    *   **$T_D = \\{P_1, I_2, P_3\\}$:** Let's check for paths between these vertices in the AR quiver. There is a path $I_2 \\to P_3$. However, there are no irreducible maps connecting $P_1$ to either $I_2$ or $P_3$. Therefore, this set is **not connected**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The tilting module $P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_3$ is the unique tilting module whose summands do not form a connected component in the AR quiver. Therefore, it is the unique tilting module that is not a slice module.\n\nThe code below will print the dimension vectors of the indecomposable summands of this module.\n\n```python\n# In the category of modules over A = C(1->2->3), the path algebra of type A_3,\n# we identify the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice module.\n#\n# A tau-tilting module is a tilting module if and only if it is sincere.\n# A slice module is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a\n# connected section in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.\n#\n# By analyzing the four tilting modules of this algebra, we find that\n# three of them are slice modules, and one is not.\n# The unique non-slice tilting module is T = P_1 + I_2 + P_3.\n#\n# We represent the indecomposable modules by their dimension vectors.\nP1 = (1, 0, 0)\nI2 = (0, 1, 1)\nP3 = (1, 1, 1)\n\n# The module is the direct sum of these three indecomposable modules.\n# We print the dimension vectors of the summands.\nprint(f\"The unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice is the direct sum of the following indecomposable modules, represented by their dimension vectors:\")\nprint(f\"P_1 = {P1}\")\nprint(f\"I_2 = {I2}\")\nprint(f\"P_3 = {P3}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe module is T = P_1 + I_2 + P_3, which corresponds to the sum of dimension vectors:\")\nprint(f\"{P1} + {I2} + {P3}\")\n```\n<<<The unique non-slice $\\tau$-tilting module is $P_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus P_3$, where the modules are represented by dimension vectors $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,1)$, and $(1,1,1)$ respectively.>>>"
