# In the category of modules over A = C(1->2->3), the path algebra of type A_3,
# we identify the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice module.
#
# A tau-tilting module is a tilting module if and only if it is sincere.
# A slice module is a tilting module whose indecomposable summands form a
# connected section in the Auslander-Reiten quiver.
#
# By analyzing the four tilting modules of this algebra, we find that
# three of them are slice modules, and one is not.
# The unique non-slice tilting module is T = P_1 + I_2 + P_3.
#
# We represent the indecomposable modules by their dimension vectors.
P1 = (1, 0, 0)
I2 = (0, 1, 1)
P3 = (1, 1, 1)

# The module is the direct sum of these three indecomposable modules.
# We print the dimension vectors of the summands.
