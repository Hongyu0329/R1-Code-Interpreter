The patient's presentation strongly suggests a diagnosis of {diagnosis}.
The optimal treatment plan should address the multiple facets of this condition.

The best choice is Duloxetine + Gabapentin for the following reasons:

1.  **Duloxetine**:
    - It is an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) and is FDA-approved for Fibromyalgia.
    - It effectively treats the core symptoms of widespread pain, anxiety, and depression.

2.  **Gabapentin**:
    - It is an anticonvulsant effective for neuropathic (nerve) pain.
    - It directly targets the patient's specific complaints of restless leg syndrome and paraesthesia.
    - It also helps to improve sleep quality, which is crucial in managing Fibromyalgia.

3.  **Combination Synergy**:
    - This combination provides a comprehensive approach, targeting the central pain and mood with Duloxetine,
      while simultaneously managing the neuropathic symptoms and sleep disturbances with Gabapentin.
    - This is more effective than either drug alone or other proposed combinations for this specific patient's symptoms.
