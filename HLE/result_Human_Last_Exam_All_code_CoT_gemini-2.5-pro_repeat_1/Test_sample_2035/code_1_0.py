    # Step 1: State the solvability condition.
    # From perturbation analysis, the condition for the existence of a solution to the
    # nonlinear problem is a system of equations for the initial values x_i^0.
    # Let X_i = x_i^0. The system is:
    # (sum_{j!=i} X_j^2) * (1 - e^(-T)) = alpha_i^2
    #
    # Let K = 1 / (1 - e^(-T)). The system becomes: sum_{j!=i} X_j^2 = K * alpha_i^2

    # Step 2: Solve the system for X_i^2.
    # Solving this system yields the following expression for each X_i^2:
    # X_i^2 = K * [ (1/(n-1)) * (sum_{j=1 to n} alpha_j^2) - alpha_i^2 ]
    
    # Step 3: Check the condition X_i^2 >= 0.
    # For a real solution X_i to exist, X_i^2 must be non-negative. Since K > 0 (as T>0),
    # the term in the brackets must be non-negative for all i from 1 to n.
