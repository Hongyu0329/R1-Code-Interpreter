# This script determines the coefficients c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 for the number
# of closed tree-like walks of length 6 in a simple graph X.
# The analysis is based on a combinatorial enumeration of possible walk structures.

# A "tree-like walk" is interpreted as a walk where the set of distinct edges
# it traverses forms a tree. A closed walk of length 6 built on a tree T with m edges
# corresponds to a set of integers k_1, ..., k_m >= 1 such that 2 * sum(k_i) = 6.
# This implies sum(k_i) = 3.

# Case 1: m=1 edge (P_2). k_1=3.
# A single edge is traversed back and forth 3 times.
# For each edge {u,v}, there are 2 walks: u->v->u... and v->u->v...
# Contribution: 2 * e.
c_1 = 2

# Case 2: The underlying structure is a cycle, e.g., a triangle (K_3).
# A triangle is not a tree, so by our definition, no walk is fundamentally
# based on a triangle structure.
# Contribution: 0 * k.
c_2 = 0

# Case 3: m=3 edges. k_1=k_2=k_3=1. The tree is a P_4 (path of length 3).
# Each of the 3 edges is traversed back and forth once.
# A detailed enumeration shows there are 6 such walks for each P_4 subgraph.
# Contribution: 6 * p.
c_3 = 6

# Case 4: m=2 edges (P_3). {k_1, k_2} = {1, 2}.
# One edge is traversed once, the other twice.
# A detailed enumeration shows there are 12 such walks for each P_3 subgraph.
# Contribution: 12 * sum(deg(v) choose 2).
c_4 = 12

# Case 5: m=3 edges. k_1=k_2=k_3=1. The tree is a K_{1,3} (star graph).
# Each of the 3 edges is traversed back and forth once.
# A detailed enumeration shows there are 12 such walks for each K_{1,3} subgraph.
# Contribution: 12 * sum(deg(v) choose 3).
c_5 = 12

# The full expression is:
# c_1*e + c_2*k + c_3*p + c_4*sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c_5*sum(deg(v) choose 3)
# The calculated coefficients are:
