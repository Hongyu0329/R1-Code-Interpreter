    "The user wants to identify the final product of a two-step organic synthesis reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The reagents are sec-BuLi/TMEDA, a strong base combination used for deprotonation, followed by methyl iodide, an electrophile. This setup is characteristic of a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction followed by an electrophilic quench.\n2.  **Determine the Site of Reaction**: The starting material has two directing groups for lithiation: a tertiary amide (`-CONEt2`) and a tertiary amine (`-NMe2`). The tertiary amide is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine. Furthermore, the two groups are in a 1,3-relationship, allowing them to act cooperatively. The lithium ion (from sec-BuLi) will be chelated by both the amide's oxygen and the amine's nitrogen. This geometry directs the deprotonation to the C2 position, the carbon atom located between the two directing groups.\n3.  **Identify the Intermediate**: Deprotonation at C2 creates a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n4.  **Determine the Final Product**: This nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (`CH3I`). The carbanion at C2 attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This results in the addition of a methyl group at the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script using the RDKit library to programmatically represent the molecules and formalize the answer. The script will:\n    *   Define the reactant and product using their SMILES strings.\n    *   Calculate their molecular formulas.\n    *   Print a summary of the reaction mechanism.\n    *   Print the final product's name and the overall reaction equation with molecular formulas, fulfilling the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\n# To run this code, you need to install the RDKit library:\n# pip install rdkit\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of the reaction between N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide,\n    sec-BuLi/TMEDA, and methyl iodide.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # SMILES strings for the reactant and product\n    # Reactant: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    smiles_reactant = \"CCN(CC)C(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(C)C\"\n    # Product: N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide\n    smiles_product = \"CCN(CC)C(=O)c1c(C)c(N(C)C)ccc1\"\n\n    # Create RDKit molecule objects\n    mol_reactant = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_reactant)\n    mol_product = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_product)\n\n    # Add hydrogens to get correct molecular formulas\n    mol_reactant_h = Chem.AddHs(mol_reactant)\n    mol_product_h = Chem.AddHs(mol_product)\n\n    # Calculate molecular formulas\n    formula_reactant = CalcMolFormula(mol_reactant_h)\n    formula_product = CalcMolFormula(mol_product_h)\n\n    product_name = \"N,N-diethyl-3-(dimethylamino)-2-methylbenzamide\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and results\n    print(\"Reaction Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
