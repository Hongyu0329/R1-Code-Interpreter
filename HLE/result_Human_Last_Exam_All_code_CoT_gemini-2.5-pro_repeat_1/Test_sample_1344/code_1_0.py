    This task requires a bifunctional catalyst. Olefin polymerization is well-established with Group IV metallocenes. Polyolefin hydrogenolysis (hydrocracking) is more challenging, requiring C-C bond activation. A single-site catalyst must be robust enough for depolymerization conditions while being active for polymerization. The optimal system is likely a supported post-metallocene complex where the support plays a crucial role.

    Group IV metals (Ti, Zr, Hf) are all candidates. Zirconium (Zr) and Hafnium (Hf) are generally preferred over Titanium (Ti) for their higher thermal stability and activity in tandem catalysis. Zirconium offers a good balance of reactivity and cost. We will select Zirconium (Zr) for its proven performance in both polymerization and C-C cleavage reactions.

    The ligand is critical for tuning stability and reactivity. Traditional cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands are excellent for polymerization but may lack the robustness for high-temperature hydrogenolysis. A 'pincer' ligand, such as a PNP (Phosphine-Amine-Phosphine) ligand, is an excellent choice. This tridentate ligand offers:
    - High thermal stability due to strong chelation.
    - An 'open' coordination site for reactant binding (H2, olefin).
    - Tunability of electronic properties by modifying the phosphine groups.

    For breaking down a solid polymer, a supported catalyst is essential. The support prevents catalyst aggregation and provides high surface area. A bifunctional approach is optimal, where the support actively participates in the reaction. Sulfated Zirconia (SO4^2-/ZrO2) is a solid superacid support that can:
    - Stabilize the single-site Zr complex.
    - Provide Br√∏nsted acid sites that work with the metal center to heterolytically cleave C-C and C-H bonds in the polymer backbone.
