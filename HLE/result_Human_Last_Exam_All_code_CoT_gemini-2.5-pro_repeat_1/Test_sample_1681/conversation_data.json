    "To solve for the equilibrium point in a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we'll use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard framework for quantizing 2x2 games.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Classical Setup**: We start with the given payoff matrix.\n    *   (Cooperate, Cooperate): (5, 5)\n    *   (Cooperate, Defect): (0, 7)\n    *   (Defect, Cooperate): (7, 0)\n    *   (Defect, Defect): (1, 1)\n    In the classical version, the only Nash Equilibrium is (Defect, Defect), leading to a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1).\n\n2.  **Quantum Setup (EWL Protocol)**:\n    *   **Initial State**: The game begins with the two players' choices (qubits) in a maximally entangled state. This state is created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|Cooperate, Cooperate>` (`|CC>`).\n    *   **Strategies**: Players choose a strategy, which is a unitary operator (a quantum gate) applied to their own qubit. The set of available strategies includes the classical ones (Cooperate and Defect) but also a continuous range of \"quantum\" strategies.\n    *   **Measurement**: After the players apply their strategies, the final state of the system is measured. The expected payoff for each player is calculated based on the probabilities of the four classical outcomes.\n\n3.  **Finding the Equilibrium**:\n    *   In the quantum version of the game, the classical (Defect, Defect) strategy is no longer a Nash Equilibrium. If one player chooses to Defect, the other player's best response is a quantum strategy that yields a better payoff.\n    *   A new, unique Nash Equilibrium emerges, often denoted as `(Q, Q)`, where `Q` is a specific quantum strategy. For this equilibrium, if one player chooses `Q`, the other player's payoff becomes independent of their own choice, removing any incentive to deviate.\n    *   This new equilibrium strategy `Q` results in all four classical outcomes—(C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D)—becoming equally probable. Each outcome has a probability of 0.25.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Equilibrium Payoff**:\n    We can now calculate the expected payoff for each player at this quantum equilibrium point by averaging the payoffs of the four possible outcomes.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n    In the EWL quantum game framework with maximal entanglement, a new Nash\n    Equilibrium emerges where all four classical outcomes become equally likely.\n    The equilibrium payoff is the average of all possible payoffs for a player.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Payoff matrix:\n    # rows are Alice's choices (C, D), columns are Bob's choices (C, D)\n    # payoffs are (Alice's payoff, Bob's payoff)\n    payoffs = {\n        'CC': (5, 5),\n        'CD': (0, 7),\n        'DC': (7, 0),\n        'DD': (1, 1)\n    }\n\n    # At the quantum Nash Equilibrium, the probability of each outcome is 0.25\n    prob_CC = 0.25\n    prob_CD = 0.25\n    prob_DC = 0.25\n    prob_DD = 0.25\n\n    # Alice's payoffs for each outcome\n    alice_payoff_CC = payoffs['CC'][0]\n    alice_payoff_CD = payoffs['CD'][0]\n    alice_payoff_DC = payoffs['DC'][0]\n    alice_payoff_DD = payoffs['DD'][0]\n\n    # Calculate Alice's expected payoff at the equilibrium\n    alice_expected_payoff = (\n        alice_payoff_CC * prob_CC +\n        alice_payoff_CD * prob_CD +\n        alice_payoff_DC * prob_DC +\n        alice_payoff_DD * prob_DD\n    )\n\n    # Since the game is symmetric, Bob's expected payoff is the same.\n    # We can calculate it for confirmation.\n    bob_payoff_CC = payoffs['CC'][1]\n    bob_payoff_CD = payoffs['CD'][1]\n    bob_payoff_DC = payoffs['DC'][1]\n    bob_payoff_DD = payoffs['DD'][1]\n\n    bob_expected_payoff = (\n        bob_payoff_CC * prob_CC +\n        bob_payoff_CD * prob_CD +\n        bob_payoff_DC * prob_DC +\n        bob_payoff_DD * prob_DD\n    )\n    \n    # The equilibrium point is the payoff pair (Alice's payoff, Bob's payoff)\n    # The question asks for \"the\" equilibrium point, which is the value of the symmetric payoff.\n    equilibrium_point = alice_expected_payoff\n\n    print(\"Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma Equilibrium Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The payoff matrix provides the following values for Alice:\")\n    print(f\"  (Cooperate, Cooperate): {alice_payoff_CC}\")\n    print(f\"  (Cooperate, Defect):   {alice_payoff_CD}\")\n    print(f\"  (Defect,   Cooperate): {alice_payoff_DC}\")\n    print(f\"  (Defect,   Defect):   {alice_payoff_DD}\")\n    print(\"\\nAt the quantum equilibrium, each outcome has a probability of 0.25.\")\n    print(\"The expected payoff is the sum of (payoff * probability) for all outcomes.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Payoff Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff = ({alice_payoff_CC} * {prob_CC}) + ({alice_payoff_CD} * {prob_CD}) + ({alice_payoff_DC} * {prob_DC}) + ({alice_payoff_DD} * {prob_DD})\")\n    print(f\"Payoff = {alice_payoff_CC * prob_CC} + {alice_payoff_CD * prob_CD} + {alice_payoff_DC * prob_DC} + {alice_payoff_DD * prob_DD}\")\n    print(f\"Equilibrium Payoff = {equilibrium_point}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe equilibrium point is a symmetric payoff of ({alice_expected_payoff}, {bob_expected_payoff}).\")\n\nsolve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma()\n<<<3.25>>>\n```"
