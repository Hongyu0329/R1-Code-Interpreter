    "A category with one object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a monoid. The single object's set of morphisms (including the identity morphism) forms the set of elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism acts as the identity element of the monoid.\n\nThe problem is therefore to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script to solve this problem by following these steps:\n1.  Represent the three morphisms as a set of numbers, `{0, 1, 2}`, where `0` is the identity morphism.\n2.  Systematically generate all possible composition tables. A composition `A o B` must also be one of the three morphisms. The identity law (`0 o X = X` and `X o 0 = X`) is fixed. This leaves 4 compositions to define: `1o1`, `1o2`, `2o1`, `2o2`. Since each can be one of 3 values, there are `3^4 = 81` possible tables.\n3.  For each of the 81 generated tables, check if the composition is associative (i.e., `(A o B) o C = A o (B o C)` for all A, B, C). A table that satisfies this is a valid monoid.\n4.  Group the valid monoids by isomorphism. Two monoids are isomorphic if one's table can be transformed into the other's by relabeling the non-identity morphisms (i.e., swapping `1` and `2`). I will do this by defining a \"canonical form\" for each isomorphism class (specifically, the lexicographically smallest table representation).\n5.  Count the number of unique canonical forms. This number is the final answer.\n6.  The script will print the total count and the defining compositions for each unique category found.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = (0, 1, 2)  # 0 is the identity element\n    \n    # Store canonical representations of found monoids.\n    # A monoid is represented by the 4-tuple of products (1*1, 1*2, 2*1, 2*2).\n    # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of a monoid and its\n    # isomorphic counterpart (obtained by swapping 1 and 2).\n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # 1.
