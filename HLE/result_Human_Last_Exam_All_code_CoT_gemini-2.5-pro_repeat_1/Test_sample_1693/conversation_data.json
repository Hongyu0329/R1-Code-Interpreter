    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\nFirst, I will research a list of French vessels, both naval and merchant, that were sunk by German U-boats between September 1939 and the French armistice on June 22, 1940.\n\nSecond, for each of these ships, I will find their size. For warships, this is typically measured in tons of displacement. For merchant ships, the standard measure is Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of volume but serves as an effective proxy for size when comparing ships.\n\nThird, I will create a Python script to represent this data. The script will define a list of these ships and their sizes.\n\nFinally, the script will iterate through the list, printing out each candidate ship and its size (as the \"equation\") to find the one with the maximum value, and then print the name of that ship as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat\n    before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n\n    The data represents notable French vessels sunk by U-boats in the specified period.\n    For merchant ships, size is given in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a standard\n    measure of a ship's internal volume and a reliable proxy for its overall size.\n    For warships, the standard displacement in tons is used.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data: List of French ships sunk by U-boats before the June 1940 armistice.\n    # Each dictionary contains the ship's name and its size.\n    ships_data = [\n        {\"name\": \"Doris (Q135)\", \"size\": 630, \"unit\": \"Tons Displacement\"},\n        {\"name\": \"SS Bretagne\", \"size\": 10108, \"unit\": \"GRT\"},\n        {\"name\": \"SS Champollion\", \"size\": 12546, \"unit\": \"GRT\"},\n        {\"name\": \"SS Sheherazade\", \"size\": 13467, \"unit\": \"GRT\"},\n    ]\n\n    largest_ship = {\"name\": \"N/A\", \"size\": 0}\n\n    print(\"Comparing the size of French ships sunk by U-boats before the 1940 armistice:\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # This loop constitutes the \"equation\" by showing all the numbers being compared.\n    for ship in ships_data:\n        print(f\"Candidate: {ship['name']}, Size: {ship['size']} {ship['unit']}\")\n        if ship[\"size\"] > largest_ship[\"size\"]:\n            largest_ship = ship\n            \n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest ship by displacement/tonnage sunk in this period was the {largest_ship['name']}.\")\n    \nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<SS Sheherazade>>>"
