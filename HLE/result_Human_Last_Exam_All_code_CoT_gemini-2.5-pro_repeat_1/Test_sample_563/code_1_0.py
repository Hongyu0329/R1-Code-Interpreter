# This script provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
# for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g = 2, 3, and 4.
# These values are based on established mathematical classifications.

# Number of automorphism group isomorphism classes for a genus 2 Riemann surface.
num_groups_g2 = 6

# Number of automorphism group isomorphism classes for a genus 3 Riemann surface.
num_groups_g3 = 16

# Number of automorphism group isomorphism classes for a genus 4 Riemann surface.
num_groups_g4 = 21

# The final result is a list containing these numbers.
# The format is [num_g2, num_g3, num_g4].
