# Step 1: Identify the Roman numerals for the translation practices capable of overcoming the challenge.
# Based on the analysis, these are Transcreation (I), Embedded audio links (II),
# introducing a foreigner with an accent (IV), and adding footnotes (VI).
option_1 = "I"
option_2 = "II"
option_4 = "IV"
option_6 = "VI"

# Step 2: Combine the identified numerals into a single string, separated by hyphens, in ascending order.
# The problem asks for the output to be a series of Roman numerals. The "equation" is the final formatted string.
# The code explicitly shows each number being part of the final output string.
final_answer_string = f"{option_1}-{option_2}-{option_4}-{option_6}"

# Step 3: Print the final result.
print(final_answer_string)
