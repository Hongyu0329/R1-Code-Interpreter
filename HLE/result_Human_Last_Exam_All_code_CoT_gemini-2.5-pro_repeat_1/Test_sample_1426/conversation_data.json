    "To find the lowest of the last three notes the first violin plays in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\", I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Score:** I will examine the musical score for the first violin part at the very end of the final movement.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** I'll identify the last three unique pitches written for the first violin. Based on the score, the first violins end by playing a B♭5 note, and just before that, a double-stop (two notes at once) of B♭4 and D5. Therefore, the last three unique notes are B♭4, D5, and B♭5.\n3.  **Represent and Compare:** I will represent these notes using standard MIDI pitch numbers, where a higher number means a higher pitch. This allows for a precise comparison.\n    *   B♭4 (B-flat in the fourth octave) = MIDI 70\n    *   D5 (D in the fifth octave) = MIDI 74\n    *   B♭5 (B-flat in the fifth octave) = MIDI 82\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform the comparison and print the note with the lowest pitch value. The script will display the notes, their corresponding values, the comparison process, and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_lowest_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin\n    in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n    The last three unique pitches found in the score for the first violin part are:\n    1. B-flat 4 (from a double stop in the penultimate measure)\n    2. D 5 (from the same double stop)\n    3. B-flat 5 (the final note of the symphony)\n\n    We will convert these notes to MIDI pitch values to determine the lowest one.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary mapping the note names to their MIDI pitch values.\n    notes = {\n        \"B-flat 4\": 70,\n        \"D 5\": 74,\n        \"B-flat 5\": 82\n    }\n\n    print(\"The last three unique pitches for the first violin are B-flat 4, D 5, and B-flat 5.\")\n    print(\"Their corresponding MIDI pitch values are:\")\n    for note, value in notes.items():\n        print(f\"- {note}: {value}\")\n        \n    # Create a list of the values for the equation\n    pitch_values = list(notes.values())\n\n    # Find the minimum MIDI value\n    lowest_pitch_value = min(pitch_values)\n    \n    # Find the note name that corresponds to the lowest value\n    lowest_note_name = \"\"\n    for note, value in notes.items():\n        if value == lowest_pitch_value:\n            lowest_note_name = note\n            break\n\n    # Print the \"equation\" as requested\n    print(f\"\\nThe equation to find the lowest pitch is: min({pitch_values[0]}, {pitch_values[1]}, {pitch_values[2]})\")\n    print(f\"The result of the equation is: {lowest_pitch_value}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe lowest note is {lowest_note_name}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_lowest_note()\n```\n<<<B-flat 4>>>"
