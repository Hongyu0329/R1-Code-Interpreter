    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: First, I will clarify what `a(n)` represents. `a(n)` is the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function that has `n` input variables.\n2.  **Find the Formula**: I will reference the known result from switching and logic theory for the value of `a(n)`. The formula for `a(n)` differs based on whether `n` is even or odd.\n    *   For even `n` (where `n >= 2`), the maximum number of prime implicants is achieved by the symmetric Boolean function consisting of all minterms of weight `n/2`. The number of prime implicants is therefore the central binomial coefficient, `a(n) = C(n, n/2)`.\n    *   For odd `n` (where `n >= 3`), the formula is `a(n) = 2 * C(n-1, (n-1)/2)`.\n3.  **Apply the Formula for n=4**: Since the question asks for `a(4)`, and 4 is an even number, I will apply the formula for even `n`. This gives `a(4) = C(4, 4/2) = C(4, 2)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: I will write a Python script to calculate `C(4, 2)` using the `math.comb` function.\n5.  **Present the Output**: The script will print the explanation, the formula used, the specific numbers in the calculation, and the final equation with the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of variables for the Boolean function\nn = 4\n\n# Explain the problem and the formula being used.\nprint(f\"To find a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.\")\nprint(f\"The value depends on whether n is even or odd.\")\nprint(f\"For an even n (like n=4), the formula is a(n) = C(n, n/2), where C is the binomial coefficient (the 'choose' function).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Apply the formula for n=4\nk = n // 2\nresult = math.comb(n, k)\n\n# Show the specific calculation for a(4)\nprint(f\"For n = {n}:\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is a({n}) = C({n}, {n}/{2}) = C({n}, {k})\")\nprint(f\"Using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!):\")\nprint(f\"C({n}, {k}) = {math.factorial(n)} / ({math.factorial(k)}! * ({n}-{k})!) = {math.factorial(n)} / ({math.factorial(k)} * {math.factorial(n-k)}) = {result}\")\n\n# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"
