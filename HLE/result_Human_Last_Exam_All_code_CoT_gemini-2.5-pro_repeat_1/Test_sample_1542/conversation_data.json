    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables, $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. Two forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear transformation of the variables.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this using a Python script:\n\n1.  **Represent the Quadratic Forms**: A quadratic form $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ can be uniquely identified by its coefficients $(a, b, c)$, where $a, b, c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. We can generate all possible $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ forms.\n\n2.  **Represent the Linear Transformations**: An invertible linear transformation is given by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ where $p, q, r, s \\in \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ and its determinant, $\\det(T) = ps - qr$, is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. The units are elements that have a multiplicative inverse, which are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. We will generate all such invertible matrices.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations**: If we apply a transformation $T$ to the variables $(x, y)$, changing them to $(x', y') = (px+qy, rx+sy)$, the quadratic form $Q(x,y)$ becomes a new form $Q'(x,y) = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2$. The new coefficients are calculated as follows:\n    $a' = ap^2 + bpr + cr^2 \\pmod 8$\n    $b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs \\pmod 8$\n    $c' = aq^2 + bqs + cs^2 \\pmod 8$\n\n4.  **Find Equivalence Classes (Orbits)**: The set of all forms that can be reached from a starting form $Q$ via any invertible transformation $T$ constitutes an equivalence class, also known as an orbit. The problem is to find the total number of such disjoint orbits.\n\n5.  **Algorithm**:\n    a. Create a set of all 512 possible forms.\n    b. Create a list of all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    c. Start with an empty list of equivalence classes.\n    d. While the set of forms is not empty:\n        i. Pick an arbitrary form from the set to be a representative of a new class.\n        ii. Calculate its entire orbit by repeatedly applying all possible transformations.\n        iii. Remove all forms in this orbit from the initial set of all forms.\n        iv. Add the representative to our list of classes.\n    e. The number of equivalence classes is the final count of representatives.\n\nThis brute-force approach is computationally feasible and will give the exact number of equivalence classes. The following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
