    Analyzes the clinical case and determines the next best step in management.

    The patient presents with signs and symptoms of metastatic malignant melanoma,
    including a primary skin lesion, new skin spots (metastases), bone pain (metastasis),
    and a malignant pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade.

    The immediate life-threatening issue (tamponade) has been addressed by pericardiocentesis,
    which also confirmed malignant cells.

    The next logical and critical step is to treat the underlying systemic disease.

    Evaluation of choices:
    A. Prescribe meloxicam: Symptomatic pain relief, not treatment of the cancer.
    B. Prescribe low-dose analgesia: Symptomatic pain relief, not treatment of the cancer.
    C. None of the choices: Possible, but other options need to be considered.
    D. Chemotherapy to kill the malignant cells: A systemic treatment for a widespread cancer. This is the correct approach.
    E. Immunosuppression: Incorrect. Immunotherapy (stimulation) is used, not suppression.
    F. Rapid antibiotic infusion: No indication of infection.
    G. Radiotherapy: A local treatment, not suitable for widespread systemic disease as a primary therapy.
    H. Diuretics: Symptomatic relief for fluid overload, but doesn't treat the cause.

    Conclusion: The next best step is to initiate systemic therapy to target the cancer throughout the body. Chemotherapy is the choice that represents this action.
