    "Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns:** We are given the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx) as 10 picometers (10 x 10⁻¹² m) and are asked about the electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n2.  **Determine the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2. We will calculate the minimum uncertainty, so Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.\n3.  **Determine the Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized: L = mvr = nħ. For the first orbit (n=1), the radius (r) is the Bohr radius (a₀). The momentum is p = mv. Therefore, the momentum is p = ħ / a₀.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p):** We will find the ratio by dividing the expression for Δp by the expression for p.\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the equation to: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n5.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:** We will plug in the known values for the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 5.292 x 10⁻¹¹ m) and the uncertainty in position (Δx = 10 x 10⁻¹² m) to find the final numerical ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum to its\n    momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants\n    # Bohr radius (a0) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n    # Reduced Planck constant (h_bar) in J*s\n    h_bar = 1.054571817e-34\n\n    # Given information\n    # Uncertainty in position (delta_x) in meters (10 pm = 10e-12 m)\n    delta_x = 10e-12\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) ---\n    # From Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (minimum uncertainty): delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n    delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p) ---\n    # From the Bohr model, for n=1: p = h_bar / a0\n    p = h_bar / a0\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the ratio ---\n    # The ratio is delta_p / p, which simplifies to a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n    ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    print(\"The ratio is calculated as (Uncertainty in Momentum) / (Momentum in First Bohr Orbit).\")\n    print(\"This simplifies to the formula: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\\n\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the values:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {a0} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculated ratio:\")\n    print(ratio)\n\ncalculate_momentum_ratio()\n<<<2.645886054515>>>"
