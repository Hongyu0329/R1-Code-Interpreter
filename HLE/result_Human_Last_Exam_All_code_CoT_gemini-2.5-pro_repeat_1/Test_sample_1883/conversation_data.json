    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is a step-by-step plan for the solution, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction and Governing Rule**: The reaction is the thermal electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a system with 8 π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, an 8-π electron (or 4n, with n=2) system undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure under thermal conditions.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemical Outcome for Isomers**: The stereochemistry of the product depends on the stereochemistry of the substituents at the termini of the reacting polyene (C2 and C9).\n    *   The starting material, **(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene**, has both terminal methyl groups pointing \"outward\" from the coiled polyene chain. Conrotatory closure of this `out/out` isomer leads exclusively to the **`trans`-isomer (B)**.\n    *   Under thermal conditions, the C8=C9 double bond can isomerize to form **(2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene**. This isomer has one methyl group \"outward\" and the other \"inward\". Conrotatory closure of this `out/in` isomer leads exclusively to the **`cis`-isomer (A)**.\n\n3.  **Apply the Curtin-Hammett Principle**: Since the starting material can isomerize before the irreversible cyclization, the final product ratio is not determined by the ground-state populations of the (8E) and (8Z) isomers. Instead, it's determined by the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to products A and B. The ratio is given by the equation:\n    Ratio (A/B) = k_A / k_B = exp(-ΔΔG‡ / RT), where ΔΔG‡ = G‡(A) - G‡(B).\n\n4.  **Estimate Transition State Energies**: We can estimate the activation energies using data from studies on similar systems (e.g., by K.N. Houk). The energy of each transition state is affected by:\n    *   The ground-state energy of the reacting isomer. The (8Z)-isomer is less stable than the (8E)-isomer due to the steric strain of the \"inward\" pointing methyl group.\n    *   The change in steric interactions as the substituents rotate during the conrotatory closure. An \"outward\" methyl group adds to the activation barrier, while an \"inward\" methyl group can relieve ground-state strain and lower the barrier.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ratio**: We will use the following approximate energy values (in kcal/mol) derived from computational studies:\n    *   Activation energy penalty for an \"outward\" methyl group: `+2.1`\n    *   Activation energy \"bonus\" (reduction) for an \"inward\" methyl group: `-1.6`\n    *   Ground state strain for an \"inward\" methyl group: `+4.0`\n\n    Using these values, we will calculate the energy difference between the two transition states (ΔΔG‡, approximated as ΔΔH‡) and then compute the product ratio A:B at a typical reaction temperature (e.g., 100 °C or 373 K).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan to calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef predict_product_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the ratio of cis (A) and trans (B) products from the thermal\n    electrocyclization of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene using FMO theory\n    and principles of torquoselectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
