    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue-Hackenbush, we use its binary representation. In this game, values corresponding to dyadic rationals (fractions with a denominator that is a power of 2) can be constructed as a simple stalk of colored pieces.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.  **Convert the fraction to binary:** A positive dyadic rational $x < 1$ is represented as $0.b_1b_2b_3...b_n$.\n2.  **Construct the stalk:** The Hackenbush representation is a stalk of $n$ pieces. The $k$-th piece from the ground corresponds to the $k$-th binary digit, $b_k$.\n3.  **Determine piece colors:** If the digit $b_k$ is 1, the piece is red. If the digit is 0, the piece is blue.\n4.  **Count the pieces:** The total number of pieces is $n$, the total number of digits in the binary representation.\n\nFor the number $\\frac{13}{16}$:\nThe binary representation is found by checking its composition in terms of powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^1} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^2} + 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^3} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^4}$\nThis gives the binary representation $0.1101_2$.\n\nThis representation has 4 digits after the decimal point. Therefore, 4 pieces are needed.\n- The first digit is '1' (Red).\n- The second digit is '1' (Red).\n- The third digit is '0' (Blue).\n- The fourth digit is '1' (Red).\n\nSo, we need 3 red pieces and 1 blue piece, for a total of 4 pieces.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this automatically.\n\n```python\ndef hackenbush_pieces(numerator, denominator):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of red and blue pieces needed to represent a\n    dyadic rational number in Red-Blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (denominator > 0 and denominator & (denominator - 1) == 0):\n        print(\"Error: The denominator must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    num = numerator\n    den = denominator\n    \n    red_pieces = 0\n    blue_pieces = 0\n    binary_representation = \"0.\"\n    \n    # The loop continues until the fraction is resolved.\n    # For a dyadic rational m / 2^n, this will take n steps.\n    while num > 0:\n        num *= 2\n        if num >= den:\n            binary_representation += \"1\"\n            red_pieces += 1\n            num -= den\n        else:\n            binary_representation += \"0\"\n            blue_pieces += 1\n            \n    total_pieces = red_pieces + blue_pieces\n    \n    print(f\"To represent the fraction {numerator}/{denominator}, we use its binary form: {binary_representation}\")\n    print(f\"Number of red pieces (1s): {red_pieces}\")\n    print(f\"Number of blue pieces (0s): {blue_pieces}\")\n    # Final equation showing the sum\n    print(f\"Total number of pieces: {red_pieces} + {blue_pieces} = {total_pieces}\")\n\n# Input numbers for the problem\nnumerator = 13\ndenominator = 16\n\nhackenbush_pieces(numerator, denominator)\n```\n<<<4>>>"
