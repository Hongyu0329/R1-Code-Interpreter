    This function calculates the number of orbits of a set of 4-tuples of matrices
    under the action of GL(1000).

    The problem reduces to counting the number of 1000-dimensional representations
    of the symmetric group S_5. The irreducible representations of S_5 have dimensions
    1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, and 6.

    We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:
    n1*1 + n2*1 + n3*4 + n4*4 + n5*5 + n6*5 + n7*6 = 1000
    
    This is calculated by summing (m1+1)*(m4+1)*(m5+1) over all non-negative
    integer solutions to m1 + 4*m4 + 5*m5 + 6*m6 = 1000, where m_d is the
    sum of multiplicities for irreps of dimension d.
