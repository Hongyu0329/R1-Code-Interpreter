Thinking Process:
1.  The core of the problem is to find the number of essential variables for a formula 'phi' with 'n' variables. Let this number be 'k'. This 'k' will be the minimum number of variables in any equivalent formula 'psi'.

2.  Condition 1 states that 'phi' has exactly 2**(n-1) models (truth assignments that make it true).
    - A formula that depends on 'k' essential variables and has 'M_h' models in its own 'k'-variable space will have M_h * 2**(n-k) models in the full 'n'-variable space.
    - So, M_h * 2**(n-k) = 2**(n-1). This simplifies to M_h = 2**(k-1).
    - This condition alone is not sufficient to determine 'k', as it holds for k=1, k=2, ..., k=n.

3.  Condition 3 states: "For any two distinct truth-value assignments v1 and v2 that make phi true, there exists at least one atomic variable p such that v1(p) != v2(p)".
    - As written, this is a tautology (it's always true by definition of 'distinct assignments').
    - For this condition to be meaningful, it must impose a real constraint. The most logical interpretation is that the variable 'p' must be one of the 'k' essential variables.
    - This implies that if you take any two distinct models of 'phi', they must differ on at least one essential variable.

4.  Let's analyze the consequence of this interpretation. Assume the number of essential variables 'k' is less than 'n' (k < n).
    - This means there is at least one non-essential variable. Let's call it p_non_essential.
    - Because p_non_essential is not essential, if we have a model 'v1', then the assignment 'v2' (which is identical to 'v1' except that the value of p_non_essential is flipped) must also be a model.
    - 'v1' and 'v2' are distinct models. However, they only differ on a non-essential variable. They have the exact same values for all 'k' essential variables.
    - This contradicts our interpretation of Condition 3, which requires any two distinct models to differ on an essential variable.

5.  Conclusion: The assumption that k < n must be false. Therefore, 'k' must be equal to 'n'.
    - The formula 'phi' must depend on all 'n' of its variables.
    - Any equivalent formula 'psi' must also depend on all 'n' variables, and therefore must contain a minimum of 'n' variables.
