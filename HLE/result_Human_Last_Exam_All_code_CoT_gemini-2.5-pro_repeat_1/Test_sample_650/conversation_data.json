    "To find the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations it performs as a function of its input size, which is determined by the values of `n` and `c`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Operation**: The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. The complexity of the entire algorithm will be primarily determined by how many times this loop runs and how much work is done inside it. The initialization step before the loop consists of a few arithmetic operations and assignments, which take constant time, O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Loop's Behavior**: Let's track the value of the variable `x`, which controls the loop's execution through `q`.\n    *   Before the loop starts, `x` is initialized to `n`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `x` is updated with the value of `q`, where `q` was calculated as `⌊previous_x / c⌋`.\n    *   This means that in each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by the base `c`.\n\n3.  **Count the Number of Iterations**: The loop continues as long as `q > 0`, which is true as long as `x ≥ c`. The process of repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` until the result is less than `c` is the definition of a logarithm. Therefore, the loop will execute `k` times, where `c^k` is approximately `n`. Solving for `k` gives `k ≈ log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is directly proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Work per Iteration**: The operations inside the loop are:\n    *   `i := i + 1` (one increment)\n    *   `x := q` (one assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (one division)\n    *   `a_i := x - qc` (one multiplication and one subtraction)\n    All these are considered elementary arithmetic operations. Assuming they take constant time, the total work done inside a single iteration is constant, or O(1).\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity**: The total time complexity is the product of the number of loop iterations and the work done per iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n))\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression**: According to the change of base rule for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant for a given analysis, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, we can disregard constant multipliers. Thus, the complexity can be simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this analysis by implementing the algorithm and printing the relationship between `n`, `c`, and the number of loop iterations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_imag_complexity(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the IMAG algorithm by counting loop iterations\n    and printing the final complexity equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(c, int) and n >= 0 and c >= 2):\n        print(\"Invalid input: Please provide integers n >= 0 and c >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing IMAG algorithm for n={n}, c={c} ---\")\n\n    # Initialization (O(1) time)\n    i = 0\n    x = n\n    q = x // c\n    \n    loop_iterations = 0\n    \n    # The 'while' loop is the dominant part of the algorithm.\n    while q > 0:\n        loop_iterations += 1\n        # Operations inside the loop are considered O(1).\n        x = q\n        q = x // c\n\n    print(f\"The 'while' loop executed {loop_iterations} times.\")\n\n    # The number of iterations is proportional to log_c(n).\n    # We can verify this calculation.\n    if n >= c:\n        theoretical_log = math.log(n, c)\n        theoretical_iterations = math.floor(theoretical_log)\n        print(f\"The theoretical number of iterations is floor(log_c(n)) = floor(log_{c}({n})) = floor({theoretical_log:.4f}) = {theoretical_iterations}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The loop does not run as n < c (0 iterations).\")\n\n    # Final Complexity Equation\n    print(\"\\nThe computational time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the constant work per iteration.\")\n    print(\"This gives the final equation: T(n, c) = O(log_c(n))\")\n    print(\"Since c is a constant, this is equivalent to T(n) = O(log n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n\n# --- Main execution with example values ---\nanalyze_imag_complexity(1000, 2)\nanalyze_imag_complexity(1000000, 10)\n```\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
