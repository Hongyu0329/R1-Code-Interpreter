    "The provided Java program does not correctly solve the problem. I will first explain the issue with the Java code and then provide a correct and highly efficient C program as requested.\n\n### Analysis of the Java Program\n\nThe submitted Java program is **incorrect**. The problem states that the operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable (`X`) can be in any order. This means there are four possible valid statements: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n\nThe Java code uses `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`. This logic fails for the statements `X++` and `X--`. For example, if the input statement is `X++`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` will be false, and no operation will be performed, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\n### Plan for an Efficient C Solution\n\nI will write a C program that is both correct and optimized for speed and memory.\n\n1.  **Read Input:** Read the number of statements, `n`.\n2.  **Initialize Counter:** Create an integer variable, let's call it `x`, and initialize it to 0.\n3.  **Loop and Process:** Loop `n` times. In each iteration:\n    *   Read the three-character statement into a small character array.\n    *   The most efficient way to determine the operation is to check the middle character (at index 1). If `statement[1]` is `'+'`, it's an increment operation (`++X` or `X++`). Otherwise, it must be a decrement operation (`--X` or `X--`).\n    *   Update the counter `x` accordingly. This requires only a single character comparison per statement.\n4.  **Print Result:** After the loop finishes, print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Efficiency Calculation (x and y)\n\n*   **x (Character Comparisons):** For an input of 100 instructions, this C program will perform exactly one character comparison (`statement[1] == '+'`) for each instruction. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is `x = 100 * 1 = 100`.\n*   **y (Memory Size):** The C program requires minimal memory. It needs one integer for the number of statements `n` (4 bytes), one integer for the result `x` (4 bytes), and a character array of size 4 to hold the 3-character string plus the null terminator (4 bytes). The total memory for these variables is `y = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12` bytes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer format `Nx+y` becomes `N100+12`.\n\nHere is the corrected and optimized C code:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    int n;\n    // Read the number of statements\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    int x = 0;\n    // A buffer to hold the statement (\"++X\" is 3 chars + null terminator)\n    char statement[4];\n\n    // Loop n times, decrementing n until it is 0\n    while (n-- > 0) {\n        // Read the statement string\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n\n        // The middle character uniquely identifies the operation.\n        // This is the most efficient check, requiring only one comparison.\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the final value of x\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+12>>>"
