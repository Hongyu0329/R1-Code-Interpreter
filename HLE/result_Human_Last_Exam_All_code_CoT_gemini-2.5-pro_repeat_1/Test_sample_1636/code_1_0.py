    # Part 1: The physical action of the sea
    reason1 = "The phrase 're-measures' implies a constant, rhythmic action. For the sea, this most directly refers to the ebb and flow of the tides. This physical process is a constant presence in the poem's setting."

    # Part 2: The metaphorical or psychological effect of that action
    reason2 = "This repetitive motion of the tides often serves in literature to evoke a state of deep thought or introspective contemplation. The speaker, watching the sea at the 'grave edge of the world', is likely in such a state, which is further suggested by the self-description 'I am agate, opaline' (implying complexity and depth)."
