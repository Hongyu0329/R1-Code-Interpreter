# The problem simplifies to calculating 2^81, as derived from number theory principles.
# The final equation is f(p) = 2**81.
# Here are the components of this final equation and the result.

base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

print("The simplified final equation is of the form: result = base ** exponent")
print(f"base = {base}")
print(f"exponent = {exponent}")
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
