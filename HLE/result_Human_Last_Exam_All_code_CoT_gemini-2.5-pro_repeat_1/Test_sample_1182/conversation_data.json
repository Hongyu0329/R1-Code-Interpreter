    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The initial equation of the curve is $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. We are working over the prime $p=2$. The reduction of this equation modulo 2 is $y^2 = x^2$, which is a highly singular curve (a \"double line\"). To find the stable reduction, we need to find a better model.\n2.  I will perform a change of variables to obtain a new model of the curve where the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side are all 2-adically integral (i.e., their 2-adic valuation is non-negative). The transformation $X=2x, Y=2y$ works. This yields the new equation $Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$. Let's call the polynomial on the right $F(X)$.\n3.  I will then determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $F(X)$ using the Newton polygon method. This analysis shows that $F(X)$ has one root at 0 (with infinite valuation), one root with a 2-adic valuation of 4, and three roots with a 2-adic valuation of 0.\n4.  The number of double points in the stable reduction can be computed using a formula that involves partitioning the roots into clusters based on their residue modulo 2. Roots with the same residue belong to the same cluster.\n    *   A root has a residue of 0 if its 2-adic valuation is greater than 0. The root 0 and the root with valuation 4 fall into this cluster.\n    *   A root has a non-zero residue if its 2-adic valuation is 0. The three roots with valuation 0 fall into this category. Further analysis shows their residues are distinct roots of the polynomial $t^3+t^2+1$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, so they each form their own cluster.\n5.  For each cluster, we calculate a contribution to the total number of double points. The total number is the sum of these contributions. The contribution of a cluster $S$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{1}{2} \\sum v_2(r - s) \\rfloor$, where the sum is over all distinct pairs of roots $r,s$ in $S$.\n6.  For the main cluster containing the root 0 and the root with valuation 4, the sum is simply the valuation of their difference, which is 4. The contribution is $\\lfloor 4/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n7.  For all other clusters, which are singletons, the sum is empty, and their contribution is 0.\n8.  The total number of double points is the sum of the contributions, which is $2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2$.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that formalizes the final calculation step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_curve_nodes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction\n    of the curve y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x above the prime 2.\n    The method uses an analysis of the 2-adic valuations of the roots of a\n    transformed version of the curve's equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
