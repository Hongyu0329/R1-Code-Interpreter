    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The problem asks for the smallest number `N` such that any integer `x >= N` can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form `f(n) = 2n^2+3n+1` for non-negative integers `n`. This is equivalent to finding the largest integer that *cannot* be represented in this way. If we call this largest unreachable number `M`, then `N = M + 1`.\n2.  The numbers are generated by the formula `f(n) = (2n+1)(n+1)`. For `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`, the sequence is `1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, ...`.\n3.  This is a variation of the subset sum problem. A standard way to solve this is using dynamic programming. I will use a boolean array, `reachable`, where `reachable[i]` is true if the number `i` can be formed by a sum of distinct elements from our set, and false otherwise.\n4.  I'll initialize a boolean array `reachable` of a sufficiently large size (`LIMIT`) with all `False` values, except for `reachable[0] = True` (representing a sum of zero, from an empty set of numbers).\n5.  I will generate the numbers from the sequence `f(n)` up to `LIMIT`.\n6.  For each number `k` in our sequence, I will iterate through the `reachable` array from top to bottom. For each index `i` from `LIMIT-1` down to `k`, I will update `reachable[i]` to `True` if `reachable[i-k]` is `True`. The backward iteration is crucial to ensure that each number from the sequence is used at most once (i.e., the summands are distinct).\n7.  After processing all numbers in the sequence up to `LIMIT`, I will scan the `reachable` array from the end to find the largest index `i` for which `reachable[i]` is `False`. This index is the largest number `M` that cannot be formed.\n8.  The final answer `N` will be `M + 1`. I will choose a `LIMIT` of 200, which should be sufficient as the gaps between representable numbers tend to fill up as more (and larger) numbers from the sequence are included.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any number >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2+3n+1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We need to find the largest number that cannot be formed.
