    # In N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory, all couplings are determined by a single gauge coupling constant, g.
    # The various terms given in the N=1 description can be used to fix this coupling g.

    # 1. Fixing the gauge coupling g from the D-term.
    # The D-term potential in the N=1 description is given as L_D = 1/2 * (f_abc * phi_i*b * phi^ic)^2.
    # The standard expression for the D-term potential is V_D = (g^2)/2 * (f_abc * phi_i*b * phi^ic)^2.
    # Comparing the given Lagrangian term with the standard potential form, we have g^2 = 1.
    g = 1

    # 2. Determining k_Yuk.
    # In N=4 SYM, the Yukawa coupling is directly proportional to the gauge coupling g.
    # With the standard normalizations that lead to the given superpotential and D-term, the relation is k_Yuk = g.
    k_Yuk = g
    
    # 3. Determining k_W from the superpotential W.
    # The superpotential for N=4 SYM written in N=1 notation is W = (g/3!) * f_abc * epsilon_ijk * phi^ia * phi^jb * phi^kc.
    # The problem gives W = (k_W/3!) * ... which implies k_W = g.
    k_W = g
    # Since g=1, we have k_W = 1. This is consistent with the problem statement.

    # 4. Determining k_D+F.
    # The scalar potential in N=4 SYM is V = (g^2/4) * sum_{I,J} (f_abc * phi_I^b * phi_J^c)^2.
    # The Lagrangian term given is L_{F+D}, which corresponds to -V.
    # The structure of the term in the prompt, L_{F+D} = k_{D+F} * (f*phi*phi)*(f*phi*phi),
    # sets the overall scale of the potential. Thus, k_{D+F} must be proportional to g^2.
    # The standard result yields k_{D+F} = g^2 / 4.
    k_D_F = g**2 / 4

    print(f"The gauge coupling constant is fixed to g = {g}")
    print(f"The Yukawa coupling constant k_Yuk is equal to g.")
    print(f"So, k_Yuk = {k_Yuk}")
    print(f"The scalar potential coupling constant k_D+F is equal to g^2 / 4.")
    print(f"So, k_D+F = {k_D_F}")
    
    # Final answer format
    # The question asks for the constants k_Yuk and k_D+F.
    # We output them as a tuple.
