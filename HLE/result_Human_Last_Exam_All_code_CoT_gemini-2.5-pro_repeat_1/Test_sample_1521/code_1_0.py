def solve_markov_chain_questions():
  """
  This function provides the answers to the two questions about Markov chains.
  
  Question 1: Given an irreducible Markov chain and a specific non-negative harmonic function h,
  can one conclude if the chain is recurrent or transient?
  Answer: The existence of the described function h, which acts as a non-constant
  non-negative supermartingale, implies the chain must be transient.

  Question 2: For a new chain defined by an h-transform using the function from Q1,
  is this new chain recurrent or transient?
  Answer: The new chain is also transient. Assuming it has a recurrent class leads to a
  contradiction with the irreducibility of the original chain.
