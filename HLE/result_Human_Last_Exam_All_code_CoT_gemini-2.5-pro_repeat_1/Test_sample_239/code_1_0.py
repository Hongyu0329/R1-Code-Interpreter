# This script analyzes the provided C code and problem description
# to answer the four questions.

# Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors?
# The C code is analyzed against the XVM C compiler specifications.
# 1. Line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a valid type. The largest unsigned integer type is `unsigned long`.
# 2. Line 4: `scanf` uses `%d` (for a 1D `digit`) to read into `unsigned long` variables. The correct format specifier is `%n`.
# 3. Line 9: `printf` uses `%d` to print a value that is the product of two `unsigned long`s. The correct specifier is `%n`.
# These three lines contain compiler errors.
compiler_error_lines = 3

# Question 2: What is the total memory (in D) used for variables in an optimized program?
# To solve the problem with minimal memory, we only need to store the three inputs.
# - n (up to 4*10^9) fits in `unsigned long` (12D).
# - m (up to 4*10^9) fits in `unsigned long` (12D).
# - a (up to 10^6) fits in `unsigned int` (6D).
# Total memory = 12D (for n) + 12D (for m) + 6D (for a).
memory_in_D = 12 + 12 + 6

# Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
# Yes. The number of flagstones for one dimension is ceil(n/a).
# This can be calculated using only integer arithmetic with the formula (n + a - 1) / a,
# which avoids the need for an `if` statement to check the remainder.
no_branching_possible = 'Y'

# Question 4: What is the expected output for n = m = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1
# The number of flagstones needed is ceil(n/a) * ceil(m/a).
# We use integer arithmetic to perform the ceiling division to ensure precision with large numbers.
flagstones_n = (n + a - 1) // a
flagstones_m = (m + a - 1) // a
expected_output = flagstones_n * flagstones_m

# The final answer must be in the format x:y:t:z, where the prompt had a typo
# listing 'z' twice. We assume 't' is the third element.
final_answer_string = f"{compiler_error_lines}:{memory_in_D}:{no_branching_possible}:{expected_output}"
