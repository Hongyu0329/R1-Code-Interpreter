    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function using Feynman's path integral formalism.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Core Concept:** The partition function `Z` in quantum statistical mechanics is given by `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`. The path integral formalism provides a way to calculate this trace by summing over all possible field histories (paths) in imaginary time.\n2.  **Identify Key Ingredients:** For fermions, this requires three specific ingredients:\n    *   **Integration Variables:** Fermionic fields are described by anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables (`ψ`, `ψ̄`). The integral is a functional integral over these fields.\n    *   **Weighting Factor:** Each path is weighted by `e^(-S_E)`, where `S_E` is the Euclidean action, derived from the system's Lagrangian by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time (`t → -iτ`).\n    *   **Boundary Conditions:** Due to the properties of the trace for fermions, the integration is performed over fields that are anti-periodic in the imaginary time direction, with period `β = 1/k_B T`.\n3.  **Assemble the Formula:** Combine these ingredients into the final expression.\n4.  **Provide the Code:** Write a Python script to print the complete formula and its components in a clear, formatted way.\n\nHere is the Python code that displays the formula.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the formula\n    z_definition = \"Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] * exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\"\n    se_definition = \"S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  L_E(ψ̄(τ, x), ψ(τ, x))\"\n    bc_definition = \"ψ(τ, x) = -ψ(τ + β, x)  and  ψ̄(τ, x) = -ψ̄(τ + β, x)\"\n    le_example = \"L_E = ψ̄(τ, x) * [ħ ∂/∂τ - (ħ²/2m)∇² - μ] * ψ(τ, x)\"\n\n    # Print the explanation and the formulas\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function (Z) in the imaginary time representation is:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] * exp( - ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x  L_E )\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"This formula is composed of the following key parts:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1.
