    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure of Dirichlet Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is called primitive if its conductor is $N$. If $N$ has the prime factorization $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$, then any primitive character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_i$, and the order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of the $\\chi_i$.\n\n2.  **Factorize the Conductor**: The given conductor is $N = 36036$. We first find its prime factorization.\n    $N = 36036 = 4 \\times 9009 = 2^2 \\times 9 \\times 1001 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conditions**: For a character $\\chi = \\chi_{4}\\chi_{9}\\chi_{7}\\chi_{11}\\chi_{13}$ to be primitive with conductor $N$ and order 6:\n    *   Each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ must be primitive modulo $p^a$.\n    *   The order of $\\chi$ must be $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: For each prime power factor $p^a$, we need to find the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6.\n    *   The number of primitive characters of a specific order $d$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(d)$, under certain conditions.\n    *   We will find the possible orders for primitive characters for each factor $p^a$ and count how many of them have orders that divide 6.\n\n5.  **Use Inclusion-Exclusion**: The total number of characters with order exactly 6 can be found by first counting all characters whose order *divides* 6, and then subtracting those whose order is a *proper divisor* of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3).\n    *   Let $A_k$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $N$ whose order divides $k$.\n    *   The number of characters of order exactly 6 is given by the formula: $A_6 - A_3 - A_2 + A_1$.\n    *   We will calculate $A_6, A_3, A_2, A_1$ by multiplying the counts of component characters for each case.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            result -= result // p\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef get_primitive_orders(p, a):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of orders of primitive characters modulo p^a.\"\"\"\n    m = p**a\n    if m == 2: return []  # No primitive characters mod 2\n    if m == 4: return [2]  # Primitive character mod 4 has order 2\n    \n    # For p odd, a=1, primitive orders are d | (p-1) with d > 1\n    if a == 1:\n        return [d for d in get_divisors(p - 1) if d > 1]\n    \n    # For p odd, a > 1, primitive orders are d | phi(p^a) but d not | phi(p^(a-1))\n    phi_m = phi(m)\n    phi_prev = phi(p**(a - 1))\n    divs_m = get_divisors(phi_m)\n    divs_prev = set(get_divisors(phi_prev))\n    return [d for d in divs_m if d not in divs_prev]\n\ndef calculate_char_count(factors, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive characters with conductor N\n    whose order divides k.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_count = 1\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the number of characters with order dividing {k}:\")\n    for p, a in factors.items():\n        m = p**a\n        prim_orders = get_primitive_orders(p, a)\n        valid_orders = [d for d in prim_orders if k % d == 0]\n        count = sum(phi(d) for d in valid_orders)\n        print(f\"  For conductor {m}, there are {count} choices.\")\n        total_count *= count\n    print(f\"Total number of characters with order dividing {k} is {total_count}.\")\n    return total_count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Main function to solve the problem.\"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    target_order = 6\n    factors = {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 1, 11: 1, 13: 1}\n\n    print(f\"Let N = {N}.
