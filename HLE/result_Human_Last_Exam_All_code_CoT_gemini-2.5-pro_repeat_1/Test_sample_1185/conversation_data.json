    "The question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2. This is a problem of enumerating the distinct topological types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a complete connected nodal curve with a finite automorphism group. The classification of these types corresponds to the stratification of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the moduli space of genus 2 curves, $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}_2}$.\n\nThe classification can be broken down based on the geometric genus of the components of the curve and its dual graph structure. The total arithmetic genus of a stable curve $C$ is given by the formula $g(C) = \\sum_{i} g_i + b_1(G)$, where $g_i$ is the geometric genus of the i-th irreducible component, and $b_1(G)$ is the first Betti number (number of loops) of the dual graph $G$. For a curve to be stable, every rational component ($g_i=0$) must have at least 3 special points (nodes), and every elliptic component ($g_i=1$) must have at least 1 special point.\n\nA full derivation of all possible stable configurations is quite involved, but the result is a well-known fact in algebraic geometry. The total number of such types is 14. We can break this number down as follows:\n\n1.  **Smooth Curve (1 type):** The curve is irreducible and has no nodes (a smooth genus 2 curve). This is the generic case.\n2.  **Singular, but with a genus > 0 component (4 types):**\n    *   The curve is irreducible with one node. Its normalization is an elliptic curve (genus 1).\n    *   The curve consists of two elliptic curves meeting at a single point.\n    *   The curve consists of one elliptic curve and a collection of rational curves, forming two distinct topological types.\n3.  **Totally Degenerate Curves (9 types):** All irreducible components of the curve are rational (genus 0).\n    *   The curve is irreducible with two nodes. Its normalization is a single rational curve.\n    *   The curve is reducible, and all its components are rational. There are 8 such configurations, distinguished by their dual graphs (e.g., two rational curves meeting at three points).\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number based on this breakdown.\n\n```python\n# The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2\n# is a known result from algebraic geometry, corresponding to the number of\n# strata in the moduli space of stable genus 2 curves.\n\n# 1.
