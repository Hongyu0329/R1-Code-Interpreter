    This script solves the musical puzzle by identifying the common theme

    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the theme and determine j and k.
    # The theme is the "Fate" motif from Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Movement 1.
    # This directly gives us j (symphony number) and k (movement number).
    j = 5
    k = 1

    # Step 3 & 4: Use the Hisaishi clue to determine l.
    # The score for the 8th Miyazaki-directed Ghibli Museum short film,

    # The clue states this is film #(j + l).
    # So, j + l = 8.
