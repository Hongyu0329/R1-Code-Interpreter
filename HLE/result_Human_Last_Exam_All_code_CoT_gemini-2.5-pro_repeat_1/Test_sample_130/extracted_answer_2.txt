The edges move with a velocity proportional to their local curvature, a process analogous to motion by mean curvature. This causes sharp corners to round off, convex regions to shrink, and concave regions to fill in. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, all shapes are smoothed and eventually shrink until they disappear, causing the image to converge to a single uniform color.
