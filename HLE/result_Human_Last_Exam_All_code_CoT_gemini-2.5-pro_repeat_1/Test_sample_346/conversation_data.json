    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: First, I will break down the complex SKI combinator expression into simpler, known components. This involves identifying standard combinators like `I` (Identity) and patterns that represent Church numerals (a way to represent natural numbers using functions).\n2.  **Simplify the Expression**: I will substitute the identified components back into the main expression. The key components are:\n    *   `succ = S(S(K(S))(K))`, the successor function (adds 1).\n    *   `I`, which represents the Church numeral `1`.\n    *   `S(I)(I)`, which represents the Church numeral `2`.\n    *   Expressions like `succ 1` become `2`, and `succ 2` become `3`.\n3.  **Interpret the Arithmetic**: The simplified expression will involve the application of Church numerals to each other. In SKI combinator logic, applying a Church numeral `m` to another numeral `n` (written as `m n`) corresponds to exponentiation: `n^m`. The structure of the simplified expression will reveal a series of nested exponentiations.\n4.  **Calculate the Value of n**: I will evaluate the nested exponentiation step-by-step to find the final value of the integer `n`.\n5.  **Calculate log_2(n)**: Finally, I will use logarithmic properties to find the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the final arithmetic calculation, showing each number involved in the final equation for `n` and its logarithm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Deconstruct and Simplify the SKI Expression\n# The original expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.\n# We identify the following Church numerals:\n# - `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(I)`, which is `succ(1)`, resulting in the Church numeral `2`.\n# - `S(I)(I)` is another representation of the Church numeral `2`.\n# - `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is `succ(S(I)(I))`, which is `succ(2)`, resulting in `3`.\n#\n# Substituting these back, the expression simplifies to: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2))) 3`.\n\n# Step 2: Interpret and Evaluate the Simplified Expression\n# The combinator `S(I) x y` reduces to `y (x y)`.\n# The application of Church numerals `m n` corresponds to exponentiation, `n^m`.\n# Following the reduction rules, the expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2))) 3` evaluates to `3 (3 (3 2))`.\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the value of n from the nested expression\n# We evaluate `3 (3 (3 2))` from the inside out:\n# - The innermost part `(3 2)` means 2^3.\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1 = 3\nresult1 = base1 ** exponent1\n\n# - The next part is `(3 result1)` or `(3 8)`, which means 8^3.\nbase2 = result1\nexponent2 = 3\nresult2 = base2 ** exponent2\n\n# - The outermost part is `(3 result2)` or `(3 512)`, which means 512^3. This is our final number, n.\nbase3 = result2\nexponent3 = 3\nn = base3 ** exponent3\n\n# Step 4: Present the final equation for n and calculate log_2(n)\nprint(f\"The final arithmetic expression for the church integer n is derived from (3 (3 (3 2))).\")\nprint(f\"Step 1: (3 2) -> {base1}^{exponent1} = {result1}\")\nprint(f\"Step 2: (3 8) -> {base2}^{exponent2} = {result2}\")\nprint(f\"Step 3: (3 512) -> {base3}^{exponent3}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"So, the final equation for n is: n = {base3}^{exponent3}\")\n\n# To calculate log_2(n), we use logarithmic properties: log(a^b) = b * log(a)\n# We know that 512 is 2^9.\n# log_2(n) = log_2(512^3) = 3 * log_2(512) = 3 * 9 = 27\nlog2_of_base3 = math.log2(base3)\nlog2_n = exponent3 * log2_of_base3\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe value of log_2(n) is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"log_2(n) = log_2({base3}^{exponent3})\")\nprint(f\"         = {exponent3} * log_2({base3})\")\nprint(f\"         = {exponent3} * {int(log2_of_base3)}\")\nprint(f\"         = {int(log2_n)}\")\n\n```\n<<<27>>>"
