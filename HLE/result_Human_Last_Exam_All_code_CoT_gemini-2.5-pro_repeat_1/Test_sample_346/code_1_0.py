# Step 1: Deconstruct and Simplify the SKI Expression
# The original expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`.
# We identify the following Church numerals:
# - `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(I)`, which is `succ(1)`, resulting in the Church numeral `2`.
# - `S(I)(I)` is another representation of the Church numeral `2`.
# - `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is `succ(S(I)(I))`, which is `succ(2)`, resulting in `3`.
#
# Substituting these back, the expression simplifies to: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2))) 3`.

# Step 2: Interpret and Evaluate the Simplified Expression
# The combinator `S(I) x y` reduces to `y (x y)`.
# The application of Church numerals `m n` corresponds to exponentiation, `n^m`.
# Following the reduction rules, the expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K 2))) 3` evaluates to `3 (3 (3 2))`.

# Step 3: Calculate the value of n from the nested expression
# We evaluate `3 (3 (3 2))` from the inside out:
# - The innermost part `(3 2)` means 2^3.
base1 = 2
exponent1 = 3
result1 = base1 ** exponent1

# - The next part is `(3 result1)` or `(3 8)`, which means 8^3.
base2 = result1
exponent2 = 3
result2 = base2 ** exponent2

# - The outermost part is `(3 result2)` or `(3 512)`, which means 512^3. This is our final number, n.
base3 = result2
exponent3 = 3
n = base3 ** exponent3

# Step 4: Present the final equation for n and calculate log_2(n)
print(f"The final arithmetic expression for the church integer n is derived from (3 (3 (3 2))).")
print(f"Step 1: (3 2) -> {base1}^{exponent1} = {result1}")
print(f"Step 2: (3 8) -> {base2}^{exponent2} = {result2}")
print(f"Step 3: (3 512) -> {base3}^{exponent3}")
print("-" * 20)
print(f"So, the final equation for n is: n = {base3}^{exponent3}")

# To calculate log_2(n), we use logarithmic properties: log(a^b) = b * log(a)
# We know that 512 is 2^9.
# log_2(n) = log_2(512^3) = 3 * log_2(512) = 3 * 9 = 27
log2_of_base3 = math.log2(base3)
log2_n = exponent3 * log2_of_base3

print(f"\nThe value of log_2(n) is calculated as:")
print(f"log_2(n) = log_2({base3}^{exponent3})")
print(f"         = {exponent3} * log_2({base3})")
print(f"         = {exponent3} * {int(log2_of_base3)}")
