        "This script explains the reasoning step-by-step.",
        "\nStep 1: Understand the definitions.",
        " - Continuum: A compact, connected metric space.",
        " - Decomposable: A continuum X that is the union of two of its proper subcontinua (X = A U B, where A and B are continua, A != X, and B != X).",
        " - Regular Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum S that is equal to the closure of its own interior, i.e., S = cl(int(S)).",
        
        "\nStep 2: Analyze the consequences of decomposability.",
        " - Let X be a decomposable continuum, with X = A U B.",
        " - Because A and B are proper, closed subsets, their complements X\\A and X\\B are non-empty open sets.",
        " - The interior of B, int(B), must contain the open set X\\A, so int(B) is non-empty.",
        " - Similarly, int(A) must contain X\\B, so int(A) is non-empty.",
        " - Since both A and B have non-empty interiors, the sets cl(int(A)) and cl(int(B)) are non-empty regular closed sets.",
        " - This suggests the number of regular subcontinua is likely greater than 0.",

        "\nStep 3: Eliminate simple examples.",
        " - If X is a simple continuum like the closed interval [0, 1] or a circle, it is decomposable.",
        " - However, in these spaces, any proper closed sub-arc S is a regular subcontinuum because cl(int(S)) = S.",
        " - Such spaces have uncountably many regular proper subcontinua. We need to find a space with the *smallest possible* number.",

        "\nStep 4: Formulate a strategy for a minimal construction.",
        " - To minimize the number of regular subcontinua, we should construct a space X with very few 'nice' open subsets whose closures are connected.",
        " - A good strategy is to build X from components that have no regular proper subcontinua themselves. Such components are called indecomposable continua (e.g., the pseudo-arc). An indecomposable continuum has the property that the interior of any of its proper subcontinua is empty.",

        "\nStep 5: Propose and analyze the minimal example.",
        " - Consider a space X formed by taking two distinct indecomposable continua, K1 and K2, and joining them at a single point p. This is known as the 'one-point union' of K1 and K2.",
        " - This space X is decomposable, as X = K1 U K2, where K1 and K2 are proper subcontinua.",
        " - Let's find its regular proper subcontinua:",
        "   1. Is K1 regular? The interior of K1 in X, int_X(K1), is the set of points in K1 except for the join point p. The closure of this set is K1 itself. So, cl(int_X(K1)) = K1. Thus, K1 is a regular proper subcontinuum.",
        "   2. Is K2 regular? By the same argument, K2 is also a regular proper subcontinuum.",
        "   3. Are there others? No. Any other proper subcontinuum S would have to be made of proper subcontinua of K1 and K2. Since K1 and K2 are indecomposable, these parts of S would have empty interiors, meaning S itself would have an empty interior. A subcontinuum with an empty interior cannot be regular. So, there are no other regular proper subcontinua.",
        " - This construction yields a decomposable continuum with exactly two regular proper subcontinua: {K1, K2}.",

        "\nStep 6: Conclude the final answer.",
        " - The existence of this space proves the minimum possible cardinality is at most 2.",
        " - A known (but difficult) theorem in continuum theory states that no decomposable continuum can have exactly one regular proper subcontinuum.",
        " - Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality cannot be 0 or 1. Combined with our example for 2, the minimum must be 2."
