    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. The method involves stacking the two matrices vertically to form a new matrix M, and then reducing this matrix to a row-echelon form using elementary row operations. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nLet's form the stacked matrix M:\nM = [P1; P2] = [s^2 + s, -s; -s^2 - 1, s^2; s, 0; -s - 1, 1]\n\nWe will perform a series of elementary row operations to simplify this matrix. An elementary row operation can be one of the following:\n1. Swapping two rows.\n2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe goal is to introduce zeros into the matrix until it is in a simplified (row-echelon) form. The resulting non-zero matrix block at the top will be the GCRD.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these steps using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices\n    P1 and P2 by performing elementary row operations on the stacked matrix [P1; P2].\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    print(\"Given matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # To simplify, we want to use lower-degree rows to eliminate higher-degree rows.\n    # Swap rows to bring the lower-degree rows from P2 to the top.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Swap rows to bring lower-degree polynomials to the top for pivoting.\")\n    M.row_swap(0, 2)\n    M.row_swap(1, 3)\n    print(\"M after swapping rows:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # Now M = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1], [s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n    # Use the first row [s, 0] to eliminate entries in the first column.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Eliminate elements in the first column.\")\n    # R3 := R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    M[2, :] = M.row(2) - (s + 1) * M.row(0)\n    # R4 := R4 + s*R1\n    M[3, :] = M.row(3) + s * M.row(0)\n    print(\"M after eliminating s^2 terms:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # Now M = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1], [0, -s], [-1, s^2]]\n    # A '1' or '-1' is an excellent pivot.
