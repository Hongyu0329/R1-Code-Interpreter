    "My plan is to determine the number of unique proton signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 1,3,5-trisubstituted-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core. This core possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. The three substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical. This symmetry means that we only need to determine the number of unique proton environments in one of the three identical \"arms\" and in the central core, then sum them up.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Central Core:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups are chemically equivalent and will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n3.  **Analyze One Arm:** Each arm consists of a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker and a complex chiral substituent, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`.\n    *   **Methylene Linker (`-CH2-`):** This group is attached to the chiral substituent. The presence of this adjacent chiral center makes the two protons of the methylene group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will give rise to two distinct signals.\n    *   **Chiral Substituent:** This part of the molecule is derived from camphor and is a rigid, asymmetric, bicyclic system. Due to its lack of internal symmetry, nearly all of its protons are in unique chemical environments.\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor-derived skeleton. They are all in different stereochemical environments and are therefore non-equivalent, giving 3 signals.\n        *   **CH2 Groups:** There are two CH2 groups in the six-membered ring of the skeleton. The two protons within each CH2 group are diastereotopic (endo/exo), and the two CH2 groups themselves are in different locations. This results in 4 unique proton signals.\n        *   **CH Protons:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring and one proton on a bridgehead carbon of the bicyclic skeleton. Both are in unique environments, giving 2 signals.\n    *   **Total for the Substituent:** Summing these up gives 3 (from CH3) + 4 (from CH2) + 2 (from CH) = 9 signals.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Signals:** Finally, I will sum the number of signals from the central core, the linker, and the chiral substituent.\n    *   Total Signals = (Central Core Signals) + (Linker Signals) + (Substituent Signals)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    molecule_name = \"1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analysis of 1H NMR peaks for: {molecule_name}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze molecular symmetry.\")\n    print(\"The molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry, making the three arms attached to the central benzene ring equivalent.\")\n    print(\"We will count the unique signals from the central core and one arm.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Central Core\n    core_signals = 1\n    print(f\"Step 2: Signals from the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\")\n    print(f\"The three methyl groups on the central ring are equivalent by symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"Number of peaks from central core = {core_signals}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: One Arm (Linker + Substituent)\n    print(\"Step 3: Signals from one of the three identical arms.\")\n    \n    # Step 3a: Linker\n    linker_signals = 2\n    print(f\" - The -CH2- linker's two protons are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral center.\")\n    print(f\"   Number of peaks from linker = {linker_signals}\")\n\n    # Step 3b: Substituent\n    # This complex substituent is a camphor-derived pyrazole.
