    The first draft of the poem presents a rich, integrated world where a human-made structure (the arches) exists in harmony with nature. The 'architect' is a known presence whose 'art' is evident. The tone is one of safety and a seamless connection between past and present.

    The fourth draft is a stark contrast. It is fragmented and focuses on decay and emptiness with words like 'loss,' 'moss,' and 'abyss.' The architect's existence is no longer a certainty but a doubtful question: 'Was there an architect, once?'. This transforms the scene from one of harmonious order into a ruin that is succumbing to time.

    The central change between the drafts is the shift from depicting persistent, human-created order to questioning whether that order can survive the disorganizing forces of time and nature (entropy, represented by the encroaching 'moss'). The poem's revision moves the focus from celebrating a creation to contemplating its decay and the potential loss of its original meaning.

    Therefore, the central metaphysical question that arises from this comparison is about the struggle of human order against the relentless passage of time.
