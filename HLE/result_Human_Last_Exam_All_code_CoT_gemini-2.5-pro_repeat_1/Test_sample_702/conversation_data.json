    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow a series of steps based on standard theorems in algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Map:** The map in question is a well-known construction in homotopy theory. We identify it as the adjoint of the smash product of two evaluation maps, $f = \\text{ad}(\\varepsilon_4 \\wedge \\varepsilon_6)$.\n2.  **Evaluation Maps:** The evaluation map $\\varepsilon_k: \\Sigma \\Omega S^k \\to S^k$ is the counit of the suspension-loop space adjunction $(\\Sigma, \\Omega)$.\n3.  **Connectivity of Adjoint Maps:** The connectivity of a map and its adjoint are identical. Therefore, the connectivity of $f$ is the same as the connectivity of $\\varepsilon_4 \\wedge \\varepsilon_6: \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n4.  **Connectivity of Evaluation Maps:** For a suspension space like $S^k = \\Sigma S^{k-1}$, the connectivity of the evaluation map $\\varepsilon_k$ is given by the formula: $\\text{conn}(\\varepsilon_k) = 2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^k) + 2$. We will calculate this for $k=4$ and $k=6$.\n5.  **Connectivity of Smash Product of Maps:** For two maps $g_1: A_1 \\to B_1$ and $g_2: A_2 \\to B_2$, the connectivity of their smash product $g_1 \\wedge g_2$ is given by the formula: $\\text{conn}(g_1 \\wedge g_2) = \\min(\\text{conn}(g_1) + \\text{conn}(B_2) + 1, \\text{conn}(g_2) + \\text{conn}(B_1) + 1)$.\n6.  **Calculation:** We will compute the connectivities of the spheres, loop spaces, and evaluation maps, and then substitute these values into the formula for the smash product connectivity to find the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the connectivity.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the dimensions of the spheres\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) -> Omega(S^{m} wedge S^{n}) for m={m}, n={n}.\")\n    print(\"This map is the adjoint of the smash product of evaluation maps, f = ad(epsilon_{m} wedge epsilon_{n}).\")\n    print(\"The connectivity of f is the same as the connectivity of epsilon_{m} wedge epsilon_{n}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the target spaces S^m and S^n\n    # The connectivity of S^k is k-1 for k > 1.\n    conn_Sm = m - 1\n    conn_Sn = n - 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the target space S^{m} is m - 1 = {m} - 1 = {conn_Sm}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the target space S^{n} is n - 1 = {n} - 1 = {conn_Sn}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the loop spaces Omega S^m and Omega S^n\n    # The connectivity of Omega S^k is (k-1)-1 = k-2.\n    conn_Omega_Sm = conn_Sm - 1\n    conn_Omega_Sn = conn_Sn - 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the loop space Omega S^{m} is conn(S^{m}) - 1 = {conn_Sm} - 1 = {conn_Omega_Sm}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the loop space Omega S^{n} is conn(S^{n}) - 1 = {conn_Sn} - 1 = {conn_Omega_Sn}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the connectivity of the evaluation maps epsilon_m and epsilon_n\n    # The formula is conn(epsilon_k) = 2 * conn(Omega S^k) + 2.\n    conn_epsilon_m = 2 * conn_Omega_Sm + 2\n    conn_epsilon_n = 2 * conn_Omega_Sn + 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the evaluation map epsilon_{m}: Sigma Omega S^{m} -> S^{m} is:\")\n    print(f\"conn(epsilon_{m}) = 2 * conn(Omega S^{m}) + 2 = 2 * {conn_Omega_Sm} + 2 = {conn_epsilon_m}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the evaluation map epsilon_{n}: Sigma Omega S^{n} -> S^{n} is:\")\n    print(f\"conn(epsilon_{n}) = 2 * conn(Omega S^{n}) + 2 = 2 * {conn_Omega_Sn} + 2 = {conn_epsilon_n}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the final connectivity using the formula for the smash product of maps\n    # conn(f1 wedge f2) = min(conn(f1) + conn(Target2) + 1, conn(f2) + conn(Target1) + 1)\n    # Here, f1 is epsilon_m and f2 is epsilon_n.\n    # Target1 is S^m, Target2 is S^n.\n    val1 = conn_epsilon_m + conn_Sn + 1\n    val2 = conn_epsilon_n + conn_Sm + 1\n    \n    print(\"The connectivity of the map is given by the formula for the smash product of maps:\")\n    print(\"conn(f) = min(conn(epsilon_m) + conn(S^n) + 1, conn(epsilon_n) + conn(S^m) + 1)\")\n    print(f\"Calculating the first term: {conn_epsilon_m} + {conn_Sn} + 1 = {val1}\")\n    print(f\"Calculating the second term: {conn_epsilon_n} + {conn_Sm} + 1 = {val2}\")\n\n    final_connectivity = min(val1, val2)\n    print(f\"\\nThe connectivity is the minimum of these two values.\")\n    print(f\"Final Connectivity = min({val1}, {val2}) = {final_connectivity}\")\n\n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_connectivity} >>>\")\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```"
