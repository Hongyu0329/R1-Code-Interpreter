print(f"Even with a high concentration of substrate, the kcat in the presence of Rga1 remains at {kcat_with_Rga1_and_high_substrate}/second.")
print("Conclusion: Since high levels of substrate do not restore enzyme activity, the inhibition is not competitive. This is characteristic of a non-competitive or irreversible inhibitor.\n")

print("- 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators': This is correct. Al1 is an activator, and Al2 is an inhibitor (kcat decreases from 500 to 150).")
print("- 'Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor': This aligns perfectly with our analysis in Step 2.")
print("- 'Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site': In the presence of both Al1 (activator) and Al2 (inhibitor), the resulting kcat is {kcat_with_Al1_and_Al2}/second. This is the same rate as with the inhibitor Al2 alone ({kcat_with_Al2}/second). This suggests that the inhibitor's effect is dominant, which is best explained by them competing for the same allosteric site.")
