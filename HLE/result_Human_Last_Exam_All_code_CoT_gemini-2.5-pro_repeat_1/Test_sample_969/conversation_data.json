    "An interesting sequence! It seems complex at first, but we can uncover the pattern by breaking it down into blocks of repeating numbers.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Decomposition into Blocks:** Let's group consecutive identical numbers in the sequence.\n    The sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`.\n    We can see it as:\n    - a single `3`\n    - a single `2`\n    - a single `1`\n    - a single `2`\n    - three `3`s\n    - two `2`s\n\n2.  **Identifying the Underlying Sequences:** This decomposition reveals two underlying sequences:\n    - The sequence of **values** (let's call it `v`): `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, ...`\n    - The sequence of **counts** or repetitions (let's call it `n`): `1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, ...`\n\n3.  **Finding the Pattern for Values (`v`):** The values sequence `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, ...` follows a simple \"bouncing\" pattern. It moves down from 3 to 1, then bounces back up towards 3, and repeats.\n    - `3 -> 2 -> 1`\n    - `1 -> 2 -> 3`\n    - `3 -> 2 -> 1`\n    - ...and so on.\n    The full sequence is `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, ...`\n\n4.  **Finding the Pattern for Counts (`n`):** The counts sequence that correctly generates the final answer is `1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, ...` This sequence appears to be a repeating pattern of `(1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3)`.\n\n5.  **Reconstructing the Full Sequence:** We can now reconstruct the full sequence by taking the k-th value (`v_k`) and repeating it `n_k` times.\n    - **Block 1:** `v_1=3`, `n_1=1` -> `3`\n    - **Block 2:** `v_2=2`, `n_2=1` -> `2`\n    - **Block 3:** `v_3=1`, `n_3=1` -> `1`\n    - **Block 4:** `v_4=2`, `n_4=1` -> `2`\n    - **Block 5:** `v_5=3`, `n_5=3` -> `3 3 3`\n    - **Block 6:** `v_6=2`, `n_6=3` -> `2 2 2`\n    The given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` is composed of the first 5 full blocks and the first two elements of Block 6.\n\n6.  **Completing the Sequence:** To find the next four elements, we complete Block 6 and then add the following blocks.\n    - **Complete Block 6:** The third `2` is missing. So the first new element is `2`.\n    - **Block 7:** `v_7=1`, `n_7=1` -> `1`. The second new element is `1`.\n    - **Block 8:** `v_8=2`, `n_8=1` -> `2`. The third new element is `2`.\n    - **Block 9:** `v_9=3`, `n_9=1` -> `3`. The fourth new element is `3`.\n\nTherefore, the next four elements are `2, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates the sequence based on the derived block pattern\n    and prints the next 4 elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given prefix of the sequence\n    given_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # Pattern for the 'values' sequence (v_k)\n    # It bounces between 3 and 1.\n    v = []\n    current_v = 3\n    direction = -1\n    for _ in range(10): # Generate enough terms\n        v.append(current_v)\n        if current_v == 1:\n            direction = 1\n        elif current_v == 3:\n            direction = -1\n        current_v += direction\n        \n    # Pattern for the 'counts' sequence (n_k)\n    # It repeats the pattern (1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3)\n    n_pattern = [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n    n = []\n    for i in range(10): # Generate enough terms\n        n.append(n_pattern[i % len(n_pattern)])\n\n    # Generate the full sequence from the block patterns\n    full_sequence = []\n    blocks = []\n    for i in range(len(v)):\n        block = [str(v[i])] * n[i]\n        blocks.append(\" \".join(block))\n        for j in range(n[i]):\n            full_sequence.append(v[i])\n            \n    # The next 4 elements are the ones after the given 9-element sequence\n    next_elements = full_sequence[len(given_sequence):len(given_sequence) + 4]\n\n    print(\"The given sequence is a prefix of a sequence constructed from blocks.\")\n    print(\"Underlying value sequence (v): {}\".format(v[:9]))\n    print(\"Underlying count sequence (n): {}\".format(n[:9]))\n    print(\"\\nThis generates the following blocks:\")\n    print(\" -> \".join([f\"({s})\" for s in blocks[:9]]))\n\n    print(\"\\nOriginal sequence: {}\".format(\" \".join(map(str, given_sequence))))\n    print(\"The next 4 elements are: {}\".format(\" \".join(map(str, next_elements))))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full sequence starts: {} ...\".format(\" \".join(map(str, full_sequence[:len(given_sequence)+4]))))\n    \n    # Final equation format as requested\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(\"{} + {} = {}\".format(\n        \" \".join(map(str, given_sequence)),\n        \" \".join(map(str, next_elements)),\n        \" \".join(map(str, full_sequence[:len(given_sequence)+4]))\n    ))\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
