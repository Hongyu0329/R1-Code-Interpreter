    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Subgroups to Group Actions:** The number of subgroups of index $n$ in a group $G$ is equal to the number of distinct transitive group actions of $G$ on a set of $n$ elements. Each such action corresponds to a homomorphism $\\phi: G \\to S_n$ with a transitive image.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Transitive Images:** For index 4, we consider homomorphisms $\\phi: G \\to S_4$. The image, $\\text{Im}(\\phi)$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ (up to conjugacy) are:\n    *   $C_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4)\n    *   $V_4$ (the Klein four-group)\n    *   $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   $A_4$ (the alternating group of order 12)\n    *   $S_4$ (the symmetric group of order 24)\n\n3.  **Eliminate Impossible Images:** We can eliminate most of these possibilities using the properties of the Grigorchuk group ($G$):\n    *   The abelianization of $G$ is $G_{ab} = G/[G,G] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group must factor through $G_{ab}$.\n    *   **Cannot be $C_4$:** The image of $G$ in $C_4$ would have to be a quotient of $G_{ab}$, which has exponent 2. Thus, the image cannot be $C_4$ (which has exponent 4).\n    *   **Cannot be $A_4$ or $S_4$:** The abelianization of $A_4$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. A homomorphism from $G$ to $A_4$ would induce a map from $G_{ab}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. The only such map is trivial, meaning the image must lie in the commutator subgroup $[A_4, A_4] = V_4$. So, $G$ cannot map onto $A_4$. Since an epimorphism to $S_4$ would imply an epimorphism to its quotient $A_4$ (via the composition $G \\to S_4 \\to A_4$, which is not possible), $S_4$ is also ruled out.\n    *   **Cannot be $D_4$:** It is a known (but non-trivial) result in the theory of branch groups that the Grigorchuk group $G$ has no epimorphism onto $D_4$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Subgroups for the Remaining Image ($V_4$):** The only possible transitive image is the Klein four-group $V_4$. A subgroup of index 4 is normal if and only if the corresponding action has $V_4$ as its image. We can count these by counting the number of epimorphisms from $G$ to $V_4$ and dividing by the size of the automorphism group of $V_4$. Since $V_4$ is abelian, this is equivalent to counting epimorphisms from $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The following Python script performs this calculation and lays out the argument.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem reduces to counting normal subgroups whose quotient is V_4,\n    # as other potential transitive images in S_4 are not possible quotients\n    # of the Grigorchuk group.\n\n    # We need to count the number of epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms)\n    # from G_ab = (Z/2Z)^3 to V_4 = (Z/2Z)^2.\n    # This is equivalent to counting surjective linear maps from the vector space F_2^3 to F_2^2.\n\n    # Let V = F_2^3 and W = F_2^2.\n    q = 2\n    dim_V = 3\n    dim_W = 2\n\n    # 1.
