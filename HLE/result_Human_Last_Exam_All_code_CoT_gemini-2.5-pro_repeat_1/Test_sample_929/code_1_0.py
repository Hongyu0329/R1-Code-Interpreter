    Analyzes different insect behavior patterns to determine which has the
    greatest positive effect on plant fitness (pollination).

    The ethogram codes are:
    1: investigation start, 2: investigation end (non-contact)
    3: interaction start, 4: interaction end (contact)
    5: feeding start, 6: feeding end (a type of interaction)

    Plant fitness is primarily driven by pollination, which occurs during feeding (5-6).

    # Choice A: 4-3 >> 6-5
    # This notation means duration of interaction (time 4 - time 3) is much greater

    # Choice B: 6-5 >> 4-3
    print("Choice B: Duration(Feeding) >> Duration(Interaction)")
    print("Feeding is a form of interaction. An insect must be in contact (interacting) to feed.")

    # Choice C: 4-3 >> 2-1
    print("Choice C: Duration(Interaction) >> Duration(Investigation)")
    print("This means insects spend a lot of time in contact with the plant compared to just investigating it from afar.")
    print("This is good, as it means the insect commits to the plant. However, a single long visit is less effective for cross-pollination than many separate, shorter visits.")

    # Choice E: n(1)/hour >> n(3)/hour
    print("Choice E: Rate(Investigation) >> Rate(Interaction)")
    print("This means many insects approach the plant (investigate) but very few actually land and make contact (interact).")

    # Choice F: n(3)/hour >> n(1)/hour
    print("Choice F: Rate(Interaction) >> Rate(Investigation)")
