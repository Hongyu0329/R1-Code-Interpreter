    """
    This function determines the smallest m for the given Diophantine set problem.

    The set A is defined for tuples (x_1, ..., x_n) where each x_i is a cube of a rational number.
    This is equivalent to: exists r_1, ..., r_n in Q such that x_i = r_i^3 for all i.
    This can be written as a system of n equations: x_i - r_i^3 = 0.
    Let the auxiliary variables y_i be these cube roots r_i. So we need n auxiliary variables.
    To combine these n equations into a single polynomial equation F=0, we use the sum of squares,
    which is 0 if and only if each term is 0 over the rational numbers.

    F(x_1,...,x_n, y_1,...,y_n) = (x_1 - y_1^3)^2 + ... + (x_n - y_n^3)^2 = 0.

    The number of auxiliary variables 'y' is n. This shows m <= n.
    The n conditions are independent, requiring n independent witnesses (the cube roots).
    Thus, we need at least n auxiliary variables. This means m >= n.
    Combining both, the smallest m is exactly n.
