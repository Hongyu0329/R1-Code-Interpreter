def find_a_for_arc_length():
    """
    Calculates the value of the constant 'a' for a given arc length problem.

    The function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the parametric equations for the astroid curve.
    2. Calculates the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt.
    3. Computes the integrand for the arc length formula.
    4. Determines the limits of integration based on the constraint 0 <= x <= a.
    5. Sets up the integral for the arc length L as a function of 'a'.
    6. Solves the integral symbolically.
    7. Equates the resulting arc length to the given length 3/2.
    8. Solves the final equation for 'a'.
    9. Prints the steps and the final equation before showing the result.
