# The problem is to evaluate the sum S = sum_{n=2 to inf} (-1)^n * S_n / n,
# where S_n is the n-th harmonic number.
# Through mathematical derivation, the exact value of the sum is found to be:
# S = (ln(2))^2 / 2 + 1 - pi^2 / 12

# We define the numbers that appear in the final formula.
num_ln = 2
power_ln = 2
denominator_ln = 2
constant_term = 1
power_pi = 2
denominator_pi = 12

# Calculate the numerical value using the derived formula.
ln_val = math.log(num_ln)
pi_val = math.pi

term1 = (ln_val ** power_ln) / denominator_ln
term2 = constant_term
term3 = (pi_val ** power_pi) / denominator_pi

result = term1 + term2 - term3

# Print the final equation with all its numbers and the calculated result.
print("The analytical formula for the sum is:")
