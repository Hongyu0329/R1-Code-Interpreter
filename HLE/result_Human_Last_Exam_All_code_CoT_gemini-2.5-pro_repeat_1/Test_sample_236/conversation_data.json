    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots**: List all knots with a crossing number of four or less.\n2.  **Identify Relevant Surgeries**: For a surgery on a knot to produce a homology 3-sphere (which are the elements of the homology cobordism group), the surgery coefficient must be an integer equal to +1 or -1.\n3.  **Analyze Each Knot's Surgery Results**: For each knot, we determine the resulting element in the homology cobordism group. We will rely on established theorems from low-dimensional topology.\n    *   Surgery on the unknot.\n    *   Surgery on the trefoil knot.\n    *   Surgery on the figure-eight knot.\n4.  **Count the Unique Elements**: Tally the number of distinct group elements obtained from the analysis.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan, explaining each step and calculating the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of unique homology cobordism group elements from surgeries on knots with at most 4 crossings.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify knots and valid surgeries\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying relevant knots and surgery types.\")\n    print(\"The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\")\n    print(\"To obtain a homology 3-sphere (an element of the group), surgery on a knot must use a coefficient of +1 or -1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze each knot\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the surgery results for each knot.\")\n\n    # Unknot (0_1)\n    print(\"\\n- For the unknot (0_1):\")\n    print(\"  Surgery with coefficients +1 or -1 on the unknot produces the standard 3-sphere, S³.\")\n    print(\"  The 3-sphere S³ is the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\")\n    identity_elements_found = 1\n    print(f\"  Unique elements found so far: {identity_elements_found}\")\n\n    # Figure-eight knot (4_1)\n    print(\"\\n- For the figure-eight knot (4_1):\")\n    print(\"  The figure-eight knot is a 'slice' knot.\")\n    print(\"  A theorem states that +1 or -1 surgery on any slice knot results in a homology sphere that is cobordant to S³.\")\n    print(\"  Therefore, surgery on the figure-eight knot also yields the identity element.\")\n    print(f\"  This does not introduce a new element.
