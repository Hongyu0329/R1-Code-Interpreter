               'explanation': 'The CD40 receptor on B cells is essential for receiving help from T cells, which is required for germinal center formation, SHM, and affinity maturation. Its knockout will severely impair the response.'},

               'explanation': 'H2-IAd is the mouse MHC Class II molecule. B cells use it to present antigens to T-helper cells. A mutation here will disrupt T-cell help, which is critical for a high-affinity antibody response.'},
