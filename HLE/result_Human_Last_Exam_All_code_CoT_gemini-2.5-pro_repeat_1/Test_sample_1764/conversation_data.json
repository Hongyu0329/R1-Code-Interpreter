    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The goal is to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space `X` into a Banach space `B`. The \"smallest possible\" implies we can choose `X` and `B` to minimize this number.\n\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** An isometric embedding is a function that preserves distances. For any given metric space `X`, it's a known mathematical result that at least one isometric embedding into some Banach space exists. Therefore, the set of embeddings is never empty, and its size must be at least 1.\n\n3.  **Find a case that achieves the lower bound:** I will construct a specific example of `X` and `B` for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n    *   **Choose the space X:** Let's pick the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: a space with a single point, let's call it `X = {p}`. The only distance is `d(p, p) = 0`. This space is ultrametric because the required inequality `d(x, z) <= max(d(x, y), d(y, z))` becomes `d(p, p) <= max(d(p, p), d(p, p))`, or `0 <= 0`, which is true.\n    *   **Choose the space B:** Let's pick the simplest possible Banach space: the trivial space `B = {0}`, which contains only the zero vector. Its norm is `||0|| = 0`, and it is a complete vector space. The cardinality `K` of this space is 1.\n    *   **Count the embeddings:** An isometric embedding is a function `f: X -> B` that preserves distance.\n        *   There is only one possible function from `X = {p}` to `B = {0}`: the function defined as `f(p) = 0`.\n        *   We need to check if this function is isometric. The condition is `||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y)` for all points in `X`. For our choice, this means `||f(p) - f(p)|| = d(p, p)`.\n        *   Substituting the values, we get `||0 - 0|| = 0`, which simplifies to `0 = 0`. This is true.\n        *   Therefore, the one and only possible function is a valid isometric embedding.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The lower bound for the number of embeddings is 1, and we have found a valid case where the number of embeddings is exactly 1. Thus, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will print this reasoning and the final calculated number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the problem.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find the minimum number of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space X to a Banach space B.\")\n    print(\"This minimum is taken over all possible choices of X and B.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the number of embeddings.\")\n    print(\"For any metric space X, an isometric embedding into some Banach space is guaranteed to exist.\")\n    print(\"This means the set of embeddings is non-empty, so the number of embeddings must be at least 1.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Construct an example to show that the number 1 is achievable.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the simplest possible spaces for X and B.\")\n    print(\" - For X, choose the single-point space: X = {p}.
