    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric encryption: Grover's algorithm.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary threat from quantum computers against symmetric-key cryptography is Grover's algorithm. Unlike Shor's algorithm, which completely breaks common asymmetric encryption (like RSA), Grover's algorithm only provides a *quadratic* speedup for searching.\n2.  **Understand the Impact:** A brute-force search for an `n`-bit key on a classical computer takes approximately 2^n operations. Grover's algorithm can perform the same search on a quantum computer in approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations.\n3.  **Define \"Secure\":** The current industry standard for strong classical security is a 128-bit security level. This means an attacker would need to perform roughly 2^128 operations to break it, which is considered computationally infeasible today and for the foreseeable future with classical computers.\n4.  **Calculate Post-Quantum Requirement:** To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, the effective key strength after the quadratic speedup must be at least 128 bits.\n    *   Let `k` be the required symmetric key length.\n    *   The effective security against a quantum computer is `k / 2`.\n    *   We want this effective security to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   So, we set up the equation: `k / 2 = 128`.\n5.  **Solve for k:** Solving for `k`, we get `k = 128 * 2 = 256`. Therefore, a 256-bit symmetric key is required to provide a security level equivalent to 128 bits of classical security.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The current standard for strong classical security is 128 bits.\nclassical_security_level = 128\n\n# Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, effectively halving the bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n# To maintain the desired security level against a quantum computer, we must double the key length.\nquantum_multiplier = 2\n\n# Calculate the required key length for post-quantum security.\npost_quantum_key_length = classical_security_level * quantum_multiplier\n\nprint(\"To achieve a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least:\")\nprint(f\"{classical_security_level} * {quantum_multiplier} = {post_quantum_key_length} bits\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"
