    # Step 1: Analyze the subject of the question: the adult male Micromalthidae.
    print("The question is about the feeding habits of an adult male of the family Micromalthidae.")

    # Step 2: State the known information about the larval stage from the problem description.
    print("Fact 1: The problem states that the larvae in the colony feed on decaying wood.")

    # Step 3: Present the key biological fact about the adult male stage.
    # Research into the life cycle of Micromalthus debilis (the sole species in the family)
    # reveals a critical detail about the adult male.
    print("Fact 2: The adult male of Micromalthidae is a rare, short-lived, non-feeding stage.")

    # Step 4: Explain the biological reason for the adult male's inability to feed.
    print("Fact 3: Adult males have vestigial, non-functional mouthparts, making them physically incapable of eating.")

    # Step 5: Formulate the conclusion based on the facts.
    # An individual in its adult male stage does not consume any food. It subsists on reserves
    # accumulated during its larval feeding stage until it dies.
    print("\nConclusion: Therefore, during its entire adult life, from emergence to death, the male will have fed on nothing.")
    
    # Step 6: Identify the correct answer choice.
    print("\nThe correct choice is 'E'.")
