    Calculates the potential energy surface for H2+ using Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF).

    UHF is used because it allows for symmetry breaking, which is essential for
    correctly describing the dissociation of H2+ into H + H+. A restricted
    method (ROHF) would incorrectly force the electron to be delocalized over
    both atoms at all distances, leading to an incorrect dissociation energy.

    Args:
        distances (list or np.array): A list of internuclear distances in Angstroms.
    
    Returns:
        A dictionary mapping distance to total energy in Hartrees.
