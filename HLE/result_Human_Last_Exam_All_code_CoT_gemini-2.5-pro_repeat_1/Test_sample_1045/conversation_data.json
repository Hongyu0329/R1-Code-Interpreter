    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom for 6-31G:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Has one valence 's' orbital. The `31G` part means this valence shell is described by two basis functions (one is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, the other is 1 primitive Gaussian). So, each H atom has **2** basis functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** A second-row element.\n        *   **Core (1s):** The `6-` part means the core electrons are described by **1** basis function (a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** The `31G` part means the valence shell is described by two sets of basis functions.\n            *   One `s` and one set of `p` (px, py, pz) functions from a contraction of 3 primitives. This is 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 functions.\n            *   One `s` and one set of `p` (px, py, pz) functions from 1 primitive. This is 1 (s) + 3 (p) = 4 functions.\n        *   Total for each C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** basis functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9  # 1s (core) + 2s' (valence) + 2p' (valence) + 2s'' (valence) + 2p'' (valence) -> 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 9\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2 # 1s' (valence) + 1s'' (valence) -> 1 + 1 = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from each element\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}):\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for {num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms = {num_carbon_atoms} * {functions_per_carbon} = {total_functions_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for {num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms = {num_hydrogen_atoms} * {functions_per_hydrogen} = {total_functions_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
