    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sum `s_n`**: The expression for `s_n` involves two sums. The second sum contains a complex-looking term, let's call it `V_k`:\n    `V_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}`.\n    For problems of this type, such expressions often simplify to a single term of the sequence.\n\n2.  **Find a Hidden Identity**: We can compute the first few terms of the sequence `a_n` and then evaluate `V_k` for small values of `k` (e.g., k=6, 7) to guess an identity.\n    *   `a_0=1, a_1=0, a_2=0, a_3=88`\n    *   `a_4 = 88a_1 + 57a_0 = 57`\n    *   `a_5 = 88a_2 + 57a_1 = 0`\n    *   `a_6 = 88a_3 + 57a_2 = 88^2`\n    *   `a_7 = 88a_4 + 57a_3 = 88(57) + 57(88) = 2*88*57`\n    *   `a_8 = 88a_5 + 57a_4 = 57^2`\n    *   `a_9 = 88a_6 + 57a_5 = 88^3`\n    *   `a_{10} = 88a_7 + 57a_6 = 3*88^2*57`\n    *   `a_{11} = 88a_8 + 57a_7 = 3*88*57^2`\n    *   `a_{13} = 88a_{10} + 57a_9 = 4*88^3*57`\n    By testing for `k=6` and `k=7`, we can verify the identity `V_k = a_{2k-1}`.\n\n3.  **Simplify `s_n`**: Substitute the identity `V_k = a_{2k-1}` into the expression for `s_n`. This will make the sum telescope.\n    `s_n = sum_{k=6 to n}(...) - sum_{k=6 to n-1}(a_{2k-1})`\n    The part of the sum involving only `a_n` terms becomes:\n    `sum_{k=6 to n}(a_{2k-3}) - sum_{k=6 to n-1}(a_{2k-1})`\n    `= (a_9 + a_{11} + ... + a_{2n-3}) - (a_{11} + a_{13} + ... + a_{2n-3})`\n    `= a_9`\n    So, the expression for `s_n` simplifies to:\n    `s_n = a_9 + sum_{k=6 to n}(2a_{k+100} + 7a_{k+51})`\n\n4.  **Analyze the Limit**: To evaluate the limit of `(ln(s_n))/n`, we need the asymptotic behavior of `a_n`. For large `n`, `a_n` is dominated by the largest root of its characteristic equation.\n    *   The characteristic equation is `r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0`.\n    *   Let `λ` be the largest positive root. Then for large `n`, `a_n ≈ C * λ^n` for some constant `C`.\n    *   The sums in `s_n` will also be dominated by the term with the largest index. The term `2 * sum(a_{k+100})` will dominate, so `s_n` will behave like `λ^(n+100)`.\n    *   `ln(s_n)` will behave like `ln(K * λ^(n+101)) ≈ ln(K) + (n+101)ln(λ)`.\n    *   The limit `lim (ln(s_n))/n` will therefore be `ln(λ)`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value**: The final step is to numerically compute `λ`, the dominant root of `r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0`, and then calculate the integer part of `10^4 * ln(λ)`. This can be done using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by finding the dominant root of the characteristic equation\n    and then calculating the final value based on the derived limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The recurrence relation is a_n = 88*a_{n-3} + 57*a_{n-4}\n    # The characteristic equation is r^4 - 88*r - 57 = 0.\n    # The coefficients of the polynomial are [1, 0, 0, -88, -57].\n    coeffs = [1, 0, 0, -88, -57]\n    \n    # Find the roots of the polynomial.\n    roots = np.roots(coeffs)\n    \n    # The limit lim_{n->inf} ln(s_n)/n simplifies to ln(lambda), where lambda\n    # is the dominant (largest in magnitude) root of the characteristic equation.\n    # We are interested in the largest positive real root which dictates the growth of the sequence.\n    dominant_root = 0\n    for r in roots:\n        # We are looking for the positive real root.\n        if np.isreal(r) and r > 0:\n            real_r = np.real(r)\n            if real_r > dominant_root:\n                dominant_root = real_r\n                \n    lambda_val = dominant_root\n    \n    # The problem asks for the integer part of 10^4 * lim (ln(s_n)/n)\n    # which is floor(10^4 * ln(lambda)).\n    limit_val = math.log(lambda_val)\n    \n    # The expression to be calculated\n    final_value_float = 10000 * limit_val\n    \n    # The integer part of the result\n    final_answer = int(final_value_float)\n    \n    print(f\"The characteristic equation is r^4 - 88*r - 57 = 0.\")\n    print(f\"The dominant root (lambda) is approximately: {lambda_val}\")\n    print(f\"The limit lim_{{n->inf}} ln(s_n)/n is ln(lambda), which is approximately: {limit_val}\")\n    print(f\"The value to find is the integer part of 10000 * ln(lambda).\")\n    print(f\"10000 * {limit_val:.8f} = {final_value_float:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"The integer part is: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<15365>>>"
