    This function solves the three-part trivia question about Nabokov's "Pale Fire".

    # Part (A): The Sherlock Holmes allusion
    # The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where a horse's
    # tracks are disguised. This corresponds to option 7.
    answer_A = 7

    # Part (C): Nabokov's prior work
    # The work that best fits the description of "intricate back-referencing"
    # and served as a model/parody for Pale Fire's structure is his
    # monumental annotated translation of "Eugene Onegin". This is option 7.
    answer_C = 7

    # Part (B): Thematic resonance and the sum constraint
    # The sum of the three numbers must be a multiple of 8.
    # A + B + C = 7 + B + 7 = 14 + B.
    # The smallest multiple of 8 greater than 14 is 16.
    # 14 + B = 16  => B = 2.
    # Option 2 is "freedom, as often symbolized by the lepidoptera". This is a plausible
    # theme, connecting the faked tracks (a bid for freedom) and the idea of
    # metamorphosis (butterfly symbolism).
    answer_B = 2

    # Print the final answer in the required format.
    # The final equation is 7 + 2 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
