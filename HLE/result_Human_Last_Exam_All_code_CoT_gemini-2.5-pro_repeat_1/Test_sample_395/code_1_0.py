# The analysis reveals a specific structure for the union of sets to meet the given conditions.
# This structure consists of:
# 1. A single element that is common to all 'n' sets.
# 2. For each set, the remaining 'k-1' elements are unique to that set and do not appear in any other set.

# Number of elements in each set that are not the common element
unique_elements_per_set = k - lambda_val

# Total number of unique elements across all 'n' sets
total_unique_elements = n * unique_elements_per_set

# The total size of the union is the sum of all unique elements plus the one common element.
