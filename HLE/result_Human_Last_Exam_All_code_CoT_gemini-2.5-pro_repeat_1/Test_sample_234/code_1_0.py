def solve_properties_of_S():
    """
    Analyzes the seven properties for the set S and prints the count of
    properties that must always be true.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  The definition of the function f and the set S are analyzed.
        - f's property: For each x in R^n, there exists an epsilon > 0 such that
          for all y with ||x-y|| < epsilon, ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||x-y||.
        - S's definition: x is in S if there exists an epsilon > 0 such that for
          all y, z in the ball B(x, epsilon), ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||y-z||.

    2.  Each of the seven properties is evaluated.
        - Open: This is always true. If x is in S, f is an isometry on B(x, e).
          For any y in B(x, e), f is also an isometry on the smaller ball
          B(y, e - ||x-y||), so y is in S. Thus, S is open.

        - Closed: Not always true. For n=1, the function f(x) = |x| yields
          S = R \\ {0}, which is not closed.

        - Connected: Not always true. For n=1, f(x) = |x| gives S = R \\ {0}, which
          is not connected.

        - Compact: Not always true. S is not always closed, so it's not always
          compact. Also, f(x) = x gives S = R^n, which is unbounded.

        - Dense: This is always true. We can show that the complement of S has an
          empty interior. If the complement S^c contained an open ball U, the
          property of f on U would imply that f is an isometry on U (for n>=2 by a
          theorem of Li, for n=1 by showing f'(x) is constant). This would mean
          U is in S, a contradiction.

        - Connected complement: Not always true. For n=1, the function
          f(x) = min(|x+1|, |x-1|) yields S = R \\ {-1, 0, 1}. The complement
          S^c = {-1, 0, 1} is not connected.

        - Trivial first singular homology group: This is always true. For n>=2,
          the argument for denseness implies S = R^n, and H_1(R^n) = 0. For n=1,
          S is an open set in R and thus a disjoint union of open intervals.
          The first homology group of such a set is trivial.

    3.  The number of properties that are always true is counted.
