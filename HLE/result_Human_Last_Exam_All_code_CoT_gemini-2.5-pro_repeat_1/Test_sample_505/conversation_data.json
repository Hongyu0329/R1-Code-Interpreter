    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to understand the relationship between the topology of a surface code and the number of logical qubits it can support.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Formula:** For a single, planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits (`k`) it can encode is equal to the number of holes (`h`) within it. The formula is `k = h`. This is because each hole introduces a pair of non-trivial loops around which logical operators can be defined, effectively adding a logical qubit.\n2.  **Calculate Qubits per Patch:** The problem states each patch has two holes. Using the formula from step 1, we can calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch.\n3.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** The problem specifies two separate patches of surface code. Since these patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** A Python script will be written to perform this calculation and print out each step of the logic.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of logical qubits for a given number of\n    surface code patches, each with a specified number of holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of independent surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes created in each patch\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a single planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits\n    # it can encode is equal to the number of holes.\n    # Formula: k = h\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches.\n    # Since they are identical, we multiply.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    print(\"--- Calculation Breakdown ---\")\n    print(f\"Number of surface code patches: {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Number of holes per patch: {holes_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"Based on the formula k=h (logical qubits = holes), the logical qubits per patch is: {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = (Number of patches) * (Logical qubits per patch)\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {num_patches} * {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    print(f\"At most, {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits can be encoded.\")\n\ncalculate_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
