    explanation = """
The core problem is that for any given birth-death model with time-varying speciation λ(t) and extinction μ(t), there is an infinite number of alternative rate functions that produce the exact same likelihood on a phylogeny of only extant species. This is a fundamental non-identifiability issue because the information about extinct lineages is lost.

To mitigate this, a strategy must either:
1.  Add new information to the model (e.g., from fossils or priors).
2.  Reframe the question to focus on parameter combinations that are identifiable.

Let's evaluate the options based on these criteria:

*   **B, D, F (Adding Information):** Incorporating prior information (B) or fossil data (D, F) adds external constraints or direct evidence of past lineages. This new information helps to distinguish between different rate scenarios. Therefore, these strategies **do help**.

*   **E, G (Re-parameterizing):** The pulled diversification rate (E) and pulled speciation rate (G) are combinations of λ(t) and μ(t) that have been shown to be identifiable from extant phylogenies alone. By focusing the inference on these specific quantities, these strategies cleverly circumvent the problem. Therefore, they **do help**.

*   **A, C (Parameterizing the Problematic Rates):** Fitting a model with piecewise constant rates (A) or piecewise polynomials (C) are simply methods for describing the very functions, λ(t) and μ(t), that are non-identifiable. These strategies do not add new information or reframe the question. Instead, they create a flexible model where the non-identifiability is guaranteed to be an issue.

*   **Comparing A and C:** Both A and C are strategies that do not help. However, option C, which suggests using polynomials of degree 5, represents a particularly problematic approach. This creates an extremely flexible model with a huge number of parameters. This high flexibility exacerbates the identifiability issue by making it even easier for the model to find many different combinations of rate functions that fit the data equally well. It is the antithesis of a strategy to mitigate the problem; it actively makes inference more difficult.

Therefore, fitting a birth-death model with pieces defined by high-degree polynomials is the strategy that does NOT help.
