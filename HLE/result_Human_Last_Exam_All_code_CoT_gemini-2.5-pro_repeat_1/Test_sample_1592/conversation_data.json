    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the location of Waskaganish**: I'll find the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for Waskaganish, Quebec.\n2.  **Identify neighboring provinces/territories**: The main candidates are Ontario (to the west and south) and Nunavut (the islands in James Bay to the northwest). Newfoundland and Labrador is significantly farther to the east.\n3.  **Find coordinates for the closest points**: I will determine the coordinates for the closest point of land in both Ontario and Nunavut to Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Ontario**, this will be the point on the Ontario-Quebec border where it meets the coast of James Bay.\n    *   For **Nunavut**, this will be the southeasternmost point of Akimiski Island, which lies within James Bay.\n4.  **Calculate the distances**: Using the Haversine formula (a standard way to calculate distance on a sphere), I will calculate the distance from Waskaganish to the pre-determined points in Ontario and Nunavut.\n5.  **Compare and conclude**: I will compare the two calculated distances to find the minimum, which will identify the closest province or territory. The final output will be the name of that province or territory.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat/2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon/2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.asin(math.sqrt(a))\n    # Radius of earth in kilometers.
