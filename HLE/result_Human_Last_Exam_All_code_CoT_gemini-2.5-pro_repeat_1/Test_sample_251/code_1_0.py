# The problem asks for the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specific Lagrangian
# submanifold in the complex 4-dimensional projective space (CP^4).
# This Lagrangian is obtained by twice applying the Biran lift operation, starting from
# a Chekanov torus in CP^2.

# Step 1: The initial number of disks.
# For the Chekanov torus in CP^2, the number of Maslov 2 disks is known to be 5.
n_2 = 5

# Step 2: Calculate the number of disks after the first lift.
# The first lift is from CP^2 to CP^3. The recurrence relation is n_k = k * n_{k-1}.
# For this step, k=3.
factor_for_cp3 = 3
n_3 = factor_for_cp3 * n_2

# Step 3: Calculate the number of disks after the second lift.
# The second lift is from CP^3 to CP^4. For this step, k=4.
factor_for_cp4 = 4
n_4 = factor_for_cp4 * n_3

# Step 4: Display the final calculation.
# The question requires showing each number in the final equation.
# The final number n_4 is calculated as factor_for_cp4 * n_3, which is
# factor_for_cp4 * (factor_for_cp3 * n_2).
