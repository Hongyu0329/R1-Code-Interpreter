    "For a p-electron coupled with its spin, we need to find the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and its z-component, $J_z$. Since $[J^2, J_z] = 0$, they share a common set of eigenstates, denoted by $|j, m_j\\rangle$.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and as it is a fermion, its spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, are given by the rules of angular momentum addition. Specifically, `j` can take values from `|l-s|` to `l+s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j):** For each allowed value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take `2j+1` values, ranging from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps. Each pair of `(j, m_j)` defines a unique common eigenstate.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator acting on the state $|j, m_j\\rangle$ is `j(j+1)` (in units of ħ²).\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator acting on the state $|j, m_j\\rangle$ is `m_j` (in units of ħ).\n5.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script that systematically calculates all possible `j` and `m_j` values and then computes and prints the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ for each state. The `fractions` module will be used for clear and exact representation of the half-integer values.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1.\n# The spin angular momentum quantum number for an electron is s = 1/2.\nl = 1\ns = Fraction(1, 2)\n\nprint(f\"Solving for common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron (l={l}, s={s}).\")\nprint(\"Eigenvalues are given in units of ħ=1.\\n\")\n\n# The total angular momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\nj_min = abs(l - s)\nj_max = l + s\n\nj_values = []\ncurrent_j = j_min\nwhile current_j <= j_max:\n    j_values.append(current_j)\n    current_j += 1\n\nprint(f\"The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j) are: {', '.join(map(str, j_values))}\\n\")\nprint(\"The common eigenvalues are found for each common eigenstate |j, m_j>.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Store the eigenvalue pairs for the final answer\neigenvalue_pairs = []\n\n# For each j, find the eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z.\nfor j in j_values:\n    # The eigenvalue of J^2 is j*(j+1)\n    j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n    \n    # The magnetic quantum number m_j can take values from -j to +j in steps of 1.\n    m_j_values = []\n    current_m_j = -j\n    while current_m_j <= j:\n        m_j_values.append(current_m_j)\n        current_m_j += 1\n    \n    print(f\"For the subspace with j = {j}:\")\n    \n    # The eigenvalue of J^2 is the same for all states with the same j.\n    # The prompt requires showing the numbers in the equation.\n    print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1) = {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j_squared_eigenvalue}\")\n    \n    print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {', '.join(map(str, m_j_values))}\")\n    print(\"  The corresponding common eigenvalue pairs (J^2, J_z) are:\")\n    \n    for m_j in m_j_values:\n        # The eigenvalue of J_z is m_j\n        j_z_eigenvalue = m_j\n        print(f\"    For state |j={j}, m_j={m_j}>:\\t({j_squared_eigenvalue}, {j_z_eigenvalue})\")\n        eigenvalue_pairs.append((j_squared_eigenvalue, j_z_eigenvalue))\n        \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n```\n<<<The eigenvalue pairs for (J^2, J_z) are: (15/4, 3/2), (15/4, 1/2), (15/4, -1/2), (15/4, -3/2), (3/4, 1/2), (3/4, -1/2)>>>"
