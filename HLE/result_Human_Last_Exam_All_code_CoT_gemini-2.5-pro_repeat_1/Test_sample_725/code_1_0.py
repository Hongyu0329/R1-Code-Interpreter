# The relationship between orbital overlap and covalency is direct.
# Covalency is a measure of electron sharing, which is facilitated by the overlap of atomic orbitals.
# A greater degree of orbital overlap results in a stronger covalent interaction.

# Information provided:
# Overlap in CeF6(2-) > Overlap in CeCl6(2-)

# Conclusion:
# Covalency of CeF6(2-) > Covalency of CeCl6(2-)

conclusion = "Stronger"

print(f"Given the higher orbital overlap, CeF6(2-) would display {conclusion} covalency compared to CeCl6(2-).")
