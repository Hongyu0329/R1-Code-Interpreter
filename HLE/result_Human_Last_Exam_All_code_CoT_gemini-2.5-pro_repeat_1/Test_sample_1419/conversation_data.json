    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions, presented as a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** I will start by writing down the one-loop renormalization group (RG) beta function, $\\beta(u)$, for the dimensionless coupling constant $u$ in $\\phi^4$ theory. This function describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. The calculation is done near four dimensions, so we use the parameter $\\epsilon = 4 - d$, where $d$ is the number of spacetime dimensions.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point, denoted as $u^*$, represents a scale-invariant point in the theory. This occurs when the coupling constant stops changing with the energy scale, which mathematically means the beta function is equal to zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** I will solve the algebraic equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ for the non-trivial fixed point $u^*$. This will yield the famous Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  **Present the Final Expression:** The Python script will print out each step of this derivation and display the final expression for $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling u*\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: State the Beta Function\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Beta Function\")\n    print(\"In quantum field theory, the renormalization group (RG) beta function, β(u), describes the running of the coupling constant u with the energy scale.\")\n    print(\"For the ϕ^4 theory in d = 4 - ε dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling u is:\")\n    print(\"\\n  β(u) = -ε * u + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u² + O(u³)\\n\")\n    print(\"Here, ε = 4 - d is a small positive parameter.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: The Fixed Point Condition\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Fixed Point Condition\")\n    print(\"A fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant.\")\n    print(\"This occurs when the beta function is zero:\")\n    print(\"\\n  β(u*) = 0\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: Solving for the Fixed Point\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Solving the Equation\")\n    print(\"We set the beta function to zero to find the fixed points:\")\n    print(\"\\n  -ε * u* + (3 / (16 * π²)) * (u*)² = 0\\n\")\n    print(\"This equation can be factored:\")\n    print(\"\\n  u* * [-ε + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u*] = 0\\n\")\n    print(\"This gives two solutions:\")\n    print(\"1. u* = 0.
