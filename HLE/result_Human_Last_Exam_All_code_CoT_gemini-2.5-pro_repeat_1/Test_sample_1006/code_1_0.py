def solve_homeomorphism_problem():
    """
    This function determines the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
    with the given properties.

    The properties are:
    1. X is a compact topological space.
    2. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R.
    3. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    These properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification
    of the long ray R, denoted as βR.

    A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a
    Tychonoff space (like the long ray R) is unique up to homeomorphism.

    This means that any space X satisfying the given conditions must be homeomorphic
    to βR. Consequently, all such spaces belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    Therefore, there is only one such class.
