    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Polynomial:** The first step is to understand the structure of the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. I will attempt to factor it over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group:** Once the polynomial is factored, say $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$, the splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its factors. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ can be determined from the Galois groups of the factors. This involves identifying the Galois group for each irreducible factor and then determining if the full group is their direct product. To do this, I'll check if the splitting fields of the factors have a trivial intersection (i.e., only $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n3.  **Apply Galois Theory:** The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a correspondence between subfields of $K$ and subgroups of $G$. Specifically, a subfield extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translates to finding all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$.\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups:** I will identify all normal subgroups of the determined Galois group $G$. The structure of $G$ as a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ will simplify this task. The normal subgroups of such a product are not always just products of normal subgroups of $G_1$ and $G_2$; I must also account for any \"diagonal\" subgroups that arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n5.  **Calculate Degrees:** For each proper, non-trivial normal subgroup $H$ found, the degree of the corresponding normal field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of $H$ in $G$, which is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$.\n6.  **Code the Solution:** Finally, I will write a Python script that implements the calculation of these degrees based on the group-theoretic properties identified in the previous steps. The script will output the final list of possible degrees.\n\n```python\ndef solve_galois_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds all possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q\n    for the splitting field K of the polynomial f(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6,\n    such that Q is a proper subfield of L and L is a proper subfield of K.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the polynomial and determine its Galois group.\n    # The polynomial f(x) factors over Q as:\n    # f(x) = (x^2 - 2) * (x^5 - 9x + 3)\n    # Let g(x) = x^2 - 2 and h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3.\n    \n    # The Galois group of g(x) over Q is the cyclic group of order 2, C_2.\n    # Its splitting field is K_g = Q(sqrt(2)).\n    order_G1 = 2\n    \n    # The Galois group of h(x) over Q is the symmetric group on 5 elements, S_5.\n    # This is because h(x) is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion for p=3,\n    # and it can be shown to have exactly 3 real roots, which for a quintic implies the Galois group is S_5.\n    # Its splitting field is K_h.\n    order_G2 = 120  # 5!\n    \n    # The full Galois group G = Gal(K/Q) is the direct product G1 x G2,\n    # because the intersection of the splitting fields K_g and K_h is Q.\n    # This holds because K_g = Q(sqrt(2)) is a real field, while the only quadratic subfield\n    # of K_h is Q(sqrt(D)), where D is the discriminant of h(x).
