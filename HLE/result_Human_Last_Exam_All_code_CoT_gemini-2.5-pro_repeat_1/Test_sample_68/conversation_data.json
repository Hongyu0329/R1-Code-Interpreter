    "To determine the size of the smallest algebraic structure for coloring the figure-eight knot, we need to understand the principles of knot coloring.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce Knot Coloring:** A knot can be colored with a set of `n` colors (represented by integers {0, 1, ..., n-1}) if at every crossing, the colors of the three intersecting arcs satisfy a specific rule. If the over-crossing arc has color `c`, and the two under-crossing arcs have colors `a` and `b`, the rule is `2*c â‰¡ a + b (mod n)`. A coloring is considered non-trivial if it uses at least two different colors.\n2.  **Connect to Knot Theory:** The smallest integer `n > 1` for which a non-trivial coloring exists is a fundamental property of the knot, known as the knot's determinant. For the figure-eight knot (the simplest non-trivial knot after the trefoil), its determinant is 5.\n3.  **The Algebraic Structure:** This means the smallest set of colors we can use is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, which has 5 elements. This set, along with the coloring operation, forms an algebraic structure called a dihedral quandle of order 5.\n4.  **Demonstrate with Code:** I will write a Python script to find a valid, non-trivial 5-coloring for the figure-eight knot. The script will:\n    *   Define the four crossings of the figure-eight knot as four distinct equations.\n    *   Iterate through possible color assignments for the four arcs of the knot using the 5 colors.\n    *   Check each assignment against the four crossing equations.\n    *   Once a valid, non-trivial coloring is found, the script will print the coloring and verify the equations for each crossing.\n    *   Finally, it will state the number of elements in the coloring set, which is 5.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the smallest number of colors needed for a non-trivial\n    coloring of the figure-eight knot and demonstrates a valid coloring.\n\n    The figure-eight knot has 4 arcs and 4 crossings. We can label the arcs\n    x1, x2, x3, and x4. The coloring rules at each crossing can be represented\n    by a system of linear congruences. For the standard figure-eight knot diagram,\n    these equations are:\n    1. 2*x1 - x2 - x4 = 0 (mod n)\n    2. 2*x3 - x1 - x4 = 0 (mod n)\n    3. 2*x4 - x2 - x3 = 0 (mod n)\n    4. 2*x2 - x1 - x3 = 0 (mod n)\n\n    A knot is n-colorable if its determinant divides n. The determinant of the\n    figure-eight knot is 5. Therefore, the smallest n > 1 for a non-trivial\n    coloring is 5.\n\n    This script will search for a valid 5-coloring to prove this.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    num_arcs = 4\n    colors = range(n)\n\n    print(f\"Searching for a non-trivial {n}-coloring of the figure-eight knot...\")\n\n    # Generate all possible color assignments for the 4 arcs\n    for coloring in itertools.product(colors, repeat=num_arcs):\n        x1, x2, x3, x4 = coloring\n\n        # A trivial coloring uses only one color.
