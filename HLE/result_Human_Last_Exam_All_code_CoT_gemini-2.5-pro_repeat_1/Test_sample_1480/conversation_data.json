    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy set, we need to combine the membership grades of the inputs in the antecedent part of the rule using a t-norm operation. The t-norm acts as a fuzzy 'AND' operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The user has provided two values: `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j)=0.9`. While `Phi_k(x′)` often represents the final activation level itself and `μG_k_j(y_j)` is a membership in the consequent (output) set, a common interpretation for such questions is to treat both given values as membership grades of the inputs in the antecedent part of the rule.\n2.  I will assume the two antecedent membership grades are `μ_A(x) = 0.7` and `μ_B(y) = 0.9`.\n3.  The most common t-norm used in fuzzy logic is the minimum operator (`min`). I will use this t-norm to calculate the rule activation level.\n4.  The rule activation level will be `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the resulting equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given membership values from the antecedent of the rule.\n# We interpret the provided values, 0.7 and 0.9, as the membership grades to be combined.\nmu1 = 0.7\nmu2 = 0.9\n\n# Step 2: Apply the t-norm operation.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which we will use here.\n# This represents the fuzzy 'AND' operation.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(mu1, mu2)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\n# The output shows the operation performed and its result.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is the t-norm of the antecedent membership values.\")\nprint(f\"Using the minimum t-norm: min({mu1}, {mu2}) = {activation_level}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
