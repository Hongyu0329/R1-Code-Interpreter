    Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement:

    Statement 1: There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.
    Analysis: The problem explicitly states that the phenotype has "no bearing on fitness" and that "all genotypes have equal fitness". These are the definitions of no natural selection acting on the trait.
    Conclusion: Statement 1 MUST be true.

    Statement 2: Parents will not raise their offspring.
    Analysis: The problem states that generations are "discrete and non-overlapping." This is a modeling assumption about population-level reproduction timing (the parent generation dies before the offspring generation reproduces). It does not strictly forbid all forms of parental care. For instance, a parent could provision or guard its eggs/juveniles and then die before they reach reproductive age. This would be a form of raising offspring that is compatible with non-overlapping generations.
    Conclusion: Statement 2 does not necessarily have to be true.

    Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations.
    Analysis: The conditions given (no mutation, no selection, no drift, no gene flow) describe a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is not evolving. However, the statement makes a claim about all future generations ("never"). The problem does not state that these idealized conditions will hold indefinitely. Evolutionary forces like mutation could arise, or a geographic barrier could appear in the future, potentially leading to speciation.
    Conclusion: Statement 3 does not necessarily have to be true.

    Statement 4: The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.
    Analysis: The population mates randomly across the entire region (panmixia), which ensures that the genetic makeup (allele and genotype frequencies) is uniform throughout. However, the phenotype is a product of both genotype (G) and environment (E). The broad-sense heritability of 0.7 (HÂ² = Vg / Vp) implies that 30% of the total phenotypic variance is due to environmental variance (Ve). The problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the entire region. It is possible for a systematic environmental difference to exist between the west and east halves (e.g., a rainfall gradient). Such an environmental difference could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype between the two groups, even if their genetic makeup is identical.
    Conclusion: Statement 4 does not necessarily have to be true.

    Final Conclusion:
    Based on the analysis, only Statement 1 is a necessary consequence of the information provided.
