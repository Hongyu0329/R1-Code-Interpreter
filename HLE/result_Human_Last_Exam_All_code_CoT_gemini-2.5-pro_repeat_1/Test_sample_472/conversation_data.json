    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to scan the Latin line:\n\nFirst, I will identify the meter of the line. The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from Plautus's play *Trinummus* and is an example of an **Iambic Senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet (`S L`). However, in the conversational style of Plautine comedy, this base pattern is highly flexible, allowing for substitutions and resolutions.\n\nNext, I will determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable. This is based on vowel length, diphthongs, and the consonants that follow (the rule of \"position\"). A key feature of Plautine scansion is the frequent use of **elision** (omitting a vowel at the end of a word when the next word starts with a vowel) to make the line fit the meter. In this specific line, a double elision occurs to reduce the syllable count from 15 to 13:\n1.  `bene esse` becomes `benesse` (the final `-e` of `bene` is elided).\n2.  `tibi bene` becomes `tib' bene` (the final `-i` of `tibi` is elided).\nCombined, `tibi bene esse` is pronounced `tib' benesse`.\n\nWith a 13-syllable line, we must have five two-syllable feet and one three-syllable \"resolved\" foot. I will then group the syllables into six feet, identifying each foot's type (e.g., Iamb, Spondee, Trochee, Bacchius). The final syllable of the line is treated as long under the principle of *brevis in longo*.\n\nFinally, I will write a simple Python script to print the resulting sequence of 'L' for long syllables and 'S' for short syllables, with a space between each of the six feet.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the provided Latin line and prints the result.\n    The line is an Iambic Senarius from Plautus.\n    Line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n    Scansion Breakdown:\n    - The line is scanned as 13 syllables after two elisions: `tibi bene` -> `tib'` and `bene esse` -> `benesse`.\n    - The resulting line for scanning is: \"et tib' benesse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n    Foot 1: et tib' -> L S (Trochee)\n    Foot 2: be-nes-se -> S L L (Bacchius, a resolved spondee)\n    Foot 3: so-li -> L L (Spondee)\n    Foot 4: quom si -> L S (Trochee)\n    Foot 5: -bi sit -> S L (Iamb)\n    Foot 6: ma-le -> S L (Iamb, due to 'brevis in longo')\n    \"\"\"\n    foot1 = \"L S\"\n    foot2 = \"S L L\"\n    foot3 = \"L L\"\n    foot4 = \"L S\"\n    foot5 = \"S L\"\n    foot6 = \"S L\"\n    \n    # Print the scansion with a space between each foot\n    print(foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4, foot5, foot6)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S S L L L L L S S L S L>>>"
