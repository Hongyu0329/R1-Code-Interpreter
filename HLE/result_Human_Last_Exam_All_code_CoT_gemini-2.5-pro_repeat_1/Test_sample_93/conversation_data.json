    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: We need to find the number of unique ordered tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method**: A direct brute-force search is a practical method for this problem, given the constraints. We will iterate through possible values for the first four variables ($x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$) and for each combination, we will determine if a valid integer $x_5$ exists.\n\n3.  **Optimize the Search**: To make the computation efficient, we can limit the search space. The value of any single variable $x_i$ cannot be greater than $\\sqrt{2024}$, which is approximately 44.9. So, $0 \\le x_i \\le 44$. We can further optimize by reducing the loop bounds dynamically. For example, after choosing a value for $x_1$, the loop for $x_2$ only needs to go up to $\\sqrt{2024 - x_1^2}$.\n\n4.  **Implement the Algorithm**:\n    *   Initialize a counter for the number of solutions to zero.\n    *   Create five nested loops, one for each variable. Or, more efficiently, four nested loops for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.\n    *   In the innermost part of the loops, calculate the remaining value needed for $x_5^2$: `remainder = 2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)`.\n    *   Check if this `remainder` is a perfect square. A simple way is to compute its integer square root and see if squaring it gives back the `remainder`.\n    *   If it is a perfect square, it means we have found a valid integer solution tuple. We then increment our counter.\n\n5.  **Format the Output**: The final code will print the equation itself, an example of one solution found, and the total count of all solutions to provide a complete answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    count = 0\n    first_solution = None\n\n    limit = math.isqrt(target)\n\n    # Use nested loops to iterate through possible values for x1, x2, x3, x4.\n    # The loops are optimized by reducing the upper bound at each level.\n    for x1 in range(limit + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        rem1 = target - s1\n        limit2 = math.isqrt(rem1)\n        for x2 in range(limit2 + 1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            rem2 = rem1 - s2\n            limit3 = math.isqrt(rem2)\n            for x3 in range(limit3 + 1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                rem3 = rem2 - s3\n                limit4 = math.isqrt(rem3)\n                for x4 in range(limit4 + 1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    rem4 = rem3 - s4\n                    \n                    # Check if the remainder is a perfect square for x5^2\n                    x5 = math.isqrt(rem4)\n                    if x5 * x5 == rem4:\n                        count += 1\n                        if first_solution is None:\n                            first_solution = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n\n    print(\"The Diophantine equation is:\")\n    print(\"x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\\n\")\n    \n    if first_solution:\n        print(\"Here is an example of one solution found:\")\n        x = first_solution\n        print(f\"{x[0]}^2 + {x[1]}^2 + {x[2]}^2 + {x[3]}^2 + {x[4]}^2 = \"\n              f\"{x[0]**2} + {x[1]**2} + {x[2]**2} + {x[3]**2} + {x[4]**2} = {target}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The total number of non-negative integer solutions is:\")\n    print(count)\n\nsolve_diophantine_equation()\n<<<4080>>>"
