    "My plan is to explain the fundamental principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and determine the minimum number of gratings needed based on the dimensionality of the problem.\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** The objective is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube, which has two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (λ), from a single 2D image captured by a sensor.\n2.  **Explain the CTIS Method:** CTIS achieves this by using a diffraction grating to project the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. The grating creates multiple, overlapping, spectrally-dispersed images (called diffraction orders). These multiple orders serve as the different \"views\" or \"projections\" required for a tomographic reconstruction, similar to how a medical CT scanner takes X-rays from multiple angles.\n3.  **Analyze the Dimensionality:**\n    *   A single, one-dimensional (1D) diffraction grating disperses light along only one axis. This creates a series of projections (e.g., 0th order, +/-1st orders, +/-2nd orders) in a line. This is insufficient because it only provides tomographic information along one spatial axis, leaving the other unresolved. It cannot uniquely reconstruct the full 3D (x, y, λ) data cube.\n    *   To fully capture the information, we need to disperse the light relative to both spatial axes (x and y). This requires a second 1D grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first. This combination (often fabricated as a single physical component called a 2D grating) creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor.\n4.  **Conclude:** The 2D grid of projections provides views from multiple, linearly independent angles, which is the minimum requirement for tomographically reconstructing the 3D data cube. Therefore, two fundamental gratings (or dispersion axes) are necessary.\n\nThe python code below will outline this logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the minimum number of diffraction\n    gratings for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of spatial dimensions in a standard image.\n    num_spatial_dimensions = 2  # These are the 'x' and 'y' axes.\n\n    # The number of spectral dimensions we want to resolve.\n    num_spectral_dimensions = 1 # This is the wavelength 'lambda'.\n\n    print(\"--- Determining Minimum Gratings for CTIS ---\")\n    print(f\"Goal: Reconstruct a 3D data cube from a 2D image.\")\n    print(f\"The data cube has {num_spatial_dimensions} spatial dimensions and {num_spectral_dimensions} spectral dimension.\")\n    print(\"\\nPrinciple of CTIS:\")\n    print(\"A diffraction grating disperses light, creating multiple 'projections' of the scene on a 2D sensor.\")\n    print(\"These projections are used to tomographically reconstruct the full data cube.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"To reconstruct a 3D volume, tomographic methods require projections from multiple, independent angles.\")\n    print(\"A single 1D grating only disperses light along one axis.
