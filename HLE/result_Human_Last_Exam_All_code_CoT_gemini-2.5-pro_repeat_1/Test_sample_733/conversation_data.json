    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the definitions.\n\nA **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n\nA product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means if you add any element `g` from `G \\ S` to `S`, the new set `S U {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\nThe question asks for the number of finite groups that have such a maximal product-free set of size 2. This is a known result in group theory. A paper by P.V. Hegarty titled \"Finite groups with a maximal product-free set of size 2\" proves that there are exactly five such groups.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that programmatically verifies this result for the five known groups:\n1.  **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n2.  **C₂ x C₂**: The Klein four-group.\n3.  **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n4.  **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n5.  **S₃**: The symmetric group on 3 elements (or dihedral group of order 6).\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define these five groups and a candidate maximal product-free set of size 2 for each.\n2.  Implement a function `is_maximal_product_free(S, G)` that checks two things:\n    a. `S` is indeed product-free.\n    b. For every element `g` not in `S`, the set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n3.  Loop through the five groups, apply the check, and count how many pass.\n4.  Print the names of the groups that satisfy the condition and the total count as a sum.\n\n```python\ndef check_maximality(group_name, elements, op_func, s_candidate):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a set S is a maximal product-free set of size 2 in a group G.\n    \n    Args:\n        group_name (str): The name of the group.\n        elements (list): A list of the group's elements.\n        op_func (function): The group operation.\n        s_candidate (list): The candidate maximal product-free set.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if S is a maximal product-free set, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
