    "Here is my plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Dates:** I will find the start and end years of the war from established StarCraft lore. The war began in the year 2504 with the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign and concluded in 2506 at the end of the *Legacy of the Void* campaign.\n2.  **Calculate Duration:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration.\n3.  **Round Up:** As requested, I will round the result up to the nearest whole year. Since the duration is a whole number, this will not change the value, but I will use the `math.ceil()` function to adhere to the instruction.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in 2504\n# and concluded in 2506.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round up the duration as requested\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the equation\nprint(f\"End Year - Start Year = Duration\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"\\nThe Second Great War lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
