    "To answer your question, I will create a Python script that identifies and prints the name of the protein involved in macrophage engulfment of amyloid upon its breakdown.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the key biological process described: Macrophages (or microglia in the brain) engulfing amyloid plaques.\n2.  Access my knowledge base to find the specific protein that, when broken down or cleaved, acts as a \"tag\" on the amyloid, signaling for it to be engulfed.\n3.  This process involves the complement system. The central protein in this system is Complement component 3 (C3).\n4.  When C3 is cleaved, its fragments (like iC3b) coat the amyloid plaques.\n5.  Macrophages/microglia have receptors (like CR3) that recognize these fragments, triggering phagocytosis (engulfment).\n6.  The Python script will store the name of this protein in a variable and then print it out in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the protein that, when broken down, facilitates\n    macrophage/microglial engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein is part of the complement system, a component of the innate immune system.\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    \n    # The breakdown of C3 into fragments like iC3b opsonizes (tags) amyloid plaques,\n    # signaling for macrophages and microglia to engulf them.\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is: {protein_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
