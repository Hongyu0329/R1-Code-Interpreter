    # The problem is a classic Minecraft resource-gathering puzzle in a constrained environment.
    # The key is to find a resource that can be obtained from mobs and crafted into a block
    # using only the 2x2 inventory crafting grid, as there is no wood to make a crafting table.

    # Step 1: Analyze obtainable resources.
    # The only renewable resources are mob drops. Witches are a key mob here.
    # Witches can drop several items, including glowstone dust and redstone dust.
    # Skeletons drop bones, which can be crafted into bonemeal.

    # Step 2: Analyze block crafting recipes.
    # - Bone Block: Requires 9 bonemeal in a 3x3 grid. Impossible without a crafting table.
    # - Redstone Block: Requires 9 redstone dust in a 3x3 grid. Impossible without a crafting table.
    # - Glowstone Block: Requires 4 glowstone dust in a 2x2 grid. This IS possible!

    # Conclusion: The first block that can be obtained is a Glowstone Block.
    # The player must kill witches until they collect 4 glowstone dust.

    print("The first block that must be obtained is the Glowstone Block.")
    print("This is possible because it can be crafted in the 2x2 inventory grid, unlike other potential blocks from mob drops.")
    print("\nThe process is to defeat Witches until at least 4 Glowstone Dust items are collected.")
    print("\nThe final crafting equation is:")

    # Define the variables for the crafting equation
    input_item_count = 4
    input_item_name = "Glowstone Dust"
    output_item_count = 1
    output_item_name = "Glowstone Block"

    # Print the equation, showing each number as requested.
    print(f"{input_item_count} {input_item_name} -> {output_item_count} {output_item_name}")
