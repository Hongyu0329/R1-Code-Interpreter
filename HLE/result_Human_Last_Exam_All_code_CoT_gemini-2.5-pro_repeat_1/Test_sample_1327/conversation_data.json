    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence**: The user has provided the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, and wants to find the next number.\n\n2.  **Look for a Simple Pattern**:\n    *   **Arithmetic Progression (adding a constant)**: The differences between terms are `11 - 2 = 9`, `23 - 11 = 12`, `51 - 23 = 28`, `119 - 51 = 68`. The differences are not constant, so it's not a simple arithmetic sequence.\n    *   **Geometric Progression (multiplying by a constant)**: The ratios are `11/2 = 5.5`, `23/11 â‰ˆ 2.09`. The ratio is not constant.\n\n3.  **Look for a More Complex Pattern**: Let's test relationships involving multiplication and addition/subtraction, like `a_n = k * a_(n-1) +/- c`.\n    *   Let's try `k=2`:\n        *   `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n        *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n        *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n        *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n        The added numbers are `[7, 1, 5, 17]`. This sequence doesn't have an obvious pattern.\n    *   Let's try `k=3`:\n        *   `11 = 3 * 2 + 5` (The operation is addition)\n        *   `23 = 3 * 11 - 10` (The operation is subtraction)\n        *   `51 = 3 * 23 - 18` (The operation is subtraction)\n        *   `119 = 3 * 51 - 34` (The operation is subtraction)\n\n4.  **Identify the Underlying Rule**: A consistent pattern emerges with `k=3`. After the first term, the operation is always subtraction. Let's analyze the sequence of numbers being subtracted: `c = [10, 18, 34]`.\n    *   Find the pattern in `c`. Let's look at the differences between its terms.\n    *   `18 - 10 = 8`\n    *   `34 - 18 = 16`\n    *   The differences `[8, 16]` form a clear geometric progression, where each difference is double the previous one.\n\n5.  **Predict the Next Term**:\n    *   The next difference in the `c` sequence should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   The next number to be subtracted (`c_next`) is the last one (`34`) plus this new difference (`32`), which is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n    *   Now, apply the main rule to find the next term in the original sequence: `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - c_next`.\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `a_6 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\n6.  **Construct the Code**: The Python code will replicate this logic to calculate and display the final answer, showing each step of the pattern recognition.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-level pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the sequence:\", s)\n    print(\"Let's test the pattern a_n = 3 * a_(n-1) +/- constant.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Establish the pattern for each term\n    # Term 2: 11 = 3 * 2 + 5\n    print(f\"Equation for the 2nd term: {s[1]} = 3 * {s[0]} + 5\")\n    \n    # Term 3: 23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n    c1 = 10\n    print(f\"Equation for the 3rd term: {s[2]} = 3 * {s[1]} - {c1}\")\n\n    # Term 4: 51 = 3 * 23 - 18\n    c2 = 18\n    print(f\"Equation for the 4th term: {s[3]} = 3 * {s[2]} - {c2}\")\n\n    # Term 5: 119 = 3 * 51 - 34\n    c3 = 34\n    print(f\"Equation for the 5th term: {s[4]} = 3 * {s[3]} - {c3}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Analyze the sequence of subtracted numbers: c = [10, 18, 34]\n    print(\"The sequence of subtracted numbers is [10, 18, 34, ...]\")\n    \n    # Find the pattern in the differences of c\n    diff1 = c2 - c1\n    diff2 = c3 - c2\n    print(f\"The differences in this sequence are {c2}-{c1}={diff1} and {c3}-{c2}={diff2}.\")\n    print(\"This is a geometric progression where the difference doubles each time (8, 16, ...).\")\n\n    # Predict the next difference\n    next_diff = diff2 * 2\n    print(f\"The next difference will be {diff2} * 2 = {next_diff}.\")\n    \n    # Predict the next number to be subtracted\n    c_next = c3 + next_diff\n    print(f\"The next number to subtract will be {c3} + {next_diff} = {c_next}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the final answer\n    last_term = s[-1]\n    next_term_in_sequence = 3 * last_term - c_next\n    \n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"Next Term = 3 * {last_term} - {c_next} = {next_term_in_sequence}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
