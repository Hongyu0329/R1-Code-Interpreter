    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324. The notation for this is \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nA direct computation for permutations of length 333 is infeasible. However, for problems of this type, the value often stabilizes for \\(n\\) greater than some small integer. A known result from the paper \"Counting 1324-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions\" by Martinez and Diz states that \\(av_n^3(1324) = 14\\) for all \\(n \\ge 6\\).\n\nWhile there appear to be some inconsistencies in the examples listed in that paper, the numerical result is likely correct, possibly derived from a computer algebra system. The stabilization occurs because a permutation with a small, fixed number of inversions involves only a few elements being out of their \"natural\" sorted order. If \\(n\\) is large enough, the remaining elements are fixed points that are too far away to form a pattern with the out-of-order elements.\n\nI will write a Python script to verify this result by computing \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) for small values of \\(n\\) (specifically, from n=4 to n=9). If the value stabilizes at 14 for \\(n \\ge 6\\), we can confidently conclude this is the answer for \\(n=333\\).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Create a function to generate all permutations of length `n` with exactly `k` inversions. This can be done recursively. A permutation of length `n` is formed by taking a permutation of length `n-1` and inserting the element `n`. Inserting `n` at position `j` (from the right, 0-indexed) adds `j` inversions.\n2.  Create a function to check if a given permutation contains the `1324` pattern. This involves finding four indices `a < b < c < d` such that `p[a] < p[c] < p[b] < p[d]`.\n3.  Iterate through `n` from 4 to 9, generate all permutations with 3 inversions, and count how many of them avoid the `1324` pattern.\n4.  Observe if the count stabilizes, and if so, use that value as the answer for n=333.\n5.  Finally, print the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(1324), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n\n    with k inversions.
