    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the function $f(a,b,c)$. It is defined by a linear recurrence relation. By using a generating function $F(x,y,z) = \\sum_{a,b,c} f(a,b,c) x^a y^b z^c$, I can find a closed-form expression for $f(a,b,c)$. The recurrence leads to $F(x,y,z) = \\frac{1}{1-x-y^2-z^3}$. The coefficient of $x^a y^b z^c$ in this expansion, which is $f(a,b,c)$, can be shown to be the multinomial coefficient $\\frac{(a+b/2+c/3)!}{a!(b/2)!(c/3)!}$, but only if $b$ is an even integer and $c$ is a multiple of 3. Otherwise, $f(a,b,c)=0$.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the arguments $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$. The goal is to calculate $f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod{p}$. I will first check if $\\beta_p$ is even and $\\gamma_p$ is a multiple of 3. Then, I will use Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients, which requires the base-$p$ expansion of the arguments of the coefficient. I will determine the base-$p$ digits for $A = \\alpha_p$, $B = \\beta_p/2$, and $C = \\gamma_p/3$.\n3.  The structure of $\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p$ provides a repeating pattern for these base-$p$ digits. Applying Lucas's Theorem, the problem simplifies to computing a product of smaller, repeating multinomial coefficients.\n4.  This product can be expressed as a power of a constant value, $X$. The exponent will be related to $p$.\n5.  Using Euler's criterion for modular exponentiation and properties of the Legendre symbol, I will simplify this expression to find the final result modulo $p$.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the numerical calculations and print the final equation showing the values involved, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_f_mod_p():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p for p = 2^127 - 1.\n\n    The detailed mathematical derivation shows that the problem simplifies as follows:\n    1. f(a,b,c) is a multinomial coefficient: C(a + b/2 + c/3, a, b/2, c/3).\n    2. We let A = alpha_p, B = beta_p/2, C = gamma_p/3. It turns out that A=C.\n    3. We need to compute C(2A+B, A, B, A) mod p.\n    4. Using Lucas's Theorem, this reduces to a product of smaller multinomial coefficients\n       based on the base-p digits of A and B.\n    5. The base-p digits of A are a repeating sequence of (1, 3, 4).\n       The base-p digits of B are a repeating sequence of (4, 2, 2).\n    6. The product becomes (T0 * T1 * T2)^((3p+1)/2) mod p, where:\n       T0 = C(6, 1, 4, 1), T1 = C(8, 3, 2, 3), T2 = C(10, 4, 2, 4).\n    7.
