    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze Symptoms and Correlate to Nerves
    # The patient presents with a collection of symptoms pointing to multiple cranial nerve palsies.
    
    # Symptom 1: Left-sided facial weakness (cannot lift eyebrow).
    # Correlation: This indicates a lesion of the Facial Nerve (CN VII), which controls the muscles of facial expression.
    
    # Symptom 2: Loss of acoustic reflex in the left ear.
    # Correlation: The stapedius muscle, which dampens the acoustic reflex, is innervated by the Facial Nerve (CN VII). This finding reinforces the diagnosis of a CN VII lesion.
    
    # Symptom 3: Hoarseness and cough.
    # Correlation: These symptoms point to paralysis of the laryngeal muscles, which control the vocal cords. These muscles are primarily innervated by the Vagus Nerve (CN X), specifically its recurrent laryngeal branch.
    
    # Symptom 4: Small mass in the thoracic cavity.
    # Correlation: This is a key finding. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve (a branch of the Vagus nerve) travels down into the thorax and loops under the aortic arch before ascending to the larynx. A thoracic mass can easily compress this nerve, causing the hoarseness and cough.
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate Anatomical Choices
    print("Evaluating the answer choices based on the patient's presentation:\n")

    # Choice A: Tensor tympani
    print("A. Tensor tympani: This muscle is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN V). While involved in the acoustic reflex, the patient's other signs (facial weakness) strongly point to the facial nerve (CN VII) and its stapedius muscle branch being the cause of the reflex loss. So, this is less likely to be the primary structure of importance.")

    # Choice B: Lateral rectus
    print("B. Lateral rectus: This eye muscle is innervated by the abducens nerve (CN VI) and is not related to the patient's symptoms.")

    # Choice C: Intercostal muscles
    print("C. Intercostal muscles: These are innervated by thoracic spinal nerves and are involved in respiration. They do not explain the patient's facial or vocal symptoms.")

    # Choice D: Cricothyroid
    print("D. Cricothyroid: This is an intrinsic muscle of the larynx, innervated by a branch of the Vagus Nerve (CN X). Its function is critical for controlling the pitch of the voice. The patient's hoarseness is a cardinal symptom directly resulting from laryngeal muscle dysfunction due to Vagus nerve pathology. The thoracic mass provides a clear cause for this nerve damage. Therefore, the cricothyroid represents the affected end-organ system responsible for a key symptom.")

    # Choice E: Stylopharyngeus
    print("E. Stylopharyngeus: This muscle is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and is primarily involved in swallowing, not voice production.")
    
    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion: The patient's hoarseness is a major symptom directly explained by the thoracic mass affecting the Vagus nerve (CN X). This leads to paralysis of laryngeal muscles. Of the options provided, the cricothyroid is the only laryngeal muscle listed, making it the most important anatomical structure to consider in relation to the patient's primary complaints.")
