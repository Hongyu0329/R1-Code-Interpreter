    This function calculates the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers with no nontrivial convergent sequences.
    
    Let τ be a totally bounded group topology on the integers Z.
    A key property of such topologies on Z is that for any open neighborhood U of 0, there exists a non-zero integer n such that the subgroup nZ = {..., -2n, -n, 0, n, 2n, ...} is contained in U.

    The condition "no nontrivial convergent sequences" means that any sequence that converges to 0 must be eventually 0. A sequence (x_k) is nontrivial if it is not eventually 0.

    Let's consider the sequence x_k = k! (k-factorial) for k = 1, 2, 3, ...
    This sequence is nontrivial because k! is never 0 for k >= 1.

    Now, let's check if this sequence converges to 0 in any totally bounded group topology τ on Z.
    To converge to 0, for any open neighborhood U of 0, the sequence must eventually be in U.
    As established, for any U, there is an n >= 1 such that nZ is a subset of U.
    We need to check if x_k is eventually in nZ. This means we need to check if n divides x_k = k! for k large enough.

    By the definition of the factorial, for any k >= n, k! = 1 * 2 * ... * n * ... * k, which is a multiple of n.
    So, for k >= n, x_k is in nZ. Since nZ is a subset of U, x_k is in U for all k >= n.
    This means the sequence x_k = k! converges to 0.

    We have found a nontrivial sequence (k!) that converges to 0 in ANY totally bounded group topology on the integers.
    This contradicts the requirement that the topology has no nontrivial convergent sequences.
    Therefore, no such topology exists.
