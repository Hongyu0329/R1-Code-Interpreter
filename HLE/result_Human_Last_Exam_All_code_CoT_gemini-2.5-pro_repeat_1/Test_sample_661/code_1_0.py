    """
    This function prints the rules added by the Knuth-Bendix completion.

    The solution is derived based on the reasoning that the original problem
    is ill-posed due to a non-orientable rule. A likely typo in the
    precedence is assumed (f < h < g instead of f < g < h) to make the
    problem solvable. The listed rules are the result of the completion
    algorithm under this assumption.
