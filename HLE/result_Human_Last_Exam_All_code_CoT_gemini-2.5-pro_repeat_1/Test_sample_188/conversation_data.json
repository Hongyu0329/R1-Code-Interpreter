  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: This is an information theory problem. We need to determine how many characters can be encoded by a given number of symbols.\n2.  **Determine the Alphabet Sizes**:\n    *   The \"encoding alphabet\" comes from the Ching's symbols. There are two \"yinyang\" states (yin, yang) and five \"wuxing\" elements (e.g., water, fire). The total number of unique symbols is 2 * 5 = 10.\n    *   The \"message alphabet\" consists of the characters from the Shu, of which there are 120 unique types.\n3.  **Calculate Codeword Length**: I need to find the minimum number of symbols from the Ching (let's call this length `L`) required to uniquely represent each of the 120 characters from the Shu. This can be found by solving the inequality `10^L >= 120`.\n4.  **Calculate Maximum Message Length**: The Ching book provides a total of 9999 symbols. The maximum length of the message is the total number of symbols available divided by the number of symbols required per character (`L`).\n5.  **Ignore Irrelevant Data**: The information about the Shu's total character count (~3000), the computer vision recognition time (12 ms), and the computation time for operations (10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors and not needed for the calculation.\n6.  **Construct the Final Code**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the steps and the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_message_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible length of a secret message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of symbols available in the Ching book.\n    total_symbols = 9999\n\n    # Determine the number of unique symbols that can be used for encoding.\n    # There are 2 yinyang states (yin, yang) and 5 wuxing elements.\n    yinyang_states = 2\n    wuxing_elements = 5\n    unique_encoding_symbols = yinyang_states * wuxing_elements\n\n    # The number of unique characters the message can be written in.\n    num_unique_characters = 120\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the parameters of the encoding problem.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of symbols available in the Ching is {total_symbols}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of unique encoding symbols is {yinyang_states} (yinyang) * {wuxing_elements} (wuxing) = {unique_encoding_symbols}.\")\n    print(f\"The message is composed of a set of {num_unique_characters} unique characters.\\n\")\n\n    # Determine the number of symbols from the Ching required to represent\n    # one character from the Shu.
