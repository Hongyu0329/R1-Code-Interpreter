    "The Gauss class number problem, specifically counting the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number, is a significant challenge in computational number theory. The results are not typically calculated on-the-fly due to their complexity. Instead, they rely on extensive computations that have been performed by mathematicians and subsequently tabulated. The most comprehensive results for class numbers up to 100 were published by Mark Watkins.\n\nMy plan is to provide the known, correct answer through a Python script. The script will:\n1.  Store a pre-computed list of the counts of negative fundamental discriminants for various class numbers in a dictionary. This data is sourced from established mathematical research (Watkins's work, referenced in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A006203).\n2.  Query this dictionary for the class number specified in the problem, which is 48.\n3.  Print the resulting count in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\nThis method leverages existing mathematical knowledge to provide an accurate answer within a practical coding framework.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number\n    by looking up the value from a pre-computed table.\n    \n    The Gauss class number problem is computationally intensive.
