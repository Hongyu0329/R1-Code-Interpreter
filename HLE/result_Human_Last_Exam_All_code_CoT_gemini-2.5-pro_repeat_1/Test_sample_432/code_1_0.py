    This function determines which of the given infinite sets have the same
    cardinality as the interval [0, 1].

    The cardinality of [0, 1] is c, the cardinality of the continuum (c = 2^ℵ₀).

    We analyze each set:
    A. (0, 1): |(0, 1)| = c. Correct.
    B. N: |N| = ℵ₀. Incorrect.
    C. Q: |Q| = ℵ₀. Incorrect.
    D. R: |R| = c. Correct.
    E. R \ Q (Irrationals): |R \ Q| = c. Correct.
    F. C (Complex numbers): |C| = |R^2| = c^2 = c. Correct.
    G. H (Quaternions): |H| = |R^4| = c^4 = c. Correct.
    H. {x: c'(x) = 0}: Countable union of open intervals, cardinality ℵ₀ * c = c. Correct.
    I. Set of strings: Countable union of finite sets, cardinality ℵ₀. Incorrect.
    J. R^N: |R^N| = c^ℵ₀ = c. Correct.
    K. Z^N: |Z^N| = ℵ₀^ℵ₀ = c. Correct.
    L. N x N: |N x N| = ℵ₀ * ℵ₀ = ℵ₀. Incorrect.
    M. R x R: |R x R| = c * c = c. Correct.
    N. 2^N: |2^N| = 2^ℵ₀ = c. Correct.
    O. 2^Q: |2^Q| = 2^ℵ₀ = c. Correct.
    P. 2^C: |2^C| = 2^c. Incorrect.
    Q. 2^(2^Z): |2^(2^Z)| = 2^(2^ℵ₀) = 2^c. Incorrect.

    The correct options are A, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O.
    In alphabetical order without delimiters, the answer is 'ADEFGHJKMNO'.
