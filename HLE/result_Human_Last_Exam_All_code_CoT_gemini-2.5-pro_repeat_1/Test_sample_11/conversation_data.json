    "To identify the first statute in the modern State of Israel that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith,\" I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  Acknowledge that the principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev*) is a cornerstone of modern Israeli law, but it was not part of the English common law that Israel inherited in 1948.\n2.  Research the wave of original Israeli legislation in the 1960s and 1970s that aimed to create an independent civil code. This is when the concept was statutorily introduced.\n3.  Examine key laws from that period, such as the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973), the Sale Law (1968), and the Bailees Law (1967).\n4.  Compare these statutes to determine which one was enacted first and contained the explicit term \"good faith.\"\n5.  While the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 is famous for making \"good faith\" a general principle, earlier laws introduced it for specific contexts. The Bailees Law of 1967 predates the others and explicitly mentions the duty to act in good faith in its text (Section 1(b)).\n6.  Therefore, the Bailees Law is the correct answer. I will provide the name of the statute as requested, without the definite article \"the\" or the year.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n# that explicitly introduced the concept of \"good faith\".\n\nstatute_name = \"Bailees Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Bailees Law>>>"
