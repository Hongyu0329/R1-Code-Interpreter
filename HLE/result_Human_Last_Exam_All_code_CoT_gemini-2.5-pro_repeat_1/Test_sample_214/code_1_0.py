# The problem is to find the number of open sets in the specified topological space.
# Based on the argument in the text, the number of open sets is given by the formula 2^(|S|-1) + 1.
# S = {1, 2, ..., 150}, so |S| = 150.
# The number of open sets is 2^(150-1) + 1 = 2^149 + 1.

n = 150
# We calculate 2^(n-1) + 1
# Since the number is very large, we represent it as a calculation.
# We will print the components of the equation that leads to the final number.

base = 2
exponent = n - 1
plus_one = 1

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is result = base^exponent + plus_one

# We won't compute the full number as it is astronomically large,
# but we will print the expression.
print(f"The number of open sets is calculated by the expression: {base}^{exponent} + {plus_one}")

# Python can handle large integers, so we can compute the result.
result = pow(base, exponent) + plus_one
print(f"The result is: {result}")
