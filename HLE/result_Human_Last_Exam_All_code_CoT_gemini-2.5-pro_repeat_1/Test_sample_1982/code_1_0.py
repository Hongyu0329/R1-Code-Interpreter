    Solves the control problem to find the value of u1.

    # Step 1: Define the given constants.
    # c1 is given in the problem statement.
    c1 = 10**4

    # The problem asks for the control u1. From the matrix equation:
    # [x11 + x21, x12 + x22] = [1 + c1*u1, 0]
    # [x21,       x22      ]   [0,           1 + c2*u2]
    #
    # From the element (2,1), we get x21 = 0.
    # Substituting this into the element (1,1) equation:
    # x11 + 0 = 1 + c1*u1  =>  x11 = 1 + c1*u1
    # Rearranging for u1 gives: u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1

    # Step 2: Determine the value of x11 from the given expressions for l1 and alpha1.
    # l1 = (1 + 10^5)^5
    # alpha1 = (1 + 10^5)^6 * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10)
    #
    # We can simplify alpha1 by recognizing the sum of cubes pattern:
    # a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) * (a^2 - ab + b^2)
    # Let a = 1 and b = 10^5.
    # (1 + 10^5) * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10) = 1^3 + (10^5)^3 = 1 + 10^15
    #
    # So, alpha1 can be rewritten as:
    # alpha1 = (1 + 10^5)^5 * [(1 + 10^5) * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10)]
    # alpha1 = l1 * (1 + 10^15)
    #
    # From this relationship, the most logical inference is that x11 = alpha1 / l1.
    x11 = 1 + 10**15

    # Step 3: Calculate u1 using the derived formula and values.
    # u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1
    numerator = x11 - 1
    u1 = numerator / c1

    # Step 4: Print the final equation with all numbers included.
    print(f"The formula for the control u1 is derived from the matrix equation as:")
    print(f"u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1")
    print(f"\nSubstituting the determined and given values:")
    # Using format() for large integers to avoid scientific notation and ensure clarity.
    print(f"u1 = ({x11:d} - 1) / {c1:d}")
    print(f"u1 = {numerator:d} / {c1:d}")
    print(f"u1 = {int(u1):d}")
