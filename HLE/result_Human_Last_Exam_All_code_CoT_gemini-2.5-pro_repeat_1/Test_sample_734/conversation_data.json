    "The theologian who first developed a systematic framework and specialized terminology to account for such events was Augustine of Hippo. He introduced the concept of *rationes seminales*, or \"seminal reasons.\"\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Explain Augustine's Concept:** Briefly define *rationes seminales*. Augustine proposed that God embedded latent potentialities (\"seeds\" or \"reasons\") into creation from the very beginning. The regular, observable laws of nature represent the normal unfolding of these seeds.\n2.  **Apply to the Virgin Birth:** A miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature itself, but the activation by God of a specific *ratio seminalis* that lies outside the usual, everyday course of nature. The potential for it was there from the start, just not in the ordinary chain of cause and effect.\n3.  **Apply to the Fall:** The changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of physical death, thorns, and thistles) can be understood as a shift in which *rationes seminales* were allowed to manifest. The potential for decay and hardship was part of the created order, but it was actualized as a consequence of sin, altering the state of nature.\n\nThis framework allows for changes in the *expression* of natural laws without suggesting that God is acting against His own created order.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
