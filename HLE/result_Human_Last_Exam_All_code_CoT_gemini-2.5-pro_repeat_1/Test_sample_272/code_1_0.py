    # (1) What is the cohomological dimension of H?
    # The cohomological dimension of a group over Z, cd_Z(H), is finite if and only if
    # the group is torsion-free. The group H = C2 * C2 contains elements of order 2
    # (its generators a and b). Therefore, H has torsion.
    # Thus, its cohomological dimension is infinite.
    ans1 = math.inf

    # (2) What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # The group G = H * H contains H as a subgroup. Since H has torsion, G also has
    # torsion. Therefore, the cohomological dimension of G is also infinite.

    # (3) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # The virtual cohomological dimension (vcd) is the minimum cohomological dimension
    # of any finite-index subgroup. H = D_infty has a subgroup K = <ab>, which is
    # isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z and has index 2 in H.
    # The group Z is torsion-free and its cohomological dimension is 1.
    # Therefore, vcd(H) = cd(Z) = 1.

    # (4) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G is the free product of four copies of C2: G = C2 * C2 * C2 * C2.
    # There is a surjective homomorphism phi: G -> C2 which sends each generator of C2 to
    # the non-trivial element. The kernel of this map is a subgroup of index 2.
    # This kernel is known to be a free group of rank 4-1=3, i.e., F_3.
    # A free group is torsion-free, and the cohomological dimension of F_n is 1.
    # So, G has a finite-index subgroup F_3 with cd(F_3) = 1.
    # Thus, vcd(G) = 1.

    # (5) How many ends does H have?
    # A group has 2 ends if and only if it has an infinite cyclic subgroup (Z) of finite index.
    # As established in (3), H has an index-2 subgroup isomorphic to Z.
    # Therefore, H has 2 ends.

    # (6) How many ends does G have?
    # By Stallings' theorem on the ends of groups, a free product A * B has infinitely
    # many ends, unless both A and B have order 2.
    # G = H * H, and H is an infinite group, so its order is not 2.
    # Therefore, G has infinitely many ends.

    # (7) What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the pro-p completion of G, where p is an odd prime.
    # P is the inverse limit of the finite p-quotients of G.
    # Let q: G -> Q be a homomorphism to a finite p-group Q.
    # The generators of G all have order 2. Their images under q must have order dividing 2.
    # But elements in a p-group have order that is a power of p.
    # Since p is odd, the only order dividing both 2 and p^k is 1.
    # So, all generators of G must be mapped to the identity element in Q.
    # This means any p-quotient Q is the trivial group.
    # Thus, the pro-p completion P is the trivial group {1}.
    # The cohomological dimension of the trivial group is 0.
    ans7 = 0
    answers.append(ans7)

    # (8) What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # Since P is the trivial group, its only subgroup is itself (with index 1).
    # The virtual cohomological dimension is therefore the same as its cohomological dimension.
    # vcd_p(P) = cd_p(P) = 0.

    # (9) What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p) as an F_p-vector space?
    # The first cohomology group H^1(G, F_p) is isomorphic to the group of homomorphisms
    # Hom(G, F_p). Since F_p is abelian, this is Hom(G_ab, F_p), where G_ab is the
    # abelianization of G.
    # G_ab = (H * H)_ab = H_ab x H_ab = (C2 x C2) x (C2 x C2) = C_2^4.
    # A homomorphism phi: C_2^4 -> F_p must satisfy 2*phi(x) = 0 for all x in C_2^4.
    # Since p is an odd prime, 2 is invertible in the field F_p.
    # So, 2*phi(x)=0 implies phi(x)=0.
    # The only homomorphism is the trivial one. The space Hom(C_2^4, F_p) is the zero vector space.
    # The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.
