    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the 2D crystallographic point groups that have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of its symmetry operations. The point groups of order 2 are:\n    *   Group **'2'** (also C₂ in Schönflies notation): Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   Group **'m'** (also D₁ or Cₛ in Schönflies notation): Contains the identity and a reflection.\n2.  Next, I need to know which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to these point groups.\n3.  I will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will:\n    a. Create a data structure (a dictionary) that maps each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its point group using standard Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n    b. Identify and count the wallpaper groups whose point group is either '2' or 'm'.\n    c. Print a detailed breakdown, showing which wallpaper groups belong to each point group of order 2, and then display the final calculation as an equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mapping of the 17 wallpaper groups to their respective point groups\n    # using Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n    wallpaper_groups_map = {\n        'p1': '1',\n        'p2': '2',\n        'pm': 'm',\n        'pg': 'm',\n        'cm': 'm',\n        'p2mm': '2mm',\n        'p2mg': '2mm',\n        'p2gg': '2mm',\n        'c2mm': '2mm',\n        'p4': '4',\n        'p4mm': '4mm',\n        'p4gm': '4mm',\n        'p3': '3',\n        'p3m1': '3m',\n        'p31m': '3m',\n        'p6': '6',\n        'p6mm': '6mm'\n    }\n\n    # The point groups of order 2 are '2' and 'm'.\n    point_groups_order_2 = ['2', 'm']\n\n    # A dictionary to store the lists of wallpaper groups for each point group of order 2.\n    result = {pg: [] for pg in point_groups_order_2}\n\n    # Iterate through all wallpaper groups and categorize them.\n    for group, point_group in wallpaper_groups_map.items():\n        if point_group in point_groups_order_2:\n            result[point_group].append(group)\n\n    print(\"Finding the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    total_count = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # Print the breakdown for each point group of order 2.\n    for point_group, groups in result.items():\n        count = len(groups)\n        print(f\"Point group '{point_group}' has {count} wallpaper group(s): {', '.join(groups)}\")\n        total_count += count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    # Print the final equation and the total count.\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"The total number is the sum of these counts.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {final_equation} = {total_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
