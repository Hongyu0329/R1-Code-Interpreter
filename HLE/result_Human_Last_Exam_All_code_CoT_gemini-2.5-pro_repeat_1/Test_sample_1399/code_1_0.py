    # Based on the manual trace:
    # - Level 1: not x1 (Decision)
    # - Level 2: x3 (Decision)
    # - Level 3: x2 (Decision)
    # - Propagation at L3:

    #   - not x4@3 (from C2, not x2, not x3)
    #   - not x6@3 (from C4, x4, not x5)

    #   - not x7@3 (from C5, x6)
    # Conflict on x7 at Level 3.

    # 3. Conflict Analysis (1UIP)
    # The conflict is between the implications for x7 and not x7.
    # Antecedent of x7: C1 (x1 \/ x6 \/ x7)
    # Antecedent of not x7: C5 (x6 \/ not x7)
    # We resolve these two clauses on the conflict variable x7.

    # from the conflict level (3). The assignment for x1 was at level 1.
    
    # 4. Identify UIPs and First UIP
    # The single literal from the conflict level is x6. The assignment was not x6.
    # Therefore, the First UIP is not x6 at level 3.
    # For this problem, we are asked for the UIPs found, and the 1UIP scheme finds one.

    # 6. Determine Backtracking Level
    # The learned clause is (x1 \/ x6).
    # The decision level for x1 (via not x1) is 1.
    # The decision level for x6 (via not x6) is 3.
    # The levels are {1, 3}. The second-highest level is 1.
