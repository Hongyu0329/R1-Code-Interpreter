def solve_chemistry_problem():
    """
    This script solves the chemistry problem by identifying the small byproduct of the given reaction.

    The reaction involves two molecules:
    Molecule 1: COC1=CC=CCC1 (1-methoxy-1,3-cyclohexadiene)
    Molecule 2: C#Cc1c(F)cccc1[N+](=O)[O-] ((2-fluoro-6-nitrophenyl)acetylene)

    1.  Reaction Type: This is a cycloaddition reaction between a diene (Molecule 1) and a
        dienophile (Molecule 2). The reaction is driven to completion by the formation of a
        stable final product with "two aromatic rings".

    2.  Aromatization: To form the second aromatic ring, the initial reaction product must
        undergo an elimination reaction. Given the presence of the methoxy group (CH3O-) on
        the diene, a common and chemically favorable pathway to aromatize the newly formed ring
        is through the elimination of methanol (CH3OH).

    3.  Byproduct Identification: This pathway produces a single, small byproduct, methanol,
        which perfectly matches the description in the problem.

    4.  Byproduct Formula: The chemical formula for methanol is CH4O.

    5.  IUPAC Name: The IUPAC name for CH4O is Methanol.
