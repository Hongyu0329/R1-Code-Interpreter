def solve_hopf_algebra_action():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Hopf algebra action problem.
    
    The problem is solved step-by-step:
    (a) The term 'symmetric' is ambiguous. Under common interpretations, the given conditions are not sufficient to prove the property. Thus, the answer is No.
    (b) We substitute j=2, r=1_R, and q=-1 into the formula. The q-binomial coefficient (2 choose 1 at q=-1) is 0, which simplifies the sum.
    (c) We substitute j=3, r=1_R, and assume q=-1 from part (b). The condition that w is central allows factoring w^3 out. We compute the coefficients for each term in the sum.
    
    The final answer is formatted as a single string and printed.

    # For part (b), the formula is:
    # x^2 a . 1_R = C_0 * w^2(g^0 a . 1_R)w^0 + C_1 * w^1(g^1 a . 1_R)w^1 + C_2 * w^0(g^2 a . 1_R)w^2
    # For q=-1: C_0=1, C_1=0, C_2=-1.
    # Result: w^2(a . 1_R) - (g^2 a . 1_R)w^2

    # For part (c), the formula simplifies due to w being central:
    # x^3 a . 1_R = w^3 * [C'_0(g^0 a . 1_R) + C'_1(g^1 a . 1_R) + C'_2(g^2 a . 1_R) + C'_3(g^3 a . 1_R)]
    # For q=-1: C'_0=1, C'_1=-1, C'_2=-1, C'_3=1.
    # Result: w^3 * [ (a.1_R) - (ga.1_R) - (g^2a.1_R) + (g^3a.1_R) ]
