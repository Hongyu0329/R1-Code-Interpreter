    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script to count the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. We need to find the total number of such walks with exactly 10 steps, starting from an origin point.\n2.  Since there is no simple closed-form formula for this, the most direct approach is to computationally enumerate and count all possible valid walks.\n3.  I will implement a recursive backtracking algorithm. This algorithm will build walks step by step. It will keep track of the points already visited in the current path. If a potential next step leads to a point that has already been visited, that branch of the search is pruned.\n4.  The core of the solution will be a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited)`. This function will calculate the number of valid walk extensions from the current point `(x, y)` with `steps_left` more steps to take, given the set of `visited` points.\n5.  The recursion's base case is when `steps_left` reaches 0, which signifies that a complete 10-step walk has been found. In this case, it returns 1.\n6.  To improve efficiency, I'll use a symmetry argument. The total number of walks is simply 4 times the number of walks that begin with a specific first move (e.g., to the right). This is due to the 90-degree rotational symmetry of the square lattice. This optimization reduces the total computation significantly.\n7.  The final script will initialize the walk after the first step and call the recursive function to count the remaining 9 steps. The result is then multiplied by 4 to get the total count for `a(10)`.\n\n```python\ndef count_walks(x, y, steps_left, visited):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks of a given length\n    from a starting point (x, y), avoiding points in the 'visited' set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: If there are no steps left, we have found one valid walk.\n    if steps_left == 0:\n        return 1\n\n    count = 0\n    # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n    moves = [(x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1)]\n\n    # Explore each possible move.\n    for next_x, next_y in moves:\n        # If the next point has not been visited yet...\n        if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n            # ...add it to the visited set and recurse.\n            visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n            count += count_walks(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1, visited)\n            # Backtrack: remove the point to allow other paths to visit it.\n            visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n            \n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n\n    # Due to the symmetry of the lattice, we can calculate the number of walks\n    # starting with a single direction (e.g., right) and multiply the result by 4.\n    # The walk starts at (0,0).
