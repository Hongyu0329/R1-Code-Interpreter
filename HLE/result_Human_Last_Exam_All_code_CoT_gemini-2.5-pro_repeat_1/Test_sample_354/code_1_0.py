    Analyzes Alan Bryman's theory of Disneyization to determine the correct answer
    from a list of choices.
    """
    explanation = """Alan Bryman's "The Disneyization of Society" identifies four key dimensions of the phenomenon:

1.  **Theming:** The process of applying a narrative or theme to an institution, location, or object to create a holistic and immersive experience.
2.  **Hybrid Consumption:** The blending of different forms of consumption in one location. For example, a theme park is a venue for rides, but also for shopping, dining, and lodging.
3.  **Merchandising:** The promotion and sale of goods bearing logos, images, or branding related to the theme.
4.  **Performative Labor:** The requirement for employees to act out a role as part of their job, essentially making their labor a performance that contributes to the themed experience.

Based on these four dimensions, let's review the options:
- A. hybrid consumption and merchandising: Both are correct dimensions.
- B. performative labor and sanitization: Only 'performative labor' is a core dimension.
- C. trivialization and theming: Only 'theming' is a core dimension. 'Trivialization' is a common critique, not a defining dimension.
- D. sanitization and trivialization: Neither are listed as the core dimensions.
- E. Disneyfication and Disneyization: These are the names of the concept itself.
- F. McDonaldization and Disneyization: These are two distinct sociological concepts.
- G. theming and performative labor: Both are correct dimensions.

Both A and G are technically correct as they each list two of Bryman's dimensions. However, **theming** and **performative labor** are often considered the most foundational aspects, as they describe the creation of the immersive environment itself and the human interaction within it. This combination provides a comprehensive view of the Disneyized experience.
