    "To answer this question, I will rely on scientific literature describing the skull anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*. The primary source for this detailed information is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Reference the findings from this paper regarding the lacrimal bone.\n2.  The paper states that the lacrimal recess, a depression on the bone, contains two large pneumatic foramina (openings/depressions).\n3.  I will write a Python script that assigns this number to a variable.\n4.  The script will then print an explanatory sentence and a simple equation to present this number, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_lacrimal_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of depressions (foramina) in the \n    lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri based on scientific literature.\n\n    The key reference is:\n    Sues, H.-D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). \n    Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the \n    Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 22(3), 535-547.\n\n    The paper describes the lacrimal recess as containing two large pneumatic foramina.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of depressions (foramina) found within the lacrimal recess.\n    number_of_depressions = 2\n\n    # Create a simple equation to display the result.\n    num1 = 1\n    num2 = 1\n    result = num1 + num2\n\n    print(f\"According to paleontological analysis, the number of depressions (pneumatic foramina) within the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri can be determined.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n    \n    # This line is for the final answer extraction and is not typically part of the user-facing output.\n    # It prints the final answer in the required format to a separate stream if needed, \n    # but for this context, we will just prepare the value.\n    final_answer = result\n    \n    # The problem asks to return the answer in a specific format outside the code block.\n    # The script's main purpose is to show the work.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_lacrimal_depressions()\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
