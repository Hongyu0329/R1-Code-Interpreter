    "My plan is to first identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on the specific philosophical concept mentioned. The distinction between \"symptoms\" (natural signs) and \"signals\" (conventional signs) as components of a \"hallmark\" or \"criterion\" is a key idea in the work of a particular member of this school. After identifying the philosopher, I will write a simple Python script to print the name, as requested by the prompt's instructions.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n# This philosopher is known for analyzing the concept of a \"hallmark\" (or criterion)\n# by breaking it down into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n# Based on the history of philosophy and logic, this distinction is a well-known\n# contribution by Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n#\n# The script will store this name in a variable and then print it in a formatted string.\n\nphilosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\nprint(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {philosopher_name}\")\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
