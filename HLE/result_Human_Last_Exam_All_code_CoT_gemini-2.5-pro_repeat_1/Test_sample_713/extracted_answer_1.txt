[d!V, R_d V] where R_d is the ratio for a regular d-simplex. For d=2, this is [2V, 10/3V]. For d=3, it is [6V, 10V]. The set of all possible values for the volume Vol(P) is the union of these intervals over all V>0, which is (0, infinity). The question is interpreted as asking for the ratio Vol(P)/V.
