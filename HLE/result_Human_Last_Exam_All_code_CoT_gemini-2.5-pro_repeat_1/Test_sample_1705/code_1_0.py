# The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S, where S is the set of
# starting points x_0 for which the sequence x_{n+1} = f(x_n) has exactly 7 distinct values.
#
# A sequence generated by iterating a function on a compact interval can only have a
# finite number of values if it is eventually periodic. This means that for some k,
# the k-th term in the sequence is equal to a previous term.
#
# The set S is therefore the set of pre-periodic points for f(x) such that the
# length of the orbit before repetition is exactly 7.
#
# In the theory of dynamical systems, it is a standard result that for a C^1 map
# on an interval, like the given f(x), the set of all pre-periodic points is
# a countable set, provided there are no non-hyperbolic (neutral) periodic orbits.
#
# For the given function f(x), one can show that its periodic orbits are repelling (hyperbolic),
# which means the condition holds.
#
# The Lebesgue measure of any countable set of real numbers is zero.
#
# Since S is a subset of the pre-periodic points, its Lebesgue measure must also be zero.
