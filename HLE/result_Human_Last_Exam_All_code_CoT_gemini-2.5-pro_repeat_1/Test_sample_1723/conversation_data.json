    "This is a knowledge-based question. The genus of mushroom known for its distinctly blue characteristics, especially the species *Lactarius indigo*, is the one most commonly associated with a \"blue print\". When this mushroom is cut or damaged, it exudes a blue latex or \"milk\" that can stain a surface blue, giving the impression of a blue print, even though its actual spore deposit is yellowish to cream. I will write a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_blue_spore_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the mushroom genus commonly associated\n    with a blue spore print.\n    \"\"\"\n    # While no known mushroom genus produces a truly blue spore print,\n    # the genus Lactarius is famous for the species Lactarius indigo.\n    # This mushroom bleeds a blue latex when cut, which can stain paper blue,\n    # leading it to be the commonly accepted answer for this question.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue print (from its latex) is: {genus_name}\")\n\nfind_blue_spore_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
