# Parameters from the problem
p = 43
n = 18
e = 3

# Derived parameters
f = n // e
q = p**f

# The equivalence relation is modulo the ideal p_K^m
# From the analysis, m = 28
m = 28

# The total number of equivalence classes is given by the formula (q-1) * q^(2m-1)
# With q = 43^6 and m = 28, this becomes (43^6 - 1) * (43^6)^55
# which simplifies to (43^6 - 1) * 43^330.

# Calculate the components of the final equation
# The first term is q - 1
term1 = q - 1

# The exponent of p in the second term is f * (2m - 1)
exponent_of_p = f * (2 * m - 1)

# Calculate the final result
total_classes = term1 * (p**exponent_of_p)

# Output the numbers in the final equation and the result
