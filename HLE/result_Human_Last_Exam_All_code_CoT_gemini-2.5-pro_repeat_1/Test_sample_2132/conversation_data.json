    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone involves treating the ketone with a base. A common base used for this reaction is an alkoxide, such as sodium methoxide (CH₃ONa). This reaction results in a ring contraction. The 6-membered cyclohexanone ring becomes a 5-membered cyclopentane ring with a carboxylic acid ester group. Therefore, the product is methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\n2.  **Determine Molecular Properties:** We need to find the properties of methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (C₇H₁₂O₂) required for the Böttcher formula.\n    *   **Molecular Formula:** C₇H₁₂O₂\n    *   **Number of Atoms (`N_atoms`):** 7 (Carbon) + 12 (Hydrogen) + 2 (Oxygen) = 21 atoms.\n    *   **Number of Bonds (`N_bonds`):** The total number of covalent bonds is calculated as half the sum of the valences of all atoms. (Valences: C=4, H=1, O=2).\n        `N_bonds` = (7 * 4 + 12 * 1 + 2 * 2) / 2 = (28 + 12 + 4) / 2 = 22 bonds.\n    *   **Number of Cycles (`N_cycles`):** The molecule contains one ring (the cyclopentane ring), so `N_cycles` = 1.\n    *   **Number of Parts (`N_parts`):** The product is a single, continuous molecule, so `N_parts` = 1.\n\n3.  **Calculate Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** We will use the formula:\n    `Complexity = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the product molecule, methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate (C7H12O2).\n\n# Number of atoms of each element\nn_carbon = 7\nn_hydrogen = 12\nn_oxygen = 2\n\n# Total number of atoms (N_atoms)\nn_atoms = n_carbon + n_hydrogen + n_oxygen\n\n# Number of covalent bonds (N_bonds), calculated from atomic valences (C=4, H=1, O=2)\n# N_bonds = (sum of valences) / 2\nn_bonds = (n_carbon * 4 + n_hydrogen * 1 + n_oxygen * 2) // 2\n\n# Number of cycles (N_cycles) in the molecule\nn_cycles = 1\n\n# Number of disconnected parts (N_parts) of the molecule\nn_parts = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the Böttcher Molecular Complexity using the formula.\n# BCI = (N_atoms * N_bonds * N_cycles) / N_parts\nboettcher_complexity = (n_atoms * n_bonds * n_cycles) / n_parts\n\n# Step 3: Print the result and the equation used.\nprint(\"The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\")\nprint(\"Its Böttcher Molecular Complexity is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Number of atoms (N_atoms) = {n_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of bonds (N_bonds) = {n_bonds}\")\nprint(f\"Number of cycles (N_cycles) = {n_cycles}\")\nprint(f\"Number of parts (N_parts) = {n_parts}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n# The final line prints the equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"{n_atoms} * {n_bonds} * {n_cycles} / {n_parts} = {int(boettcher_complexity)}\")\n```\n<<<462>>>"
