    "The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This quantity is equivalent to the number of basis elements of degree 10 in the free Lie algebra on two generators (say, X and Y).\n\nThis number can be calculated using Witt's formula, which gives the dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra over a field with k generators:\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(n/d) * k^d`\n\nHere:\n*   `n = 10` (the order).\n*   `k = 2` (the number of generators, X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `mu` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that implements this formula for `n=10` and `k=2`. The script will:\n1.  Define a helper function to compute the Möbius function, `mu(x)`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  Calculate `mu(10/d)` for each divisor `d`.\n4.  Compute each term `mu(10/d) * 2^d` in the sum.\n5.  Sum the terms, divide by 10, and print the final result.\n6.  Crucially, the script's output will show the full equation with all the intermediate numbers to demonstrate how the final answer is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num and their powers.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(1) = 1\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Möbius function is defined only for positive integers.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n    \n    # Find divisors of n\n    divisors = sorted([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0])\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the Witt's formula sum\n    total_sum = 0\n    mu_values = []\n    terms = []\n    term_values = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_val = mobius(n // d)\n        mu_values.append(f\"mu({n//d})={mu_val}\")\n        term_val = mu_val * (k**d)\n        terms.append(f\"({mu_val}) * {k}^{d}\")\n        term_values.append(str(term_val))\n        total_sum += term_val\n        \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula for n={n} and k={k}:\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{{d|n}} mu(n/d) * k^d\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"For n={n}, the divisors 'd' are: {divisors}\")\n    print(f\"The corresponding mu(n/d) values are: {', '.join(mu_values)}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Substituting these values into the formula:\")\n    \n    equation_symbolic = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(terms) + \" ]\"\n    print(equation_symbolic.replace(\"+ -\", \"- \"))\n\n    equation_numeric = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(term_values) + \" ]\"\n    print(equation_numeric.replace(\"+ -\", \"- \"))\n    \n    equation_summed = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\"\n    print(equation_summed)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nL_2(10) = {result}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_order_10()\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
