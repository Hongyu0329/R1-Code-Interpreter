    "An HSS (Hierarchical Semi-separable) matrix multiplication algorithm, specifically a matrix-vector multiplication, operates by traversing the corresponding hierarchical tree representation of the matrix. The number of submatrices accessed is equivalent to the total number of nodes in this tree.\n\nA hierarchical tree with a depth `d` is a binary tree that has `d+1` levels, from level 0 (the root) to level `d` (the leaves). At any given level `k`, there are `2^k` nodes or submatrices.\n\nTo find the total number of submatrices accessed, we need to sum the number of nodes at each level from 0 to the specified depth of 4.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum and displays the full equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of submatrices accessed in an HSS matrix\n    multiplication for a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # Calculate the number of submatrices at each level.\n    # At level k, there are 2^k submatrices.\n    nodes_per_level = [2**k for k in range(depth + 1)]\n\n    # The total number of submatrices is the sum of nodes at all levels.\n    total_submatrices = sum(nodes_per_level)\n\n    # Prepare the output strings.\n    print(f\"For a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree of depth {depth}, the number of submatrices at each level 'k' is 2^k.\")\n    print(\"The total number of accessed submatrices is the sum of submatrices at all levels from 0 to the depth.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation is as follows:\")\n\n    # Create the equation string, ensuring each number is included.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, nodes_per_level))\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result.\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_submatrices}\")\n\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n<<<31>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with depth 4.
