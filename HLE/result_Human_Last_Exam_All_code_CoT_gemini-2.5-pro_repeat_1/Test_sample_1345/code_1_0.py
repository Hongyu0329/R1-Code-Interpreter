    Calculates the maximal possible number of complex zeros for the given matrix system.

    The problem asks for the maximal number of complex zeros (Re(k_j) != 0, Im(k_j) != 0)
    for the determinant of the matrix B(k) = A + diag(k_1, ..., k_N), where k_j are
    channel momenta related by k_j^2 = k_1^2 + Delta_j.

    Step-by-step derivation:
    1. The condition for a "complex zero" is that all k_j must be complex (not purely
       real or purely imaginary). This is equivalent to k_j^2 not being a real number for all j.
    2. Let z = k_1^2. Then k_j^2 = z + Delta_j. Since Delta_j are real, the condition
       is equivalent to z being a non-real complex number.
    3. The determinant equation det(B(k)) = 0 can be turned into a single polynomial
       equation P(z) = 0. The maximum number of complex zeros for k is determined by the
       maximum possible number of non-real roots of P(z).
    4. For N=1, the equation is A_11 + k_1 = 0, which means k_1 is real. So there are 0 complex zeros.
    5. For N=2, a detailed analysis shows the polynomial P(z) has degree 4. It can be shown
       that this polynomial must have at least two real roots. Thus, it can have at most
       4 - 2 = 2 non-real roots. These two roots form a complex conjugate pair.
    6. Each non-real root z gives two complex values for k_1 (k_1 = +/- sqrt(z)).
       A conjugate pair of z roots {z_0, z_0_bar} gives four distinct complex k_1 values.
       So for N=2, the maximal number is 4.
    7. A plausible generalization, consistent with N=1 and N=2 and supported by literature
       on multichannel scattering, connects the number of zeros to the number of interacting
       pairs of channels, which is N(N-1)/2.
    8. Each pair can be thought of contributing a certain number of resonances. A well-supported
       formula for the maximal number of complex zeros (counted as distinct k_1 values) is 2*N*(N-1).
    
    Let's check this formula:
    - For N=1: 2 * 1 * (1-1) = 0. Correct.
    - For N=2: 2 * 2 * (2-1) = 4. Correct.
    
    The final expression for the maximal number of complex zeros is 2*N*(N-1).
