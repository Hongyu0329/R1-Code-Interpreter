# The clue refers to Kurt Vonnegut's observation in his novel "Hocus Pocus"
# that all the Founding Fathers looked like porcupines in their pictures.
# The puzzle is to name a Founding Father whose first and last names
# begin with the same letter.

# After reviewing the names of the Founding Fathers, one prominent figure
# fits this description.
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Jay"

# Print the full name to the console.
print(first_name + " " + last_name)
