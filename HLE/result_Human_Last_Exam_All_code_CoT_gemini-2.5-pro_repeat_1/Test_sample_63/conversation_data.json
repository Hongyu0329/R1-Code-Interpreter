    "Based on the clue from Kurt Vonnegut's novel *Hocus Pocus*, where he describes the Founding Fathers as looking like porcupines due to their hairstyles and wigs, we need to find a prominent Founding Father whose first and last names start with the same letter.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  Recall or research the specific quote from Kurt Vonnegut to understand the context. The quote is about the Founding Fathers in general.\n2.  The task is to find a specific individual from this group.\n3.  The constraint is that the person's name must be two words, both starting with the same letter.\n4.  I will search for a prominent Founding Father whose name fits this pattern.\n5.  John Jay is a well-known Founding Father whose name fits the \"J. J.\" pattern.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print his name.\n\n```python\n# The clue refers to Kurt Vonnegut's observation in his novel \"Hocus Pocus\"\n# that all the Founding Fathers looked like porcupines in their pictures.\n# The puzzle is to name a Founding Father whose first and last names\n# begin with the same letter.\n\n# After reviewing the names of the Founding Fathers, one prominent figure\n# fits this description.\nfirst_name = \"John\"\nlast_name = \"Jay\"\n\n# Print the full name to the console.\nprint(first_name + \" \" + last_name)\n```\n<<<John Jay>>>"
