    "To determine the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval `[0,1]` and the unit circle, I will use a known formula from metric geometry. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Parameters:** I will first identify the key parameters of the two spaces.\n    *   For the interval `X = [0,1]`, the relevant parameter is its length, `L`.\n    *   For the unit circle `Y = S^1` with its intrinsic metric, the relevant parameter is its total length (circumference), `l`.\n\n2.  **State the Formula:** The Gromov-Hausdorff distance `d_GH` between an interval of length `L` and a circle of length `l` is given by a well-established formula. The choice of the specific formula depends on the comparison between the interval's length `L` and the circle's diameter, which is `l/π`.\n\n3.  **Implement Calculation:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Assigns the values for `L` (which is 1) and `l` (which is `2π`).\n    *   Compares `L` and `l/π` to select the correct part of the formula.\n    *   Substitutes the values into the formula.\n    *   Calculates the final distance.\n    *   Prints the steps of the calculation, including the final equation with all numbers substituted, and the resulting distance.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gromov_hausdorff_distance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]\n    and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters of the two metric spaces.\n    # Space X: The interval [0, 1].
