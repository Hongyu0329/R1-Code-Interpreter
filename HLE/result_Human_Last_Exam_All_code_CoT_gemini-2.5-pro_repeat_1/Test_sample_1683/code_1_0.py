# This script outlines the multi-step synthesis to identify the final product.

# Define the names of compounds at each step based on chemical analysis.
starting_material = "(2-bromophenyl)methanol"

# Step 1: n-BuLi (2 eq.) followed by diethyl carbonate and workup.
# The reaction forms an ester at the aryl position and regenerates the alcohol.
compound_1 = "ethyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)benzoate"

# Step 2: Dimerization using dichlorodimethylsilane.
# Two molecules of Compound 1 are linked via a silyl ether bridge.
compound_2 = "bis[2-(ethoxycarbonyl)benzyl] dimethylsilyl ether"

# Step 3: Reduction with Lithium naphthalenide.
# The silyl ether is cleaved to a methyl group, and the ester is reduced to an alcohol.
compound_3 = "2-methylbenzyl alcohol"

# Step 4: Jones Oxidation.
# The primary alcohol is oxidized to a carboxylic acid.
compound_4_name = "2-methylbenzoic acid"

# Determine the molecular formula for Compound 4 (C6H4 ring + COOH + CH3).
num_carbon = 6 + 1 + 1
num_hydrogen = 4 + 1 + 3
num_oxygen = 2

# Print the final result and the numbers in the molecular formula.
