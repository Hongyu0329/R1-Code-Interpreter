    Analyzes the relationship between inaccessible and measurable cardinals to solve the problem.

    explanation = """
1.  The problem provides a system S, which is Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC) plus the axiom "there exists an inaccessible cardinal κ".

2.  It then provides a statement P: "There exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j : V → M from the universe V into a transitive class M, such that the critical point of j is κ."

3.  This statement P is a standard definition of a **measurable cardinal**. Therefore, statement P is equivalent to the assertion "κ is a measurable cardinal".

4.  The question thus boils down to the relationship between these two large cardinal axioms within ZFC:
    -   Axiom 1 (from S): There exists an inaccessible cardinal.
    -   Axiom 2 (from P): There exists a measurable cardinal.

5.  In large cardinal theory, there is a well-established hierarchy of consistency strength. It is a theorem that any measurable cardinal must also be an inaccessible cardinal. However, the converse cannot be proven within ZFC. The axiom for a measurable cardinal is strictly stronger than the axiom for an inaccessible cardinal.

6.  Let's evaluate the choices based on this fact:
    -   A) P is provable in S: This is false. We cannot prove the existence of a measurable cardinal just from the existence of an inaccessible one.
    -   B) The negation of P is provable in S: This is also false. Proving that no measurable cardinals exist from S would contradict the fact that the theory ZFC + "a measurable cardinal exists" is considered consistent (and in fact implies the consistency of S).
    -   D) P leads to a contradiction in S: This is false. The theory S + P (ZFC + Inaccessible + Measurable) is simply ZFC + Measurable, which is a standard, albeit very strong, extension of ZFC.
    -   E) P is meaningless: P is a well-formed and central statement in modern set theory.

7.  Conclusion: Since P can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of S, P is independent of S.
