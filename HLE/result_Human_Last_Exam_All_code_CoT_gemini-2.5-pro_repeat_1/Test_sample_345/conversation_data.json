    "I will answer your question by providing a Python script. My plan is to store the known information—the artist, painting title, creation year, acquisition year, and the acquiring museum—in variables. Then, I will use these variables to construct and print a clear, human-readable sentence that directly answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_museum_for_painting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the acquisition of the painting \"The Radionist\".\n    The data is based on known art history records.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the artwork and its acquisition\n    artist = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    painting_title = \"The Radionist\"\n    creation_year = 1927\n    acquisition_year = 1967\n    acquiring_museum = \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence, including all the numbers from the query.\n    print(\n        f'The museum that acquired the {creation_year} tempera painting \"{painting_title}\" '\n        f'by {artist} in {acquisition_year} is the {acquiring_museum}.'\n    )\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nfind_museum_for_painting()\n```\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
