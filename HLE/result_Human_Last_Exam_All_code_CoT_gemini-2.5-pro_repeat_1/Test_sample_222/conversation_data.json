    "This task requires us to find the DFT of a sequence that is formed by interleaving two other sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We are given the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`, which are `X(k)` and `H(k)` respectively.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the target sequence:** The new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is an 8-point sequence:\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n2.  **Recognize the structure:** The problem asks for the DFT of this new 8-point sequence. This structure is a classic example of the Decimation-In-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The sequence `y(n)` has its even-indexed terms form the sequence `x(n)` and its odd-indexed terms form the sequence `h(n)`.\n    *   Even part: `y(2n) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)} = x(n)`\n    *   Odd part: `y(2n+1) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)} = h(n)`\n3.  **Apply the FFT formula:** The 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, let's call it `Y(k)`, can be computed directly from the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts (`X(k)` and `H(k)`). The formulas are:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-2Ï€jk/8)` is the \"twiddle factor\".\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** We will use Python with the `numpy` library to perform the complex arithmetic. The code will iterate from `k=0` to `3`, calculate the twiddle factors, apply the formulas above, and print each step of the calculation.\n\nNote: The prompt asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence, which is likely a typo. The structure of the problem strongly implies that the goal is to find the **8-point DFT** of the 8-point sequence. We will proceed with this standard interpretation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence using the\n    decimation-in-time FFT formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n    N = 8\n    half_N = N // 2\n    \n    # Initialize the output 8-point DFT array\n    Y = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"This problem uses the decimation-in-time FFT structure.\")\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) is calculated from the 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\")\n    print(\"Formulas:\")\n    print(\"Y(k)   = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)\")\n    print(\"Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Detailed Calculations ---\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate from k = 0 to 3\n    for k in range(half_N):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_8^k\n        twiddle_factor = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / N)\n        \n        # Calculate the product term for clarity\n        product_term = twiddle_factor * H[k]\n        \n        # --- Calculate Y(k) ---\n        Y[k] = X[k] + product_term\n        \n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({k}) + W_8^{k} * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} + ({twiddle_factor.real:.4f} + {twiddle_factor.imag:.4f}j) * {H[k]}\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} + ({product_term.real:.4f} + {product_term.imag:.4f}j)\")\n        print(f\"   = {Y[k].real:.4f} + {Y[k].imag:.4f}j\\n\")\n\n        # --- Calculate Y(k+4) ---\n        Y[k + half_N] = X[k] - product_term\n        \n        print(f\"For k = {k} (calculating Y({k+half_N})):\")\n        print(f\"Y({k + half_N}) = X({k}) - W_8^{k} * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} - ({twiddle_factor.real:.4f} + {twiddle_factor.imag:.4f}j) * {H[k]}\")\n        print(f\"   = {X[k]} - ({product_term.real:.4f} + {product_term.imag:.4f}j)\")\n        print(f\"   = {Y[k + half_N].real:.4f} + {Y[k + half_N].imag:.4f}j\\n\")\n        print(\"--------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final 8-point DFT Y(k) vector:\")\n    # Clean up near-zero floating point artifacts for printing\n    Y_cleaned = [np.round(val, 10) for val in Y]\n    print(np.array(Y_cleaned))\n    \n    # The final answer block as requested\n    global final_answer\n    final_answer = np.array(Y_cleaned)\n\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_dft()\n# The final answer is wrapped in the specified format\n# We convert complex numbers to strings for the final output format.\nanswer_str = \"[\" + \", \".join([f\"({c.real}{c.imag:+}j)\" for c in final_answer]) + \"]\"\nprint(f\"<<<{answer_str}>>>\")\n```"
