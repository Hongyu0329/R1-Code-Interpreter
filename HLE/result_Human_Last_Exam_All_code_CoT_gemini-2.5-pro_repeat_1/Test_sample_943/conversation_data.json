    "Here is a plan to solve for K:\n1.  First, I will analyze the structure of the tensor given by the function $f(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$.\n2.  I will show that this tensor is a rank-1 perturbation of the $n$-th Kronecker power of a smaller, $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ base tensor.\n3.  I will determine the slice rank of this tensor family. I'll show that its asymptotic growth rate is $2^n$.\n4.  By equating this growth rate with the given expression $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$, I will establish an equation for K.\n5.  Finally, I will solve this equation for K and provide a Python script to compute its numerical value.\n\nThe tensor $T_n$ in question is defined by the function $T_n(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i+y_i+z_i) - 1$.\nLet's consider the base case for $n=1$. The tensor $S_1$ is defined by $S_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$ on $\\{0,1\\}^3$. The tensor $T_1$ is $S_1 - 1$. The tensor $T_n$ is the Kronecker product $S_1^{\\boxtimes n}$ minus the all-ones tensor $J$.\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor is a measure of its complexity. For the base tensor $S_1$, we can compute the ranks of its \"flattenings\". The tensor can be represented as a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube of numbers. Flattening along the first dimension gives two $2 \\times 2$ matrices: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$. These are linearly independent, so the rank of this flattening is 2. By symmetry, all flattenings have rank 2. The slice rank of $S_1$ is therefore 2.\n\nThe slice rank of a Kronecker product of tensors is the product of their slice ranks. So, the slice rank of $S_1^{\\boxtimes n}$ is $2^n$.\n\nThe tensor we are interested in is $T_n = S_1^{\\boxtimes n} - J$. By analyzing the flattenings of this new tensor, it can be shown that its slice rank is $2^n-1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, we equate the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank with the given formula:\n$SR(T_n) = 2^n - 1 \\approx 2^n$ for large $n$.\nThe given formula is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The term $e^{o(n)}$ accounts for sub-exponential factors, which we can ignore when comparing the bases.\nSo, we set the bases equal:\n$2 = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\n$2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n$2^{K+1} = 3$\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives:\n$K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n$K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\nThis can also be written as $K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nThe following python code calculates the value of K.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_for_k():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the value of K based on the analysis.\n    The slice rank of the tensor is 2^n - 1.\n    The problem provides the formula (3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).\n    Equating the asymptotic bases, we get the equation 2 = 3 / (2^K).\n    This script solves this equation for K.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The equation is 2 = 3 / (2^K)\n    # which simplifies to 2^(K+1) = 3\n    # K+1 = log2(3)\n    # K = log2(3) - 1\n    k_value = math.log2(3) - 1\n\n    print(\"The analysis of the tensor's slice rank leads to the equation for the asymptotic base:\")\n    # As requested, printing the numbers in the final equation.\n    print(\"2 = 3 / (2^K)\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving for K:\")\n    print(\"2 * 2^K = 3\")\n    print(\"2^(K+1) = 3\")\n    print(\"K+1 = log2(3)\")\n    print(\"K = log2(3) - 1\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe numerical value of K is: {k_value}\")\n\nsolve_for_k()\n\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
