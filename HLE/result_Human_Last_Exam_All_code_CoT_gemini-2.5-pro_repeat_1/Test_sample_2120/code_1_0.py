# Plan:
# 1. Identify the polynomials whose roots are the poles of the B(z) field.
#    The poles of E(z) are non-existent as it is an entire function (polynomial).
#    The poles of B(z) are the roots of P(z) = 4z^4 - z^3 + z^2 + 1 = 0
#    and Q(z) = z^4 + z^2 - z + 4 = 0.
# 2. Use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of roots for each polynomial.
#    For a polynomial a_n*z^n + a_{n-1}*z^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.
# 3. Calculate the total sum of roots and the total number of roots.
# 4. Compute the average value by dividing the total sum by the total number.

# Polynomial P(z) = 4*z**4 - 1*z**3 + 1*z**2 + 0*z**1 + 1
p_coeffs = {'a4': 4, 'a3': -1}
# Polynomial Q(z) = 1*z**4 + 0*z**3 + 1*z**2 - 1*z**1 + 4
q_coeffs = {'a4': 1, 'a3': 0}

# Number of roots for each polynomial is its degree.
num_roots_p = 4
num_roots_q = 4

# Calculate sum of roots for P(z)
sum_roots_p = -p_coeffs['a3'] / p_coeffs['a4']

# Calculate sum of roots for Q(z)
sum_roots_q = -q_coeffs['a3'] / q_coeffs['a4']

# The total number of poles is the sum of the number of roots.
total_num_roots = num_roots_p + num_roots_q

# The total sum of poles is the sum of the sums of roots.
total_sum_roots = sum_roots_p + sum_roots_q

# The average value is the total sum divided by the total number.
average_value = total_sum_roots / total_num_roots

# Print the final equation for the average value
print(f"Sum of roots for P(z) = -({p_coeffs['a3']}) / {p_coeffs['a4']} = {sum_roots_p}")
print(f"Sum of roots for Q(z) = -({q_coeffs['a3']}) / {q_coeffs['a4']} = {sum_roots_q}")
print(f"Total number of poles = {num_roots_p} + {num_roots_q} = {total_num_roots}")
print(f"Total sum of poles = {sum_roots_p} + {sum_roots_q} = {total_sum_roots}")
print(f"Average value = ({sum_roots_p} + {sum_roots_q}) / ({num_roots_p} + {num_roots_q}) = {total_sum_roots} / {total_num_roots} = {average_value}")
print(f"\nThe average value of the complex coordinates is {average_value}.")

# Final answer format
print(f"\n<<<{average_value}>>>")
