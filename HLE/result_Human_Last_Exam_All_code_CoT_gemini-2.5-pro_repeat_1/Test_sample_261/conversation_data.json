    "To answer this question, I will research historical records and lists of the superiors of the Pskov-Caves Monastery. My plan is to find a reliable source that lists the archimandrites and their years of service, and then identify the individual who served from 1730 to 1731. I will then present this information in a Python script as requested. The script will store the name and the years in variables and print a sentence with the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery for a specific period.\n    The information is based on historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_year = 1730\n    end_year = 1731\n    archimandrite_name = \"Markell\"\n    \n    # The final equation here is a sentence constructed from the known facts.\n    # We will output each number (the years) and the name in the final sentence.\n    print(f\"The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from the year {start_year} to {end_year} was {archimandrite_name}.\")\n\nfind_archimandrite()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
