    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large values of $x$, we will follow a method based on asymptotic analysis.\n\nThe ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Simplify the ODE for large $x$**: We will analyze the behavior of each term in the equation as $x \\to \\infty$ to identify the dominant terms.\n2.  **Assume a power-law solution**: We will propose a solution of the form $y(x) = A x^n$, which is a common form for asymptotic solutions.\n3.  **Determine the exponents and coefficients**: By substituting the proposed solution into the simplified ODE, we will find the values of $n$ and $A$ by balancing the dominant terms. This is known as the method of dominant balance.\n4.  **Construct the final expression**: Finally, we will use the calculated values to write down the approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$, rounding the numerical coefficient to two decimal places as requested.\n\n**Step 1: Simplifying the ODE**\nFor large $x$, the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2 + 2}$ approaches zero, as the denominator grows quadratically. The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x) + 1}$ is oscillatory and bounded (except at the singularities of $\\tan(x)$) and is expected to be negligible compared to the other terms which might follow a power-law decay or growth. Therefore, we can approximate the ODE by its dominant non-linear parts:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$\n\n**Step 2: Assuming a Power-Law Solution**\nLet's assume the solution has the form $y(x) = A x^n$. Its derivatives are:\n*   $y'(x) = A n x^{n-1}$\n*   $y'''(x) = A n(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3}$\n\n**Step 3: Finding the Dominant Balance**\nSubstituting these into the simplified ODE gives:\n$A n(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (A n x^{n-1})^4$\n$A n(n-1)(n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n\nFor large $x$, we need to balance the terms with the highest power of $x$. The term $A^4 x^{4n}$ will be larger than $A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$. Thus, the dominant balance must be between the left-hand side and the first term on the right-hand side:\n$n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$\n\nWith $n=-1$, the powers of $x$ in our equation are $x^{-4}$, $x^{-4}$, and $x^{-8}$. The $x^{-8}$ term ($(y')^4$) is indeed smaller than the other two for large $x$, so our dominant balance is consistent and simplifies to $y''' \\approx y^4$.\n\nNow we solve for the coefficient $A$ using $y(x) = Ax^{-1}$ in $y''' = y^4$:\n*   $y''' = A(-1)(-2)(-3)x^{-4} = -6A x^{-4}$\n*   $y^4 = (Ax^{-1})^4 = A^4 x^{-4}$\n\nEquating them gives $-6A x^{-4} = A^4 x^{-4}$, which implies $-6A = A^4$.\nThis can be written as $A^4 + 6A = 0$, or $A(A^3 + 6) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution, we have $A^3 = -6$, which gives $A = -\\sqrt[3]{6}$. The initial conditions given at $x=0$ do not influence this large-$x$ behavior.\n\n**Step 4: Constructing the Final Expression**\nWe calculate the numerical value of $A$ and round it to two decimal places.\n$A = -\\sqrt[3]{6} \\approx -1.81712$\nRounding to two decimal places, we get $A \\approx -1.82$.\nThus, the approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$ in the large $x$ regime is $y(x) = -1.82 / x$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the coefficient and prints the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_asymptotic_ode():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficient for the asymptotic solution of the ODE\n    and prints the final analytical expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From the analytical derivation, the coefficient A is determined by A^3 = -6.\n    # So, A = - (6)^(1/3).\n    A = -math.pow(6, 1.0/3.0)\n\n    # Round the coefficient to two decimal places as requested.\n    A_rounded = round(A, 2)\n\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the full expression for y(x).\n    \n    print(\"The derived analytical expression that approximates the solution for large x is:\")\n    print(f\"y(x) = {A_rounded} / x\")\n\nsolve_asymptotic_ode()\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 / x>>>"
