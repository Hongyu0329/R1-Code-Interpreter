    "To solve this problem, we will determine the structure of the Schur multiplier of the group $G$ and then count its proper subgroups up to isomorphism.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent the Group**: The permutation group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a$, $b$, and $c$, acting on the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$. To work with this group computationally, we first map the non-numeric symbols to integers: $x \\to 10$, $y \\to 11$, and $z \\to 12$.\n\n2.  **Compute the Schur Multiplier**: The Schur multiplier, which we'll call $A$, is a finite abelian group associated with $G$. We can find its structure using the computational algebra system GAP, which has specialized algorithms for this purpose. We will use the `pygap` library in Python to interface with GAP and call the `AbelianInvariantsMultiplier` function. This function returns a list of integers that describe the structure of $A$ as a direct product of cyclic groups, i.e., $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{n_1} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{n_2} \\times \\dots$.\n\n3.  **Count Proper Subgroups**: Once the structure of $A$ is known, we can find the number of its proper subgroups up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup is any subgroup that is not equal to the group itself. We will list all possible isomorphism classes of subgroups of $A$ and then subtract one (for $A$ itself) to get the final count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It requires the `pygap` library and a working installation of GAP.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of proper subgroups of the Schur\n    multiplier of the given group G, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The pygap library can be noisy.
