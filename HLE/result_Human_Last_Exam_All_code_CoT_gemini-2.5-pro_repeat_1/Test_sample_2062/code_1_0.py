# (a) Is it true that A and B are similar if and only if the multiplicities of each eigenvalue are identical?
# For diagonal matrices, similarity is determined by the multiset of their eigenvalues. If the multiplicities
# of each eigenvalue are identical, the multisets are the same, and the matrices are similar. Conversely,
# similar matrices share the same characteristic polynomial, hence the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities.

# (b) For n = 3 and eigenvalues alpha, beta, gamma in F, how many similarity classes exist if they are distinct?
# A similarity class is determined by the multiset of its eigenvalues. We need to find the number of
# multisets of size k=3, with elements chosen from a set of n=3 distinct eigenvalues.
# This is a combinations with repetition problem. The formula is C(k + n - 1, k).
k = 3  # The dimension of the matrix (size of the multiset).
n = 3  # The number of distinct eigenvalues to choose from.
