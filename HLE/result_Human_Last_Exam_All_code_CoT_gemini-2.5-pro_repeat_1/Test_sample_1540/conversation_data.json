    "My plan to solve this involves two main parts. First, I will provide a Python script to solve the string comparison problem as requested. Second, I will analyze the problem from the perspective of writing a memory-efficient C program to determine the value of `m`, as specified in the task description.\n\n### Python Solution Plan\n1.  Read the two input strings from standard input.\n2.  Since the comparison must be case-insensitive, convert both strings to the same case, for instance, lowercase, using the `.lower()` method.\n3.  Perform a direct lexicographical comparison on the transformed strings.\n4.  Based on the comparison result, print \"-1\" if the first string is smaller, \"1\" if it's larger, and \"0\" if they are equal.\n\n### C Program Memory-Efficiency Analysis\nThe task requires finding the total memory `m` in bytes used for variables in the *most memory-efficient C program* for this problem.\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing both strings in memory if possible. A standard approach is to use two character arrays (e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101];`), which would consume `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the buffers.\n2.  **Optimized Approach:** A more memory-efficient method is to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string character-by-character, comparing it on-the-fly with the corresponding character in the first string. This avoids needing a second buffer.\n3.  **Variable Declaration and Sizing:**\n    *   A buffer for the first string is necessary: `char s1[101];`. The size is 101 to accommodate a string of length 100 plus the null terminator. This uses **101 bytes**.\n    *   We need to read the second string one character at a time. The `getchar()` function is suitable for this, but it returns an `int` to handle the `EOF` (End-Of-File) case. So, we need a variable: `int c2;`. On typical systems used for competitive programming, an `int` is 4 bytes. This uses **4 bytes**.\n    *   We need an index to iterate through the first string's buffer (`s1`). Since the maximum string length is 100, a `char` variable is sufficient to serve as a counter (as it can hold values from 0 to 100). This is the most memory-efficient type for the index: `char i;`. This uses **1 byte**.\n4.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    The total memory for variables in this optimized C program is the sum of the sizes of the variables declared.\n    m = (size of `s1` buffer) + (size of `getchar` variable) + (size of index)\n    m = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte = 106 bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0 as a result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input.\n    try:\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    except (IOError, IndexError):\n        s1 = \"\"\n\n    # Read the second string from standard input.\n    try:\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    except (IOError, IndexError):\n        s2 = \"\"\n\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n    # Perform the lexicographical comparison and determine the result.\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        result = -1\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        result = 1\n    else:\n        result = 0\n\n    # The problem statement mentions an equation, which is not applicable here.\n    # We will just print the final result as requested.\n    # Final Result: -1\n    if result == -1:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    # Final Result: 1\n    elif result == 1:\n        print(\"1\")\n    # Final Result: 0\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
