Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and memory formation, it is predicted that interleukin-15 would lead to an **increase** in the release of key effector cytokines (like IFN-γ and TNF-α) from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 generates a more functionally potent and persistent T cell product.
