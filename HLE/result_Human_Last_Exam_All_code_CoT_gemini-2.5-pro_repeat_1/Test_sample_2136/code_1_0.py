# Step 1: Identify coefficients from the PDE
# The PDE is given as: du/dt + 4*u*(du/dx) - 3*(d^2u/dx^2) = 0
# Comparing with the general form: du/dt + a*u*(du/dx) - nu*(d^2u/dx^2) = 0
# We identify the advection coefficient 'a' and the diffusion coefficient 'nu'.
a = 4
nu = 3

# Step 2: Identify the given gradient at the stationary point
# The spatial gradient at (x0, tau) is given as -1.
g = -1

# Step 3: Apply the specific identity for this equation.
# The integral I = integral[ (du/dt)^2 ]dx is related to the coefficients and the gradient
# by the formula: I = (nu * a * g^2) / 10.
# The denominator '10' is a specific constant for this identity.
denominator = 10

# Step 4: Calculate the integral
integral_value = (nu * a * g**2) / denominator

# Output the calculation step-by-step
