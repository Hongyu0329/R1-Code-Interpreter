    "My plan is to scan the provided Latin hexameter line, \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" by breaking it down into its six metrical feet. I will identify each foot as either a dactyl (D), which consists of one long syllable followed by two short syllables, or a spondee (S), which consists of two long syllables.\n\nThe process involves several steps:\n1.  **Syllabification:** Breaking the line into individual syllables.\n2.  **Elision:** Identifying and handling cases where a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word starting with a vowel or \"h,\" causing the first syllable to be dropped.\n3.  **Vowel Length:** Determining whether each syllable is long or short based on its vowel (long by nature or part of a diphthong) or its position (a vowel followed by two or more consonants).\n4.  **Foot Construction:** Grouping the syllables into the six feet of the hexameter line, remembering that the fifth foot is typically a dactyl and the sixth is a spondee.\n\nThis particular line from Lucretius is known for its metrical complexity, involving multiple elisions and potential metrical licenses. Based on analysis, the scansion is determined to be Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\nThe following Python code will present this final scansion, clearly showing how the line is divided into feet and labeling each foot with its corresponding pattern.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a specific line of Latin hexameter and prints the result.\n    The line is: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    This line is known for its metrical complexities, and the scansion\n    presented is based on established classical analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The original Latin line\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n    # The line divided into its six metrical feet\n    # Note the splitting of words like 'atque', 'convenit', and 'imago' across feet.\n    feet_division = [\"verum ubi\", \"equi at\", \"que hominis\", \"casu con\", \"venit i\", \"mago\"]\n\n    # The scansion pattern for each foot: D for Dactyl, S for Spondee\n    scansion_pattern = [\"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n\n    # Print the header\n    print(f\"Scansion of the line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Print each foot with its scansion\n    full_scansion_line = []\n    for i in range(len(feet_division)):\n        foot_text = feet_division[i]\n        pattern = scansion_pattern[i]\n        # We represent the dactyls and spondees in the final equation\n        if pattern == \"D\":\n            foot_representation = \"D\"\n        else: # Spondee\n            foot_representation = \"S\"\n        \n        full_scansion_line.append(foot_representation)\n\n        print(f\"Foot {i+1}: {foot_text:<12} -> {pattern}\")\n    \n    # Print the final scansion on one line\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Final Pattern: \" + \" | \".join(full_scansion_line))\n\n\n# Execute the function to print the scansion\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D | S | S | S | D | S>>>"
