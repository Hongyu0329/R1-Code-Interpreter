    Analyzes the three yes/no questions about the quiver automorphism and prints the reasoned answer.

    Our reasoning is based on the properties of the reflection automorphism g, where g^2 = id.
    This implies the identity: mu_i * mu_{n-(d+i+1)}^* = 1 for all i.
    """
    
    # --- Analysis and Answer for (c) ---
    # The question is equivalent to "must mu_i * mu_i^* = 1?", since lambda^2=1.
    # We test this by constructing a counterexample.
    # Let k = n-(d+i+1). The consistency conditions from g^2=id are:
    # 1) mu_i * mu_k^* = 1
    # 2) mu_k * mu_i^* = 1
    # We can pick values for mu_i and mu_i^* and see if they are consistent.
    
    # Let's choose a counterexample:
    mu_i = 2.0
    mu_i_star = 3.0
    
    # From the consistency conditions, we can derive mu_k and mu_k_star:
    mu_k = 1.0 / mu_i_star
    mu_k_star = 1.0 / mu_i
    
    # Now we check if the condition in question, mu_i * mu_i^* = 1, holds.
    product = mu_i * mu_i_star
    
    # Based on this, we conclude the answer for (c).
    answer_c = "no"

    # --- Analysis and Answer for (a) ---
    # The question states that if the reflection axis passes through vertex j, then sigma(a_j) must
    # be a multiple of a_j-1^*. This is a very strong condition on the operator sigma. Since sigma is
    # not defined, we cannot assume it has this property. It is not true for a general operator
    # that is compatible with the quiver's structure.
    answer_a = "No"

    # --- Analysis and Answer for (b) ---
    # This question asks if A implies B. The relationship c_j^* = -mu_j^(-1) * c_j is highly specific.
    # In the mathematical contexts where such quiver problems arise (like Calabi-Yau algebras or
    # symplectic reflection algebras), such identities often hold due to deep structural properties
    # (e.g., related to a non-degenerate trace or a moment map). It is plausible that this implication
    # is true in the intended framework.
    answer_b = "yes"
