def solve_photon_rate():
    """
    This function calculates the photon creation rate based on common, though sometimes varying, definitions in cavity QED.

    The rate is proportional to g^2 and inversely proportional to the cavity decay rate γ_c.
    The exact numerical prefactor (e.g., 1, 2, 4) can depend on the precise definition
    of the coupling constant 'g' and the decay rate in the Hamiltonian.

    The most common result is 4*g**2/γ_c. However, this is not an option.
    Among the given options, only E, g**2/γ_c, is dimensionally correct
    (assuming g and γ_c are frequencies) and has the correct physical scaling.
    This implies a specific convention for defining the coupling constant 'g'.
