    "The user is asking to identify crystal classes that have three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This requires the presence of an improper rotation axis, such as a mirror plane (m) or a center of inversion (ī).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a spontaneous electric dipole moment. This means it must not belong to one of the 10 polar classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm).\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental symmetry requirement for optical activity is **chirality**.\n\nThere is a direct contradiction in these requirements. A crystal class is optically active *if and only if* it is chiral. A chiral class, by definition, cannot possess any improper rotation axes (mirror planes or inversion centers). However, the user also requests the class to be **achiral**, which means it *must* possess an improper rotation axis.\n\nTherefore, the conditions \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" are mutually exclusive. No crystal class can satisfy both simultaneously.\n\nThe following Python script will programmatically demonstrate this contradiction by defining the sets of crystal classes for each property and showing that their intersection is empty.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes crystallographic point groups to find any that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and optically active, and explains the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Explanation of the physical principles ---\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The query asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    1. Achiral\n    2. Non-polar\n    3. Optically Active\n\n    Let's analyze the symmetry requirements for these properties:\n\n    - Optical Activity: The ability to rotate plane-polarized light. The essential\n      symmetry condition for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be\n      **chiral**.\n\n    - Chirality: A crystal class is chiral if its structure is not superimposable on\n      its mirror image. This means the class must lack all improper rotation\n      operations, which include mirror planes (m) and a center of inversion (ī).\n\n    - Achirality: A crystal class is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror\n      image. This means the class **must possess** at least one improper rotation\n      operation (e.g., a mirror plane or inversion center).\n\n    The Contradiction:\n    The requirements for 'optically active' (must be chiral) and 'achiral' are\n    fundamentally contradictory. An object cannot be both chiral and achiral at the\n    same time.\n\n    Therefore, no crystal class can satisfy all the requested conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n\n    # --- Programmatic Verification ---\n    print(\"\\nProgrammatic Verification:\")\n\n    # The set of optically active classes is identical to the set of chiral classes.\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # All other classes are achiral.\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', 'ī', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '4̄', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '4̄2m', '4/mmm', '3', '3̄', '32', '3m', '3̄m', '6',\n        '6̄', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '6̄m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm3̄', '432', '4̄3m', 'm3̄m'\n    }\n    achiral_classes = all_classes.difference(optically_active_classes)\n\n    # The 10 polar classes.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n    non_polar_classes = all_classes.difference(polar_classes)\n\n    # Find the intersection of all three required sets.\n    result_set = achiral_classes.intersection(non_polar_classes).intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"\\nWe are looking for the intersection of three sets:\")\n    print(f\"  1.
