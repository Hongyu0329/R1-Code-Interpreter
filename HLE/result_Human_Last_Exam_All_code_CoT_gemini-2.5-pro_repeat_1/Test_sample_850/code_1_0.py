    The query asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:
    1. Achiral
    2. Non-polar
    3. Optically Active

    Let's analyze the symmetry requirements for these properties:

    - Optical Activity: The ability to rotate plane-polarized light. The essential
      symmetry condition for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be
      **chiral**.

    - Chirality: A crystal class is chiral if its structure is not superimposable on
      its mirror image. This means the class must lack all improper rotation
      operations, which include mirror planes (m) and a center of inversion (ī).

    - Achirality: A crystal class is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror
      image. This means the class **must possess** at least one improper rotation
      operation (e.g., a mirror plane or inversion center).

    The Contradiction:
    The requirements for 'optically active' (must be chiral) and 'achiral' are
    fundamentally contradictory. An object cannot be both chiral and achiral at the
    same time.

    Therefore, no crystal class can satisfy all the requested conditions.
