Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogen atoms would still exhibit tunneling.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Origin of Tunneling**: The tunneling effect in ammonia (NH3) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where the nitrogen (N) atom passes through the plane of the three hydrogen (H) atoms. This creates a double-well potential. The nitrogen's wavefunction can penetrate the potential energy barrier between the two wells, leading to a splitting of the ground state energy level.

2.  **What Determines the Barrier?**: The potential energy barrier is determined by the electrostatic forces (Coulomb's Law) between the electrons and the nuclei, and the masses of the atoms involved. Nuclear spin does not affect an atom's mass or its electric charge.

3.  **Effect of "Exotic" Hydrogen**:
    *   Ordinary Hydrogen: The nucleus (a proton) is a fermion with spin 1/2.
    *   Exotic Hydrogen: The nucleus is a boson with spin 0.
    *   Replacing ordinary H with exotic H does NOT change the masses or the electric charges in the molecule. Therefore, the electrostatic potential energy surface and the potential barrier for the nitrogen inversion remain unchanged.

4.  **The Role of Spin and Symmetry**: The difference in nuclear spin affects the overall symmetry of the molecular wavefunction required by the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
    *   For ordinary NH3, with fermionic protons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric when two protons are exchanged.
    *   For exotic NH3, with bosonic spin-0 hydrogens, the total wavefunction must be symmetric when two exotic hydrogens are exchanged.

5.  **Conclusion**: This symmetry requirement dictates which rotational and nuclear-spin states can be combined with the vibrational tunneling states. It will alter the populations of the energy levels and the appearance of the molecule's spectrum. However, it does not eliminate the potential barrier or the tunneling itself. The fundamental double-well potential still exists, and so the energy levels will still be split by tunneling.

Therefore, the ammonia molecule made with exotic, spin-zero hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling.
