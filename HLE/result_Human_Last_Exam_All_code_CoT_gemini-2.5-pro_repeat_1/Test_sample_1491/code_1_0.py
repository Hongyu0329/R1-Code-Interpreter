# This script prints the final answer based on the analysis of the two experiments.
# The analysis determines which capabilities are necessary for an AI to replicate
# the Visual Cliff and Swinging Room experiments.

# I. Goal-driven locomotion triggered by visual stimuli: "cliff"
# II. A functional analogue of cortical area MST (optic flow processing): "room"
# III. A mechanism for evaluating relative size (texture gradient): "cliff"
# IV. A mechanism for resolving binocular disparity: "cliff"
# V. A mechanism for controlling posture: "both"

final_answer = "cliff-room-cliff-cliff-both"
