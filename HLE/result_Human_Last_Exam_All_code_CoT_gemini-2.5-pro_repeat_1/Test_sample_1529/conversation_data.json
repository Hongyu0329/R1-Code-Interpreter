    "To find the minimal discriminant of the curve defined by $y^2=x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$, we need to calculate a specific invariant of the curve. This invariant, the discriminant, is determined by the polynomial on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nThe term \"minimal discriminant\" refers to the discriminant of a so-called \"minimal model\" of the curve over the rational numbers. This model is an equivalent equation for the curve that is as simple as possible in a number-theoretic sense. For the given curve, the provided equation is already a minimal model.\n\nTherefore, the task simplifies to calculating the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x) = x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal discriminant of the curve y^2 = x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable and the polynomial\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = x**6 + 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + 4*x + 1\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial\n    # For the given curve, its model is already minimal, so the discriminant of the\n    # polynomial is the minimal discriminant of the curve.\n    minimal_discriminant = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as\n    # printing the final numerical answer.\n    print(minimal_discriminant)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<-28744576>>>"
