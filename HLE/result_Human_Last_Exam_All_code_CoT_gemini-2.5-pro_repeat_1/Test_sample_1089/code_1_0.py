        'B': 'Foreign Object Damage',
        'C': 'Blade Tip Rub and Wear',

    1.  The repair method is 'TIG welding (GTAW) build-up of layers of filler material'. This is an additive process designed to replace lost material and restore the original dimensions of a part.

    2.  Let's evaluate the damage types:
        - Cracking (A, E), Creep (D), and widespread Corrosion (F) are not primarily fixed by building up layers of material. Their repair is more complex, involving crack removal, heat treatment, or recoating.
        - Foreign Object Damage (B) involves nicks and gouges where material is lost. TIG build-up is used to repair this.
        - Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is the progressive loss of material from the blade tip due to contact with the engine casing. This is a very common issue that directly impacts engine efficiency.

    3.  Conclusion: The process of meticulously 'building up layers' of material is the quintessential description for repairing a worn-down blade tip. This procedure restores the precise tip clearance required for optimal engine performance. While FOD is also repaired with welding, tip wear is the most classic and frequent application for this specific 'build-up' technique.
