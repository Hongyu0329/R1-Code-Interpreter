    "This problem asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root. This is a question from algebraic topology and combinatorics. The precise definition of \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" is not given, which suggests that the answer should be based on a general principle rather than a detailed enumeration based on a complex definition.\n\nA simplicial complex $F$ failing to collapse onto a subcomplex $R$ is often due to the presence of some non-trivial homology in the pair $(F,R)$. The number of combinatorial objects like spanning trees on a complex $K$ is often related to the torsion part of the homology groups of $K$. For instance, the number of simplicial spanning trees of a certain type on a $d$-dimensional complex $K$ is given by $|H_{d-1}(K)_{\\text{tors}}|^2$.\n\nFor the Möbius band $M$, which is a 2-dimensional complex, this formula would point to $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. The first homology group of the Möbius band is $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. This is a torsion-free group. The torsion subgroup is trivial, $\\{0\\}$, which has order 1. This would imply there is only 1 such \"tree\", which is not a very interesting answer and relies on a specific definition of \"tree\" that might not apply here.\n\nA more fruitful approach is to consider the internal structure of the Möbius band, which is captured by relative homology. Let's consider the first homology group of the Möbius band relative to its boundary, $H_1(M, \\partial M)$. The boundary $\\partial M$ is a single circle, $S^1$. The long exact sequence of homology for the pair $(M, \\partial M)$ includes the segment:\n$$ \\dots \\to H_1(\\partial M) \\xrightarrow{i_*} H_1(M) \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to H_0(\\partial M) \\xrightarrow{j_*} H_0(M) \\to \\dots $$\nWe have the following standard results for a Möbius band $M$:\n*   $H_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Let its generator be $c$ (the core circle).\n*   $H_1(\\partial M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Let its generator be $b$. The inclusion map $i_*$ sends $b$ to $2c$. So, $i_*$ is a multiplication-by-2 map.\n*   $H_0(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_0(\\partial M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ as both are path-connected. The map $j_*$ is an isomorphism.\n\nFrom the exactness of the sequence, the map following $j_*$ is zero, and the map preceding $j_*$ has an image equal to $\\ker(j_*) = \\{0\\}$. This means the map $H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to H_0(\\partial M)$ is the zero map. The sequence thus gives:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(M, \\partial M) \\to 0 $$\nThis implies that $H_1(M, \\partial M)$ is the cokernel of the multiplication-by-2 map, which is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $H_1(M, \\partial M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThis group is a torsion group of order 2. It represents the non-trivial \"internal\" structure of the Möbius band that causes its non-orientability. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the \"forests that fail to collapse\" are counted by a formula related to this group.\n\nBy analogy with the formula for spanning trees, we hypothesize that the number of these non-collapsing rooted forests is given by the squared order of the torsion subgroup of this relative homology group.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of $H_1(M, \\partial M) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is the group itself. Its order is 2.\nThe number of forests is therefore $|H_1(M, \\partial M)_{\\text{tors}}|^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n\nThe following Python code prints this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial structures (\"higher dimensional rooted forests\")\n#    on the Möbius band that fail to collapse.\n# 2. Such non-collapsing structures are typically related to the topology of the space, specifically its homology groups.\n# 3. Standard theorems relate the number of \"simplicial spanning trees\" to the squared order of the torsion\n#    subgroup of a homology group of the complex.\n# 4. The relevant homology group that captures the internal, non-orientable nature of the Möbius band is the\n#    first relative homology group with respect to its boundary, H_1(M, dM).\n# 5. This group is isomorphic to Z_2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n# 6. The number of forests is hypothesized to be the squared order of this group.\n\n# The first relative homology group of the Möbius band (M) with respect to its boundary (dM) is Z_2.\n# H_1(M, dM) = Z_2\n# The torsion subgroup of Z_2 is Z_2 itself.\norder_of_torsion_group = 2\n\n# The number of such forests is the square of this order.\nnumber_of_forests = order_of_torsion_group ** 2\n\n# Print the equation and the final result.\nprint(f\"{order_of_torsion_group}^2 = {number_of_forests}\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
