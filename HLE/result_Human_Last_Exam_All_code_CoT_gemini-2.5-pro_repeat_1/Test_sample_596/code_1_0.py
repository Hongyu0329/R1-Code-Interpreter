# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial structures ("higher dimensional rooted forests")
#    on the Möbius band that fail to collapse.
# 2. Such non-collapsing structures are typically related to the topology of the space, specifically its homology groups.
# 3. Standard theorems relate the number of "simplicial spanning trees" to the squared order of the torsion
#    subgroup of a homology group of the complex.
# 4. The relevant homology group that captures the internal, non-orientable nature of the Möbius band is the
#    first relative homology group with respect to its boundary, H_1(M, dM).
# 5. This group is isomorphic to Z_2, the cyclic group of order 2.
# 6. The number of forests is hypothesized to be the squared order of this group.

# The first relative homology group of the Möbius band (M) with respect to its boundary (dM) is Z_2.
# H_1(M, dM) = Z_2
# The torsion subgroup of Z_2 is Z_2 itself.
order_of_torsion_group = 2

# The number of such forests is the square of this order.
number_of_forests = order_of_torsion_group ** 2

# Print the equation and the final result.
print(f"{order_of_torsion_group}^2 = {number_of_forests}")
