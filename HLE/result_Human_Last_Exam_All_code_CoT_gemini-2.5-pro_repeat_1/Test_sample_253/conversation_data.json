    "To solve this problem, I will simulate a one-dimensional cellular automaton according to Rule 110. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110:** Rule 110 determines the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. There are 2³ = 8 possible neighborhood patterns (`111`, `110`, ..., `000`). The rule number 110 in binary is `01101110`. I will create a mapping (like a Python dictionary) for these 8 patterns to their corresponding outputs.\n    *   `111` → `0`\n    *   `110` → `1`\n    *   `101` → `1`\n    *   `100` → `0`\n    *   `011` → `1`\n    *   `010` → `1`\n    *   `001` → `1`\n    *   `000` → `0`\n\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton:** I'll create a 1D grid (a list of 0s and 1s) to represent the cells. The problem starts with a \"single cell in state 1\". I will place this '1' in the center of a sufficiently wide grid of '0's. The width needs to be large enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 generations. A width of `2 * generations + 1` is the minimum required, so I'll use a slightly larger width for safety.\n\n3.  **Run the Simulation:** I will loop 20 times to simulate 20 generations. In each generation, I'll calculate the state of every cell for the next generation by applying Rule 110 to its neighborhood and store the results in a new grid. After all new states are calculated, I'll replace the old grid with the new one.\n\n4.  **Format and Print the Output:** After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. I will find the final pattern, trim the leading and trailing zeros from the grid, and print the resulting binary sequence as a single string.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
