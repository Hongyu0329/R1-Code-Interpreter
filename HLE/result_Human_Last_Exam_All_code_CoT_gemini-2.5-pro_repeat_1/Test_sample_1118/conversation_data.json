    "I will answer your question about the painter Curt Querner. My plan is to first identify the object he is holding in his 1933 self-portrait. Then, as per your instructions, I will create a Python script that prints this information as a complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object Curt Querner holds\n    in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    painter = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    symbolic_object = \"a poppy flower\"\n    \n    print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait, {painter} holds {symbolic_object} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a poppy flower>>>"
