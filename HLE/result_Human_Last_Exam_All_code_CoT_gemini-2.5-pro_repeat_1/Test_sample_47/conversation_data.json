    "To find the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a standard formula based on the overlaps within the sequence itself.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Problem**: We are drawing letters from a 26-letter alphabet with uniform probability. We want to find the expected number of draws until the target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears.\n2.  **Use the Overlap Formula**: The expected time `E` can be calculated with the formula:\n    `E = Î£ (N^k)` for all `k` from 1 to `L` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` matches the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n    -   `S` is the target sequence (\"TENETENET\").\n    -   `L` is the length of `S` (9).\n    -   `N` is the size of the alphabet (26).\n3.  **Identify Overlaps**: I will write a script to iterate from `k=1` to `k=9` and check for `prefix == suffix` matches.\n4.  **Calculate and Sum**: For each `k` where a match is found, the script will calculate `26^k` and add it to a running total.\n5.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the final equation, showing each term that contributes to the sum, and then the final result, as requested.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time for a sequence to appear, based on its internal overlaps.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- 1.
