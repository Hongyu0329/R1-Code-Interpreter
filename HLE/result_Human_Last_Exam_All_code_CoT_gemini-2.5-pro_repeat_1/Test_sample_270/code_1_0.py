    Calculates the fractional Dehn twist coefficient for (Da o Db)^9.

    The problem is interpreted in the context of the mapping class group of a
    torus with one boundary component, which is isomorphic to the 3-strand
    braid group B_3. The right-handed Dehn twists Da and Db correspond to
    the positive braid generators sigma_1 and sigma_2.

    The "fractional Dehn twist coefficient" is interpreted as the exponent sum
    of the corresponding braid word. For (sigma_1 * sigma_2)^9, each generator
    has an exponent of +1, and there are 2 * 9 = 18 generators in total.
