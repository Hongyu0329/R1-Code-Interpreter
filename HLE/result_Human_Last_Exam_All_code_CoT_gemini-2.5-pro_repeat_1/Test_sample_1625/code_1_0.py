    # Step 1: Explain the reasoning.
    # The key to the question is understanding the geometry of a toroidal system.
    # The "poloidal" direction corresponds to the small circumference of the torus.
    # This is an angular coordinate (theta), which is periodic over 2*pi.
    # The most suitable spectral expansion technique for any periodic function is the Fourier series.

    print("1. A toroidal system (like a tokamak) is doughnut-shaped.")
    print("2. The 'poloidal' direction refers to the angle going the short way around the torus.")
    print("3. This angle is a periodic variable, typically from 0 to 2*pi.")
    print("4. The Fourier series is the standard mathematical method for representing periodic functions.")
    print("5. Therefore, a Fourier series is the natural choice for the poloidal dependence.")
