    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):**\n    *   The name `6-311G**` is a Pople-style basis set notation. The number of primitive Gaussians is atom-dependent, so we need to define the rules for different types of atoms.\n    *   **`6-`**: This refers to the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is described by a single contracted function, which is a sum of **6** primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **`-311`**: This describes the valence electrons. The valence shell is split into three functions (a \"triple-split valence\" basis).\n        *   The first number (`3`) means the inner valence shell is described by one contracted function made of **3** primitives.\n        *   The second and third numbers (`1` and `1`) mean the middle and outer valence shells are each described by one contracted function made of **1** primitive each.\n    *   **`G`**: Simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n    *   **`**` (or `(d,p)`): These are polarization functions added to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n        *   The first `*` adds one set of d-type polarization functions to \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. This is typically a single uncontracted d-primitive.\n        *   The second `*` adds one set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This is typically a single uncontracted p-primitive.\n\n2.  **Apply Rules to Specific Atoms:**\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It has no core electrons, only a 1s valence orbital.\n        *   Valence `s` orbital (from `-311`): `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n        *   Polarization `p` functions (from the second `*`): `1` primitive.\n        *   Total for H = `5 + 1 = 6` primitives.\n    *   **For a Second-Row Heavy Atom (like Carbon, C):** It has a 1s core and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n        *   Core `1s` orbital (from `6-`): `6` primitives.\n        *   Valence `2s` orbital (from `-311`): `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n        *   Valence `2p` orbitals (from `-311`): `3 + 1 + 1 = 5` primitives.\n        *   Polarization `d` functions (from the first `*`): `1` primitive.\n        *   Total for C = `6 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 17` primitives.\n\n3.  **Create a Python Script:**\n    *   The script will first print the breakdown for the individual atoms (H and C) to show the general rule.\n    *   Then, as a complete example, it will calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for a methane molecule (CHâ‚„) by summing the primitives from its constituent atoms (1 Carbon and 4 Hydrogens).\n    *   The final output will show the full equation for the methane calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_and_print_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for representative atoms and an example molecule (Methane).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom.\")\n    print(\"Here is the breakdown for common atoms:\\n\")\n\n    # --- Hydrogen ---\n    h_s_valence = 3 + 1 + 1\n    h_p_polarization = 1\n    h_total = h_s_valence + h_p_polarization\n\n    print(\"For a Hydrogen (H) atom:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the equation\n    print(f\"Primitives = (3+1+1) [s valence] + 1 [p polarization] = {h_s_valence} + {h_p_polarization} = {h_total}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon) ---\n    heavy_core = 6\n    heavy_s_valence = 3 + 1 + 1\n    heavy_p_valence = 3 + 1 + 1\n    heavy_d_polarization = 1\n    heavy_total = heavy_core + heavy_s_valence + heavy_p_valence + heavy_d_polarization\n\n    print(\"For a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon, C):\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the equation\n    print(f\"Primitives = 6 [core] + (3+1+1) [s valence] + (3+1+1) [p valence] + 1 [d polarization]\")\n    print(f\"           = {heavy_core} + {heavy_s_valence} + {heavy_p_valence} + {heavy_d_polarization} = {heavy_total}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # --- Example Molecule: Methane (CH4) ---\n    print(\"As a full example, let's calculate the total for Methane (CH4):\\n\")\n    num_c = 1\n    num_h = 4\n\n    total_for_c = num_c * heavy_total\n    total_for_h = num_h * h_total\n    final_total = total_for_c + total_for_h\n\n    print(\"Total Primitives = (Num C atoms * Primitives per C) + (Num H atoms * Primitives per H)\")\n    print(f\"Total Primitives = ({num_c} * {heavy_total}) + ({num_h} * {h_total})\")\n    print(f\"Total Primitives = {total_for_c} + {total_for_h}\")\n    print(f\"Total Primitives = {final_total}\")\n    \n    # Return the final calculated value for the example molecule\n    return final_total\n\n# Execute the function and capture the final answer for the example\nfinal_answer = calculate_and_print_primitives()\n\n# The final answer is the total number of primitive Gaussians for Methane (CH4).\n# print(f\"\\n<<<For CH4: {final_answer}>>>\") # This is for internal check, not final output format.\n```\n<<<17 for a Carbon atom and 6 for a Hydrogen atom.
