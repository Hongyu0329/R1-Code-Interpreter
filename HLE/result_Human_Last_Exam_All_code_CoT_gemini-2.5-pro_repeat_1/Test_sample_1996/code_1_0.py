    Calculates the number of unique integers in a 3D Square Pascal Pyramid

    The pyramid is constructed layer by layer based on the following rules:
    1. Layer 1 is [[1]].
    2. Layer n (for n > 1) is an n x n matrix.
    3. The border of any layer consists of only 1s.
    4. An interior value at (i, j) in layer n is the sum of the four
