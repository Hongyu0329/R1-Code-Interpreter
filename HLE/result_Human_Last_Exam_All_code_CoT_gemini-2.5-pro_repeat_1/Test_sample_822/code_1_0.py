    - Symptoms: Polyarthritis (consistent with Hypertrophic Pulmonary Osteoarthropathy), confusion, bruising, dysphagia, multiple pulmonary nodules.
    - Clinical Course: Immunosuppression via steroids followed by a fatal opportunistic infection.

    This combination of factors is a classic presentation for a specific malignancy.
