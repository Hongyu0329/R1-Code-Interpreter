    "Based on scientific literature, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single, universally fixed value. It depends on various factors, including the specific synthesis method, nanoparticle morphology, and the precise reaction conditions (temperature, pressure). However, extensive research points to a general range where the catalytic activity is maximized. This is typically when there is a high dispersion of Ni species and a maximum number of active sites at the Ni-CeOâ‚‚ interface.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that calculates a representative ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio based on an optimal atomic percentage of Nickel (Ni) commonly cited in research for these applications. An atomic percentage of around 15% Ni in the Ni-Ce system is often found to provide an excellent balance of active sites and stability. The script will:\n1.  Define the optimal atomic percentage for Ni (15%).\n2.  Calculate the corresponding atomic percentage for Cerium (Ce).\n3.  Compute the Ni/Ce molar ratio.\n4.  Print the values and the final calculation in an equation format.\n\n```python\n# Define the optimal atomic percentage of Ni based on experimental literature findings.\n# A value around 15% is often cited for maximizing the catalytically active Ni-CeO2 interface.\nni_atomic_percent = 15.0\n\n# The remainder of the composition is Cerium (Ce).\nce_atomic_percent = 100.0 - ni_atomic_percent\n\n# The molar ratio is the ratio of their atomic percentages.\n# We can think of this as considering a sample of 100 atoms.\nni_moles = ni_atomic_percent\nce_moles = ce_atomic_percent\n\n# Calculate the final Ni/Ce ratio.\nideal_ratio = ni_moles / ce_moles\n\nprint(f\"Based on an optimal composition of {ni_atomic_percent}% Ni and {ce_atomic_percent}% Ce (atomic percent):\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculation for the ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Ni moles = {ni_moles}\")\nprint(f\"Ce moles = {ce_moles}\")\nprint(f\"Ratio Equation: {ni_moles} / {ce_moles} = {ideal_ratio:.3f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nAn ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is approximately {ideal_ratio:.3f}.\")\n```\n<<<0.176>>>"
