    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we need to find the number of cyclic subgroups in this group. Let's denote the semidihedral group of size $2^n$ as $SD_{2^n}$.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Identify the group:** The group is the semidihedral group of size 512. In the notation $SD_{2^n}$, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n = 9$. The group is $SD_{512}$.\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element. This is the definition of a cyclic subgroup. So, the task is to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n3.  **Analyze the group structure:** The group $SD_{2^n}$ is given by the presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = b^2 = 1, bab = a^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = b^2 = 1, bab = a^{127} \\rangle$. The elements are of two forms:\n    *   Powers of $a$: $a^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ of order 256.\n    *   Elements outside $\\langle a \\rangle$: $a^i b$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n4.  **Count the cyclic subgroups:** I will count the cyclic subgroups by considering these two sets of elements separately.\n    *   **Subgroups within $\\langle a \\rangle$:** Since $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256 ($=2^8$), the number of its subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 256. A number of the form $p^k$ has $k+1$ divisors. So, there are $8+1=9$ such subgroups. For the general case $SD_{2^n}$, this is $n$.\n    *   **Subgroups generated by $a^i b$:** I will determine the order of these elements. It turns out that elements $a^i b$ have order 2 if $i$ is even, and order 4 if $i$ is odd.\n        *   There are $256/2 = 128$ elements of order 2 (for even $i$). Each generates a unique subgroup of order 2. So, this gives 128 subgroups. For $SD_{2^n}$, this is $2^{n-2}$ subgroups.\n        *   There are $128$ elements of order 4 (for odd $i$). A cyclic subgroup of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators. So, these elements form pairs that generate the same subgroup. This gives $128/2 = 64$ subgroups. For $SD_{2^n}$, this is $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ subgroups.\n5.  **Sum the results:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these distinct sets of subgroups. The final formula is $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$. I will implement this calculation in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group of size 2^n, we first find n.\n    # 2^n = 512 => n = log2(512)\n    try:\n        n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # A \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup.\n    # We need to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.\n\n    # The formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in SD_{2^n} is:\n    # n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\n    # This formula is derived by categorizing the elements and the subgroups they generate.\n\n    # 1.
