    # The prompt requests outputting numbers in an equation. This problem's solution is conceptual
    # and doesn't involve a numerical equation. The answer is a cardinal number.
    # For instance, if we consider finite subsets, we have classes for size n=0, 1, 2, ...
    # Equation: Number of classes for finite sets = |{0, 1, 2, ...}| = Aleph-zero
    # But the problem is about ALL subsets, which leads to a much larger number.
    # There is no simple equation like 2+2=4.
