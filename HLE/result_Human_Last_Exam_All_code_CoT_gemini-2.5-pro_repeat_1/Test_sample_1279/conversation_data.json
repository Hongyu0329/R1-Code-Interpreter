    "In Quantum Field Theory, the contribution of a Feynman diagram to a physical process is weighted by a numerical factor called the symmetry factor. For a given interaction term in the Lagrangian, like the $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ term in scalar field theory, we can draw diagrams representing particle interactions. At the second order in the coupling constant $\\lambda$, we are considering diagrams with two vertices.\n\nFor vacuum-to-vacuum transitions (vacuum bubbles), there are no external particles. We must connect all lines internally. At second order in $\\phi^4$ theory, there are three distinct diagrams: two connected and one disconnected.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to calculate their symmetry factors and sum them:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** We will identify the three topologically distinct vacuum bubble diagrams with two vertices.\n    *   **Diagram A (the \"Saturn\" diagram):** A connected diagram where two vertices are linked by two propagators, and each vertex also has a self-loop.\n    *   **Diagram B (the \"Melon\" diagram):** A connected diagram where two vertices are linked by four propagators.\n    *   **Diagram C (the disconnected diagram):** Two separate copies of the first-order vacuum bubble (the \"figure-eight\" diagram).\n2.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram:** The symmetry factor is the number of permutations of lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. We will calculate this for each of the three diagrams.\n    *   For the **Saturn diagram (A)**, we count the ways to swap the identical lines.\n    *   For the **Melon diagram (B)**, we count the permutations of the four identical propagators.\n    *   For the **disconnected diagram (C)**, we first find the symmetry factor of a single figure-eight diagram and then combine them, accounting for the fact that the two figure-eights are identical and can be swapped.\n3.  **Sum the Symmetry Factors:** We will add the three calculated symmetry factors together to get the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams\n    in phi^4 theory and sums them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Diagram A: The \"Saturn\" Diagram ---\n    # This connected diagram has two vertices connected by two propagators,\n    # and each vertex also has a self-loop.\n    # The symmetries are:\n    # 1.
