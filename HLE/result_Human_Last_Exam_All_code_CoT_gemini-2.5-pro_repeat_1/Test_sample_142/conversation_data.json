    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing formula:** For a molecule with a singlet ground state (total spin S=0), the number of CSFs in a full CI calculation is given by the Weyl-Paldus formula:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N/2} \\binom{K+1}{N/2+1}$\n    where:\n    *   `N` is the total number of electrons in the molecule.\n    *   `K` is the total number of spatial orbitals, which is equal to the number of basis functions in the chosen basis set.\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of electrons (N):** We will sum the atomic numbers for all atoms in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total N = 1 * 6 (for C) + 3 * 1 (for H) + 1 * 14 (for Si) + 1 * 9 (for F) = 32 electrons.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of basis functions (K):** We need to determine the number of basis functions for each atom in the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy atoms (`d` functions) and hydrogen atoms (`p` functions).\n    *   **H**: 5 basis functions (2s, 1p)\n    *   **C, F (2nd row heavy atoms)**: 15 basis functions each (3s, 2p, 1d)\n    *   **Si (3rd row heavy atom)**: 19 basis functions (4s, 3p, 1d)\n    *   Total K = 1 * 15 (for C) + 3 * 5 (for H) + 1 * 19 (for Si) + 1 * 15 (for F) = 64 basis functions.\n\n4.  **Compute the final value:** We will plug N=32 and K=64 into the formula and calculate the result using a Python script, which can handle the very large numbers involved.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs)\n# for a full CI calculation of the CH2SiHF molecule with a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n# Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N).\n# Atomic numbers: C=6, H=1, Si=14, F=9\nelectrons_C = 6\nelectrons_H = 1\nelectrons_Si = 14\nelectrons_F = 9\n\nnum_C = 1\nnum_H = 3\nnum_Si = 1\nnum_F = 1\n\nN = num_C * electrons_C + num_H * electrons_H + num_Si * electrons_Si + num_F * electrons_F\nprint(f\"Molecule: CH2SiHF\")\nprint(f\"Total number of electrons (N) = {N}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K) for 6-31G**.\n# 6-31G** basis functions per atom:\n# H: 5 (2s, 1p)\n# C, F (2nd row): 15 (3s, 2p, 1d)\n# Si (3rd row): 19 (4s, 3p, 1d)\nbasis_C = 15\nbasis_H = 5\nbasis_Si = 19\nbasis_F = 15\n\nK = num_C * basis_C + num_H * basis_H + num_Si * basis_Si + num_F * basis_F\nprint(f\"Basis Set: 6-31G**\")\nprint(f\"Total number of basis functions / spatial orbitals (K) = {K}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of CSFs for a singlet state (S=0).\n# The formula is: N_csf = (1 / (K + 1)) * C(K + 1, N / 2) * C(K + 1, N / 2 + 1)\n# where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\nif N % 2 == 0:\n    M = N // 2\n    K_plus_1 = K + 1\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of CSFs for a singlet state...\")\n    print(f\"Formula: (1 / (K + 1)) * C(K + 1, N / 2) * C(K + 1, N / 2 + 1)\")\n    \n    # Substitute values into the equation\n    print(f\"\\nEquation with values:\")\n    print(f\"(1 / ({K} + 1)) * C({K} + 1, {N} / 2) * C({K} + 1, ({N} / 2) + 1)\")\n    print(f\"= (1 / {K_plus_1}) * C({K_plus_1}, {M}) * C({K_plus_1}, {M + 1})\")\n\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficients\n    term1 = math.comb(K_plus_1, M)\n    term2 = math.comb(K_plus_1, M + 1)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIntermediate values:\")\n    print(f\"C({K_plus_1}, {M}) = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"C({K_plus_1}, {M + 1}) = {term2}\")\n\n    # Perform the final calculation.
