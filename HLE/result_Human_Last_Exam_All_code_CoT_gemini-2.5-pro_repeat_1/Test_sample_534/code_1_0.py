    # 1. Define the sets and the point 'a' conceptually.
    # The set P is a shape in R^2 that looks like a rectangle with two antennae.
    # P = ([0,1] x {0}) U ({1/3} x [0,1]) U ({2/3} x [0,1]) U ([1/3, 2/3] x {1})
    # The set X is a union of a line segment I and four copies of P.

    # 2. Analyze the problem statement.
    # We need to find the number of connected components of the set S, where S is the intersection
    # of all compact, connected neighborhoods of 'a' within the space X.
    # Let S = Intersect(N) for all N such that:
    #   a) N is a subset of X.
    #   b) N is compact (closed and bounded).
    #   c) N is connected.
    #   d) N is a neighborhood of 'a' in X. This means 'a' is in the interior of N relative to X.
    #      (i.e., there exists an open ball B in R^3 around 'a' such that (B intersect X) is a subset of N).

    # 3. Restrict S to a smaller subset of X.
    # Let P_0 = {0} x P. This is the copy of P in the yz-plane (x=0).

    # P_0 is a compact and connected subset of X.

    # So, (B intersect X) is a subset of P_0.

    # Let's consider the set N_L = L.
    # N_L is compact and connected.
    # N_L is a neighborhood of 'a' because a small ball around 'a' intersects X only along this line segment.
    # N_L does not contain any point from the "loop" part of P_0 (e.g., p = (0, 1/2, 1)).
    # So, no point from the loop part can be in S.

    # Let p be a point in L other than 'a', for example p = (0, 0.5, 0).
    # We want to construct a C.C.N. of 'a' that does not contain p.
    # Consider the set N_p = {(0, y, 0) | y in [0.8, 1]}.
    # - N_p is compact (a closed line segment).
    # - N_p is connected (it's a line segment).
