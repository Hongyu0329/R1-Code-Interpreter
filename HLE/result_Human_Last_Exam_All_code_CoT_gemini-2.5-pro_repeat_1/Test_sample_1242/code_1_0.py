    In psycholinguistics, the complexity of an individual word is most strongly predicted by features that describe the word itself, not the text it appears in.

    1.  Features like 'number of unique words' and 'number of word categories' are text-level metrics, measuring the diversity of a whole document, not the difficulty of a single word. This disqualifies options A, B, C, and E.

    2.  Option D includes the most powerful and well-established word-level predictors:
        - Word Length & Syllable Count: Measures of orthographic and phonological complexity.
        - Word Familiarity Rating: A measure of frequency, the single strongest predictor of word recognition speed.
        - Concreteness Rating: A measure of semantic difficulty, as abstract words are more complex than concrete ones.

    This combination of features effectively models a word's complexity from multiple dimensions (structural, frequency, and semantic).
