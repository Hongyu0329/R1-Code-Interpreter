    # Step 1: Define the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition.
    # It posits that anomalies of global symmetries are invariant under renormalization
    # group flow. This means the anomaly calculated in a high-energy (UV) theory
    # must be precisely matched by the anomaly in the corresponding low-energy (IR) theory.

    # Step 2: Analyze its main physical consequence.
    # Because the low-energy physics must successfully reproduce the anomaly, this principle
    # acts as a powerful, non-perturbative check on any proposed low-energy effective theory.
    # If a candidate IR theory does not have the right degrees of freedom or symmetry
    # breaking pattern to match the UV anomaly, that theory is ruled out.

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on this understanding.
    # - Option A (Preservation of global symmetries) is incorrect.
    # - Option B (Consistency of UV and IR anomalies) describes the condition itself, not its primary implication.
    # - Option D (Requirement of anomaly cancellation) confuses global with gauge anomalies.
    # - Options F, G, H, I, J describe specific consequences or applications, but they are all
    #   subsets of a more general concept.
    # - Option C (Constraint on low-energy effective theories) best captures the overarching
    #   physical implication. The condition's primary use and consequence is to constrain
    #   the possibilities for what can happen at low energies.

    # Step 4: Select the best answer.

    explanation = "The most fundamental physical implication of the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is that it serves as a powerful, non-perturbative constraint on the structure and content of any valid low-energy effective theory derived from a given UV theory."
