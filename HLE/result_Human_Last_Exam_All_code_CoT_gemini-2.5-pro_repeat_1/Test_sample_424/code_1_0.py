def solve_planar_set_problem():
    """
    This function identifies and counts the points in a given planar set
    whose removal would disconnect the set into three or more components.

    The planar set is the union of:
    1. The unit circle.
    2. The line segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2].
    3. The line segment [1/2, 3/2] x {0}.
    4. The line segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}.
    5. The line segment {0} x [-3/2, -1/2].
    6. The line segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}.
    7. The bottom-right quarter of the circle of radius 3/2.

    Analysis shows the entire figure is connected. We are looking for articulation
    points where 3 or more paths meet. Removing such a point disconnects the
    figure into a number of components equal to the number of paths.
