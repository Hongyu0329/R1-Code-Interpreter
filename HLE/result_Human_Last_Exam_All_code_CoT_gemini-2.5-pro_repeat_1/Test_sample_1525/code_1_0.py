# The user wants me to count the number of correct statements from the list A, B, C, D, E.
# Based on a logical analysis of the provided text:
# Statement A is correct because the "order of appearance" is not well-defined for a Datalog program, making the segregation operator ambiguous.
# Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the central claim and its reasoning about the operators is flawed.
# Statement C is correct because aggregation is a lossy operation, and segregation does not guarantee the recovery of the original program (i.e., gamma^-1[gamma[P]] != P in general).
# Statement D is correct because the ambiguity in the segregation definition, as pointed out in A, also makes its application to sets of facts unclear.
# Statement E is incorrect because it contains the false assertion that the refinement operation has "no effect".

# The correct statements are A, C, and D.
# The total number of correct statements is 3.

correct_statement_count = 3
