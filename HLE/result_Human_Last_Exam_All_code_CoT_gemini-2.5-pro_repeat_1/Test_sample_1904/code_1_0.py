# Step 1: Define the properties of the chosen space X.
# X is a countably infinite set with the metric d(x, y) = 1 if x != y, and 0 if x == y.
# This space is ultrametric, totally disconnected, has infinitely many points, and is bounded.

# Step 2: Determine the possible diameters of non-empty closed subsets of X.
# A non-empty closed subset A can have one or more points.

# Case A: A is a singleton set, e.g., A = {x_i}.
# The diameter is sup{d(a, b) for a, b in A} = d(x_i, x_i) = 0.
diameter_singleton = 0

# Case B: A has more than one point, e.g., A = {x_i, x_j, ...} with i != j.
# The diameter is sup{d(a, b) for a, b in A}.
# Since A has at least two distinct points x_i and x_j, d(x_i, x_j) = 1.
# The supremum must be at least 1.
# Since d(a, b) is always 0 or 1, the supremum is 1.
diameter_multi_point_set = 1

# The set of all possible diameters is {0, 1}.
possible_diameters = {diameter_singleton, diameter_multi_point_set}

# Step 3: Apply the theorem connecting components to diameters.
# For a bounded ultrametric space X, the connected components of CL(X)
# are precisely the collections of sets with the same diameter.
# The number of connected components is the number of possible distinct diameters.
num_components = len(possible_diameters)

# Step 4: State the conclusion.
# Since X is totally disconnected, CL(X) is not connected, so the number of components must be > 1.
# We have found a space for which the number is 2.
# Therefore, the minimum possible number is 2.
