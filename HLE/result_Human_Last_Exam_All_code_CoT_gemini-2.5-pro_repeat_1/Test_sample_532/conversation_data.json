    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically group theory. I will provide the derivation of the answer and present it within a Python script that outlines the logical steps.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Terms**: I will start by clarifying the definitions of a \"product-free set\" and a \"filled group\". A key clarification is that a group `G` is called filled if the union of its maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {1}`, where `1` is the identity element.\n2.  **State a Key Theorem**: There is a known characterization for filled groups: a finite group `G` is filled if and only if it has no normal subgroup of index 2.\n3.  **Analyze Nilpotent Groups**: A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n4.  **Combine the Concepts**: I will apply the characterization of filled groups to the structure of nilpotent groups. I will analyze when a finite nilpotent group can have a normal subgroup of index 2.\n5.  **Derive the Conclusion**: A nilpotent group `G` has a normal subgroup of index 2 if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup is non-trivial. Therefore, for `G` to be filled, its Sylow 2-subgroup must be trivial, which means `G` must have an odd order.\n6.  **Final Answer**: The finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite nilpotent groups of odd order. I will present this reasoning within a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef find_finite_filled_nilpotent_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to determine the characterization of\n    all finite filled nilpotent groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: What are the finite filled nilpotent groups?\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Understanding the Definitions\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"1.
