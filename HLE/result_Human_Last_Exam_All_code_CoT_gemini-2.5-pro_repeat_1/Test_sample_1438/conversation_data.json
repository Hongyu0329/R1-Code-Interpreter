    "To address your question, we must first understand how the Pauli exclusion principle is handled in the path integral formalism.\n\n1.  **Grassmann Variables:** The path integral for fermions utilizes special mathematical objects known as Grassmann variables (e.g., `η`). These are anticommuting numbers, meaning for any two Grassmann variables `η₁` and `η₂`, they adhere to the property `η₁η₂ = -η₂η₁`.\n\n2.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** A direct result of this anticommuting nature is that the square of any single Grassmann variable is zero: `η² = 0`. This is the mathematical reflection of the Pauli exclusion principle—a single fermionic state cannot be occupied more than once, just as a Grassmann variable cannot be squared.\n\n3.  **Integral Measure:** The integration \"measure,\" symbolized as `dη`, is not a number in the conventional sense. Instead, it is a symbolic element defined by the rules of Berezin integration.\n\n4.  **Normalization (The \"Value\"):** The core rules for integrating over a single Grassmann variable `η` are:\n    *   `∫ dη = 0`\n    *   `∫ dη η = 1`\n\n    The \"value\" you are asking about is best understood as this normalization convention. The integral is defined to yield a value of **1** when integrating over the variable itself. This specific normalization is fundamental to the consistency and computational utility of the formalism.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this essential normalization rule, which effectively represents the \"value\" of the integral measure in practice.\n\n```python\ndef print_grassmann_integral_normalization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the fundamental normalization rule for the\n    Berezin integral over a single Grassmann variable. This rule\n    is key to maintaining consistency with the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the normalization equation: ∫ dη η = 1\n    integral_symbol = \"\\u222B\"  # Unicode for the integral sign\n    measure_symbol = \"dη\"\n    variable_symbol = \"η\"\n    equals_symbol = \"=\"\n    normalization_value = 1\n\n    print(\"In the path integral formalism, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded\")\n    print(\"by the property that Grassmann variables square to zero (η² = 0).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe integral measure 'dη' is defined by a set of rules, not a single value.\")\n    print(\"The key normalization rule that defines the integral is:\")\n    \n    # We print the full equation as requested, highlighting each part.\n    # The instruction was: \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # We will print the equation and then the numerical value itself.\n    print(f\"{integral_symbol} {measure_symbol} {variable_symbol} {equals_symbol} {normalization_value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe specific 'value' that results from this normalized integral is:\")\n    print(normalization_value)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_grassmann_integral_normalization()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
