    "To determine the symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram, we need to count the number of ways the components of the diagram can be rearranged without changing its overall structure (topology).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Components:** The problem specifies a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (which we'll interpret as propagators or lines). The simplest and most common scenario for this is in a theory like $\\phi^4$, where two vertices are connected to each other by four distinct lines.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symmetries:**\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical. We can swap their positions, and the diagram remains unchanged. This contributes a factor equal to the factorial of the number of identical vertices.\n    *   **Propagator Permutations:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are also identical. We can interchange any of these four lines with each other, and the diagram's topology is preserved. This contributes a factor equal to the factorial of the number of identical lines.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor, S, is the product of the factors from all identified symmetries.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script to perform these calculations and print the step-by-step equation leading to the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four identical propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be permuted\n    num_vertices = 2\n\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the vertices that can be permuted\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # The symmetry contribution from swapping vertices is n!\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # The symmetry contribution from swapping identical propagators is m!\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of all symmetry contributions\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"Calculating the symmetry factor 'S' for a diagram with 2 vertices and 4 propagators connecting them.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"The total symmetry is the product of the symmetries of its components:\")\n    print(f\"1.
