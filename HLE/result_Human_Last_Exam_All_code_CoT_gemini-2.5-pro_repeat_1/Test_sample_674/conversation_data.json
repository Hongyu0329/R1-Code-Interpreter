    "After analyzing the sequence S4 and trying to find a recursive formula, it appears that there isn't a simple, standard recurrence relation that perfectly generates the entire given sequence. Many known sequences, like the Hofstadter Q-sequence, are similar but do not match.\n\nHowever, one particular recurrence relation, known for generating the Newman-Conway sequence, matches the first five terms of S4 perfectly. It's plausible that this is the intended rule, and the provided sequence S4 has some discrepancies.\n\nThe rule is:\n`s[1] = 1, s[2] = 1`\n`s[n] = s[s[n-1]] + s[n-1-s[n-1]]`\n\nLet's trace the first few terms with this rule:\n*   `s[1] = 1`\n*   `s[2] = 1`\n*   `s[3] = s[s[2]] + s[3-1-s[2]] = s[1] + s[2-1] = s[1] + s[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   `s[4] = s[s[3]] + s[4-1-s[3]] = s[2] + s[3-2] = s[2] + s[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   `s[5] = s[s[4]] + s[5-1-s[4]] = s[2] + s[4-2] = s[2] + s[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   `s[6] = s[s[5]] + s[6-1-s[5]] = s[2] + s[5-2] = s[2] + s[3] = 1 + 2 = 3` (This is where it first differs from S4, which has s[6]=4)\n\nThe following Python code implements this rule to generate the sequence.\n\n```python\ndef generate_sequence_s4(num_terms):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a sequence based on the deduced rule R(s[n]) = s[s[n-1]] + s[n-1-s[n-1]].\n    Note: The generated sequence matches the provided S4 for the first 5 terms,\n    but diverges afterwards.
