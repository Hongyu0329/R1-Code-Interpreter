    # The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set difference
    # of two cardinals, lambda and mu. The definitions are:
    # lambda: min |F| such that for all g, there is an f in F where f and g agree on a set of size kappa^+.
    # mu: min |F| such that for all g, there is an f in F where f is greater than or equal to g on a set of size kappa^+.

    # Step 1: Establish the relationship between mu and lambda.
    # If a function f equals g on a set A, it also holds that f is greater than or equal to g on A.
    # This means any set of functions F that satisfies the condition for lambda also satisfies it for mu.
    # Therefore, it is a theorem in ZFC that mu <= lambda.
    
    # Step 2: Simplify the quantity to be maximized.
    # We want to find the maximum cardinality of max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu}).
    # Since mu <= lambda, this simplifies to the set lambda \ mu.
    # For infinite cardinals with mu < lambda, the cardinality of this set is lambda.
    # If mu = lambda, the cardinality is 0.
    # To maximize this value, we need to find the maximum possible value of lambda in a model
    # of ZFC where mu is strictly smaller than lambda.

    # Step 3: State the relevant results from advanced set theory.
    # The value of lambda is not fixed in ZFC. However, it has a provable upper bound.
    # A deep result by Saharon Shelah shows that lambda <= (2^kappa)^+.
    # Furthermore, this bound is known to be sharp. This means it is consistent with ZFC
    # that lambda achieves this maximum possible value.
    # It is also consistent that mu can be strictly smaller than lambda in such a model
    # (e.g., mu = kappa^+ while lambda = (2^kappa)^+).

    # Step 4: Conclude the answer.
    # The maximum possible value for lambda is (2^kappa)^+. Therefore, this is the
    # maximum possible cardinality for the set difference in question.

    # Step 5: Format and print the symbolic answer as requested.
    # The variable kappa represents an arbitrary infinite cardinal.
    kappa = "κ"
    
    # Construct the symbolic expression for the answer.
    # The base of the power is 2.
    power_base = "2"
    
    # The final expression is (2^kappa)^+.
    final_answer_expression = f"({power_base}^{kappa})⁺"

    print("The final answer is a symbolic expression derived from set theory.")
    print(f"Let κ be an infinite cardinal.")
    print(f"The maximum possible cardinality of max({{λ,μ}}) \\ min({{λ,μ}}) is:")
    print(final_answer_expression)
    
    # As requested, outputting the number in the final equation.
    # The final expression is Answer = (2^κ)⁺. The number in this expression is 2.
