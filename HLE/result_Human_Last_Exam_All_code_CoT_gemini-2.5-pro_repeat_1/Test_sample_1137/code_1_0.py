    print("Determining the best litigation forum for RE1's claim against RE2.")
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Analysis of the key factors:")
    print("1. Jurisdiction: All parties, offices, and properties are in Ontario, indicating a provincial court is appropriate.")
    print("2. Case Complexity: The dispute involves complex contracts, corporate governance, and financial issues, classifying it as complex commercial litigation.")
    print("3. Monetary Value: The dispute concerns six large commercial properties, placing the value far above the limit for small claims court.")
    print("4. Desired Speed: RE1 wants the case to conclude in the 'shortest amount of time', favoring a forum known for efficiency.")
    print("\nEvaluating the options:")

    print("\nA. Ontario Court of Appeal: This is an appellate court that hears appeals from lower courts. Litigation cannot be commenced here. This option is incorrect.")

    print("\nD. Small Claims Court: This court's jurisdiction is limited to claims of $35,000 or less. The value of this dispute is much higher. This option is incorrect.")

    print("\nE. Federal Court of Canada: This court's jurisdiction is limited to matters under federal law. This dispute, concerning contracts and property, falls under provincial law. This option is incorrect.")

    print("\nC. Superior Court of Justice: This is the appropriate court of general jurisdiction for this type of claim. While a valid option, it may not be the *best* one for a speedy resolution.")

    print("\nB. Commercial List: This is a specialized list within the Superior Court of Justice. It is specifically designed to manage and adjudicate complex commercial cases efficiently. It uses active case management by specialized judges to ensure matters proceed without delay. Given the complexity and the expressed need for speed, this is the most suitable forum.")

    print("\n------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: The Commercial List is the best choice because it specializes in the efficient resolution of complex commercial disputes like this one.")
