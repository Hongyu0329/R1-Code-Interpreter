# This problem is solved analytically. This code serves to formalize the steps and calculate the final result.

# Step 1: Find the optimal strategy F for agent B.
# Agent A's winning probability for a given F is P(A wins | F) = max(F, 1-F).
# Agent B wants to minimize this probability.
# The minimum of max(F, 1-F) occurs when F = 1-F, which is F = 0.5.
F_optimal = 0.5

# Step 2: Calculate the minimized probability of A winning with this optimal F.
# P(A wins) = max(0.5, 1 - 0.5)
minimized_prob_A_wins = 0.5

# Step 3: Calculate the final value as requested by the problem.
# The value is floor(1 / P(A wins)).
inverse_prob = 1 / minimized_prob_A_wins
final_value = math.floor(inverse_prob)

# Output the components of the final calculation as requested.
print(f"The minimized probability, P(A wins), is {minimized_prob_A_wins}.")
print(f"The final equation is: floor(1 / {minimized_prob_A_wins})")
print(f"The value of the fraction is: {inverse_prob}")
print(f"The floor of the fraction is: {final_value}")
