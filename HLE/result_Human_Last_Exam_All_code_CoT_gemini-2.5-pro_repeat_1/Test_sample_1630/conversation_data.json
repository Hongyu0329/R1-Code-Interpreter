    "Answering this question requires us to determine the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, subject to the given conditions on the polynomials $f$ and $g$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** Determine the degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The number of solutions to $h(x) = x$ is limited by the degree of the polynomial $h(x) - x$.\n2.  **Show the upper bound is achievable:** We need to demonstrate that there exists at least one pair of polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and for which the equation $f(g(x)) = x$ has the maximum possible number of real roots.\n3.  **Construct an example:** A constructive approach provides the most convincing evidence. We can build suitable $f$ and $g$ by perturbing known polynomials with many real roots for a related problem. Chebyshev polynomials are an excellent choice for this.\n4.  **Use Python to verify:** Write a Python script to define the constructed polynomials and numerically find the roots of $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ to confirm that there are indeed 9 distinct real roots.\n\nThis plan leads to the following Python code, which carries out the argument and verification.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.polynomial.polynomial as P\n\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning for the maximum number of fixed points\n    and verifies it with a concrete example using numerical computation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Theoretical Maximum\n    # Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials of degree 3.\n    # The composition h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = 9.\n    # A fixed point is a solution to h(x) = x, or h(x) - x = 0.\n    # The degree of h(x) - x is 9.\n    # By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 has at most 9 real roots.\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing the upper bound\")\n    print(\"The function f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = 9.\")\n    print(\"The equation for fixed points, f(g(x)) - x = 0, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Achieving the maximum\n    # To show that 9 fixed points are possible, we need to construct f(x) and g(x) such that:\n    # 1.
