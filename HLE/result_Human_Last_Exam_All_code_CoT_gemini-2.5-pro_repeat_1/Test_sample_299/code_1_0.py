    explanation = """
Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, |S|.

Step 1: Monotonicity of the function f
The function f must be injective because if f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2), implying x1 = x2.
A continuous and injective function on R must be strictly monotonic. So, f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

Step 2: Case of f being strictly decreasing
If f is strictly decreasing, f(f(x)) is strictly increasing, which is consistent with exp(x).
A detailed analysis shows that if f is a decreasing solution, there must be a real number c such that f(c) = 0.
From this, we can derive the following values based on the original equation:
- f(f(c)) = f(0)
- f(f(c)) = exp(c)
- Therefore, we have the point f(0) = exp(c).

Also, by applying f again:
- f(f(0)) = f(exp(c))
- f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1
- Therefore, we have the point f(exp(c)) = 1.

For any real number c, it is true that c < exp(c). Since f is strictly decreasing, this implies f(c) > f(exp(c)).
Substituting the values we found, f(c) = 0 and f(exp(c)) = 1, we get the inequality:
0 > 1
This is a contradiction. Thus, there are no strictly decreasing solutions.

Step 3: Case of f being strictly increasing
If f is increasing, the composition f(f(x)) is also increasing.
Analysis of the function's properties shows that for any increasing solution f, there exists a unique negative real number 'a' such that a = lim(x -> -infinity) f(x) and f(a) = 0.
Solutions can be constructed based on these properties. The construction depends on two choices:
1. A choice of the negative real number 'a'.
2. A choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function h that maps the interval [a, 0] to [0, exp(a)].

This initial function segment h can be uniquely extended to a valid solution f over the entire real line R.
The number of ways to choose the function h for a fixed 'a' is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
The number of ways to choose 'a' from the interval (-infinity, 0) is also c.
Since the sets of solutions for different values of 'a' are disjoint, the total number of increasing solutions is c * c = c.

Step 4: Conclusion
The set of solutions only contains strictly increasing functions.
The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, c.
