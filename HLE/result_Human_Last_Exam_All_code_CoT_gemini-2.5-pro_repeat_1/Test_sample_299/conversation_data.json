    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the function's properties**: Show that any solution `f` must be continuous and strictly monotonic. This splits the problem into two cases: `f` is strictly increasing or `f` is strictly decreasing.\n2.  **Rule out decreasing solutions**: Prove that the case where `f` is strictly decreasing leads to a logical contradiction ($0 > 1$), meaning no such solutions exist. The proof involves evaluating the function at specific points derived from the properties of `f`, such as `f(c)=0`, `f(0)=exp(c)`, and `f(exp(c))=1`.\n3.  **Analyze increasing solutions**: Show that solutions exist for the strictly increasing case. These solutions can be constructed and are parameterized by two choices: a negative real number `a` (where `f(a) = 0`), and an arbitrary continuous increasing function `h` over the interval `[a, 0]`.\n4.  **Count the solutions**: Determine the cardinality of the set of valid constructive choices. For each choice of `a` from an uncountable set, there is an uncountable number of choices for `h`. This implies that the total number of solutions is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n5.  **Final Code**: The provided Python script will print the step-by-step logical argument that leads to the conclusion and then state the final answer for the cardinality.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the problem of finding the cardinality\n    of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    The problem is theoretical, not computational, so the code prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nLet S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x). We want to find the cardinality of S, |S|.\n\nStep 1: Monotonicity of the function f\nThe function f must be injective because if f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2), implying x1 = x2.\nA continuous and injective function on R must be strictly monotonic. So, f is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\nStep 2: Case of f being strictly decreasing\nIf f is strictly decreasing, f(f(x)) is strictly increasing, which is consistent with exp(x).\nA detailed analysis shows that if f is a decreasing solution, there must be a real number c such that f(c) = 0.\nFrom this, we can derive the following values based on the original equation:\n- f(f(c)) = f(0)\n- f(f(c)) = exp(c)\n- Therefore, we have the point f(0) = exp(c).\n\nAlso, by applying f again:\n- f(f(0)) = f(exp(c))\n- f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1\n- Therefore, we have the point f(exp(c)) = 1.\n\nFor any real number c, it is true that c < exp(c). Since f is strictly decreasing, this implies f(c) > f(exp(c)).\nSubstituting the values we found, f(c) = 0 and f(exp(c)) = 1, we get the inequality:\n0 > 1\nThis is a contradiction. Thus, there are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n\nStep 3: Case of f being strictly increasing\nIf f is increasing, the composition f(f(x)) is also increasing.\nAnalysis of the function's properties shows that for any increasing solution f, there exists a unique negative real number 'a' such that a = lim(x -> -infinity) f(x) and f(a) = 0.\nSolutions can be constructed based on these properties. The construction depends on two choices:\n1. A choice of the negative real number 'a'.\n2. A choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function h that maps the interval [a, 0] to [0, exp(a)].\n\nThis initial function segment h can be uniquely extended to a valid solution f over the entire real line R.\nThe number of ways to choose the function h for a fixed 'a' is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\nThe number of ways to choose 'a' from the interval (-infinity, 0) is also c.\nSince the sets of solutions for different values of 'a' are disjoint, the total number of increasing solutions is c * c = c.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nThe set of solutions only contains strictly increasing functions.\nThe cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n\"\"\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n    # The cardinality 'c' is the size of the set of real numbers |R|, also denoted 2^{\\aleph_0}.\n    # The final answer is the name of this cardinality.\n    print(\"The cardinality of the set of such functions is:\")\n\n\nsolve_cardinality_problem()\nprint(\"<<<The cardinality of the continuum (c)>>>\")\n```"
