    This function determines and prints the French equivalent of the name "Odobeccus".
    
    The name "Odobeccus" is a Latinized version of a Germanic (Frankish) name
    from the 5th century. It does not have a direct, one-to-one evolution 
    into a modern French name.

    The name is composed of two parts:
    1. Odo: A Germanic root meaning "wealth" or "possession".
    2. beccus: A suffix, noted by Latin authors as being of Gaulish origin, meaning "beak".

    Since the full name did not survive into the modern language, the standard practice
    is to find the equivalent of the principal root, "Odo". The established French
    form of the name "Odo" is "Eudes".
