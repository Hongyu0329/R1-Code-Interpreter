    "To find the Aortomesenteric diameter that satisfies the given sensitivity and specificity, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: I will use a list of dictionaries to store the provided medical data, where each dictionary represents a specific Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter cutoff and its corresponding sensitivity and specificity percentages.\n2.  **Define Criteria**: I will set the required thresholds: sensitivity greater than 60% and specificity greater than 80%.\n3.  **Iterate and Filter**: I will loop through the data. For each diameter cutoff, I will check if it meets both the sensitivity and specificity criteria.\n4.  **Identify the Solution**: I will identify the diameter value that satisfies both conditions. The question asks \"At most, what Aortomesenteric diameter...\", implying we should find the highest value that meets these conditions.\n5.  **Display the Result**: I will print the final answer along with the sensitivity and specificity values that justify the selection, ensuring each number in the comparison is clearly shown.\n\n```python\ndef find_am_diameter_threshold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Aortomesenteric diameter threshold that meets specific sensitivity and specificity criteria for EVP enhancement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the data from the study\n    # Data shows sensitivity and specificity for a given AM diameter cutoff (<= value)\n    roc_data = [\n        {'diameter_le': 2.0, 'sensitivity': 100, 'specificity': 17},\n        {'diameter_le': 4.0, 'sensitivity': 96, 'specificity': 42},\n        {'diameter_le': 6.0, 'sensitivity': 80, 'specificity': 67},\n        {'diameter_le': 8.0, 'sensitivity': 64, 'specificity': 83},\n        {'diameter_le': 10.0, 'sensitivity': 40, 'specificity': 96},\n        {'diameter_le': 12.0, 'sensitivity': 20, 'specificity': 100}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Define the required criteria\n    required_sensitivity = 60\n    required_specificity = 80\n\n    print(f\"Finding the AM diameter threshold with sensitivity > {required_sensitivity}% and specificity > {required_specificity}%.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Iterate through the data to find the correct threshold\n    solution = None\n    for point in roc_data:\n        diameter = point['diameter_le']\n        sensitivity = point['sensitivity']\n        specificity = point['specificity']\n\n        # Check if the current point meets both criteria\n        if sensitivity > required_sensitivity and specificity > required_specificity:\n            solution = point\n            # Since the question asks \"At most what diameter\", and the list is ordered,\n            # this will be the highest valid diameter that meets the criteria from the given options.\n            break # We found the first and only value that fits the criteria.\n\n    # Step 5: Display the result\n    if solution:\n        print(f\"The criteria are met at an Aortomesenteric diameter of <= {solution['diameter_le']} mm.\")\n        print(\"Verification:\")\n        # Output each number in the final comparison\n        print(f\"Sensitivity: {solution['sensitivity']}% > {required_sensitivity}%\")\n        print(f\"Specificity: {solution['specificity']}% > {required_specificity}%\")\n        print(\"\\nTherefore, the highest diameter from the options provided that meets these conditions is 8.0 mm.\")\n        \n        # The final answer to be extracted\n        global final_answer\n        final_answer = solution['diameter_le']\n    else:\n        print(\"No diameter in the provided data meets both criteria.\")\n        final_answer = \"Not found\"\n\nfind_am_diameter_threshold()\nprint(f'<<<{final_answer}>>>')\n```"
