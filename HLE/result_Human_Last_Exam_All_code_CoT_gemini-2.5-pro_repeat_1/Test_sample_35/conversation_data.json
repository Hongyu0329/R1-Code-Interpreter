    "Of course, let's break down this poker scenario to find the optimal play.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Poker Scenario:** We'll establish the key variables: your stack size (16 big blinds), your position (UTG+1), and the tournament situation (near the money bubble).\n2.  **Analyze the Impact of the Bubble:** The money bubble is a critical factor. Opponents will play much tighter than usual to avoid busting out and missing the cash. This means they will only call your all-in with a very strong range of hands. This increases your \"fold equity\" â€“ the chance you win the pot uncontested.\n3.  **Establish a Calling Range:** We'll assume a reasonable, tight calling range for an opponent behind you, something like `99+, AQs+, AKo`.\n4.  **Calculate Expected Value (EV):** For each hand choice, we will calculate the EV of going all-in. The calculation is:\n    `EV(shove) = (Probability_everyone_folds * Pot_won) + (Probability_of_call * EV_when_called)`\n    A positive EV means the play is profitable compared to folding (which has an EV of 0).\n5.  **Compare the Options:** We will compare the EV of shoving for each hand (`QJs`, `99`, `AJo`, `AKo`) to determine the most profitable play. The hand with the highest EV is the one you *should* jam.\n\nLet's execute this plan using Python.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the best shoving hand.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
