    "The user is asking a literary question about William Morris's novel, \"The House of the Wolfings\". The task is to identify a specific character.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Recall or research the plot and characters of \"The House of the Wolfings\".\n2.  Specifically look for a character who has been to a Roman city.\n3.  Identify the passage where this character describes Roman customs, looking for references to a she-wolf and founders, which would allude to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n4.  Once the character is identified, I will present the answer in a Python script as requested by the prompt format, using a `print` function to display the name.\n\nThe character in question is Otter. In Chapter IV, \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" he recounts his time as a captive. He describes the Romans' origin myth, stating they worship a she-wolf who suckled their first \"king-folk,\" a clear reference to Romulus and Remus. I will now create the Python code to output this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the user's literary question by identifying the correct character.\n# The question is about William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" and a character\n# who describes Roman religion in a way that alludes to the Romulus and Remus myth.\n\n# The character's name is Otter.\ncharacter = \"Otter\"\n\n# In Chapter IV, Otter, a former captive of the Romans, describes their origin story.\n# He tells his kinsfolk that the Romans worship a she-wolf who suckled their founders,\n# which is a direct reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\nprint(f\"The character who visited a Roman city and described their religious practices is: {character}\")\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
