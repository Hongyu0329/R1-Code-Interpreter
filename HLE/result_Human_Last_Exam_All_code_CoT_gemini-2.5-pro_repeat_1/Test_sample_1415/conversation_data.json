    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to be evaluated is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This is a standard logarithmic derivative form. The antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Using the antiderivative, the definite integral is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(x) at the limits:**\n    *   First, let's determine the full expression for `F₃(x)`:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Now, evaluate `F₃(x)` at `x = 1` and `x = 0`:\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate the Value of the Integral (V):**\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n    *   `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n    *   Using logarithm properties, this can be written as `V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is to compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to perform these calculations accurately using the `math` module. The script will print out the values for `F₃(1)`, `F₃(0)`, the integral `V`, and the final requested integer value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the functions for clarity, although not strictly necessary for the final calculation\ndef F0(x):\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n# Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\nF3_at_1 = F3(1)\nF3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The final equation for the integral V is: V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n# Let's print the numbers in this equation\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(1) is: {F3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of F₃(0) is: {F3_at_0}\")\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral, V\nV = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V}\")\n\n# Calculate the final result as requested\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {final_result}\")\n\nprint(\"<<<{}>>>\".format(final_result))\n```"
