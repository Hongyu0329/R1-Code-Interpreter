    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I need to understand what kind of sound a human muscle twitch produces. Muscle contractions generate very low-frequency sounds, which fall into the category of infrasound (sound below 20 Hz).\n2.  Next, I will analyze the hearing capabilities of each animal listed in the answer choices, specifically focusing on their ability to perceive low-frequency sounds or infrasound.\n3.  I will compare these abilities to determine which animal is the most likely candidate.\n4.  The python code will then print out this step-by-step analysis, including the hearing ranges of the animals, to demonstrate the reasoning.\n5.  The final part of the script will present the conclusion in a format that resembles a logical equation, showing that the herring's hearing range is the one that best matches the frequency of a muscle twitch.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing capabilities of different animals to determine\n    which one might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the sound source.\")\n    print(\"A human muscle twitch produces very low-frequency sound, known as infrasound (typically below 20 Hz).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Analyze the hearing range of each animal.\")\n    print(\" - E. Human: The typical human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. We cannot hear infrasound.\")\n    print(\" - A. Dog: Hearing range is approximately 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz. Better than humans for high frequencies, but not specialized for infrasound.\")\n    print(\" - B. Bat: Famous for using high-frequency ultrasound (20,000 Hz to 200,000 Hz) for echolocation. Not adapted for infrasound.\")\n    print(\" - D. Whale: Baleen whales are known to use infrasound (as low as 10-20 Hz) for long-distance communication. They are sensitive to low frequencies.\")\n    print(\" - C. Herring: This fish has an exceptionally wide hearing range. It can detect sounds from below 1 Hz (infrasound) up to 180,000 Hz (ultrasound). This unique ability helps it detect predators and other environmental cues.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Compare and conclude.\")\n    print(\"While whales have good infrasound hearing, specific research has demonstrated that certain fish, like goldfish (related to herring), can detect the faint, low-frequency pressure waves created by human muscle contractions. The herring's auditory system is highly adapted to perceive such vibrations in the water.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: The Final Equation (Logical Deduction)\")\n    print(\"Let F_twitch be the frequency of a muscle twitch.\")\n    print(\"Let F_human_min be the minimum frequency a human can hear.\")\n    print(\"Let F_herring_min be the minimum frequency a herring can hear.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe know the following:\")\n    print(\"F_twitch < 20 Hz\")\n    print(\"F_human_min = 20 Hz\")\n    print(\"F_herring_min < 1 Hz\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final logical statement is:\")\n    print(\"F_herring_min < F_twitch < F_human_min\")\n    print(\"\\nThis shows that a herring is capable of hearing a sound that is too low for a human to hear.\")\n\nsolve_animal_hearing_puzzle()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
