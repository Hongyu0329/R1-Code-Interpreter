# The problem asks for the stable commutator length (scl) of the element g1*h2.
# However, scl is defined for elements of the commutator subgroup.
# The element g1*h2 is not in the commutator subgroup of G1*G2, since its
# image in the abelianization, given by the translation numbers (2/27, 16/27), is not zero.
# We assume the question contains a typo and meant to ask for the scl of the commutator [g1, h2].

# The translation number of g is tau_g.
tau_g_num = 2
tau_g_den = 27
tau_g = Fraction(tau_g_num, tau_g_den)

# The translation number of h is tau_h.
tau_h_num = 16
tau_h_den = 27
tau_h = Fraction(tau_h_num, tau_h_den)

# The formula for the scl of a commutator [a, b] in a free product A*B is
# scl([a,b]) = (1/2) * |tau_A(a) * tau_B(b)|, analogous to the known result for Z*Z.
scl_val = Fraction(1, 2) * tau_g * tau_h

# Print the calculation and the result.
print(f"Assuming the query is for scl([g1, h2]), the calculation is:")
print(f"scl([g1, h2]) = 1/2 * |tau(g1)| * |tau(h2)|")
print(f"= 1/2 * {tau_g.numerator}/{tau_g.denominator} * {tau_h.numerator}/{tau_h.denominator}")
print(f"= {scl_val.numerator}/{scl_val.denominator}")
