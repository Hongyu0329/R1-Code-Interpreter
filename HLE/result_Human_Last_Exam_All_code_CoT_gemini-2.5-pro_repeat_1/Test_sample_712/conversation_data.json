    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is to first use my knowledge base to identify the specific genus of bacterium known for producing a compound that exhibits triboluminescence. Then, I will create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear and informative answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_triboluminescent_bacterium():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the genus of bacterium\n    known for producing a triboluminescent compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus of the bacterium in question.\n    genus = \"Photorhabdus\"\n    \n    # The property being discussed.\n    property_name = \"triboluminescence\"\n    \n    # The specific species often cited for this property.\n    species = \"Photorhabdus luminescens\"\n    \n    # A description of the compound.\n    compound_description = \"crystals of a luciferase enzyme complex\"\n\n    # Print the information in a clear, formatted way.\n    print(f\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting {property_name} is: {genus}\")\n    print(f\"Specifically, species like {species} produce {compound_description} that emit light when mechanically disturbed (e.g., shaken or crushed).\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_triboluminescent_bacterium()\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
