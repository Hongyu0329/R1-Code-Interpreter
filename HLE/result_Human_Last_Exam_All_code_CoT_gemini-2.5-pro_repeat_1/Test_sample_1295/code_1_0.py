    """
    This function generates the SMILES representation of a molecule based on a complex set of constraints.
    
    The constraints provided (e.g., molecular weight, atom counts, functional groups, H-bond properties) are partially contradictory.
    The chosen structure represents the best possible fit, satisfying the core quantitative and structural requirements.
    
    The molecule is 1,2-bis(1-amino-N-propylmethanimidoyl)diazene.
    - Molecular Formula: C8H18N6
    - Molecular Weight: ~198.159 Da
    - Valence Electrons: 80
    - Heavy Atoms: 14 (8 Carbon, 6 Nitrogen)
    - Functional Groups: 2 amidines, 1 azo group
    - H-Bond Donors: 4 (from two -NH2 groups)
    - Rotatable Bonds: 4
    
    This structure is the most logical solution despite inconsistencies in the prompt's description of amine types and NH group counts.
