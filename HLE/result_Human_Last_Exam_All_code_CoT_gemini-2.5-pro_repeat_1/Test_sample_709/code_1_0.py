    print("2.  'ox: The number 'three'.")

    print("4.  ta: Preposition meaning 'in' or 'at'.")
    print("5.  batz'i k'op: Literally 'true language' or 'genuine language'. It's the term Tzotzil speakers use for their own language, so it translates well to 'native language' or 'original language'.")
    print("6.  jna: A possessed noun. 'na' means 'house' and 'j-' is the possessive for 'my'. So, 'jna' means 'my house'.")
    print("7.  junabi: An adverb of time meaning 'last year'.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Reconstructing the sentence meaning:")
    print("The presence of 'junabi' (last year) sets the tense to the past, so 'Oy' becomes 'There was'.")
    print("The phrase ''ox k'op' (three words/talk) followed by 'ta batz'i k'op' (in the native language) suggests a conversation.")
    print("While ''ox' literally means 'three', it's likely used idiomatically to mean 'some' or 'a bit of', making ''ox k'op' mean 'a talk' or 'a discussion'. A literal translation of 'three words' does not fit the context of the best answer choices.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Assembled translation:")
    print("Combining the parts: 'There was' (Oy) + 'talk' ('ox k'op) + 'in the native language' (ta batz'i k'op) + 'at my house' (ta jna) + 'last year' (junabi).")
    print("This gives us: 'There was talk in the native language at my house last year.'")

    print("Evaluating the choices:")
    print("A, F: Wrong tense ('are') and location.")
    print("B: Wrong location ('my village') and time ('yesterday').")

    print("D and H are the closest choices.")
    print("D: 'There was talk in Tzotzil at my house last year.'")
    print("H: 'There was talk in my native language at my house last year.'")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Choice H is the superior translation. It uses 'my native language', which is a more faithful translation of 'batz'i k'op' (the 'true language' from the speaker's perspective). It also creates a natural parallel with 'jna' ('my house').")
