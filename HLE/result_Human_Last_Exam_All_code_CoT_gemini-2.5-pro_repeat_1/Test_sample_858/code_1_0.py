    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze definitions and establish the key property.
    # A continuum X is a compact connected Hausdorff space.
    # X is aposyndetic if for any distinct x, y in X, there's a continuum K
    # such that x is in the interior of K, and K does not contain y.
    # A point p is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a dense, continuum-connected subset.
    #
    # We will show that in an aposyndetic continuum X, the set of non-block points is X itself.

    # Step 3: Prove that every point p in an aposyndetic continuum X is a non-block point.
    # Let p be any point in X. We show that S = X \ {p} is continuum-connected.
    # Let x and y be any two points in S.
    # By the definition of aposyndesis, for any point z in S, there is a continuum K_z
    # such that z is in Int(K_z) and p is not in K_z. Thus, K_z is a subset of S.
    # The collection of these interiors, {Int(K_z)}, forms an open cover of S.
    # A theorem by F. B. Jones (1951) states that if X is aposyndetic, X \ {p} is connected.
    # Since S is connected, there exists a finite chain of these open sets connecting x and y.
    # Let this chain be Int(K_1), Int(K_2), ..., Int(K_n).
    # The union of this chain of intersecting continua, H = K_1 U K_2 U ... U K_n, is itself a continuum.
    # This continuum H contains both x and y and is a subset of S.
    # Thus, S = X \ {p} is continuum-connected. Since S is dense in itself, p is a non-block point.
    # As p was arbitrary, all points in X are non-block points.

    # Step 4: Reframe the question.
    # The problem is now equivalent to finding the smallest possible cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.

    # Step 5 & 6: Find and verify the smallest example.
    # Consider the simplest continuum: a space with a single point, X = {p}.
    # - Is it a continuum? Yes, it is compact, connected, and Hausdorff.
    # - Is it aposyndetic? The condition is "for every two distinct points...". Since there are no
    #   two distinct points, the condition is vacuously true. So, yes, it is aposyndetic.
    
    # Step 7: Conclude the cardinality.
    # The smallest aposyndetic continuum is a single-point space, which has cardinality 1.
    # Since the set of non-block points is the entire space, its cardinality is also 1.
    
    smallest_cardinality = 1

    print("The key insight is that for any aposyndetic continuum X, the set of non-block points is the entire space X.")
    print("Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest possible cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.")
    print("A single-point space is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff) and is vacuously aposyndetic.")
    print("The cardinality of this space is 1.")
