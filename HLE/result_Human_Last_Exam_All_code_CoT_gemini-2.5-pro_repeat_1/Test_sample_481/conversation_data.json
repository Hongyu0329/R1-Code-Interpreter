    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for both 10mg and 20mg dosages. I will use my knowledge base to find this information, making sure to exclude any text, color, or size details as requested by the user.\n\n1.  **Identify Imprint for 10mg:** I will find the specific numerical code used on Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsules.\n2.  **Identify Imprint for 20mg:** I will find the specific numerical code used on Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsules.\n3.  **Construct Python Script:** I will create a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and then prints a clear statement identifying which number corresponds to which dosage. The script will output the final answer directly.\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is 3105.\nimprint_10mg = 3105\n\n# The numerical imprint for Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is 3106.\nimprint_20mg = 3106\n\n# Print the findings as requested.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<3105 and 3106>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
