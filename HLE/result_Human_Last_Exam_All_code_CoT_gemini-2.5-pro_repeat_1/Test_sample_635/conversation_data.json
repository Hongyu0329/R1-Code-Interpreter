    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix (i.e., its determinant is not the zero polynomial).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\n\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Since $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be polynomial matrices, the product $D(s)H(s)$ must also result in a polynomial matrix. Let's denote the elements of $D(s)$ as:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, we compute the product $D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Derive conditions for $D(s)$**\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its elements must be polynomials.\n-   The elements $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ are already polynomials by definition of $D(s)$.\n-   The elements $n_{11}(s)$ and $n_{21}(s)$ must also be polynomials. Let's write them over the common denominator $s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$:\n    \\[\n    n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}\n    \\]\nFor these expressions to be polynomials, the numerators must be divisible by the denominator, $s^2-1$. This means the numerators must be zero at the roots of the denominator, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nFor $n_{11}(s)$:\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n\nFor $n_{21}(s)$:\n-   At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$.\n-   At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Find a suitable $D(s)$**\n\nWe need to find a simple, non-singular polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these four conditions. Let's build it row by row, aiming for low-degree polynomials.\n\nFor the first row $[d_{11}(s), d_{12}(s)]$:\n-   $d_{12}(1)=0$ implies $d_{12}(s)$ has a factor of $(s-1)$. Let's try $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$.\n-   $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1)=0$. Let's try a constant $d_{11}(s) = a$. This gives $2a + c(-1-1) = 2a-2c=0 \\implies a=c$.\n-   Choosing the simplest non-trivial case, $a=c=1$, we get:\n    $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n\nFor the second row $[d_{21}(s), d_{22}(s)]$:\n-   We need a solution that is linearly independent of the first row. Let's try setting $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n-   The condition $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1)=0$ becomes $d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n-   The condition $d_{22}(1)=0$ remains.\n-   So, $d_{22}(s)$ must have factors $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$, meaning it's divisible by $(s-1)(s+1)=s^2-1$.\n-   The simplest choice is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n\nThis gives us the candidate matrix:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nIts determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = 1(s^2-1) - 0 = s^2-1$, which is not identically zero, so $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $N(s)$**\n\nNow we find the corresponding $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{s^2-1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nSo, $N(s)$ is a constant matrix, which is a valid polynomial matrix.\n\n**Step 5: Verify Coprimeness**\n\nTo verify that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, we check if the matrix $M(s) = [D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$.\n\\[\nM(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rank of this 2x4 matrix is 2 if its two rows are linearly independent. The rows are linearly independent for all $s$ because the first row starts with a non-zero constant (1) while the second row starts with 0. Thus, the first row can never be a multiple of the second, and the second row can only be a multiple of the first if both are zero, which is not possible.\nA more rigorous method is to compute all 2x2 minors of $M(s)$ and find their greatest common divisor (GCD). If the GCD is a non-zero constant, the matrices are coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines the matrices and performs these verification steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # The derived left factorization matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    # --- Verification Step 1: Check if H = D^(-1) * N ---\n    # Calculate D^(-1) * N\n    D_inv_N = D.inv() * N\n    # Simplify the resulting matrix to compare with H\n    verification_H = sympy.simplify(D_inv_N)\n    \n    is_factorization_correct = (verification_H == H)\n\n    # --- Verification Step 2: Check for left coprimeness ---\n    # Form the augmented matrix M = [D, N]\n    M = D.row_join(N)\n    \n    # The matrices are left coprime if the GCD of all 2x2 minors of M is a constant.\n    minors = []\n    # Generate all 2x2 minors\n    for j1 in range(M.shape[1]):\n        for j2 in range(j1 + 1, M.shape[1]):\n            minor_matrix = M[:, [j1, j2]]\n            minors.append(minor_matrix.det())\n            \n    # Calculate the GCD of all the minors\n    if len(minors) > 0:\n        current_gcd = minors[0]\n        for i in range(1, len(minors)):\n            current_gcd = sympy.gcd(current_gcd, minors[i])\n    else:\n        current_gcd = 0\n        \n    # Coprime if the GCD is a non-zero constant\n    is_coprime = sympy.sympify(current_gcd).is_constant() and current_gcd != 0\n\n    # --- Print the results ---\n    print(\"The given transfer function H(s) is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(H)\n    print(\"\\nA left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
