# Based on the analysis, we found the smallest integer n and the infinity norm of W_n.

# The smallest integer n for which f(n) > 10
n = 11

# The infinity norm of the corresponding Weyr matrix W_n
infinity_norm_Wn = 2

# The final calculation is the product of n and the infinity norm of W_n
result = n * infinity_norm_Wn

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: n * ||W_n||_inf = result
