def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the described AI model.

    The problem states that the set of indices 'I' for successful predictors
    is uncomputable. This means the model cannot reliably know in advance which
    of its predictors will succeed. A goal of "achieving predictive success"
    is therefore not "safe" because it may be unachievable.

    A safe goal must be based on what the model *can* do and observe. The model
    can generate predictors from their indices (p.c. function descriptions) and
    observe their behavior. The safest and most fundamental goal is therefore to
    learn about the relationship between a predictor's description and its
    behavior.

    This is a form of learning about the model's own potential components.
