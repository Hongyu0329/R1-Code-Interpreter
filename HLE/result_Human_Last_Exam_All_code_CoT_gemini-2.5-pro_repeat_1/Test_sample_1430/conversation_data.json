    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Curve C:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, is directly related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, $\\rho(Jac(C))$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(Jac(C)) + 1$.\n    This formula holds for any degree $d \\geq 1$. In our case, $d=15$.\n\n2.  **Find the Smallest Possible Rank:** The problem is now to find the smallest possible value of $\\rho(Jac(C))$ for a curve $C$ of genus $g=3$. The Jacobian $Jac(C)$ is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. The rank $\\rho(Jac(C))$ is minimal when the curve $C$ is \"generic\". For a generic curve, the only endomorphisms of its Jacobian are the integers, and its Néron-Severi group is generated by a single element (the class of the principal polarization). Thus, the minimum rank is 1.\n\n3.  **Find the Largest Possible Rank:** To find the largest possible rank, we must consider special \"non-generic\" curves. The maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension $g$ is $g^2$. For our genus $g=3$ case, this maximum is $3^2 = 9$. This maximum is achieved when the Jacobian has the largest possible ring of endomorphisms, for instance, when it is isogenous to the product of $g$ copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM).\n    An example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum rank is the Fermat quartic curve defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of the CM elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$. Therefore, the maximum rank of 9 is indeed achievable for $\\rho(Jac(C))$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ranks for X:** Using the formula from step 1, we can now calculate the smallest and largest ranks for $X = C^{(15)}$:\n    *   Smallest rank: $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(Jac(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest rank: $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(Jac(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and present the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of X = C^(15), where C is a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the relationship between the Neron-Severi ranks.\")\n    print(\"Let X = C^(d) be the d-th symmetric power of a curve C of genus g.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(f\"The formula is: rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1.\")\n    print(\"This means we need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(Jac(C)) for a genus g = {} curve.\".format(g))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Smallest Rank Calculation\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the smallest possible rank.\")\n    # For a generic curve, the Jacobian has End(Jac(C)) = Z.\n    # The Neron-Severi group is generated by the principal polarization.\n    rho_jac_min = 1\n    print(f\"For a generic genus {g} curve, the Jacobian has the minimum possible Neron-Severi rank.\")\n    print(f\"The minimum rank for rho(Jac(C)) is {rho_jac_min}.\")\n\n    rho_x_min = rho_jac_min + 1\n    print(f\"Therefore, the smallest possible rank for rho(X) is rho(Jac(C))_min + 1 = {rho_jac_min} + 1 = {rho_x_min}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Largest Rank Calculation\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the largest possible rank.\")\n    # The maximum possible Neron-Severi rank for an abelian variety of dimension g is g^2.\n    # This is achieved for special curves, e.g., those whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of CM elliptic curves.\n    rho_jac_max = g**2\n    print(f\"The maximum possible Neron-Severi rank for an abelian variety of dimension g is g^2.\")\n    print(f\"For g = {g}, the maximum rank for rho(Jac(C)) is {g}^2 = {rho_jac_max}.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achieved for certain curves, like the Fermat quartic, whose Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of a CM elliptic curve.\")\n\n    rho_x_max = rho_jac_max + 1\n    print(f\"Therefore, the largest possible rank for rho(X) is rho(Jac(C))_max + 1 = {rho_jac_max} + 1 = {rho_x_max}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is {rho_x_min}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is {rho_x_max}.\")\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
