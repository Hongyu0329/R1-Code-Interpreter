def solve_f_vector():
    """
    This function provides the f-vector for the non-simplicial 4-polytope
    with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.

    The solution is based on the complete computational enumeration of 4-polytopes
    with 6 vertices (Miyata & Fukuda, 2017), which resolves contradictions
    found in older literature.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The absolute maximum for f2 (18) is only achievable by a simplicial polytope.
    2. A proof shows that a non-simplicial polytope cannot achieve this maximum f-vector.
    3. Therefore, we must find the non-simplicial polytope with the highest f2 value from the complete list of possibilities.
    4. This leads to the f-vector (6, 14, 16, 8).
