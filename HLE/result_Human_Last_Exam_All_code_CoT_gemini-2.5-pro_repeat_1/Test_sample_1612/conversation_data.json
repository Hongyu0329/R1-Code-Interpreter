    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two different types of Triple Crowns in MLB: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n- The batting Triple Crown is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n- The pitching Triple Crown is awarded to a player who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\nNext, I will count the number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown and the number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to add these two numbers together to find the total number of unique MLB players who have won a Triple Crown. The script will print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# In MLB, there are two types of Triple Crowns: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n# We need to count the unique winners for each category and then sum them up.\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n# This includes players from the National League, American League, and the American Association.\n# Players like Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams won it multiple times but are counted once.\nnum_batting_winners = 16\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n# Players like Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, and Roger Clemens won it multiple times but are counted once.\nnum_pitching_winners = 23\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique Triple Crown winners.\ntotal_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n# Print the final equation showing how the total was calculated.\nprint(f\"Number of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_pitching_winners}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of unique Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n```\n<<<39>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
