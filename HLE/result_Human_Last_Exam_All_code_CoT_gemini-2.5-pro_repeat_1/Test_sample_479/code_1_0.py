# Plan:
# 1. State the key property of the surface derived from the problem description.
# 2. Cite the relevant mathematical theorem that connects this property to the surface's topology.
# 3. Use the theorem to identify the surface type and its corresponding genus.
# 4. Present the final conclusion for the maximal genus.

print("Let's break down the reasoning to find the maximal genus.")

# Step 1: Analyze the given conditions.
print("\nThe problem states that Ω is a compact region in ℝ³ with a smooth, connected boundary ∂Ω.")
print("The crucial condition is that the mean curvature vector of ∂Ω never vanishes. This implies the scalar mean curvature, H, is non-zero at every point on the surface.")
print("Since ∂Ω is compact and connected, the continuous function H must have a constant sign. So, either H > 0 everywhere or H < 0 everywhere.")

# Step 2: Apply the relevant theorem.
print("\nA fundamental theorem of differential geometry (Alexandrov's Theorem) states that:")
print("Any compact, connected, embedded surface in ℝ³ with mean curvature of a constant sign must be homeomorphic to a sphere.")

# Step 3: Determine the genus.
print("\nThis theorem implies that the surface ∂Ω must be a sphere, topologically speaking.")
print("The genus of a surface, g, is a topological invariant. For a sphere, the genus is 0.")

# Step 4: Show the calculation for the Euler characteristic of a sphere.
# The formula relating Euler characteristic (χ) and genus (g) is χ = 2 - 2g.
genus_of_sphere = 0
print(f"\nFor a sphere, the genus g = {genus_of_sphere}.")
print("Using the formula for the Euler characteristic, χ = 2 - 2*g:")
euler_characteristic = 2 - 2 * genus_of_sphere
print(f"χ = 2 - 2 * {genus_of_sphere} = {euler_characteristic}")

# Step 5: Conclude the maximal genus.
print("\nSince any surface satisfying the conditions must have a genus of 0, the maximal possible genus is 0.")
