    "To determine the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to follow a multi-step process rooted in the theory of finite classical groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Properties:** The group is PSU(n, q) with n=4 and q=997. This group is a quotient group, PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)), where SU(n, q) is the special unitary group and Z is its center.\n2.  **Understand Involutions in a Quotient Group:** An involution in PSU(4, q) is an element `gZ` (where `Z` is the center and `g` is an element of SU(4, q)) such that `(gZ)^2` is the identity element of PSU(4, q), and `gZ` is not the identity itself. This means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`, and `g` must not be in `Z`.\n3.  **Calculate the Size of the Center:** The center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices and its order is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. For our case, this is `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. The center is `Z = {I, -I}`.\n4.  **Count Pre-images in SU(4, q):** We need to count the number of elements `g` in SU(4, q) such that `g^2` is in `Z = {I, -I}`. This count is the sum of two disjoint sets of elements:\n    *   The number of elements `g` such that `g^2 = I`. This includes the identity and the involutions of SU(4, q). Let's call the number of involutions `i(SU(4,q))`. The total count for this case is `i(SU(4,q)) + 1`.\n    *   The number of elements `g` such that `g^2 = -I`. Let's call this count `s_2(SU(4,q))`.\n5.  **Use Known Formulas:** Fortunately, there are established formulas for `i(SU(4,q))` and `s_2(SU(4,q))`:\n    *   `i(SU(4,q)) = q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n    *   `s_2(SU(4,q)) = q^2 * (q^3 + 1)`\n6.  **Calculate the Final Number:** The total number of elements `g` in SU(4, q) that map to involutions in PSU(4, q) is `i(SU(4,q)) + s_2(SU(4,q))`. (The elements `I` and `-I` from the center are excluded). Each involution in PSU(4, q) corresponds to `d=2` such elements in SU(4, q).\n    *   The number of elements in `SU(4,q)` whose square is in the center is `|S| = (i(SU(4,q)) + 1) + s_2(SU(4,q))`.\n    *   The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is `(|S| - |Z|) / |Z| = (i(SU(4,q)) + 1 + s_2(SU(4,q)) - 2) / 2 = (i(SU(4,q)) + s_2(SU(4,q)) - 1) / 2`.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to perform these calculations with q = 997.\n\n```python\ndef solve_psu_involutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # Part 1: Calculate the number of involutions in SU(4, q), denoted i(SU(4,q)).\n    # An involution t in SU(4,q) has eigenvalues +-1 and det(t)=1,\n    # which implies the (-1)-eigenspace has even dimension.
