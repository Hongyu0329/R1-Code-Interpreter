1.  Define the Space:
    The space X is the union of line segments in the plane:
    - L: from p = (1, 0) to the origin (0, 0).
    - L_n: from p_n = (1, 1/n) to the origin (0, 0), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    The space we consider is X' = X \\setminus {(0,0)}, which is X with the origin removed.

2.  Identify the Candidate Components:
    Removing the origin breaks the connection point between all the segments.
    The remaining parts are:
    - C_0 = L \\setminus {(0,0)}, which is the half-open segment (0, 1] on the x-axis.
    - C_n = L_n \\setminus {(0,0)}, the half-open segment from just after the origin to (1, 1/n), for n >= 1.
    Each of these sets C_k (for k = 0, 1, 2, ...) is path-connected, and therefore connected.
    The space is the disjoint union X' = C_0 U C_1 U C_2 U ...

3.  Analyze the Components C_n for n >= 1:
    Let's consider one of these segments, say C_k for a fixed k >= 1.
    - We can show that C_k is a 'clopen' set in X', meaning it is both open and closed in the subspace topology of X'.
    - It is open because for any point x in C_k, its distance to any other segment C_j (j != k) is positive. The infimum of these distances is also positive, allowing us to find a small open ball around x that doesn't intersect any other C_j.
    - Since C_k is open, its complement X' \\setminus C_k is closed. But we can also show that C_k is closed directly because it contains all of its limit points within X'.
    - In any topological space, a non-empty, connected, clopen set is a connected component.
    - Therefore, each C_n for n = 1, 2, 3, ... is a connected component.
    - This already tells us there are infinitely many connected components.

4.  Analyze the Remaining Part, C_0:
    - The connected components of a space form a partition of that space.
    - We have identified the components C_1, C_2, C_3, ...
    - The only part of the space left is C_0.
    - Therefore, C_0 must be the union of all the remaining connected components.
    - C_0, being a line segment, is itself connected.
    - Thus, C_0 cannot be broken down further and must be a single connected component.

5.  Conclusion:
    The connected components of the space X' are the sets {C_0, C_1, C_2, C_3, ...}.
    The number of these components is countably infinite.
