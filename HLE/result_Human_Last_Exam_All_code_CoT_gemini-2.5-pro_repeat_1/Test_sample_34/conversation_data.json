    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button, we need to consult a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening range chart for a 100BB deep, 6-max cash game.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Establish the context: The Button is the most profitable position in poker, which allows for the widest opening range. An open-raise to 2.5x is a standard size. The absence of rake makes marginal hands slightly more profitable.\n2.  Define \"worst\": In this context, \"worst\" refers to the hand with the lowest Expected Value (EV) that is still considered a profitable open-raise. Any hand weaker than this would typically be a fold.\n3.  List the suited Jack combinations in descending order of strength: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. (AJs, KJs, QJs are premium hands and not typically what is meant by \"worst\").\n4.  Consult GTO principles: Due to the powerful position and the equity provided by being suited, standard GTO charts for this scenario include *all* suited Jacks as profitable opens.\n5.  Identify the bottom of the range: The hand with the lowest kicker and least connectivity (potential to make a straight) will have the lowest EV. This is unequivocally J2s.\n\nThe following Python script will define this range and print the weakest hand from it as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB cash game.\n\n    In poker theory, the \"worst\" hand in an opening range is the one with the\n    lowest expected value (EV) that is still profitable to play. For an open-raise\n    from the button at 100BB stack depth, the opening range is very wide.\n\n    Standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts indicate that all suited Jacks are\n    profitable opens in this scenario. We list them from strongest to weakest\n    to find the one at the bottom of the range.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Suited Jacks ordered from strongest to weakest (excluding premium JQs+)\n    suited_jacks_range = [\n        \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # The \"worst\" suited jack is the last one in this ordered list.\n    worst_suited_jack = suited_jacks_range[-1]\n\n    print(\"Based on standard GTO pre-flop charts for a 100BB button open:\")\n    print(\"The worst suited jack that is still considered a standard open-raise is:\")\n    print(f\"Hand: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n<<<J2s>>>\n```"
