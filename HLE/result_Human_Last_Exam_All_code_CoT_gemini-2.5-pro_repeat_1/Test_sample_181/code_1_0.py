# The problem asks for the value of foo(7).
# Direct computation is impossible. We analyze the properties checked by the moo() function.
# The analysis shows that foo(n) counts the number of multiplication tables on n elements
# that are either a group or the "right-zero semigroup" (where a*b = b).

# For n=7, these two categories are distinct.

# 1. Count the number of group structures on a set of 7 elements.
# Since 7 is a prime number, any group of order 7 is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z_7.
# The number of distinct Cayley tables for a group G on n elements is n! / |Aut(G)|.
# The size of the automorphism group of Z_n is phi(n), Euler's totient function.
n = 7

# For a prime p, phi(p) = p - 1.
phi_7 = n - 1

# Calculate 7!
factorial_7 = math.factorial(n)

# Number of group tables is 7! / phi(7)
num_group_tables = factorial_7 // phi_7

# 2. Count the number of "right-zero semigroup" structures.
# The operation a*b = b defines exactly one multiplication table.
num_other_structures = 1

# 3. The total count is the sum.
total_count = num_group_tables + num_other_structures
