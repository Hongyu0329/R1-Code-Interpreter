    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use a general topological formula that relates the number of loops (L), internal propagators (I), and vertices (V) in a connected diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the general topological formula:** For any connected Feynman diagram, the number of loops is given by `L = I - V + 1`.\n2.  **State the vertex rule:** We will assume the most common type of interaction for a scalar field, which is a `phi^4` theory. In this theory, each vertex connects four lines (propagators). This relationship can be expressed as `4 * V = 2 * I + E`, where E is the number of external lines (representing incoming/outgoing particles).\n3.  **Set the number of loops:** The problem specifies a two-loop diagram, so `L = 2`.\n4.  **Solve for V:** We now have a system of two equations with three variables (V, I, E). We can rearrange them to express V in terms of L and E.\n    *   From the loop formula: `I = L + V - 1`\n    *   Substitute this into the vertex rule: `4V = 2(L + V - 1) + E`\n    *   Simplify and solve for V:\n        *   `4V = 2L + 2V - 2 + E`\n        *   `2V = 2L - 2 + E`\n        *   `V = L - 1 + E / 2`\n5.  **Minimize V:** To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we need to use the minimum possible number of external lines (E). The smallest possible value for E is 0 (a vacuum diagram). Note that E must be an even number for V to be an integer, which is consistent with `phi^4` theory.\n6.  **Calculate the final result:** Substitute `L=2` and `E=0` into the formula for V to find the minimum number of vertices. The Python script below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory (phi^4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of loops required\n    L = 2\n\n    # To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we must use the minimum\n    # possible number of external lines (E).
