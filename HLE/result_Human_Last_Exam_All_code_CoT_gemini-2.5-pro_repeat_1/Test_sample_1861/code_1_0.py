    This function prints a step-by-step logical argument to solve the given problem.

    print("Here is the reasoning to determine which statement is true:")
    print("Step 1: Understand the problem's main condition.")
    print("The problem states that for any two points x, y in M, there is a diffeomorphism F such that F(x) = y and F*η = η.")
    print("This means there is a group G of diffeomorphisms that preserves η, and G acts transitively on M.")
    print("\nStep 2: Relate the condition on η to its exterior derivative, Ω = dη.")
    print("The pullback F* commutes with the exterior derivative d. So, F*Ω = F*(dη) = d(F*η) = dη = Ω.")
    print("This means Ω is also invariant under the group G.")
    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the consequences of this invariance.")
    print("A detailed analysis using the Lie algebra of G and Cartan's formula shows that the invariance under a transitive group action forces the 2-form Ω to have constant coefficients in the natural coordinates of M (e.g., (x,y) for R^2, (θ,z) for the cylinder, (θ1, θ2) for the torus).")
    print("So, we can write Ω = C * vol, where 'vol' is the standard volume form and C is a constant.")
    print("\nStep 4: Analyze each case for the manifold M.")
    print("\nCase A: M is the 2-torus (T^2).")
    print("The torus is a compact manifold without boundary. By Stokes' Theorem, the integral of an exact form over M must be zero.")
    print("∫_T² dη = 0")
    print("If Ω = C * dθ1 ∧ dθ2, its integral is ∫_T² C dθ1 ∧ dθ2 = C * Area(T²).")
    print("For the integral to be zero, C must be 0. Thus, for the torus, dη = 0.")
    print("\nCase B: M is the plane (R^2) or the cylinder (S¹ x R).")
    print("These manifolds are not compact, so the previous argument doesn't apply directly.")
    print("However, the analysis from Step 3 can be continued. If dη ≠ 0, then Ω is a non-zero constant 2-form.")
    print("This property forces the vector fields of the symmetry group G to be translation vector fields (i.e., vector fields with constant components).")
    print("Since the group G must be transitive, it must contain all translations.")
    print("So, η must be invariant under all translations.")
    print("A 1-form is invariant under all translations only if it has constant coefficients (e.g., η = a*dx + b*dy).")
    print("The exterior derivative of any 1-form with constant coefficients is zero: dη = 0.")
    print("This contradicts the assumption that dη ≠ 0. Therefore, dη must be 0 in these cases as well.")
    print("\nStep 5: Conclude.")
    print("In all three cases (torus, cylinder, and plane), the given conditions necessarily imply that dη = 0.")
    print("Therefore, the correct statement is that it is necessary in any case that dη = 0.")
