# Step 1: Define the number of folds and calculate the number of layers.
num_folds = 4
num_layers = 2**num_folds

# Step 2: Determine the grid size imposed by the folding.
# Two folds (one vertical, one horizontal) create a 2x2 grid.
# Four folds create a 4x4 grid. The side dimension of the grid is 2^(num_folds/2).
grid_side_dimension = 2**(num_folds // 2)

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of new edges created by the cuts.
# We cut 4 corners on the folded square, and each cut goes through all layers.
corners_cut = 4
new_edges_from_cuts = corners_cut * num_layers

# Step 4: Calculate the number of remaining segments of the original 4 edges.
# Each original edge is interrupted at its 2 endpoints (which become corner snips)
# and at several points in between (which become notches).
# The number of notches along one original edge is the grid side dimension minus 1.
num_notches_per_edge = grid_side_dimension - 1

# The number of segments an edge is broken into is the number of interruptions (notches) plus one.
# So, each original edge is broken into (num_notches_per_edge + 1) segments.
# This simplifies to grid_side_dimension segments.
segments_per_original_edge = num_notches_per_edge + 1

# Calculate the total number of segments from all 4 original edges.
original_edges = 4
remaining_original_segments = original_edges * segments_per_original_edge

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of edges.
# This is the sum of the new edges from the cuts and the remaining original segments.
total_edges = new_edges_from_cuts + remaining_original_segments

# Print the final breakdown of the calculation and the result.
