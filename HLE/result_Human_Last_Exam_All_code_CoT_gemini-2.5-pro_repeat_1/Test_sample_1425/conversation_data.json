    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the partition function using path integrals.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Partition Function**: Start with the general definition of the grand canonical partition function, $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$.\n2.  **Interpret the Hamiltonian**: The given Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This is an unusual form. The most standard interpretation for a textbook problem is that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian (kinetic + potential energy) is zero, and the operator given is the grand canonical Hamiltonian itself, $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu\\hat{N} = 0 - \\mu\\hat{N} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n3.  **Formulate the Path Integral**: Express the partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta\\hat{K}}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}]$ as a path integral over a complex scalar field $\\phi(\\tau)$, which is appropriate for describing a system where particles can be created and destroyed. We'll assume the particles are bosons. For simplicity, we'll consider a system with only a single available quantum state (e.g., the zero-momentum mode).\n4.  **Define the Action**: From the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$, we will construct the corresponding Euclidean action $S_E$ which appears in the exponent of the path integral, $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E}$.\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral**: The resulting path integral is a Gaussian integral. We will evaluate it using the standard formula for Gaussian integrals over fields, which relates the result to the determinant of the operator in the action, i.e., $Z \\propto [\\det(\\text{operator})]^{-1}$.\n6.  **Calculate the Determinant**: The determinant is calculated by finding the product of the eigenvalues of the operator. The eigenvalues are found by acting on the basis of Fourier modes in imaginary time (Matsubara frequencies).\n7.  **Final Result**: Combine the steps to arrive at the final expression for the partition function Z.\n8.  **Code Implementation**: Write a Python script to print the final equation, breaking down its components as requested.\n\n### Derivation:\n\nThe grand canonical partition function is defined as $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$, where $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n\nBased on our plan, we interpret the given Hamiltonian as the grand canonical Hamiltonian, $\\hat{K} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. Thus, the partition function is $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu\\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}}]$.\n\nUsing the path integral formalism for a single bosonic state described by a complex field $\\phi(\\tau)$, the partition function is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\n\nThe Euclidean action $S_E$ corresponding to the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}=-\\mu\\hat{N}$ is given by:\n$S_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\phi^*(\\tau)(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\phi(\\tau) \\right]$\n\nThe path integral is therefore:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi^*(\\tau)(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)\\phi(\\tau)}$\n\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral over the field $\\phi$. Its value is proportional to the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the quadratic form. For bosons, the result is:\n$Z = [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$\n\nTo evaluate the determinant, we find its eigenvalues by acting on the eigenfunctions $e^{i\\omega_n \\tau}$, where $\\omega_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\beta}$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies for integers $n$.\n$(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) e^{i\\omega_n \\tau} = (i\\omega_n - \\mu) e^{i\\omega_n \\tau}$\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = i\\omega_n - \\mu$. The determinant is the product of all eigenvalues:\n$\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) = \\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\nUsing the standard result for this infinite product from finite-temperature field theory, we get:\n$\\prod_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (i\\omega_n - \\mu) = 1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}$\n\nFinally, substituting this back into our expression for Z gives the partition function:\n$Z = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n\nThis result requires that the chemical potential $\\mu < 0$ for the geometric series representation of this function to converge, which is the physical condition to prevent infinite occupation of the zero-energy state.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the derived partition function Z and its components.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols used in the equation\n    Z, beta, mu = sympy.symbols('Z β μ')\n    \n    # Define the components of the final equation\n    # The equation is Z = 1 / (1 - e^(βμ))\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator_term_1 = 1\n    \n    # Explain the equation\n    print(\"The derived partition function Z for a single bosonic state is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"Z = numerator / (term1 - term2)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The components of the equation are:\")\n    # Print each number/component of the final equation\n    print(f\"The numerator is: {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"The first term in the denominator is: {denominator_term_1}\")\n    print(\"The second term in the denominator is e^(βμ)\\n\")\n    \n    # Construct the final equation using the components\n    final_equation_str = f\"{Z} = {numerator} / ({denominator_term_1} - exp({beta}{mu}))\"\n    \n    # Print the final, formatted equation\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(final_equation_str)\n    \n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(\"Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function\")\n    print(\"β: Inverse temperature (1 / (k_B * T))\")\n    print(\"μ: Chemical Potential (must be negative for this result)\")\n    print(\"exp: The exponential function\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_partition_function()\n\n```\n<<<$Z = 1 / (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$>>>"
