    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Logical Fragment**: I will first analyze the structure of the formulas in the given first-order logic fragment, $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. The schema $S$ has 4 unary predicates. The concepts are defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable, $x$. I'll show that any such formula is equivalent to a *positive monomial*—a conjunction of the atomic predicates, like $P_{i_1}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_m}(x)$—or the empty concept, under a suitably chosen model. This is because any existentially quantified part of the formula without the free variable $x$ becomes a sentence that is either true or false for the whole model, and we can choose a model where these sentences are true. The fragment does not include negation, so we only consider positive conjunctions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Equivalent Machine Learning Problem**: The problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of positive monomials over a set of $k=4$ boolean features (our predicates).\n\n3.  **State the Known Result**: The VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over $k$ features is a standard result in computational learning theory, and it is equal to $k$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: With $k=4$ predicates, the VC dimension is 4.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a simple Python script that sets the number of predicates to 4 and prints the calculated VC dimension, along with an explanation of the reasoning, as requested. The code will also print the final, simple equation relating the number of predicates to the VC dimension.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the VC dimension for the specified first-order logic fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The schema S contains 4 unary predicates.
