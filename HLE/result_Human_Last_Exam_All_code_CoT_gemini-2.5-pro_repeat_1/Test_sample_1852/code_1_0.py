def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the set theory problem based on the provided reasoning.
    The problem asks for delta_1 + delta_2, where delta_1 and delta_2 are the supremum and
    infimum of the set X of regular cardinals lambda for which a specific type of tower
    of length lambda exists.

    The solution is derived from set-theoretic principles and the assumption that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    """

    # Based on the analysis:
    # 1. The maximum possible length of a tower is the size of the algebra P(omega_1)/I_c, which is 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    #    So, delta_1 <= omega_2.
    # 2. It can be shown that no tower of length omega_1 exists. Since the length must be a regular cardinal,
    #    the minimum possible length is omega_2. So, delta_2 >= omega_2.
    # 3. Combining these, we get omega_2 <= delta_2 <= delta_1 <= omega_2, which implies delta_1 = delta_2 = omega_2.
    # 4. It's possible to construct a tower of length omega_2, so the set X is not empty and is equal to {omega_2}.
