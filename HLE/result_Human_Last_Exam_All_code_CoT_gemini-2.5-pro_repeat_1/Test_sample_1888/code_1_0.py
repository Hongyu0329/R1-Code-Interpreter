# Based on the analysis of the set theory problem:
# delta is the order type of the set of possible cardinalities.
# gamma is the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.

# The value of delta is determined to be omega_2. The number here is 2.
delta_val = 2

# The value of gamma is determined to be omega_1. The number here is 1.
gamma_val = 1

# The problem asks for the value of the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
# The result is omega_2 + omega_1.
# The following print statement displays the final equation, including the numbers as requested.
print(f"omega_{delta_val} + omega_{gamma_val}")
