# The question asks to identify a conceptual entity from a quote by Paul Morand,
# cited by the historian Fernand Braudel.
# The quote, found in Braudel's "On History", specifies what should be "inscribed within a sphere".
# The relevant part of the quote is: "...'a history of men should be inscribed within a sphere...'"
# This directly answers the question.

# The conceptual entity in question.
entity = "a history of men"

# Printing the answer.
