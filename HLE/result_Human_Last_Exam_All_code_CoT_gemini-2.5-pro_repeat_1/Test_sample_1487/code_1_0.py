# The problem asks to compute the value of the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# From the mathematical derivation, we found that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
#
# Let's substitute this into the expression.
# Let X = pi^2/6 - 1.
# The expression becomes:
# (2 * (1/2 * X)) / X + 10^15
# which simplifies to:
# X / X + 10^15
# = 1 + 10^15

# Define the terms of the final simplified equation
first_term = 1
second_term = 10**15

# Calculate the final result
final_result = first_term + second_term

# Print the final equation and its result
print(f"The equation simplifies to: {first_term} + {second_term}")
print(f"The final result is: {final_result}")
