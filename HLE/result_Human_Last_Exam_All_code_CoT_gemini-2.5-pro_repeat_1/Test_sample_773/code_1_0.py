# The order of the residual field, q_v, is a power of a prime number.
# The problem does not specify its value. Let's choose a sample value to demonstrate the calculation.
# The smallest possible value for the order of a field is 2.
q_v = 2

# The calculation is based on the formula derived from the n=1 case,
# under the assumption that the result is independent of n.
# The formula is q_v / (q_v - 1).

# Numerator of the expression
numerator = q_v

# Denominator of the expression
denominator = q_v - 1

# The result of the division
result = numerator / denominator

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
