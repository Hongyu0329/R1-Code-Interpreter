    print("\nA. Gene conversion:")
    print("   Result: Incorrect. Gene conversion is a process that makes two DNA sequences identical. This works against divergence, not for it.")

    print("\nB. Pseudogenization:")
    print("   Result: Incorrect. This is the most common fate, where one gene copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. This explains the LOSS of a functional gene, not the RETENTION of two diverging copies.")

    print("\nC. Neofunctionalization:")
    print("   Result: Plausible. In this model, one copy retains the original function while the other acquires a completely new function through mutation. This explains both retention (both copies are useful) and divergence (the second copy changes).")

    print("\nD. Subfunctionalization:")
    print("   Result: Plausible. In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns). After duplication, each copy loses some functions and specializes in a subset of the original roles. Both copies are now required to fulfill the complete original function. This also explains retention and divergence.")

    print("\nE. Adaptive radiation:")
    print("   Result: Incorrect. This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for it, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for retaining a single gene pair.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the primary accepted models for how duplicate genes are retained and diverge.")
    print("However, the Subfunctionalization (or Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation) model is considered a very likely mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It does not require a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation. Instead, it relies on more common loss-of-function mutations that make both copies necessary to perform the original set of functions.")
    print("This provides a stable state where both genes are kept, allowing them to diverge over longer evolutionary timescales. For this reason, it is often considered a highly likely mechanism responsible for the widespread retention of duplicate genes observed in genomes.")
