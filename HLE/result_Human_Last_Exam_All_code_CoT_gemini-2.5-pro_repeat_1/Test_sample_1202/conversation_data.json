    "This is a conceptual question from evolutionary biology. I will create a Python script that walks through the provided answer choices, explains the reasoning for why each is correct or incorrect, and then prints the final determination.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the biological question and the answer choices.\n2.  Evaluate each choice systematically:\n    *   **Gene conversion:** This process homogenizes sequences, working against divergence.\n    *   **Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one gene copy is lost to mutation, which fails to explain the *retention* of both copies.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes one copy gains a new function. It explains both retention and divergence and is a major accepted mechanism.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the two copies partition the ancestral functions between them. It also explains retention and divergence and is another major accepted mechanism.\n    *   **Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism for gene retention.\n3.  Compare the two plausible mechanisms, Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization. Both are key models explaining the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. They are often considered the primary answers to this question. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. While both occur, subfunctionalization provides a powerful explanation for how duplicate genes can be preserved from being lost in the first place, as it relies on more common degenerative mutations to make both copies essential. This initial preservation is a crucial step for any subsequent evolution. Therefore, many consider it a highly likely and widespread mechanism for duplicate gene retention.\n4.  The script will print this reasoning and then the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the question: Which mechanism is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes?\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nA. Gene conversion:\")\n    print(\"   Result: Incorrect. Gene conversion is a process that makes two DNA sequences identical. This works against divergence, not for it.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nB. Pseudogenization:\")\n    print(\"   Result: Incorrect. This is the most common fate, where one gene copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. This explains the LOSS of a functional gene, not the RETENTION of two diverging copies.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nC. Neofunctionalization:\")\n    print(\"   Result: Plausible. In this model, one copy retains the original function while the other acquires a completely new function through mutation. This explains both retention (both copies are useful) and divergence (the second copy changes).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nD. Subfunctionalization:\")\n    print(\"   Result: Plausible. In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns). After duplication, each copy loses some functions and specializes in a subset of the original roles. Both copies are now required to fulfill the complete original function. This also explains retention and divergence.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nE. Adaptive radiation:\")\n    print(\"   Result: Incorrect. This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for it, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for retaining a single gene pair.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the primary accepted models for how duplicate genes are retained and diverge.\")\n    print(\"However, the Subfunctionalization (or Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation) model is considered a very likely mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes.
