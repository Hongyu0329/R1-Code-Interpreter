    Solves a topology problem by deducing the structure of a continuum.

    The problem asks for the number of topologically distinct continua X satisfying:
    1. X has k > 1 and finitely many "end points".
    2. X has exactly two orbits under its group of auto-homeomorphisms.

    The code formalizes the logical deduction to find the answer.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the orbit condition.
    # Property (2) implies that the set of end points (E) and the set of
    # non-end points (I = X \ E) must be the two orbits. This means the set I
    # is "homogeneous" â€“ all points within it are topologically equivalent.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the structure of the homogeneous set I.
    # For I to be homogeneous, it cannot contain points with different local
    # topologies, such as a mix of branch points and simple interior points.
    # This implies I must be a 1-dimensional manifold.

    # Step 3: Identify the manifold I.
    # A connected 1-manifold is either an open interval or a circle.
    # - If I were a circle, X would be a circle, which has 0 end points,
    #   violating Property (1).
    # - Therefore, I must be an open interval.

    # Step 4: Identify X.
    # Since X is a compact continuum, it must be the closure of I. The closure
    # of an open interval that adds end points is a closed interval, i.e., an arc.

    # Step 5: Verify the arc.
    # - An arc has 2 end points. (2 > 1, so Property (1) holds).
    # - An arc has two orbits: the set of 2 end points, and the set of all
    #   interior points. (Property (2) holds).

    # Step 6: Conclude the number of distinct continua.
    # The only continuum satisfying the conditions is the arc. All arcs are
    # topologically equivalent to one another.
    number_of_continua = 1

    # Final Output
    # The problem asks for the number of such topologically distinct continua.
    # Our analysis concludes there is only one.
    print("The reasoning leads to the conclusion that the only continuum satisfying the properties is an arc.")
    print("All arcs are topologically equivalent.")
    print("Therefore, the number of topologically distinct continua is given by the equation:")
    print(f"Number of continua = {number_of_continua}")
