    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$. In the context of the theory of the Markov spectrum, this refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it $\\alpha_{4/7}$, which is constructed from the continued fraction of the rational number $4/7$.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Find the simple continued fraction of the rational number 4/7.** We will use the Euclidean algorithm for this.\n2.  **Construct the periodic part of the associated quadratic irrationality.** The rule for this construction is as follows: if the continued fraction of a rational number $p/q$ is $[0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]$, then the continued fraction for the associated quadratic irrationality $\\alpha_{p/q}$ is given by $[0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1}]$. The periodic part is formed by the sequence of coefficients of the rational number's continued fraction, followed by its reverse.\n3.  **Determine the quadratic equation** that $\\alpha_{4/7}$ satisfies. This is a good way to verify the result and fulfills the instruction to output the numbers of an equation.\n4.  **Present the final continued fraction.**\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It first calculates the continued fraction of 4/7, then uses its coefficients to construct the periodic continued fraction for $\\alpha_{4/7}$, and finally derives the quadratic equation for its value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_rational_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the continued fraction of a rational number p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    # Ensure p < q for the form [0; a1, a2, ...]\n    if p >= q:\n        raise ValueError(\"This function assumes p < q for simplicity.\")\n    \n    # First coefficient is always 0\n    coeffs.append(p // q)\n    p = p % q\n    \n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        # This is an intermediate step, the actual coefficient is from q/p\n        p, q = q, p\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p = p % q\n        \n    return coeffs\n\ndef get_quadratic_equation_from_period(period):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the quadratic equation Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 for the value x of a\n    purely periodic continued fraction [0; period].\n    The value of the fraction x is defined as x = [0; period].\n    Let theta = [period; period].
