    Calculates the number of circulon types for a classical SO(3) gauge theory.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Establish the classification formula. Based on the problem's premise that point defects
        (m=0) in a D=(d+1) dimensional space are classified by pi_d(G), we generalize this.
        A defect of dimension m is classified by pi_{D-m-1}(G).
    2.  For a circulon (m=1), the classification is pi_((d+1)-1-1)(G) = pi_{d-1}(G).
    3.  The number of types is the order of the group |pi_{d-1}(SO(3))|.
    4.  We use the known orders of the homotopy groups of SO(3).
