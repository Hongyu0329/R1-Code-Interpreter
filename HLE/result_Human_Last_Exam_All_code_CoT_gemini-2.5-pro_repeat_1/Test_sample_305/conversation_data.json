    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can perform a systematic search using a Python script. Here is the step-by-step plan for the script:\n\n1.  **Define the Set:** We'll represent the set with 3 elements as $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. A binary operation is a function that takes two elements from this set and returns an element from the same set.\n\n2.  **Use Commutativity to Reduce Search Space:** The commutativity property ($x * y = y * x$) means the operation's multiplication table (Cayley table) is symmetric across its main diagonal. This significantly reduces the number of possibilities we need to check. For a 3-element set, a commutative operation is fully defined by the results of just 6 pairs: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2).\n\n3.  **Iterate Through All Commutative Operations:** The result for each of the 6 defining pairs can be any of the 3 elements in our set. This gives a total of $3^6 = 729$ possible commutative operations. We will create a loop that generates each of these 729 possibilities.\n\n4.  **Check for Associativity:** For each of the 729 commutative operations, we must check if it is also associative. The associativity property ($(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)$) must be true for all possible combinations of $x, y, z$ from our set $S$. There are $3^3 = 27$ such combinations (triplets) to verify for each operation.\n\n5.  **Count Valid Operations:** We will use a counter, initialized to zero. Inside our main loop, we'll have a set of nested loops to check all 27 associativity conditions. If an operation satisfies all of them, we increment our counter.\n\n6.  **Output the Result:** After checking all 729 operations, the final value of the counter will be the answer. The script will print the steps of the calculation and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of n elements by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = list(range(n))\n    \n    # For a commutative operation on a set of size n, we only need to define\n    # the operation for pairs (i, j) where i <= j.
