# Plan:
# 1. Define physical constants and given values in SI units.
# 2. Calculate the mass of the black hole (Pegasi) using Kepler's Third Law.
# 3. Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (rs) of Pegasi.
# 4. Calculate the gravitational time dilation factor (f) for Pioneer.
# 5. Round the factor f to three decimal places.
# 6. Analyze the memory usage (z) for a memory-efficient Bagua C program.
# 7. Print the final equation with the calculated numbers.
# 8. Format and print the final answer as f:z.

# --- Step 1: Define Constants and Givens ---
G = 6.6743e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
c = 2.99792458e8  # Speed of light (m/s)

# Pandora's data (converted to SI units)
T_pandora_sec = 800 * 24 * 3600  # Orbital period in seconds
a_pandora_m = 100e6 * 1000      # Orbital radius in meters

# Pioneer's data (converted to SI units)
d_m = 13 * 1000                 # Distance from event horizon in meters

# --- Step 2: Calculate Mass of Pegasi (M) ---
# Using Kepler's Third Law: M = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2)
M_pegasi = (4 * math.pi**2 * a_pandora_m**3) / (G * T_pandora_sec**2)

# --- Step 3: Calculate Schwarzschild Radius (rs) ---
# Formula: rs = 2 * G * M / c^2
rs_pegasi = (2 * G * M_pegasi) / (c**2)

# --- Step 4: Calculate Time Dilation Factor (f) ---
# The total distance from the center of the black hole is r = rs + d
r_total = rs_pegasi + d_m
# The time dilation formula is f = sqrt(1 - rs / r)
time_dilation_factor = math.sqrt(1 - rs_pegasi / r_total)

# --- Step 5: Round f to 0.001 ---
f_rounded = round(time_dilation_factor, 3)

# --- Step 6: Analyze Memory Usage (z) ---
# A memory-efficient Bagua C program would require variables for constants,
# intermediate calculations, and the final result.
# Data type sizes in trits: int = 8, frac = 8.
#
# Variables needed for the program:
# 1. frac G: Constant for Gravity (8 trits)
# 2. frac c: Constant for speed of light (8 trits)
# 3. frac PI: Constant for Pi (e.g., 22/7) (8 trits)
# 4. frac a_pandora: Pandora's orbital radius (8 trits)
# 5. frac T_pandora: Pandora's orbital period (8 trits)
# 6. unsigned int d_pioneer: Pioneer's distance (int is 8 trits)
# 7. frac result: To hold intermediate results (M, rs) and the final value (f) (8 trits)
# 8. frac temp1: First temporary variable for complex calculations (8 trits)
# 9. frac temp2: Second temporary variable for complex calculations (8 trits)
#
# Total variables = 9
# Total memory usage z = 9 variables * 8 trits/variable
z_memory_usage = 9 * 8

# --- Step 7: Output the Final Equation with Numbers ---
