def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    Analyzes the statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis reveals the following logical chain:
    A potential V(r) is trivially coupled <=> The S-matrix S(E) is trivially coupled.
    A Jost matrix F(E) is trivially coupled => The S-matrix S(E) is trivially coupled.
    The reverse is also true: S(E) trivially coupled => F(E) trivially coupled.
    Therefore, V, S, and F are all either trivially or nontrivially coupled together.

    1) Correct. A nontrivially coupled S(E) implies a nontrivially coupled V(r).
    2) Correct. A diagonal S(E) implies a diagonal V(r) (barring certain degeneracies).
    3) Correct. A nontrivially coupled V(r) implies a nontrivially coupled F(E).
    4) Correct. A nontrivially coupled F(E) implies a nontrivially coupled S(E).
    5) False. A diagonal F(E) is trivially coupled, which implies V(r) is also trivially coupled,
       contradicting the premise.
