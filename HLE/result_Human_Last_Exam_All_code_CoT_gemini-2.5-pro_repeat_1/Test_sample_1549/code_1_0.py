def solve_n_compactness():
    """
    Calculates the value of [X] for X = [0,1]^3 based on Helly's Theorem.

    The problem asks for [X], the minimum n for which X is n-compact.
    A space X is n-compact if it has an open sub-basis such that every cover
    by sub-basis elements has a subcover with n or fewer elements.

    This property is directly related to the Helly number of the family of
    convex sets in the ambient space. For a space X that is a subset of R^d,
    the value [X] is given by d + 1.

    The space X in this problem is the unit cube [0,1]^3.
    This is a convex subset of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R^3.
