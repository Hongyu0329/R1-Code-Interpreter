    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation for the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, followed by a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the General Case:** First, I'll state the formula for the number of independent components of a Riemann tensor on a general n-dimensional Riemannian manifold for context.\n2.  **Introduce Kähler Manifolds:** I'll explain that a Kähler manifold has a complex structure that adds constraints, reducing the number of independent components. The real dimension `n` of a Kähler manifold is always even, so we can write `n = 2m`, where `m` is the complex dimension.\n3.  **Explain the Kähler Constraints:** The key simplification on a Kähler manifold is that in a suitable complex coordinate system, the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor are of the type $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$. This tensor possesses specific symmetries.\n4.  **Count the Components:** These symmetries allow us to understand the tensor $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$ as an object defined by an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix, where $N$ is the dimension of the space of symmetric $(2,0)$-tensors, given by $N = \\binom{m+1}{2}$.\n5.  **Derive the Formula:** The number of independent real components in an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix is $N^2$. By substituting the expression for $N$, we arrive at the final formula.\n6.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script that takes the complex dimension `m` as input and calculates the number of components, printing out each step of the calculation as requested. I'll use `m=2` as an example.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_kahler_riemann_components(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The real dimension n is 2*m\n    n = 2 * m\n\n    # On a Kähler manifold, the Riemann tensor is determined by a Hermitian form on the\n    # space of symmetric (2,0)-tensors.
