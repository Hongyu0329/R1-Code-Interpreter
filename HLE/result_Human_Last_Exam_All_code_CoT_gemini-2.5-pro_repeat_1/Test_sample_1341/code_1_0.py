    # Step 1 & 2: Define contractual terms and evaluate Jack's performance
    purchase_price = 3000
    payment_amount = 500
    payments_made = 3  # For Nov 2, Dec 1, and Jan 1

    total_paid = payments_made * payment_amount

    print(f"Result: Jack has paid ${total_paid} in total.")
    print("Fact: Jack missed the payment due on February 1, 2023. This constitutes a default.")

    # Step 3: Analyze statutory protections (Ontario's two-thirds rule)
    two_thirds_threshold = (2 / 3) * purchase_price

    print("\n--- Analysis of Statutory Protection (Two-Thirds Rule) ---")
    print("In Ontario, a seller cannot repossess goods without a court order if the buyer has paid two-thirds of the price.")
    print(f"The two-thirds threshold for this purchase is: 2/3 * ${purchase_price}")

    print(f"Comparison: Jack has paid ${total_paid}, which is less than the ${two_thirds_threshold:.2f} threshold.")
    print("Conclusion: Jack is not protected from repossession by the 'two-thirds rule'. This invalidates Answer B.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate Gary's adherence to the contract's default procedure
    contract_notice_requirement = "written notice of default"
    action_taken_by_gary = "sent a text letting him know that he missed a payment"

    print("Question: Does an informal text message reminder qualify as a formal 'written notice of default'?")
    print("Analysis: A formal notice of default typically must be unambiguous, state that the party is in default, and refer to the consequences outlined in the contract. An informal text reminder likely does not meet this legal or contractual standard.")

    # Step 5: Final Conclusion
    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Since the contractual requirement for a 'written notice of default' was likely not met, the three-day period for Jack to fix the default was never properly started.")
    print("Therefore, Gary's attempt to repossess the vehicle on February 6th is premature because he has not followed the specific procedure outlined in the contract he signed.")
    print("This reasoning directly supports Answer C.")
