    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to reorder numbers in a sum string (e.g., `3+1+2`) so that they are in non-decreasing order (i.e., `1+2+3`). The input numbers are guaranteed to be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2.  **Choose a Memory-Efficient Strategy:** A simple approach would be to extract all the numbers into a list, sort the list, and then join them back into a string. However, a more memory-efficient strategy, especially since we only have four distinct numbers, is to count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). This avoids creating an intermediate list to hold all the numbers from the input string.\n3.  **Python Implementation:**\n    *   Read the input string.\n    *   Use the string's `count()` method to find how many '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's are present.\n    *   Create a new list by adding the character '1' for `count1` times, '2' for `count2` times, and so on. This list will be inherently sorted.\n    *   Join the elements of this new list with a `+` sign and print the resulting string.\n4.  **C Program Memory Calculation:** The prompt also asks for the memory usage `m` of a memory-efficient C program implementing this same counting logic. I will calculate this based on typical data type sizes.\n    *   **Input Buffer:** To store the input string of up to 1000 characters, a `char` array is needed. `char s[1001];` (1000 for characters + 1 for the null terminator) would use `1001 * sizeof(char)` = 1001 bytes.\n    *   **Counts Array:** To store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, an integer array can be used. `int counts[4];` would use `4 * sizeof(int)`. Assuming `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, this is 16 bytes.\n    *   **Auxiliary Variables:** We would need a few integer variables for loops and flags (e.g., `i`, `j`, `is_first`). Let's assume 3 integer variables: `3 * sizeof(int)` = 12 bytes.\n    *   **Total Memory (m):** 1001 + 16 + 12 = 1029 bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code that solves the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum string, sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n    Example: 3+2+1 -> 1+2+3\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string from the user.\n    # The .strip() removes any potential leading/trailing whitespace, including the newline.\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # A memory-efficient way is to count the occurrences of each number.\n    count1 = s.count('1')\n    count2 = s.count('2')\n    count3 = s.count('3')\n    count4 = s.count('4') # As per the prompt's problem description\n\n    # Create a list that will hold the numbers in sorted order.\n    sorted_numbers = []\n\n    # Extend the list with the correct number of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's.\n    sorted_numbers.extend(['1'] * count1)\n    sorted_numbers.extend(['2'] * count2)\n    sorted_numbers.extend(['3'] * count3)\n    sorted_numbers.extend(['4'] * count4)\n\n    # Join the sorted numbers with '+' to form the final sum string.\n    # The output will correctly show each number in the final equation.\n    # For example, ['1', '1', '2'] becomes \"1+1+2\".\n    result = \"+\".join(sorted_numbers)\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1029>>>"
