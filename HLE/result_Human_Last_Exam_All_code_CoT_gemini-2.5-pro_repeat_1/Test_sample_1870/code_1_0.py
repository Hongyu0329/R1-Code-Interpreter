    print("We need to show that for any alpha < omega_1, the set difference |y \\ x_alpha| is countable.")
    print(" - Consider an element y_beta from our constructed set y.")
    print(" - If beta >= alpha, then by our construction rule, y_beta was chosen from a set that is a subset of x_alpha. So, y_beta is in x_alpha.")
    print(" - Therefore, an element y_beta can only be outside of x_alpha if its index beta is less than alpha.")
    print(" - The set of such indices {beta : beta < alpha} is countable, since alpha itself is a countable ordinal.")
    print(" - This means only a countable number of elements from y can be outside of x_alpha.\n")
    
    print("This construction always works for a tower of length omega_1. This means no such tower can satisfy the maximality condition (of having no pseudo-intersection).")
    print("Therefore, the minimal length delta must be strictly greater than omega_1.")

    print("--- Final Answer ---\n")
    print("Combining the two facts (delta >= omega_2 and delta <= omega_2), we find the minimal possible value for delta.\n")
