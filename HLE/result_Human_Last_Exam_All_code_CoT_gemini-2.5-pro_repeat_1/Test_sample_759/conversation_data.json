    "To find the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group of size 3, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the constraints:** The automorphism group `Aut(γ)` has order 3. This is the cyclic group C₃. This means the graph must possess a 3-fold rotational symmetry but must lack any other symmetries (like reflections). An automorphism of order 3 acts on the vertices as a permutation composed of disjoint 3-cycles and fixed points.\n\n2.  **Determine the minimum number of vertices:** Let `n` be the number of vertices. It is a known result from graph theory that the minimum number of vertices for a graph `γ` with `Aut(γ) ≅ C₃` is `n=9`. Any graph with fewer than 9 vertices will have an automorphism group of a different order.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum number of edges:**\n    *   A graph on `n=9` vertices must have at least `e = n-1 = 8` edges to be connected.\n    *   The automorphism group of order 3 acts on the set of edges. The size of any edge's orbit under this action must divide the order of the group, so orbit sizes can only be 1 or 3.\n    *   An edge can only be in an orbit of size 1 (i.e., be a fixed edge) if it connects two vertices that are themselves fixed points of the automorphism. The minimal 9-vertex graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` has no fixed points (its automorphism permutes all vertices in three 3-cycles). Therefore, all edges must lie in orbits of size 3.\n    *   This implies that the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n    *   Combining the requirements `e >= 8` and `e` being a multiple of 3, the smallest possible value for `e` is 9.\n\n4.  **Construct a candidate graph:** We need to confirm that a graph with `n=9` and `e=9` actually exists. We can construct one.\n    *   Let the vertices be `V = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.\n    *   Let the automorphism `φ` be `i ↦ (i + 3) mod 9`. This creates three vertex orbits: `(0,3,6)`, `(1,4,7)`, and `(2,5,8)`.\n    *   We can form the graph's edges by choosing a few base edges and then applying the automorphism `φ` to generate the full set of edges. To get `e=9`, we need 3 edge orbits.\n    *   Let's choose base edges `(0,1)`, `(0,3)`, and `(0,4)`. Applying `φ` and `φ²` to these three edges generates a set of 9 distinct edges that form a connected graph. This graph can be shown to have an automorphism group of size exactly 3.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since a graph with `e=9` exists, and we have shown that `e` must be at least 9, the smallest possible number of edges is 9.\n\nThe following Python code constructs this graph and prints the number of edges.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,\n# connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.\n# Based on graph theory, the minimum number of vertices for such a graph is 9.\n# For a connected graph with 9 vertices, the number of edges must be at least 8.\n# Furthermore, because the automorphism group is C3 and the minimal graph has no\n# fixed points, the number of edges must be a multiple of 3.\n# The smallest multiple of 3 that is >= 8 is 9.\n# The following code describes the construction of such a graph with 9 edges.\n\n# Define the vertices and the base edges for the construction\nnum_vertices = 9\nbase_edges = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\nall_edges = set()\n\n# The automorphism is i -> (i + 3) mod 9.
