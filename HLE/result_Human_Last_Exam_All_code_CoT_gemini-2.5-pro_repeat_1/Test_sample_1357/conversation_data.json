    "To determine the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve with a good reduction Jacobian, we need to analyze the structure of the special fiber of the curve's stable model.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Apply the Raynaud-LÃ¼tkebohmert Theorem**: This fundamental theorem connects the reduction of a curve to the reduction of its Jacobian. For the Jacobian to have good reduction, its special fiber must be a 4-dimensional abelian variety. This imposes strong constraints on the special fiber of the curve's stable model.\n2.  **Analyze the Stable Reduction's Dual Graph**: The condition of the Jacobian having good reduction implies that the dual graph of the stable reduction must be a tree. A graph with cycles (loops) would introduce a non-trivial torus part into the generalized Jacobian of the reduced curve, preventing it from being a pure abelian variety.\n3.  **Use the Genus Formula**: For a stable curve `C_s` with components `C_i` of geometric genus `g_i`, its arithmetic genus `g` is given by the formula `g = sum(g_i) + #nodes - #components + 1`. Since the dual graph is a tree, the number of nodes (edges) is one less than the number of components (`#nodes = #components - 1`).\n4.  **Simplify the Genus Constraint**: Substituting the tree condition into the genus formula for our `g=4` case, we get `4 = sum(g_i) + (#components - 1) - #components + 1`, which simplifies to `sum(g_i) = 4`. This means the sum of the geometric genera of all components in the stable reduction must be exactly 4.\n5.  **Enumerate Combinatorial Types**: The problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: find all possible ways to form a stable curve whose components' genera sum to 4 and whose dual graph is a tree. This involves:\n    *   Finding all integer partitions of 4.\n    *   For each partition, treating the parts as genera of the components, and determining the number of distinct, stable tree structures that can be formed with these components. A component is stable if `2*g_i - 2 + n_i > 0`, where `n_i` is the number of nodes on it (the degree of the vertex in the dual graph). Since all components must have genus `g_i >= 1` (as their sum is 4), this condition is always met for any connected tree structure.\n\nThe following Python script enumerates these combinatorial possibilities and calculates the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve\n    with a good reduction Jacobian by enumerating the combinatorial possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is equivalent to finding the number of distinct, genus-labeled trees where the sum of the genera (labels) is 4.\")\n    print(\"We analyze this by considering the integer partitions of 4.\\n\")\n\n    cases = [\n        {\n            \"partition\": \"4\",\n            \"description\": \"A single irreducible component of genus 4.
