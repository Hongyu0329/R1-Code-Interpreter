    "My plan is to find the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries. The main character is Adam Zamoyski. I will search for information about his relationships in the book. The character he forms the closest bond with, which can be considered a form of marriage in the novel's context, is a post-human entity. I will create a Python script to store this character's name in a variable and then print it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# He is resurrected in a distant future and forms a deep, dependent bond with a\n# post-human entity known as a phoebe. This relationship is the central partnership\n# in the book and is the equivalent of a marriage.\n# The name of this character is Angelika.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelika\"\n\n# Printing the name of the character.\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelika>>>"
