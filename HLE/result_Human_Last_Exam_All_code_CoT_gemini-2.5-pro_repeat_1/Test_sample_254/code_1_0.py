    print("The validity of an NMA rests on several key assumptions that are interconnected. Let's examine why meeting just one is not enough.\n")

    print("1. Considering only Homogeneity (C):")
    print("   - Homogeneity assumes that studies comparing the same two treatments are estimating a similar true effect.")
    print("   - This is not sufficient because you could have perfect homogeneity within each direct comparison (e.g., all 'A vs B' studies are consistent with each other), but if the patient populations in 'A vs B' studies are fundamentally different from those in 'B vs C' studies, the indirect comparison of A vs C is invalid. This violates the transitivity assumption.\n")

    print("2. Considering only Transitivity (A) / Similarity of Effect Modifiers (D):")
    print("   - Transitivity assumes it is valid to compare treatments indirectly (e.g., A vs C through A vs B and B vs C trials). This is based on the similarity of effect modifiers (like age, disease severity) across studies.")
    print("   - This is not sufficient because even if the studies are comparable in theory, the analysis can still be invalid if there is significant inconsistency. Inconsistency means the direct evidence (from 'A vs C' trials) and indirect evidence (from the A-B-C path) statistically disagree, pointing to a fundamental problem in the network.\n")

    print("3. Considering only Consistency (B):")
    print("   - Consistency is the statistical confirmation that direct and indirect evidence agree. It is often considered the statistical corollary of transitivity.")
    print("   - This is not sufficient because consistency is an outcome of a valid network, not a sole prerequisite. A network could be 'consistent' by chance, especially with sparse data, while still having underlying violations of homogeneity or transitivity that were not detected.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The validity of a Network Meta-Analysis is not guaranteed by satisfying any single condition. It requires a holistic assessment where all key assumptions are reasonably met. They are interdependent parts of a valid analytical framework.")
    
    # The prompt requires outputting an 'equation'. We can represent the logic as one.
    print("\nFinal logical 'equation':")
    print("A valid NMA requires that (Transitivity = 1) AND (Homogeneity = 1) AND (Consistency = 1). If any of these conditions equals 0, the entire result is invalid.")
