    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) for the quantum DNA polymerase problem.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The problem asks for the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.
    2. P(n) is the probability that for a random DNA sequence of length n, the counts
       of the 8 bases (N_0, ..., N_7) satisfy the condition N_x mod 8 != x for all x.
    3. The limit of P(n) does not strictly exist but oscillates depending on n mod 8.
       The question's request for a single "limiting value" implies we should
       calculate the average probability over these oscillations (the Ces√†ro mean).
    4. This average probability can be shown to be (7/8)^8. This is the same result
       as if the events (N_x mod 8 != x) were independent for each x, each with a
       probability of 7/8.
    5. This script calculates the value of (7/8)^8 and prints the components of the
       expression as requested.
