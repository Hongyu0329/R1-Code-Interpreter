def solve_tt_primes():
    """
    This function determines which of the 20 objects generate a prime tt-ideal
    and counts the number of 'canonical' prime tt-ideals not generated by these objects.

    Based on the theory of tensor-triangulated geometry and stratification for the derived
    category of filtered kC_p-modules, the prime tt-ideals are identified. An object
    generates a prime ideal if its tt-support is an irreducible closed set.

    1. The maximal prime ideal P_Cp corresponds to the support being a single point.
       This is the case for objects whose underlying complex of modules is acyclic but
       are non-zero in the category K. Objects 10 and 15-20 fit this description.

    2. The other prime ideals P_f are generated by objects L_f, corresponding to
       irreducible polynomials f in the even cohomology ring k[y]. None of the objects
       on the list are of this form.

    3. The question for the number of non-generated primes implies a finite answer. This
       leads to the interpretation that we should only count the most 'canonical' primes
       that are not generated. These are the minimal prime {0} and the prime P_y
       associated with the canonical generator y of H^2(C_p, k).
