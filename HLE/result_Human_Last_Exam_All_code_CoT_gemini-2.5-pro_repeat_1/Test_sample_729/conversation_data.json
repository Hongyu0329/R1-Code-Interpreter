    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n2.  **Determine the Group Parameter 'n':** The order of a generalized quaternion group is always a power of 2, written as $2^n$. For a group of size 128, we have $128 = 2^7$, which means $n=7$.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem:** For any generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$ where $n \\ge 3$, there is a known mathematical result stating that the number of distinct power subgroups is exactly $n$.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Since $n=7$ for $Q_{128}$ (and $7 \\ge 3$), the number of power subgroups is 7.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will calculate $n$ from the group size and then use the theorem to find the answer. It will also print a breakdown of the calculation to satisfy the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\nThe 7 power subgroups are: the group $Q_{128}$ itself, the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$, and the five cyclic subgroups generated by powers of the element $x$: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_in_Q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the\n    generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The size of the generalized quaternion group.\n    group_size = 128\n\n    # The order of a generalized quaternion group Q_2^n is 2^n.\n    # We find n by taking the logarithm base 2 of the group size.\n    # For Q_128, size = 128 = 2^7, so n=7.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} with n >= 3,\n    # the number of power subgroups is known to be exactly n.\n    if n < 3:\n        print(f\"The formula for the number of power subgroups applies for n >= 3.\")\n        print(f\"For Q_{group_size}, n = {n}, so the formula may not apply.\")\n        return\n\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n    \n    # Explain the calculation step-by-step\n    print(f\"The generalized quaternion group of size {group_size} is denoted as Q_{group_size}.\")\n    print(f\"The order of this group is {group_size}, which is equal to 2 to the power of n.\")\n    print(f\"We find n: n = log2({group_size}) = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nA theorem in group theory states that for any generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n}\")\n    print(f\"with n >= 3, the number of distinct power subgroups is exactly n.\")\n    print(f\"Since n = {n} in this case, the total number of power subgroups is {num_power_subgroups}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThese subgroups consist of:\")\n    print(f\"1.
