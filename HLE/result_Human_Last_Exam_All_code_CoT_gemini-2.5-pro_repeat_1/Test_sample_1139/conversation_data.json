    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensionality of the target manifold for the bosonic sector of the specified supersymmetric sigma-model.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Identify the correct mathematical space (manifold) that describes the bosonic sector. For the symmetry class D with `n` replicas, this space is the symmetric space `O(2n) / U(n)`.\n2.  Set the number of replicas to `n=2` as specified in the problem. The manifold becomes `O(4) / U(2)`.\n3.  The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is its dimension. The dimension of a quotient space `G/H` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n4.  Calculate the dimension of the orthogonal group `G = O(4)`. The general formula for the dimension of `O(N)` is `N*(N-1)/2`.\n5.  Calculate the dimension of the unitary group `H = U(2)`. The general formula for the dimension of `U(N)` is `N^2`.\n6.  Subtract the dimension of `H` from the dimension of `G` to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_physics_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for a specific supersymmetric sigma-model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks for the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables\n    # needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    # with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n\n    # 1.
