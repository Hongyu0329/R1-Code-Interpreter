    "My plan is to solve this problem computationally using Python and the `networkx` library. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. The strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Generate all possible graphs:** I will generate every possible simple graph with 5 vertices. A simple graph on 5 vertices can have between 0 and 10 edges (the maximum is C(5, 2)). I will iterate through all possible subsets of these 10 edges.\n2.  **Check for 2-vertex-connectivity:** For each generated graph, I will use the `networkx` function `node_connectivity` to determine its vertex connectivity. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if this value is 2 or greater.\n3.  **Filter for non-isomorphic graphs:** Many of the generated graphs will be structurally identical (isomorphic). I will maintain a list of the unique (non-isomorphic) 2-connected graphs found so far. For each new graph that is 2-connected, I will check if it is isomorphic to any graph already in my list. If it's not, I will add it.\n4.  **Count the result:** The final count will be the total number of unique, non-isomorphic graphs collected in the list.\n\nThis method systematically checks all possibilities and uses a robust isomorphism test to ensure each unique graph structure is counted only once.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs\n    with a specified number of vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 5\n    if num_vertices <= 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    vertices = range(num_vertices)\n    \n    # Generate all possible edges for a simple graph with num_vertices\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))\n    num_possible_edges = len(possible_edges)\n    \n    # A list to store the nonisomorphic graphs that meet the criteria\n    nonisomorphic_graphs_found = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible numbers of edges\n    for num_edges in range(num_possible_edges + 1):\n        # Iterate through all combinations of edges for a given number of edges\n        for edges in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, num_edges):\n            # Create a graph from the current set of edges\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(vertices)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n            \n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is >= 2.\n            # This also implicitly checks that the graph is connected and has no articulation points.\n            try:\n                if nx.node_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n                    # Check if this graph is isomorphic to any we've already found\n                    is_new = True\n                    for H in nonisomorphic_graphs_found:\n                        if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                            is_new = False\n                            break\n                    \n                    if is_new:\n                        nonisomorphic_graphs_found.append(G)\n            except nx.NetworkXError:\n                # nx.node_connectivity raises an error for graphs with < 2 nodes,\n                # but our setup ensures num_vertices >= 2.
