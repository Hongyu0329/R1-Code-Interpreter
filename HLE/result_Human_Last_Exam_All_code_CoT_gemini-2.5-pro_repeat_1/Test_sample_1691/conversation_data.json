    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior**: The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the integrand becomes very large where $g(x)$ is very small. The function $g(x)$ is zero at $x=0$. Therefore, the primary contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: In the region near $x=0$, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its term with the lowest power of $x$, which is the dominant term for small $x$. So, $g(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. The integrand can then be approximated as $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}}$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Integral**: We replace the full expression for $g(x)$ with its small-$x$ approximation. We also extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$. This is justified because for small $\\epsilon$, the approximated integrand decays very quickly as $x$ increases, making the contribution from the tail of the integral (beyond a small neighborhood of 0) negligible compared to the leading-order term.\n    The approximation is:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n4.  **Solve the Integral**: We can solve this integral using a variable substitution. Let $u^5 = \\frac{9.0 x^{5.0}}{\\epsilon}$, which gives $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} u$. The differential is $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} du$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0})^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5} = \\frac{(\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{1+u^5} = (9.0)^{-1/5} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{du}{1+u^5}$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Standard Integral**: The remaining definite integral is a standard result, given by $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5$, this is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Final Formula**: Combining these results, we obtain the asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\left( (9.0)^{-1/5} \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n    This can be written as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{C_2}$, where the code below will calculate the numerical values of $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the constants for the asymptotic formula of the integral\n    I(epsilon) = integral_0^15 (1 / (epsilon + 9*x^5 + 5*x^6 + 9*x^8)) dx\n    The formula is of the form I(epsilon) ~ C1 * epsilon^C2 for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dominant term in the denominator for x -> 0 is g(x) ~ a * x^p\n    a = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n\n    # The exponent C2 is given by the scaling law\n    C2 = (1.0 - p) / p\n\n    # The coefficient C1 is derived from the substitution and a standard integral\n    # C1 = a^(-1/p) * integral_0^inf(1/(1+u^p)) du\n    # The standard integral is equal to (pi/p) / sin(pi/p)\n    integral_part = (math.pi / p) / math.sin(math.pi / p)\n    C1 = math.pow(a, -1.0 / p) * integral_part\n\n    # Print the derived analytical formula with the computed constants.\n    print(f\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = C1 * epsilon^C2\")\n    print(f\"where the numbers are:\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {C1}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {C2}\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = {C1} * epsilon^({C2})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<0.6888226433289233>>>"
