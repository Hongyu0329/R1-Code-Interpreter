    "Phosphorus is a chemical element that can exist in several different structural forms called allotropes. Each of these allotropes has a distinct appearance and color.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the main, commonly recognized allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n2.  List the distinct color associated with each allotrope.\n3.  Sum the number of these distinct colors to find the total.\n4.  Present this information in a Python script that prints the breakdown and the final count as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the colors of the common allotropes of phosphorus\n    and calculates the total number of distinct colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary mapping each common allotrope to its distinct color.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"White (or yellowish)\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"Violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n    \n    print(\"The colors of the pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for allotrope, color in allotropes.items():\n        print(f\"- {color} (from {allotrope})\")\n        \n    num_colors = len(allotropes)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThere are {num_colors} distinct colors that can be observed.\")\n    \n    # Building and printing the final equation as requested.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"The final equation for the total number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
