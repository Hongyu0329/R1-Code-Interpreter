    Analyzes the factors behind the 2004-2008 non-agency RMBS crisis to identify the root cause.

    This is a knowledge-based problem. The code serves to document the reasoning and provide the answer in the requested format.

    Reasoning:
    1.  The value of a Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS) is derived from the cash flows of the underlying mortgages.
    2.  During 2004-2008, the value of these securities collapsed due to unprecedented levels of mortgage defaults.
    3.  We must find the ROOT CAUSE of these defaults.
    4.  Factors like 'Default rates' (E) and 'Recovery rates' (G) are direct drivers of value but are SYMPTOMS or PROXIMATE causes, not the root cause. The question is *why* defaults skyrocketed.
    5.  The answer lies in the poor quality of the underlying loans. This poor quality was a direct result of the practices of the companies that created them.
    6.  'The quality of the loan issuer and RMBS originator' (F) is the most comprehensive root cause. It encompasses the lax underwriting standards, the acceptance of low FICO scores (C), the creation of risky adjustable-rate products (B), and fraudulent application processing. The originators created the toxic assets at the very start of the financial chain.
