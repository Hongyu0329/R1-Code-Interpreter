Step-by-step analysis of the complexity statements:

Let's analyze the three constituent problems first:
1.  k-Clique: The problem of finding a clique of size k. This is the canonical W[1]-complete problem. It is not fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) unless FPT=W[1]. The counting version, #k-Clique, is #W[1]-complete.
2.  Induced k-Matching: The problem of finding k edges such that the subgraph induced by their 2k vertices consists only of these k edges. This problem is known to be W[1]-hard.
3.  Induced k-by-k-Biclique: The problem of finding an induced complete bipartite subgraph with k vertices in each partition. This problem is also W[1]-hard.

Now let's evaluate the given statements.

A. PDecide is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
B. PDecide is W[1]-hard

PDecide is the decision problem for the disjunction (OR) of the three problems above. If PDecide were FPT, it would mean an algorithm with runtime f(k) * n^c exists. This algorithm would have to work on all input graphs.

Consider a restricted class of graphs that are guaranteed to have no induced k-matchings and no induced k-by-k-bicliques. On such graphs, PDecide is equivalent to the k-Clique problem. It is a known result in parameterized complexity that k-Clique remains W[1]-hard even on such restricted graph classes (e.g., graphs with high girth, which limits induced structures).

If PDecide were FPT, it would imply that k-Clique on these restricted graph classes is FPT, which contradicts its known W[1]-hardness. Therefore, the assumption that PDecide is FPT must be false. This means PDecide is W[1]-hard.

Conclusion: Statement A is FALSE. Statement B is TRUE.

C. PCount is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
D. PCount is #W[1]-hard

PCount asks for the total number of the three types of structures. If PCount were FPT, we could solve the decision problem PDecide by simply running the FPT counting algorithm and checking if the result is greater than 0. This would imply that PDecide is FPT.

Since we have already established that PDecide is W[1]-hard, PCount cannot be FPT (unless W[1]=FPT).

Conclusion: Statement C is FALSE.

For statement D, we use the same reasoning as for statement B. The counting problem #k-Clique is #W[1]-hard, even on restricted graph classes where the number of induced k-matchings and induced k-by-k-bicliques is zero. An FPT algorithm for PCount would have to work on these graphs. On these specific graphs, the output of PCount is exactly the number of k-cliques. This would imply an FPT algorithm for #k-Clique on these restricted classes, which contradicts the fact that it is #W[1]-hard. Therefore, PCount must be #W[1]-hard.

Conclusion: Statement D is TRUE.
