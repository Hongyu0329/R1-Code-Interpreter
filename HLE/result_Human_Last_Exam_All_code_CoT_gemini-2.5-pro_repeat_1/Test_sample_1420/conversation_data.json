    "My plan is to solve for the scaling exponent α by using the first-order epsilon expansion, a standard technique in renormalization group theory.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify Parameters**: I'll start by defining the key parameters. For this problem, the spatial dimension is `d = 3`. In the context of the Ising model (which is the standard assumption unless specified otherwise), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`, and the number of spin components is `n = 1`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ)**: The epsilon expansion is performed in terms of the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`. I will calculate this value.\n3.  **Use the Epsilon Expansion Formula**: I'll apply the well-known first-order formula for the specific heat exponent `α`: `α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n4.  **Substitute and Solve**: I will substitute the parameters `n` and `ϵ` into the formula to calculate the numerical value of `α`.\n5.  **Code Generation**: Finally, I will write a Python script to perform and display this calculation, ensuring it prints the full equation with all the numbers and the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1.
