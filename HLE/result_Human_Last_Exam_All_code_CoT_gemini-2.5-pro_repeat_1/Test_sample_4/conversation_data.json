    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**: The commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, and $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. We can see that the algebra is formed by two well-known Lie algebras \"glued\" along a common subalgebra.\n    *   The subalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4$ is the 4-dimensional filiform nilpotent Lie algebra, denoted $\\mathfrak{f}_4$.\n    *   The subalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ with relation $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$ is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, denoted $\\mathfrak{h}_3$.\n    *   The common subalgebra is the 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$, which is just $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Künneth-like Formula**: The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be viewed as the tensor product of the complexes for $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over the complex for their intersection. This structure leads to a formula for the Poincaré polynomial of the total algebra in terms of its components:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)}$\n\n3.  **Determine the Poincaré Polynomials of the Components**:\n    *   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\mathfrak{f}_4$**: The Betti numbers for the n-dimensional filiform Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{f}_n$ are known. For $n=4$, they are $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=2, b_4=1$. Thus, its Poincaré polynomial is:\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n    *   **For $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\mathfrak{h}_3$**: The Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1$. Thus, its Poincaré polynomial is:\n        $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    *   **For $\\mathbb{R}$**: This is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. Its Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=1$. Its Poincaré polynomial is:\n        $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Polynomial**: We will multiply $P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x)$ and $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x)$ and then divide the result by $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$. This can be done using polynomial arithmetic.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: A Python script using the `numpy` library will be provided to perform the polynomial multiplication and division and format the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_polynomial(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Formats a list of coefficients into a polynomial string.\"\"\"\n    parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(coeffs):\n        # Cast to integer if it's a whole number\n        if np.isclose(coeff, round(coeff)):\n            coeff = int(round(coeff))\n\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Term part\n        if i == 0:\n            term = str(coeff)\n        elif i == 1:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = \"x\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x\"\n        else:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = f\"x**{i}\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x**{i}\"\n        \n        parts.append(term)\n        \n    # Join parts with ' + ' and handle negative signs correctly\n    return \" + \".join(parts).replace(\" + -\", \" - \")\n\n# Step 3: Define the Poincare polynomials for the component Lie algebras\n# P_f4(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4 for the filiform algebra f_4\np_f4 = np.array([1, 2, 2, 2, 1])\n\n# P_h3(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 for the Heisenberg algebra h_3\np_h3 = np.array([1, 2, 2, 1])\n\n# P_R(x) = 1 + x for the 1D abelian algebra R\np_R = np.array([1, 1])\n\n# Step 4: Compute the final polynomial using the formula\n# Numerator = P_f4(x) * P_h3(x)\np_numerator = np.polymul(p_f4, p_h3)\n\n# Final polynomial = Numerator / P_R(x)\np_g, remainder = np.polydiv(p_numerator, p_R)\n\n# The remainder should be zero, indicating exact division\n# print(f\"Remainder: {remainder}\")\n\n# Format and print the final polynomial\nfinal_poly_str = format_polynomial(p_g)\nprint(final_poly_str)\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x**2 + 6*x**3 + 5*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
