# The user wants to know the name of a specific island town.
# The clues are:
# 1. More than 500 km from another inhabited island (very remote).
# 2. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.
# 3. The town and the bay share the same name.
#
# The answer is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
# - Easter Island is one of the most isolated inhabited islands in the world.
# - The main town, Hanga Roa, is located on Hanga Roa Bay.
# - The island is entirely volcanic, and the bay is a direct result of this volcanic geography.
