The incorrect statement is A.

Detailed Explanation:
The statement claims that the 'embroidered dragon and phoenix robe' (龙凤褂, lóngfèng guà) was formalized as wedding attire during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). This is a common misconception.

While the Ming Dynasty did establish red as the primary color for wedding attire and used elaborate phoenix crowns (凤冠) for brides of high status, the specific 'dragon and phoenix robe' is more accurately associated with the subsequent Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) and modern traditions, particularly in Southern China.

The formal wedding attire for women of the noble class in the Ming Dynasty was typically a different style of red robe, often a 蟒服 (mǎngfú, a 'python' robe), worn with a 霞帔 (xiápèi, a decorative shawl-like garment). Therefore, attributing the formalization of the lóngfèng guà to the Ming Dynasty is historically inaccurate.
