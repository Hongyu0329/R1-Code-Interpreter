    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Location:** \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome.\n*   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n*   **Object:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n*   **Timeframe:** In \"1950\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Known Elements**\nThe Piazza della Rotonda is one of Rome's most famous squares. Its primary features today are the Pantheon and the large fountain in the center, the *Fontana del Pantheon*, which is topped by an Egyptian obelisk. Since the Pantheon and the fountain are still there, the removed feature must be something else.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Historical Context of 1950**\nThe mid-20th century, especially the period after World War II, was a time of major modernization in many European cities. A key aspect of this modernization was the transformation of urban transport. Cities began to favor buses and private cars over older systems like electric tramways. This often led to the removal of extensive networks of tram tracks from city centers.\n\n**Step 4: Research Specific Changes to the Piazza della Rotonda**\nInvestigating the history of the Piazza della Rotonda's infrastructure reveals that it was once a hub for Rome's tram network. Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century clearly show tram tracks in the square.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"Unique Architectural Feature\"**\nThe tram line in the Piazza della Rotonda was not just a simple straight track. To navigate the space around the central fountain, the tramway was constructed as a circular loop or ring, the **\"Anello tranviario del Pantheon\"** (Pantheon tram ring). Trams would enter the square and circle the fountain before continuing on their route. This circular track, integrated into a historic and architecturally sensitive square, was indeed a unique and notable feature of the piazza's layout for several decades.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Removal Date**\nThe tram ring around the Pantheon was part of a network that was decommissioned as Rome updated its public transport system. The process of dismantling these central tram lines occurred in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The removal of the tracks from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 aligns perfectly with this historical timeline.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unique architectural feature that was present in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal in 1950 was the circular tram track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tram track that went around the central fountain.>>>"
