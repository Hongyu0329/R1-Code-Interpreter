    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core task is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix A, which is explicitly given:\n\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\nThe question also provides context: \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". We need to determine if this context affects the matrix A. Since the matrix A is defined with specific numerical entries, the additional information serves as background and does not change the matrix we need to work with. The problem reduces to a direct calculation of the determinant of A.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n1.  **Identify the matrix:** The matrix for which the determinant needs to be calculated is clearly provided.\n2.  **Ignore extraneous information:** The phrases \"Markov quiver\" and \"for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" are contextual. While the matrix A is indeed related to the Markov quiver (it is the Cartan matrix of type \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\)), the specific value of \\( m_{1/2} \\) does not alter the entries of A. We can proceed with the calculation without using this information.\n3.  **Choose a calculation method:** For a 3x3 matrix, several methods can be used, such as the Sarrus rule, cofactor expansion, or row reduction. Using more than one method is a good way to verify the result.\n4.  **Check for special properties:** Before diving into calculation, it's useful to inspect the matrix for properties that simplify the work. For instance, checking for linear dependence among rows or columns.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe will compute the determinant of A using three different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Rule of Sarrus**\nFor a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\), the determinant is given by the formula:\ndet = \\( aei + bfg + cdh - gec - hfa - idb \\)\n\nFor our matrix A:\n*   a=2, b=-1, c=-1\n*   d=-1, e=2, f=-1\n*   g=-1, h=-1, i=2\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\ndet(A) = (2)(2)(2) + (-1)(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(-1) - [(-1)(2)(-1) + (-1)(-1)(2) + (2)(-1)(-1)]\ndet(A) = 8 - 1 - 1 - [2 + 2 + 2]\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\n**Method 2: Cofactor Expansion**\nWe can expand the determinant along any row or column. Let's use the first row.\ndet(A) = \\( a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + a_{13}C_{13} \\)\ndet(A) = \\( 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} \\)\n\nCalculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3 \\)\n\nNow substitute these back into the expansion formula:\ndet(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\ndet(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 0\n\n**Method 3: Row Operations and Properties of Determinants**\nA key property of determinants is that if the rows or columns of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Let's check if the rows of A are linearly dependent by summing them.\nLet R1, R2, and R3 be the rows of A.\nR1 + R2 + R3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2]\nR1 + R2 + R3 = [0, 0, 0]\n\nSince the sum of the three rows is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. Therefore, the determinant of the matrix must be zero. This is the quickest method if this property is spotted. This property is characteristic of all affine Cartan matrices, of which A is an example.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll three methods yield the same result. The determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
