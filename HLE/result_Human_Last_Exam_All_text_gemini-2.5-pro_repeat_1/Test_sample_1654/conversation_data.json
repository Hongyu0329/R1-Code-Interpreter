    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question's Core Request**\nThe main task is to count the number of times Anton Chekov describes the police superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his shifting mentality, which is the key to identifying the relevant passages.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Description of the Coat\"**\nFor this analysis, a \"description\" is not just an adjective used for the coat. It includes any instance where Chekov draws the reader's attention to the coat, particularly the significant actions of Otchumyelov putting it on or taking it off. These actions are the primary way Chekov uses the coat as a symbol.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological Analysis of the Story's Events**\nWe will read through the story and identify each moment the coat is mentioned or its state is changed.\n\n*   **Instance 1: The Introduction**\n    At the very beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks across the market square, he is described.\n    *   **Description:** He is wearing a \"new overcoat.\" This is the first time the coat is mentioned, setting the stage for its importance.\n\n*   **Instance 2: The First Shift in Opinion**\n    After the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's official demeanor changes. He suddenly feels warm, a physical reaction to his change of mind.\n    *   **Description:** He says to his policeman, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\" This action of removing the coat is the second description and the first symbolic shift.\n\n*   **Instance 3: The Second Shift in Opinion**\n    When the policeman says that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's mood changes again. He now feels the need to appear stern and official.\n    *   **Description:** He says, \"Put my coat on, brother Yeldyrin... the wind's getting up... I feel a bit shivery...\" Putting the coat back on is the third description, symbolizing his return to a harsher stance.\n\n*   **Instance 4: The Third Shift in Opinion**\n    A new voice in the crowd insists that the dog is indeed the General's. Otchumyelov immediately reverses his position again, becoming sycophantic.\n    *   **Description:** He once again complains of the heat, saying, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" This is the fourth time the coat's status is described.\n\n*   **Instance 5: The Fourth Shift in Opinion**\n    The General's cook arrives and states that the dog does not belong to them. This throws Otchumyelov back into confusion and he reverts to his \"official\" coldness.\n    *   **Description:** He says, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin; I feel the wind blowing...\" This fifth description shows him putting the coat on yet again.\n\n*   **Instance 6: The Final Shift and Conclusion**\n    The cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's brother, who has recently arrived. Relieved to have identified the owner as someone important, Otchumyelov settles on his final, fawning attitude.\n    *   **Description:** As he leaves the scene, Chekov writes that Otchumyelov \"wraps his greatcoat round him\" and continues on his way. This final action with the coat serves as the sixth and concluding description, cementing his final \"chameleon\" persona.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n1.  **Actions as Descriptions:** The most important descriptions are the actions of taking the coat off and putting it on. These are not passive details; they are central to the story's theme and characterization.\n2.  **Synonyms for the Coat:** Chekov uses the terms \"overcoat\" and \"greatcoat\" in various translations, but they both refer to the same symbolic garment.\n3.  **Consistency:** This sequence of six descriptions is consistent across standard translations of the story, as it forms the narrative and symbolic backbone of the plot.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy carefully tracking each mention and action related to Otchumyelov's coat from the beginning of the story to the end, we can identify six distinct instances where Chekov describes it to symbolize the superintendent's servile and ever-changing mentality.\n\n<<<6>>>"
