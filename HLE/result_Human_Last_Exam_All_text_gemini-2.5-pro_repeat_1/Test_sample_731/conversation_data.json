    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The size of the group is given as 512, which is $2^9$. So, we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$, which means $n=9$.\n    The presentation for our group is:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{8}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{7}-1} \\rangle$\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of this group are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**.\n    Therefore, the question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $SD_{512}$.\n\n**Step 2: Strategy for counting cyclic subgroups**\n\nTo find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups, we can count the number of subgroups for each possible order and sum them up. A more direct approach is to partition the subgroups into two categories:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are contained within the subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These must be generated by elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n**Step 3: Count cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{1, r, r^2, \\dots, r^{255}\\}$ is a cyclic group of order 256. For any finite cyclic group, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of the group's order.\nThe order of $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $256 = 2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$. These are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\nThere are $8+1=9$ divisors. Thus, there are **9** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Count cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$**\n\nThese subgroups must be generated by elements of the form $g = sr^i$. To count them, we first need to determine the orders of these elements.\nThe order of $g=sr^i$ is determined by its powers. Let's compute $g^2$:\n$(sr^i)^2 = sr^i sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i$.\nFrom the group relation, $srs = r^{127}$, which implies $sr = r^{127}s$. By induction, we can show $sr^i = r^{127i}s$.\nSo, $(sr^i)^2 = (r^{127i}s)sr^i = r^{127i}s^2 r^i = r^{127i} \\cdot 1 \\cdot r^i = r^{128i}$.\n\nNow, we find the order of $sr^i$ by considering two cases for the integer $i$:\n\n*   **Case 1: $i$ is even.**\n    Let $i = 2k$. Then $(sr^{2k})^2 = r^{128(2k)} = r^{256k} = (r^{256})^k = 1^k = 1$.\n    So, if $i$ is even, the element $sr^i$ has order 2.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $i$ in the range $0 \\le i < 256$. These are $i=0, 2, 4, \\dots, 254$.\n    Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2: $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\{1, sr^i\\}$. These subgroups are distinct because if $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^j \\rangle$ (for $i,j$ even), then $sr^i = sr^j$, which implies $i=j$.\n    So, there are **128** cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by these elements.\n\n*   **Case 2: $i$ is odd.**\n    Let $i = 2k+1$. Then $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i}$. Since $i$ is odd, $128i \\equiv 128 \\pmod{256}$.\n    So, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128}$.\n    The element $r^{128}$ has order 2, since $(r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = 1$.\n    Since $(sr^i)^2$ has order 2, the element $sr^i$ must have order 4.\n    There are $256/2 = 128$ odd values for $i$ in the range $0 \\le i < 256$. These are $i=1, 3, 5, \\dots, 255$.\n    We have 128 elements of order 4. These elements generate cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n    A cyclic subgroup of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators. For a subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ of order 4, its generators are $g$ and $g^3$.\n    The number of distinct cyclic subgroups is the number of elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup: $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    So, there are **64** distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by these elements.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from the disjoint categories we've analyzed.\n*   Cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n*   Cyclic subgroups generated by $sr^i$ with $i$ even: 128\n*   Cyclic subgroups generated by $sr^i$ with $i$ odd: 64\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe subgroups generated by elements $sr^i$ are not contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$, so there is no overlap with the first category of 9 subgroups. The subgroups generated by $sr^i$ for even $i$ (order 2) and odd $i$ (order 4) are also distinct. Therefore, we can simply sum the counts.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$."
