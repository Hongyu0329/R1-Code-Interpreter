    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosopher.\n    *   **Affiliation:** The philosopher must belong to the Lviv-Warsaw School of philosophy.\n    *   **Key Concept:** The philosopher is known for analyzing the notion of a \"hallmark\" (a type of sign or characteristic feature).\n    *   **Specific Contribution:** This analysis involves decomposing the concept of a hallmark into two distinct categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was an influential school of Polish logic and analytic philosophy active between the World Wars.\n    *   Its founder was Kazimierz Twardowski.\n    *   Prominent members included Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n    *   The school was known for its emphasis on clarity, logical rigor, and the analysis of language.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: \"Symptoms\" vs. \"Signals\"**\n    *   This is a distinction within semiotics (the theory of signs).\n    *   A **symptom** (in Polish, *objaw*) is typically understood as a natural sign that is causally connected to what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. The connection is not based on convention or intention.\n    *   A **signal** (in Polish, *sygnał*) is typically understood as a conventional or intentional sign, created to communicate or to elicit a specific response from a receiver. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; a spoken command is a signal.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to the Philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   The analysis of language, meaning, and signs was a central concern for many members of this school.\n    *   We need to find the philosopher whose work in semiotics or philosophy of language prominently features the symptom/signal distinction.\n    *   While many members worked on logic, the analysis of different types of signs in this manner is most characteristic of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   In his works on \"pragmatic logic\" and the philosophy of language, Ajdukiewicz provided a detailed classification of signs. He distinguished signs based on their relationship to the object they refer to and the intention of the user.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Attribution to Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz:**\n    *   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz explicitly developed a theory of signs where he made this crucial distinction. He analyzed how expressions function.\n    *   He identified **symptoms** as signs that are causally produced by the state of affairs they indicate (e.g., a cry of pain).\n    *   He identified **signals** (sometimes also called \"appeals\") as signs used intentionally to influence the behavior or thoughts of a recipient.\n    *   This decomposition is a well-known part of his contribution to semiotics and the philosophy of language, separating natural, causal signs from conventional, communicative ones. The term \"hallmark\" or \"feature\" (*cecha* in Polish) can be understood as a general type of sign, whose function Ajdukiewicz's analysis helps to clarify.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made the influential distinction between signs as symptoms and signs as signals is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
