    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question:**\nThe question asks to identify a classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. In ballet, \"position\" not only refers to the shape (e.g., fifth position) but also to the configuration, such as which foot is in front. Therefore, a step that is \"changé\" (changed) ends in a different position from where it started. We are looking for a step that is \"sans changer\" (without changing).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump where the legs open and close three times, creating six distinct movements (hence \"six\"). For example, starting with the right foot front, the legs open, beat back, open, beat front, open, and finally close.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot in front). This is by definition a \"changé\" step.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in a closed position, usually fifth.\n    *   **Execution:** \"Échappé\" means \"to escape,\" involving a jump from a closed position to an open one (like second position). \"Battu\" means \"beaten,\" so the legs beat together as they return to the closed position. The term \"changé\" is explicitly in the name, meaning \"changed.\"\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the feet having switched their front/back placement.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Often begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble.\" The dancer slides one foot out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings both legs together (\"assembles\" them) in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. In the most common forms, such as *assemblé dessus* (over) or *assemblé dessous* (under), the feet change places. For example, in *assemblé dessus*, the foot that starts in the back moves to the front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** In its standard execution, the feet land in a different configuration of fifth position than where they started.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are typically different.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" is a gliding step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind\" and refers to the action of the closing leg. The execution can vary:\n        *   If the front foot (right) initiates the glide to the side, and the back foot (left) closes behind it, the dancer ends with the right foot in front, the same as the start. This is a *glissade sans changer*.\n        *   However, if the back foot (left) initiates the glide to the side, and the front foot (right) closes behind it, the dancer ends with the left foot in front, which is a change. This is a *glissade changé*.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A *glissade derrière* can be performed either with or without changing the feet. Because it does not *always* end in the same position, it may not be the best answer.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative step. It resembles a *pas de chat* but with a double *rond de jambe* (circle of the leg) in the air. The standard execution involves a jump where the leading leg performs a *rond de jambe en l'air* outwards, and the second leg performs one inwards. The dancer then lands back in the starting position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The standard and most frequently performed version of a gargouillade is *sans changer*. The dancer starts in fifth position with one foot in front and lands in fifth position with the very same foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The characteristic execution of a gargouillade has the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nComparing the options, Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, and Assemblé are fundamentally changing steps. Glissade derrière can be performed either way, making it an ambiguous case. Gargouillade, in its standard form as taught and performed in classical repertoire, is a non-changing step. Therefore, it is the most accurate answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
