    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the lowest possible temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be synthesized in an efficient manner. This requires considering all known synthesis methods and evaluating them based on efficiency, which typically involves factors like reaction rate, yield, and practicality.\n\n**Step 2: Review Synthesis Methods for Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**\n\nThere are several methods to produce XeF₄, but the most common and well-established is the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas.\n\n*   **Method: Direct Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Description:** This method involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine gas in a sealed nickel vessel under pressure. The outcome of the reaction is highly dependent on the conditions (temperature, pressure, and reactant ratio).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Critical Reaction Conditions**\nThe synthesis of xenon fluorides is a delicate process where temperature and reactant ratios are used to control which fluoride (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) is the major product.\n\n*   **To produce XeF₂:** Typically requires an excess of Xenon and is done at a similar temperature (around 400°C) or via photolysis at room temperature.\n*   **To produce XeF₄:** This requires an excess of fluorine gas. The standard, well-documented procedure involves heating a xenon-fluorine mixture in a molar ratio of approximately 1:5.\n*   **To produce XeF₆:** This requires a large excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20 ratio) and higher temperatures (around 300°C but at much higher pressure) or higher temperatures at lower pressure (above 500°C).\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the Temperature for Efficient XeF₄ Production**\n\nFor the direct thermal synthesis of XeF₄, the temperature is a critical factor for achieving an \"efficient\" process.\n\n*   **If the temperature is too low (e.g., below 300°C):** The activation energy for the reaction is not met, and the reaction proceeds extremely slowly, if at all. This is not efficient.\n*   **If the temperature is too high (e.g., 600°C):** The reaction will favor the formation of the more highly fluorinated product, Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆), especially with the excess fluorine present. This would make the production of pure XeF₄ inefficient due to low yield and difficult separation.\n*   **The Optimal Temperature:** The established temperature that provides a good balance between a high reaction rate and high selectivity for XeF₄ is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, with a 1:5 ratio of Xe to F₂, XeF₄ is formed as the primary product in good yield.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Other Potential Methods**\nWhile methods like photochemical synthesis or electrical discharge can produce xenon fluorides at lower temperatures (even room temperature or below), they are generally considered less \"efficient\" for producing large, pure quantities compared to the direct thermal method. They often result in lower yields or mixtures of products and are not the standard for bulk preparation. Therefore, the most reliable and efficient method remains the thermal synthesis.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude by Analyzing the Answer Choices**\n\nBased on the analysis, we need to find the coldest temperature from the list where the synthesis is still efficient.\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** Too hot, would inefficiently produce XeF₄ and favor XeF₆.\n*   **B. 400 C:** This is the standard, textbook temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. The reaction proceeds at a good rate and yields the desired product.\n*   **C. 200 C:** Too cold for the thermal reaction to be efficient. The rate would be very slow.\n*   **D. 78 C:** Far too cold for an efficient thermal reaction.\n*   **E. 0 C:** Far too cold for an efficient thermal reaction.\n*   **F. -78 C:** Far too cold for an efficient thermal reaction.\n\nTherefore, 400°C is the most suitable temperature among the choices that allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride. It represents the lower boundary for an efficient thermal process.\n\n<<<B>>>"
