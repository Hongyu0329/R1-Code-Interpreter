    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Determine the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Fuzzy System Type:** Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS). This indicates a high level of uncertainty handling, but the fundamental concepts of fuzzy inference remain similar.\n    *   **Given Value 1:** `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   **Given Value 2:** `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   **Operation:** A t-norm operation is mentioned.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Fuzzy Rule:** A fuzzy rule is typically in the form `IF <antecedent> THEN <consequent>`. For example, `Rule k: IF x is F_k THEN y is G_k`.\n    *   **Rule Activation Level (or Firing Strength):** This is the result of evaluating the `IF` part (the antecedent) of the rule for a given input. It measures the degree to which the rule's premise is true. It is a single value (or interval in type-2/3 systems) that represents the rule's contribution to the final output.\n    *   **Antecedent:** The `IF` part of the rule (e.g., `x is F_k`).\n    *   **Consequent:** The `THEN` part of the rule (e.g., `y is G_k`).\n    *   **T-norm:** A function that models a fuzzy logical `AND` operation. Common t-norms are Minimum (`min(a,b)`) and Product (`a*b`).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Provided Information in Context:**\n    *   The process of generating an output from a fuzzy rule involves several steps. The first major step is to determine the rule's activation level.\n    *   `Phi_k(x′)`: In the literature on fuzzy logic systems (including Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3), the symbol `Φ` (Phi) or `f` is standard notation for the firing strength or **rule activation level** of the k-th rule for a given input `x'`. The problem explicitly states that `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j)`: This notation represents the membership grade of a value `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k`, which is the **consequent** of the rule. This value is used in a later step of the fuzzy inference process called \"implication,\" where the activation level is combined with the consequent set to produce the rule's output fuzzy set.\n    *   **T-norm Operation:** A t-norm is used to calculate the rule activation level (`Phi_k(x′)`) by combining the membership degrees of the input in the various antecedent sets. The mention of \"using a t-norm operation\" in the question is descriptive of how `Phi_k(x′)` was obtained; it is not an instruction to perform a new calculation.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Distinguishing between steps:** It is crucial to distinguish between the \"rule activation\" step and the subsequent \"implication\" step. The activation level depends only on the rule's antecedent and the input. The implication step uses this activation level to modify the rule's consequent.\n*   **Relevance of Information:** The question provides the value for the rule activation level (`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`) and a value from the consequent set (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`). The question asks for the rule activation level. Therefore, the value from the consequent set is extraneous information for this specific question.\n*   **Complexity of IT3 FS:** While the problem is set in the context of an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set, the values provided are crisp numbers (`0.7`, `0.9`). This simplifies the problem to its core logic. In a full IT3 FS calculation, `Phi_k(x′)` would be an interval or a more complex structure, but the principle remains the same. The question is testing the understanding of the process, not the complex arithmetic of IT3 FSs.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the \"rule activation level\".\n2.  The standard symbol for the rule activation level of rule `k` is `Phi_k(x′)`.\n3.  The problem explicitly states that `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n4.  Therefore, the rule activation level is given directly in the problem statement. The other information (`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`) is not needed to answer the question.\n\nFinal Answer: The rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
