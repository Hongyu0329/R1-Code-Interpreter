    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function (Z):**\n    The grand canonical partition function describes a system that can exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir. It is defined in terms of the Hamiltonian `H^` and the particle number operator `N^` as:\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β(H^ - μN^))]`\n    Here, `β = 1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `Tr` denotes the trace over all quantum states.\n\n2.  **Substitute the Given Hamiltonian:**\n    The problem specifies a very particular Hamiltonian: `H^ = -μN^`. We substitute this into the general formula for `Z`:\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β((-μN^) - μN^))]`\n    `Z = Tr[e^(-β(-2μN^))]`\n    `Z = Tr[e^(2βμN^)]`\n    This simplified expression is what we need to evaluate using the path integral formalism.\n\n3.  **Establish the Path Integral Formulation:**\n    The partition function `Z` can be expressed as a functional integral (path integral) over fields `ψ(x,τ)` and `ψ*(x,τ)`:\n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n    The term `S` is the Euclidean action, which corresponds to the operator in the exponent of the density matrix, `K^ = H^ - μN^`. The action is given by:\n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ψ*(x, τ) ∂_τ ψ(x, τ) + H(ψ*, ψ) - μN(ψ*, ψ)]`\n    where `H(ψ*, ψ)` and `N(ψ*, ψ)` are the field representations of the operators `H^` and `N^`.\n\n4.  **Construct the Action for the Specific System:**\n    *   The particle number operator is represented by `N(ψ*, ψ) = ∫ d^d x ψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)`.\n    *   The given Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^` is represented by `H(ψ*, ψ) = -μ ∫ d^d x ψ*ψ`.\n    *   We combine these to find the term `H - μN` needed for the action:\n        `H - μN = (-μ ∫ d^d x ψ*ψ) - (μ ∫ d^d x ψ*ψ) = -2μ ∫ d^d x ψ*ψ`\n    *   Therefore, the action `S` for this system is:\n        `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ψ* ∂_τ ψ - 2μ ψ*ψ]`\n        `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x ψ*(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ`\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Path Integral:**\n    The action `S` is quadratic in the fields, meaning the path integral is a Gaussian integral. The result of such an integral is the determinant of the operator in the quadratic form. The specific form of the result depends on whether the particles are **bosons** (described by complex fields) or **fermions** (described by Grassmann fields).\n\n    The integral evaluates to:\n    *   For Bosons: `Z = [det(∂_τ - 2μ)]^-1`\n    *   For Fermions: `Z = det(∂_τ - 2μ)`\n\n    To evaluate the determinant, we find the eigenvalues of the operator `(∂_τ - 2μ)`. In a basis of momentum states `k` and Matsubara frequencies `ω_n`, the operator is diagonal, and its eigenvalues are `(-iω_n - 2μ)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Determinant and Distinguish by Particle Statistics:**\n    The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues over all single-particle states (all modes `k`). Let `M` be the total number of single-particle states available to the system.\n    A crucial point is that the eigenvalues `(-iω_n - 2μ)` do not depend on the momentum `k`. This is because the Hamiltonian lacks a kinetic energy term. Therefore, the product over all `M` states is simply the result for a single state raised to the power of `M`.\n\n    The calculation for a single state, after summing over the Matsubara frequencies `ω_n`, yields a well-known result that depends on the particle statistics.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Bosons**\n        The occupation number of any state can be `0, 1, 2, ...`. The single-state partition function is a geometric series: `Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (e^(2βμ))^n = 1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))`. This sum only converges if `μ < 0`.\n        The total partition function is:\n        `Z_boson = [1 / (1 - e^(2βμ))]^M`\n\n    *   **Case 2: Fermions**\n        The occupation number of any state can only be `0` or `1` (Pauli exclusion principle). The single-state partition function is: `Σ_{n=0,1} (e^(2βμ))^n = 1 + e^(2βμ)`.\n        The total partition function is:\n        `Z_fermion = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M`\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Particle Statistics:** The final answer critically depends on whether the system consists of bosons or fermions. The problem does not specify this, so a complete answer must address both possibilities.\n*   **Simplified Hamiltonian:** The Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^` has no kinetic or potential energy terms. This simplifies the calculation significantly, making the result independent of momentum and dependent only on `β`, `μ`, and the total number of states `M`.\n*   **Number of States (M):** `M` represents the total number of single-particle quantum states available. For a system in a box of volume `V`, `M` is proportional to `V`.\n*   **Convergence Condition:** For the bosonic case, the result is valid only under the condition `μ < 0`, which ensures the convergence of the underlying geometric series and prevents an infinite population of the ground state.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer depends on the statistics of the particles in the system. Let M be the total number of single-particle states.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**, the partition function is:\n$Z = \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}} \\right)^M$\nThis is valid for `μ < 0`.\n\nFor a system of **fermions**, the partition function is:\n$Z = (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})^M$\n\nSince the question does not specify the particle type, both results constitute the complete answer.\n\n<<<For bosons, Z = (1 - e^(2βμ))^(-M), under the condition μ < 0. For fermions, Z = (1 + e^(2βμ))^M, where M is the total number of single-particle states.>>>"
