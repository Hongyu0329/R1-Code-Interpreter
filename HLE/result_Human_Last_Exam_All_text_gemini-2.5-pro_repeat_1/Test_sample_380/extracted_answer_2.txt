No, the local magnetic field is not generally considered to be radial when calculating normalized magnetic helicity at the L1 point. The correct procedure is to transform the magnetic field data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, where one axis is parallel to the local average magnetic field. The helicity is then calculated using the components perpendicular to this local field direction. Using components perpendicular to the radial direction is only a valid approximation when the local magnetic field itself happens to be nearly radial.
