    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the integral $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j\\rangle$ where $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ are 1s Slater-type orbitals (STOs). This is a matrix element of the operator $\\frac{1}{r}$ in the basis of 1s STOs. In atomic units, this operator represents the potential energy of an electron due to a nucleus with charge +1 located at the origin. The integral in full is:\n\\[ \\int_{\\text{all space}} \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}) d\\tau \\]\n\n### Careful Points and Interpretation\n\n1.  **Identity of the Orbitals**: The question specifies \"for a 1s Slater orbital\" (singular). This suggests we are calculating a property of a single orbital, which is its expectation value. Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that the initial and final states are the same, i.e., $\\phi_i = \\phi_j = \\phi_{1s}$. If the orbitals were different, the question would likely be phrased \"between two 1s Slater orbitals\".\n\n2.  **Location of Orbitals and Potential**: The operator is $1/r$, implying the source of the potential is at the origin ($r=0$). In the context of an atomic orbital, it's natural to assume the orbital itself is also centered at the origin. This leads to a one-center integral, which is the simplest case. Other cases, like two-center integrals (where orbitals are on different atoms), are more complex and would require additional information, such as the distance between the centers.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Interpretation**: We will proceed by evaluating the expectation value of the $1/r$ operator for a single 1s Slater orbital centered at the origin. This is the most fundamental and common integral of this type. We are calculating $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Evaluation\n\n**Step 1: Define the Normalized 1s Slater Orbital**\n\nA 1s Slater-type orbital is given by the functional form $\\phi(r) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent and $N$ is a normalization constant. We find $N$ from the normalization condition $\\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle = 1$.\n\nIn spherical coordinates, the volume element is $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$.\n\\[ \\langle \\phi | \\phi \\rangle = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^\\infty |N e^{-\\zeta r}|^2 r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi = 1 \\]\n\\[ N^2 \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty r^2 e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\right) = 1 \\]\nThe angular integrals evaluate to $2\\pi$ and $2$, respectively, giving a product of $4\\pi$.\nThe radial integral is a standard form: $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$. For $n=2$ and $a=2\\zeta$, we have $\\int_0^\\infty r^2 e^{-2\\zeta r} dr = \\frac{2!}{(2\\zeta)^3} = \\frac{2}{8\\zeta^3} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^3}$.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the normalization equation:\n\\[ N^2 (4\\pi) \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^3} \\right) = 1 \\implies N^2 \\frac{\\pi}{\\zeta^3} = 1 \\implies N = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} \\]\nThus, the normalized 1s Slater orbital is:\n\\[ \\phi_{1s}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\]\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Expectation Value Integral**\n\nWe want to calculate $I = \\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$. Since $\\phi_{1s}$ is a real function, $\\phi_{1s}^* = \\phi_{1s}$.\n\\[ I = \\int \\phi_{1s}(r) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_{1s}(r) d\\tau = \\int \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r} \\right) d\\tau \\]\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int \\frac{e^{-2\\zeta r}}{r} d\\tau \\]\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Integral in Spherical Coordinates**\n\nUsing $d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta dr d\\theta d\\phi$:\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin\\theta d\\theta \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-2\\zeta r}}{r} r^2 dr \\]\nThe angular part, as before, integrates to $4\\pi$. The integral simplifies to:\n\\[ I = \\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi} (4\\pi) \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr = 4\\zeta^3 \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr \\]\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Final Radial Integral**\n\nThe remaining integral is $\\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr$. This is again a standard form $\\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-ax} dx = \\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}$, this time with $n=1$ and $a=2\\zeta$.\n\\[ \\int_0^\\infty r e^{-2\\zeta r} dr = \\frac{1!}{(2\\zeta)^{1+1}} = \\frac{1}{(2\\zeta)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\]\n\n**Step 5: Combine Results to Get the Final Answer**\n\nSubstitute the value of the radial integral back into the expression for $I$:\n\\[ I = 4\\zeta^3 \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\zeta^2} \\right) = \\zeta \\]\n\nThe result of the evaluation is the orbital exponent, $\\zeta$.\n\n<<<\\zeta>>>"
