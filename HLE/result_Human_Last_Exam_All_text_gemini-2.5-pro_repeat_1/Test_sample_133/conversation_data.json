    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Connect 4 game state to find the optimal moves for player 'O'.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find all the optimal moves for player 'O' to win as fast as possible. This means we first look for any move that results in an immediate win. If no such move exists, we look for moves that set up a guaranteed win on the next turn (a forced win).\n\n**2. Analyze the Board for Immediate Wins**\nLet's examine the current board to see if 'O' can place a disc to create a line of four. A winning move would complete a row, column, or diagonal of four 'O's.\n\n*   **Horizontal Check:**\n    *   Row 4 has a sequence of two 'O's: `d4` and `e4`. To win horizontally, 'O' would need to complete a line of four, like `b4, c4, d4, e4` or `c4, d4, e4, f4`. This would require placing two discs simultaneously, which is not possible in one turn. There is no existing line of three 'O's.\n*   **Vertical Check:**\n    *   Column 'd' has two 'O's stacked at `d5` and `d4`. The next available space is `d3`. Playing at `d3` would create a line of three 'O's (`d5, d4, d3`), but not a winning line of four. No other column offers an immediate vertical win.\n*   **Diagonal Check (Down-Right /):**\n    *   There is a diagonal sequence of three 'O's at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. To win, 'O' needs to place a disc at `f3`. However, we must check if `f3` is a valid move. In column 'f', there are already discs at `f6` (O) and `f5` (X). The next playable spot in this column is `f4`, not `f3`. Therefore, this diagonal win is not available on this turn.\n*   **Diagonal Check (Down-Left \\):**\n    *   There are no diagonal lines of three 'O's in this direction.\n\n**Conclusion of Step 2:** There are no moves that allow 'O' to win immediately on this turn.\n\n**3. Analyze for Forced Wins (Winning in 2 Turns)**\nSince there's no immediate win, the next best strategy is to create a situation where 'O' has multiple winning threats simultaneously, and the opponent ('X') can only block one. This is often called a \"double threat\" or a \"fork\".\n\nLet's evaluate the consequences of 'O's possible moves:\n\n*   **Move `c4`:**\n    *   If 'O' plays at `c4`, this creates a horizontal line of three 'O's: `c4, d4, e4`.\n    *   This line of three creates two potential winning spots on the next turn for 'O': `b4` and `f4`.\n    *   The line looks like this: `[b4] [c4:O] [d4:O] [e4:O] [f4]`.\n    *   Both `b4` and `f4` are currently open and playable.\n    *   Player 'X' can only block one of these spots on their turn. For example, if 'X' plays at `b4`, 'O' can then play at `f4` to win. If 'X' plays at `f4`, 'O' can play at `b4` to win.\n    *   Therefore, playing at `c4` creates a guaranteed win for 'O' on their next turn.\n\n*   **Move `f4`:**\n    *   If 'O' plays at `f4`, this creates a different horizontal line of three 'O's: `d4, e4, f4`.\n    *   This line of three creates two potential winning spots on the next turn for 'O': `c4` and `g4`.\n    *   The line looks like this: `[c4] [d4:O] [e4:O] [f4:O] [g4]`.\n    *   Both `c4` and `g4` are currently open and playable.\n    *   Player 'X' can only block one of these spots. If 'X' blocks `c4`, 'O' wins at `g4`. If 'X' blocks `g4`, 'O' wins at `c4`.\n    *   Therefore, playing at `f4` also creates a guaranteed win for 'O' on their next turn.\n\n*   **Other Moves (`a4`, `b5`, `d3`, `e3`, `g4`):**\n    *   Playing at `d3` creates a vertical threat (`d5, d4, d3`), which 'X' can easily block by playing at `d2`. This does not create a double threat and is therefore a slower path to victory.\n    *   The other moves do not create any immediate threats of three and are thus less effective than `c4` or `f4`.\n\n**4. Final Conclusion**\nThe fastest way for 'O' to win is to secure a victory in two turns. The moves that achieve this are `c4` and `f4`. Both moves create an unstoppable double threat. Therefore, these are the two optimal moves.\n\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
