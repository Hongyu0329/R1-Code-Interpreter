    "This problem asks for the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve `C` under the condition that its Jacobian `J(C)` has good reduction. This is a problem in arithmetic geometry that can be translated into a combinatorial problem of counting certain types of graphs.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Translating the Geometric Conditions into Graph Theory\n\nLet `C` be a curve of genus `g=4` defined over a valuation field `K`. The stable reduction of `C` is a stable curve `C_s` over the residue field `k`. The structure of `C_s` can be described by its **dual graph**, denoted `Γ`.\n\n1.  **Vertices of the Graph**: The vertices `v` of `Γ` correspond to the irreducible components of the stable fiber `C_s`. Each vertex `v` is labeled by a non-negative integer `g(v)`, which is the geometric genus of the corresponding component.\n2.  **Edges of the Graph**: The edges of `Γ` correspond to the nodes (ordinary double points) where two components intersect. If a component intersects itself at a node, it corresponds to a self-loop on the vertex.\n\nThe two main conditions given in the question translate into strong constraints on this dual graph `Γ`:\n\n1.  **Jacobian `J(C)` has good reduction**: A fundamental result by Raynaud states that the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction if and only if the curve has semistable reduction, and the dual graph `Γ` of its special fiber is a **tree**. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles.\n\n2.  **Stable Reduction**: The special fiber `C_s` is a stable curve. This imposes a condition on each irreducible component. For a component corresponding to a vertex `v` with genus `g(v)` and `deg(v)` nodes on it (where `deg(v)` is the degree of the vertex in the graph), the stability condition is `2g(v) - 2 + deg(v) > 0`.\n    This inequality implies the following crucial constraints:\n    *   If `g(v) = 0`, then `deg(v) > 2`, so `deg(v) ≥ 3`.\n    *   If `g(v) = 1`, then `deg(v) > 0`, so `deg(v) ≥ 1`.\n    *   If `g(v) > 1`, the condition is met for any `deg(v) ≥ 1`.\n\n3.  **Genus Constraint**: The genus of the original curve `C` is related to the genera of the components and the structure of the graph by the formula `g(C) = Σ g(v) + b_1(Γ)`, where `b_1(Γ)` is the first Betti number (number of independent cycles) of the graph. Since `g(C) = 4` and `Γ` is a tree (`b_1(Γ) = 0`), we have `Σ g(v) = 4`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of non-isomorphic labeled trees `Γ` satisfying:\n(a) The sum of the genus labels on all vertices is 4.\n(b) Any vertex `v` with label `g(v)=0` must have degree `deg(v) ≥ 3`.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Enumeration of the Graphs\n\nA key observation from the stability condition is that any **leaf** of the tree (a vertex with degree 1) cannot have genus 0, because `deg(v)=1` and `g(v)=0` violates `deg(v) ≥ 3`. Therefore, all leaves must have genus `g(v) ≥ 1`.\n\nWe can classify the possible trees by their number of leaves, `L`. Since the leaves must have `g≥1`, the sum of their genera is at least `L`. As the total sum of all genera is 4, we must have `L ≤ 4`.\n\n**Case L=1: The tree has 1 leaf.**\n*   A tree with one leaf is a single vertex.\n*   `Σg(v) = g(v_1) = 4`.\n*   **Type 1**: One vertex labeled `g=4`.\n\n**Case L=2: The tree has 2 leaves.**\n*   A tree with two leaves is a path. Let the vertices be `v_1, ..., v_k`.\n*   The internal vertices `v_2, ..., v_{k-1}` have degree 2. By the stability condition, they cannot have `g=0`. All leaves and internal vertices must have `g≥1`.\n*   The sum of all `g(v)` must be 4, and all `g(v)` must be positive integers.\n*   **k=2 (Path P₂)**: `g(v₁)+g(v₂)=4`. Partitions of 4 into 2 parts are `3+1` and `2+2`.\n    *   **Type 2**: `(g=3) --- (g=1)`\n    *   **Type 3**: `(g=2) --- (g=2)`\n*   **k=3 (Path P₃)**: `g(v₁)+g(v₂)+g(v₃)=4`. Partition of 4 into 3 parts is `2+1+1`. The central vertex `v₂` can have `g=2` or `g=1`.\n    *   **Type 4**: `(g=1) --- (g=2) --- (g=1)`\n    *   **Type 5**: `(g=2) --- (g=1) --- (g=1)` (This is distinct from Type 4).\n*   **k=4 (Path P₄)**: `g(v₁)+...+g(v₄)=4`. Partition of 4 into 4 parts is `1+1+1+1`.\n    *   **Type 6**: `(g=1)---(g=1)---(g=1)---(g=1)`\n*   `k>4` is not possible as the sum of `k` positive integers would be `≥5`.\n\n**Case L=3: The tree has 3 leaves.**\n*   The tree must have at least one internal branch point (degree ≥ 3).\n*   **Structure 1: Star graph K₁,₃**. One central vertex `v_c` and 3 leaves `l₁, l₂, l₃`.\n    *   `deg(v_c)=3`, `deg(l_i)=1`. Leaves must have `g≥1`. `v_c` can have `g=0`.\n    *   `g(v_c) + g(l₁) + g(l₂) + g(l₃) = 4`.\n    *   If `g(v_c) > 0`: Partition of 4 into 4 positive parts is `1+1+1+1`. All vertices are `g=1`.\n        *   **Type 7**: Star graph `K₁,₃` with all vertices labeled `g=1`.\n    *   If `g(v_c) = 0`: `g(l₁)+g(l₂)+g(l₃)=4`. Partition of 4 into 3 positive parts is `2+1+1`.\n        *   **Type 8**: Star graph `K₁,₃` with `g=0` center and leaves `g=2, g=1, g=1`.\n*   **Structure 2: Path with a branch**. A 5-vertex tree with leaves `l₁, l₂, l₃`.\n    *   Graph: `l₁ --- i₁ --- i₂ --- l₃`, with `l₂` attached to `i₁`.\n    *   Degrees: `deg(i₁)=3`, `deg(i₂)=2`.\n    *   Constraints: `g(l_i)≥1`, `g(i₂)≥1`. `g(i₁)` can be 0.\n    *   `g(l₁)+g(l₂)+g(l₃) + g(i₁) + g(i₂) = 4`.\n    *   Since 4 vertices must have `g≥1`, the only solution is for them to have `g=1`. This means `g(l₁)=g(l₂)=g(l₃)=g(i₂)=1`, which forces `g(i₁)=0`.\n        *   **Type 9**: The described 5-vertex tree with one `g=0` vertex (at the branch) and four `g=1` vertices.\n\n**Case L=4: The tree has 4 leaves.**\n*   The sum of genera of the 4 leaves is at least 4. So they must all have `g=1`, and all other vertices must have `g=0`.\n*   All internal nodes must have `g=0` and thus `deg≥3`.\n*   A tree with 4 leaves and internal degrees `≥3` can have 1 or 2 internal nodes.\n*   **Structure 1: Star graph K₁,₄**. One central `g=0` vertex, 4 leaves of `g=1`.\n    *   **Type 10**: Star graph `K₁,₄` with `g=0` center and four `g=1` leaves.\n*   **Structure 2: Dumbbell graph**. Two internal `g=0` vertices `i₁, i₂` connected to each other. Each is connected to two `g=1` leaves.\n    *   `deg(i₁)=deg(i₂)=3`. This is stable.\n    *   **Type 11**: Dumbbell graph with two `g=0` centers, each attached to two `g=1` leaves.\n\n**Case L>4:** This is impossible, as the sum of genera of leaves alone would exceed 4.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nWe have exhaustively enumerated all possible graph structures. Let's list the number of types found in each case:\n*   L=1: 1 type\n*   L=2: 5 types (Types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n*   L=3: 3 types (Types 7, 8, 9)\n*   L=4: 2 types (Types 10, 11)\n\nTotal number of types = 1 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 11."
