    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta (photons) using the framework of Large Deviation Theory (LDT), specifically mentioning the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Interpretation of the LDT Framework**\n\nThe problem is a standard statistical mechanics problem (finding properties of a photon gas) framed in the language of LDT. We can interpret the named theorems as follows:\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem provides a rigorous foundation for the Principle of Maximum Entropy. It states that the probability of observing a macroscopic state (described by an empirical distribution) that deviates from the most probable (equilibrium) state is exponentially small. Therefore, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the macroscopic state that maximizes the statistical entropy ($S = k_B \\ln W$, where $W$ is the number of microstates).\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the large deviations of a sample mean from its true expectation value. In this context, it justifies using the expectation value of energy, calculated with the equilibrium distribution, as the macroscopic equilibrium mean energy. The equilibrium value is the one for which the probability of observation is maximized.\n\nThe overall strategy is:\n1.  Define the entropy for a gas of bosons (photons).\n2.  Use the principle of maximum entropy (the \"Boltzmann-Sanov\" step) to find the most probable, or equilibrium, distribution of particles among energy states.\n3.  Use this equilibrium distribution to calculate the average or mean energy (the \"Cramer-Chernoff\" step) and the corresponding maximum entropy value.\n\n### **Step 2: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution (Maximizing Entropy)**\n\n1.  **System:** A gas of photons in a volume V. Photons are bosons, and their total number is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n2.  **Entropy:** For a set of energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$ and occupation number $n_i$, the number of microstates for bosons is $W = \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$. The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$. Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers, the entropy expression to be maximized is:\n    $S[n_i] = k_B \\sum_i [ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i ]$\n3.  **Constraint:** The system has a fixed total mean energy $U$.\n    $\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i = U$.\n4.  **Maximization:** We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S$ subject to the energy constraint. The Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta(\\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i - U)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier.\n    Setting $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = 0$ yields:\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n    This gives the average occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ for the $g_j$ states at energy $\\epsilon_j$:\n    $\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    The average occupation of a single quantum state is $\\bar{n}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1}$. This is the celebrated Bose-Einstein distribution for particles with zero chemical potential, with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n\n1.  **From Sum to Integral:** To find the total energy $U = \\langle E \\rangle$, we sum the energy over all states. For a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral over the density of states, $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$. For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n    $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n2.  **Energy Integral:** The total energy $U$ is the integral of energy $\\epsilon$ times the average number of photons at that energy, $\\bar{n}(\\epsilon)g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$.\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\bar{n}(\\epsilon) \\cdot g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 \\right) d\\epsilon$\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n3.  **Evaluation:** We solve the integral by substitution $x = \\beta \\epsilon$.\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3 (\\beta)^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n    The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, whose value is $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n    $U = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3 \\beta^4} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} \\right) = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3 \\beta^4}$\n4.  **Final Expression for Energy:** Substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where T is the absolute temperature, we get the equilibrium mean energy:\n    $U(V, T) = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n    This is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy**\n\n1.  **Thermodynamic Relation:** A convenient way to find the entropy is via the grand canonical partition function, $Z_{gr}$. For bosons, $\\ln Z_{gr} = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i-\\mu)})$. With $\\mu=0$ and converting to an integral:\n    $\\ln Z_{gr} = - \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = - \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\n2.  **Evaluation of Partition Function:** Solving this integral (e.g., via integration by parts) yields:\n    $\\ln Z_{gr} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{45 h^3 c^3 \\beta^3}$\n3.  **Entropy Calculation:** The entropy $S$ is related to $U$ and $\\ln Z_{gr}$ by the thermodynamic identity $S = k_B(\\ln Z_{gr} + \\beta U)$.\n    $S = k_B \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{45 h^3 c^3 \\beta^3} + \\beta \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3 \\beta^4} \\right) \\right)$\n    $S = k_B \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{45 h^3 c^3 \\beta^3} + \\frac{24 \\pi^5 V}{45 h^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\right) = k_B \\left( \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V}{45 h^3 c^3 \\beta^3} \\right)$\n4.  **Final Expression for Entropy:** Substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n    $S(V, T) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B (k_B T)^3}{45 h^3 c^3} = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at temperature T are:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:** $U(V, T) = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:** $S(V, T) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n>>>"
