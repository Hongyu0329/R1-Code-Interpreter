The set M should be defined as a closed ball in the space of continuous functions C([0, 1]) equipped with the supremum norm ||·||_∞. Specifically, M = {u ∈ C([0, 1]) | ||u||_∞ ≤ R}, where R is a positive constant chosen to satisfy two conditions: (1) R < ln(8) to ensure the associated integral operator is a contraction, and (2) exp(R) ≤ 8R to ensure the operator maps the set M to itself.
