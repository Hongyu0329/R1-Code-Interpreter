    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the System of Equations:**\n    We are given the system:\n    (1) $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n    (2) $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n    We are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points (or critical points) are points $(d, u)$ where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n    From equation (2), $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$. These are horizontal invariant lines.\n\n    *   **Case 1: u = 0**\n        Substitute $u=0$ into equation (1):\n        $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 2d^2$.\n        For an equilibrium point, we need $d'=0$, so $2d^2=0$, which implies $d=0$.\n        This gives the equilibrium point **P1 = (0, 0)**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: u = 1**\n        Substitute $u=1$ into equation (1):\n        $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n        For an equilibrium point, we need $d'=0$, so $2d^2+2d=0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n        This gives two more equilibrium points: **P2 = (0, 1)** and **P3 = (-1, 1)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $J(d,u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\partial d'/\\partial d & \\partial d'/\\partial u \\\\ \\partial u'/\\partial d & \\partial u'/\\partial u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$\n    $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} = (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3$\n    $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} = 0$\n    $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} = 3u^2 - 2u$\n\n    *   **At P2 = (0, 1):**\n        $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)0 - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, P2 is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n    *   **At P3 = (-1, 1):**\n        $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3+10)(-1) - 3(1)^2+4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -7 - 3 + 4 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they have opposite signs, P3 is a **saddle point**.\n\n    *   **At P1 = (0, 0):**\n        $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n4.  **Identify the Separatrix:**\n    A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. We have a saddle point at P3 = (-1, 1).\n\n    We search for an invariant curve, which is a curve $d=f(u)$ that is also a trajectory of the system. If such a curve exists and passes through the saddle point, it must be part of its stable or unstable manifold.\n    The condition for an invariant curve is $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du}\\frac{du}{dt}$.\n    Substituting the system equations:\n    $d' = f'(u) u'$\n    $2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u) = f'(u) [u^2(u-1)]$.\n    Let's test for a simple polynomial solution, for instance, $d=f(u) = ku^n$. A parabola of the form $d=ku^2$ is a good candidate, as it might connect (0,0) to (-1,1).\n    Let's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$. This curve passes through both P1=(0,0) and the saddle point P3=(-1,1).\n\n5.  **Verify the Solution:**\n    We test if $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ is a solution to the system.\n    First, find the derivative of the proposed solution with respect to $t$:\n    $d' = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\frac{du}{dt} = -2u \\cdot u'$.\n    Substitute $u' = u^2(u-1)$:\n    $d' = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u(u^3-u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$. This is our Left Hand Side (LHS).\n\n    Now, substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation (1):\n    RHS = $2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    RHS = $2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n    RHS = $2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - u^3 + u^4$\n    RHS = $(2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n    RHS = $-2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact trajectory of the system.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The trajectory $d = -u^2$ connects the equilibrium point (0,0) to the saddle point (-1,1).\n    To determine the direction of flow, we look at the sign of $u'$ for $u \\in (0,1)$.\n    $u' = u^2(u-1) < 0$ for $u \\in (0,1)$. This means that $u$ decreases with time.\n    Therefore, the flow on the curve $d=-u^2$ is from $u=1$ (the point (-1,1)) to $u=0$ (the point (0,0)).\n    This means the curve $d=-u^2$ is a branch of the unstable manifold of the saddle point (-1,1). As a part of the unstable manifold of a saddle, it is a separatrix. It separates the phase plane into regions with different trajectory behaviors.\n\nThe equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
