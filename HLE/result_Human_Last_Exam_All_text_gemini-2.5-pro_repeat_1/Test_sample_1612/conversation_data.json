    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Batting Triple Crown\nThe Triple Crown in baseball refers to a batter leading their league (either the American League or the National League) in three specific statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List All Winners\nWe need to compile a list of every player who has accomplished this feat in MLB history, including in leagues that are now defunct but officially recognized by MLB as \"major leagues\" (like the American Association).\n\nThe winners are, in chronological order:\n\n1.  **Paul Hines (1878):** Played for the Providence Grays in the National League. This is the first-ever Triple Crown.\n2.  **Tip O'Neill (1887):** Played for the St. Louis Browns in the American Association.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The American Association was a recognized major league from 1882 to 1891, so its winners are included in the official MLB count.\n3.  **Hugh Duffy (1894):** Played for the Boston Beaneaters in the National League.\n4.  **Nap Lajoie (1901):** Played for the Philadelphia Athletics, winning the first-ever American League Triple Crown.\n5.  **Ty Cobb (1909):** Played for the Detroit Tigers in the American League.\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman (1912):** Played for the Chicago Cubs in the National League.\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby (1922):** Played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League.\n8.  **Rogers Hornsby (1925):** Played for the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., unique players), not the number of times the award has been won. Rogers Hornsby is one winner who accomplished the feat twice.\n9.  **Chuck Klein (1933):** Played for the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League.\n10. **Jimmie Foxx (1933):** Played for the Philadelphia Athletics in the American League.\n11. **Lou Gehrig (1934):** Played for the New York Yankees in the American League.\n12. **Joe Medwick (1937):** Played for the St. Louis Cardinals. He was the last player to win the Triple Crown in the National League.\n13. **Ted Williams (1942):** Played for the Boston Red Sox in the American League.\n14. **Ted Williams (1947):** Played for the Boston Red Sox in the American League.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like Hornsby, Ted Williams is a single winner who won it twice.\n15. **Mickey Mantle (1956):** Played for the New York Yankees in the American League.\n16. **Frank Robinson (1966):** Played for the Baltimore Orioles in the American League.\n17. **Carl Yastrzemski (1967):** Played for the Boston Red Sox in the American League.\n18. **Miguel Cabrera (2012):** Played for the Detroit Tigers in the American League. He is the most recent player to win a Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Unique Winners\nNow, we count the number of individual players from the list above. We must be careful to count players who won multiple times (Hornsby and Williams) only once.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman\n7.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice)\n8.  Chuck Klein\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. Ted Williams (won twice)\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting these unique names gives a total of 16 players.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere have been 18 instances of a player winning the Triple Crown, but these were achieved by a total of 16 different players.\n\n<<<16>>>"
