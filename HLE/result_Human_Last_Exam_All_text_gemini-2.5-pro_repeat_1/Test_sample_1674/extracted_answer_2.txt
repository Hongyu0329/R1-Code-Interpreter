Yes, the theory can fail. The introduction of the birefringent medium, which is not accounted for in the inversion process, will cause the theory to break down. The mathematical reason is that the operator for the birefringent medium (`B`) and the operator for the random medium (`T`) do not commute (`B*T â‰  T*B`). The inversion process effectively tries to undo the operation of `T` on a light field that has been altered in a way the inversion doesn't expect (by `B`). This leads to an incorrectly calculated input beam that will not reproduce the desired output when propagated through the full system.
