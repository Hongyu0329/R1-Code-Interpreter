    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe question asks for the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. The 8-point sequence is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\nLet the new 8-point sequence be `y(n)`.\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\"**\n\nCalculating an N-point DFT of an L-point sequence where L > N is not a direct operation. The standard interpretation in digital signal processing is to first create an N-point sequence from the L-point sequence through a process called **time-aliasing**.\n\n*   Let the 8-point sequence be `y(n)`, where `n = 0, ..., 7`.\n*   Let the new 4-point sequence be `y_a(n)`, where `n = 0, ..., 3`.\n*   Time-aliasing is performed by \"wrapping\" the sequence and adding the parts:\n    `y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n + 4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nOur goal is to find `Y_a(k) = DFT_4{y_a(n)}`.\n\n**3. Relate the Problem to Frequency Domain Properties**\n\nThere are two main approaches: a longer one through the time domain and a shorter one using frequency domain properties. The frequency domain approach is more direct and less prone to calculation errors.\n\n**Method: Using Frequency Domain Properties**\n\nThis method leverages two key properties of the DFT.\n\n*   **Property 1: Time-Aliasing and Frequency Sampling:** The DFT of the time-aliased sequence `y_a(n)` is equivalent to sampling the DFT of the original 8-point sequence `y(n)`. If `Y(k) = DFT_8{y(n)}`, then the 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence is `Y_a(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`. This means we need to find `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`.\n\n*   **Property 2: DFT of an Interleaved Sequence:** The 8-point sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This structure is fundamental to the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` as follows:\n    `Y(k) = X(k \\mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k \\mod 4)`\n    where `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2π * k / N)`.\n\n**4. Calculate the Required DFT Points `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)`**\n\nWe are given:\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe will also need the \"twiddle factors\":\n*   `W_8^0 = exp(0) = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = exp(-j * 2π * 2 / 8) = exp(-jπ/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^4 = exp(-j * 2π * 4 / 8) = exp(-jπ) = -1`\n*   `W_8^6 = exp(-j * 2π * 6 / 8) = exp(-j3π/2) = j`\n\nNow we calculate the values for `Y(k)`:\n\n*   **For `k = 0`:**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For `k = 2`:**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For `k = 4`:**\n    `Y(4) = X(4 \\mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 \\mod 4) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 + (-1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **For `k = 6`:**\n    `Y(6) = X(6 \\mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 \\mod 4) = X(2) + (j) * H(2) = -1 + (j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**5. Assemble the Final 4-Point DFT**\n\nThe final 4-point DFT, `Y_a(k)`, is composed of these calculated values:\n*   `Y_a(0) = Y(0) = 1`\n*   `Y_a(1) = Y(2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y_a(2) = Y(4) = 1`\n*   `Y_a(3) = Y(6) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT sequence is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly interpreting the question:** The most critical step is understanding that \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\" implies time-aliasing.\n2.  **Using the right DFT properties:** The solution depends on knowing the relationship between time-aliasing and frequency-sampling, and the formula for the DFT of an interleaved sequence.\n3.  **DFT Periodicity:** Remember that an N-point DFT is N-periodic. `X(k)` and `H(k)` are 4-periodic, so `X(k) = X(k \\mod 4)`. This is essential for calculating `Y(k)` for `k >= 4`.\n4.  **Twiddle Factor Calculation:** Ensure the complex exponential values (`W_N^k`) are calculated correctly. A sign error here will change the result.\n5.  **Complex Arithmetic:** The final calculations involve adding and multiplying complex numbers. Care must be taken to perform these operations accurately.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the 4-point DFT sequence calculated above.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
