    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Complete Bipartite Graph ($K_{m,n}$):** This is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, $U$ and $V$, with $|U|=m$ and $|V|=n$. An edge exists between every vertex in $U$ and every vertex in $V$, but there are no edges within $U$ or within $V$. In our case, we have $K_{1000,1000}$, so $m=n=1000$.\n\n2.  **List Coloring and Choosability ($\\text{ch}(G)$):**\n    *   A list assignment $L$ for a graph $G$ assigns a list of available colors $L(v)$ to each vertex $v$.\n    *   An $L$-coloring is a proper coloring where each vertex $v$ is assigned a color from its list $L(v)$.\n    *   The choosability (or list chromatic number) of a graph $G$, denoted $\\text{ch}(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an $L$-coloring for any list assignment $L$ where $|L(v)| \\ge k$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n3.  **Alon-Tarsi Number ($AT(G)$):**\n    *   An **orientation** $D$ of a graph $G$ is formed by assigning a direction to each edge of $G$.\n    *   A subgraph of $D$ is **Eulerian** if, for every vertex in the subgraph, its in-degree equals its out-degree.\n    *   An Eulerian subgraph is **even** or **odd** depending on whether it has an even or odd number of edges.\n    *   Let $EE(D)$ be the number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $D$, and $OE(D)$ be the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $D$.\n    *   The Alon-Tarsi number of $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ satisfying two conditions:\n        1.  The maximum out-degree, $\\Delta^+(D)$, is less than $k$ (i.e., $\\Delta^+(D) \\le k-1$).\n        2.  $EE(D) \\neq OE(D)$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Alon-Tarsi Number to Choosability\n\nA fundamental result in this area is the **Alon-Tarsi Theorem**, which states that the choosability of a graph is bounded by its Alon-Tarsi number:\n$\\text{ch}(G) \\le AT(G)$\n\nFor a large class of graphs, including all bipartite graphs, it is a known result that this inequality is actually an equality.\n$AT(G) = \\text{ch}(G)$ for any bipartite graph $G$.\n\n**Careful Point:** This equality is crucial. It is conjectured to be true for all graphs (this is the Alon-Tarsi Conjecture), but it has only been proven for certain classes of graphs. Since $K_{1000,1000}$ is a bipartite graph, we can confidently use this equality.\n\nTherefore, the problem of finding the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is equivalent to finding its choosability.\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\text{ch}(K_{1000,1000})$\n\n### Step 3: Find the Choosability of $K_{1000,1000}$\n\nThere is a celebrated theorem by Fred Galvin that gives the exact choosability of $K_{n,n}$.\n\n**Galvin's Theorem:** The choosability of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that the central binomial coefficient related term $\\binom{2k-1}{k}$ is greater than or equal to $n$.\n$\\text{ch}(K_{n,n}) = \\min \\left\\{ k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\mid \\binom{2k-1}{k} \\ge n \\right\\}$\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to use the correct formula. Note that $\\binom{2k-1}{k} = \\binom{2k-1}{k-1}$.\n\nFor our problem, $n = 1000$. We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that:\n$\\binom{2k-1}{k} \\ge 1000$\n\n### Step 4: Perform the Calculation\n\nLet's test values of $k$ starting from 1.\n\n*   **k = 1:** $\\binom{2(1)-1}{1} = \\binom{1}{1} = 1$. ( $1 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 2:** $\\binom{2(2)-1}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = 3$. ( $3 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 3:** $\\binom{2(3)-1}{3} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10$. ( $10 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 4:** $\\binom{2(4)-1}{4} = \\binom{7}{4} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 35$. ( $35 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 5:** $\\binom{2(5)-1}{5} = \\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 126$. ( $126 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 6:** $\\binom{2(6)-1}{6} = \\binom{11}{6} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 462$. ( $462 < 1000$)\n*   **k = 7:** $\\binom{2(7)-1}{7} = \\binom{13}{7} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8}{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 1716$. ( $1716 \\ge 1000$)\n\n**Careful Point:** The calculation must be precise. Let's double-check the last two.\n$\\binom{11}{6} = \\binom{11}{5} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 11 \\times (10/5/2) \\times (9/3) \\times (8/4) \\times 7 = 11 \\times 1 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 7 = 462$. Correct.\n$\\binom{13}{7} = \\binom{13}{6} = \\frac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 13 \\times (\\frac{12}{6 \\times 2}) \\times 11 \\times (\\frac{10}{5}) \\times (\\frac{9}{3}) \\times (\\frac{8}{4}) = 13 \\times 1 \\times 11 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 1716$. Correct.\n\nThe first integer value of $k$ for which the condition $\\binom{2k-1}{k} \\ge 1000$ is met is $k=7$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nSince the smallest integer $k$ is 7, we have:\n$\\text{ch}(K_{1000,1000}) = 7$\n\nBecause $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\text{ch}(K_{1000,1000})$, the Alon-Tarsi number is also 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
