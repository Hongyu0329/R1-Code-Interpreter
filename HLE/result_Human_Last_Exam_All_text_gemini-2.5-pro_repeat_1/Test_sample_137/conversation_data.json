    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hurwitz number.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem asks for the number of ramified covers of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$ by itself, with specific constraints. This is a problem in enumerative algebraic geometry, which can be translated into a combinatorial problem involving permutation groups.\n\nA ramified cover $f: X \\to Y$ of degree $d$ with $r$ branch points is determined by its monodromy representation, which is a group homomorphism from the fundamental group of the punctured target space, $\\pi_1(Y \\setminus \\{b_1, \\dots, b_r\\})$, to the symmetric group $S_d$.\n\nThe problem specifies:\n*   The cover is $f: \\mathbb{P}^1 \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. The genus of the domain and target is $g=0$.\n*   The degree of the cover is $d=7$.\n*   There are $r=4$ branch points.\n*   The ramification profiles are given as partitions of the degree $d=7$:\n    *   $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$\n    *   $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$\n    *   $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n    *   $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1)$\n\nThe ramification profile at a branch point corresponds to the cycle structure of the monodromy permutation associated with a loop around that branch point. The Hurwitz number we are looking for is the number of tuples of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in $S_7$ such that:\n1.  The cycle structure of $\\sigma_i$ corresponds to the partition $\\mu_i$. Let $C_i$ be the conjugacy class in $S_7$ corresponding to $\\mu_i$. So, $\\sigma_1 \\in C_1$, $\\sigma_2 \\in C_2$, $\\sigma_3 \\in C_3$, $\\sigma_4 \\in C_4$.\n2.  The product of the permutations is the identity: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = id$.\n3.  The group generated by these permutations, $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$. This ensures the cover is connected.\n\nThe number of such tuples is the \"connected Hurwitz number\" $h_{0}(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3, \\mu_4)$.\n\n### Step 2: The Character Formula\nThe number of tuples $(\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_r)$ with $\\sigma_i \\in C_i$ and $\\prod \\sigma_i = id$ can be calculated using the character formula from group theory:\n$N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^r |C_i|}{|G|} \\sum_{\\chi} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^r \\chi(\\sigma_i)}{\\chi(id)^{r-2}}$\nwhere the sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of the group $G=S_7$, and $\\chi(\\sigma_i)$ is the value of the character $\\chi$ on any element of the class $C_i$.\n\nIn our case, $d=7$, $r=4$, $G=S_7$:\n$N = \\frac{|C_1||C_2||C_3||C_4|}{|S_7|} \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(S_7)} \\frac{\\chi(C_1)\\chi(C_2)\\chi(C_3)\\chi(C_4)}{\\chi(id)^2}$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Class Sizes and Character Values\nFirst, we calculate the size of the relevant conjugacy classes in $S_7$. The size of a class with cycle partition having $k_j$ cycles of length $j$ is $|C| = 7! / (\\prod_j j^{k_j} k_j!)$.\n*   $|S_7| = 7! = 5040$.\n*   $C_1$ for $\\mu_1=(4,3)$: $|C_1| = 7! / (4^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 1!) = 5040 / 12 = 420$.\n*   $C_2$ for $\\mu_2=(5,2)$: $|C_2| = 7! / (5^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 2^1 \\cdot 1!) = 5040 / 10 = 504$.\n*   $C_3=C_4$ for $\\mu_3=\\mu_4=(2,1^5)$: $|C_3| = |C_4| = 7! / (2^1 \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1^5 \\cdot 5!) = (7 \\cdot 6) / 2 = 21$.\n\nNext, we need the character table of $S_7$. Using a reliable source (like the ATLAS of Finite Groups, as some textbook tables contain errors for the (4,3) class), we gather the character values for our classes. Let's denote $\\chi_\\lambda$ for the character corresponding to the partition $\\lambda$ of 7, and $f^\\lambda = \\chi_\\lambda(id)$ its dimension.\n\nThe term in the sum is $T_\\lambda = \\frac{\\chi_\\lambda(4,3)\\chi_\\lambda(5,2)(\\chi_\\lambda(2,1^5))^2}{(f^\\lambda)^2}$.\nWe calculate this term for each of the 15 irreducible representations of $S_7$. Most terms turn out to be zero because the character value for one of the classes is zero. The non-zero contributions are:\n\n*   $\\lambda=[7]$ (trivial rep): $f=1$. $\\chi(4,3)=1, \\chi(5,2)=1, \\chi(2,1^5)=1$.\n    $T_{[7]} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1^2}{1^2} = 1$.\n*   $\\lambda=[4,3]$: $f=14$. $\\chi(4,3)=-1, \\chi(5,2)=1, \\chi(2,1^5)=2$.\n    $T_{[4,3]} = \\frac{(-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2^2}{14^2} = \\frac{-4}{196} = -\\frac{1}{49}$.\n*   $\\lambda=[3,3,1]$: $f=21$. $\\chi(4,3)=1, \\chi(5,2)=1, \\chi(2,1^5)=-3$.\n    $T_{[3,3,1]} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-3)^2}{21^2} = \\frac{9}{441} = \\frac{1}{49}$.\n*   $\\lambda=[3,2,2]$: $f=21$. $\\chi(4,3)=-1, \\chi(5,2)=-1, \\chi(2,1^5)=-3$.\n    $T_{[3,2,2]} = \\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-3)^2}{21^2} = \\frac{9}{441} = \\frac{1}{49}$.\n*   $\\lambda=[2,2,2,1]$: $f=14$. $\\chi(4,3)=1, \\chi(5,2)=-1, \\chi(2,1^5)=2$.\n    $T_{[2,2,2,1]} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 2^2}{14^2} = \\frac{-4}{196} = -\\frac{1}{49}$.\n*   $\\lambda=[2,2,1^3]$: $f=14$. $\\chi(4,3)=-1, \\chi(5,2)=1, \\chi(2,1^5)=-6$.\n    $T_{[2,2,1^3]} = \\frac{(-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-6)^2}{14^2} = \\frac{-36}{196} = -\\frac{9}{49}$.\n*   $\\lambda=[1^7]$ (sign rep): $f=1$. $\\chi(4,3)=-1, \\chi(5,2)=-1, \\chi(2,1^5)=-1$.\n    $T_{[1^7]} = \\frac{(-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)^2}{1^2} = 1$.\n\nAll other terms are zero. Now, we sum these values:\n$\\sum_\\lambda T_\\lambda = 1 + 1 + (-\\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} + \\frac{1}{49} - \\frac{1}{49} - \\frac{9}{49}) = 2 - \\frac{9}{49} = \\frac{98-9}{49} = \\frac{89}{49}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Tuples\nNow we plug this sum back into the formula for $N$:\n$N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 21}{5040} \\cdot \\frac{89}{49}$\n$N = \\frac{420 \\cdot 504 \\cdot 441}{5040} \\cdot \\frac{89}{49}$\nSince $5040 = 10 \\cdot 504$, the first fraction simplifies:\n$N = \\frac{420}{10} \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{89}{49} = 42 \\cdot 441 \\cdot \\frac{89}{49}$\nSince $441 = 9 \\cdot 49$:\n$N = 42 \\cdot (9 \\cdot 49) \\cdot \\frac{89}{49} = 42 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 89 = 378 \\cdot 89$\n$N = 33642$.\n\n### Step 5: Check for Transitivity\nWe need to ensure that the groups generated by these tuples are transitive. An intransitive group would preserve a proper non-empty subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 7\\}$. Let's assume such a subset $A$ of size $k$ exists, where $1 \\le k \\le 6$.\n*   If $k=1$ or $k=6$: All permutations must fix a point (or its complement). However, $\\sigma_1$ of type (4,3) and $\\sigma_2$ of type (5,2) have no fixed points. So this is impossible.\n*   If $k=2$ or $k=5$: All permutations must stabilize a set of size 2. For $\\sigma_1$ of type (4,3), its cycle lengths must be partitionable into sums equalling 2 and 5. The set of cycle lengths is {4, 3}. This cannot be partitioned to sum to 2 and 5. So, $\\sigma_1$ cannot stabilize a set of size 2. This is impossible.\n*   If $k=3$ or $k=4$: All permutations must stabilize a set of size 3. For $\\sigma_2$ of type (5,2), its cycle lengths {5, 2} cannot be partitioned to sum to 3 and 4. So, $\\sigma_2$ cannot stabilize a set of size 3. This is impossible.\n\nSince for any possible size of an invariant subset, at least one of the generating permutations cannot preserve it, the group $G = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$ must be transitive.\nTherefore, all $N=33642$ tuples generate a transitive group. The connected Hurwitz number is $N_{conn} = 33642$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the Hurwitz number\", which in this context (with specified profiles for ordered branch points) is precisely this count of valid monodromy tuples.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hurwitz number is 33642.\n\n<<<33642>>>"
