    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay. (This detail is crucial, as the reference might be specific to the Russian language or a particular translation).\n    *   **Location:** The wide boulevards of Vienna.\n    *   **Subject:** The surname of an English poet.\n    *   **Task:** Name the surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Source Text:** The description points to a well-known passage in Russian literature. The essay in question is \"Journey to Armenia\" (Путешествие в Армению) by the Russian poet and essayist Osip Mandelstam, written in 1931. Although the question mentions a \"Russian translation,\" the text is originally in Russian; this phrasing in the riddle might be slightly misleading or simply part of the puzzle's setup.\n\n3.  **Locating the Relevant Passage:** In the second chapter of the essay, Mandelstam creates a vivid, almost surrealist image. He writes about the Viennese police dealing with workers. The specific sentence is:\n    *   In Russian: \"...а на широких бульварах Вены или Данцига тупая австрийская полиция разгоняет рабочих палками и **Бернсом**.\"\n    *   In English translation: \"...and on the wide boulevards of Vienna or Danzig, the dull-witted Austrian police disperse the workers with clubs and **Burns**.\"\n\n4.  **Identifying the Poet:** The surname mentioned is \"Бернс\" (Byorns), which is the standard Russian transliteration for the surname **Burns**. This refers to the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns (1759-1796).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **The Pun:** The most important point to understand is that Mandelstam is using a pun. The sentence \"disperse the workers with clubs and Burns\" sounds absurd. The pun works because in Russian, the word for the \"sideburns\" style of facial hair, \"бернсы\" (byornsy), is derived directly from the surname of the poet Robert Burns, who famously wore them. So, Mandelstam is playing on the dual meaning: the police are dispersing crowds with clubs and \"sideburns\" (a synecdoche for the police themselves or their aggressive appearance). This wordplay is specific to the Russian language.\n\n2.  **\"English\" vs. \"Scottish\" Poet:** The question asks for an \"English\" poet, while Robert Burns was Scottish. In common parlance, especially from a non-British perspective, \"English\" is often used as a shorthand for \"British.\" Given that Scotland is part of Great Britain and Burns wrote in English as well as Scots, this is a widely accepted inaccuracy in this kind of riddle.\n\n3.  **The \"Translation\" Clue:** The text is an original work by a Russian author, not a translation *into* Russian. The pun would not work if the text were translated from another language. The mention of \"translation\" in the question's premise is likely a misdirection to make the puzzle more challenging. The core facts—a Russian text, Vienna, and a poet's name—all point to this specific passage by Mandelstam.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the passage from Osip Mandelstam's \"Journey to Armenia,\" we identify the poet's surname as \"Бернс\" (Byorns). This is a pun on the Russian word for sideburns. Transliterated back into English, the surname is Burns.\n\n<<<Burns>>>"
