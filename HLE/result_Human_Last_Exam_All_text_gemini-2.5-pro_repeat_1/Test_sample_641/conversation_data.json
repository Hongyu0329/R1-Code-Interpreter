    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2, i.e., an element `g` such that `g^2 = 1` and `g` is not the identity. The problem asks for the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997).\n\nLet `G = PSU(n, q)` where `n=4` and `q=997`. The group `G` is defined as `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary group and `Z` is its center.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of involutions.\n\n### **Step 1: Lifting the Problem from PSU to SU**\n\nAn element `x = gZ` in `PSU(n, q)` (where `g \\in SU(n, q)` and `Z = Z(SU(n, q))`) is an involution if `x^2 = 1_G` and `x \\neq 1_G`.\n*   `x^2 = (gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = 1_G = Z`. This means `g^2 \\in Z`.\n*   `x \\neq 1_G` means `gZ \\neq Z`, so `g \\notin Z`.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of elements `g \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 \\in Z(SU(4, 997))` and `g \\notin Z(SU(4, 997))`, and then determine how many distinct elements these correspond to in the quotient group `PSU`.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n\nThe center of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `ωI` such that `ω^n = 1` and `ω^{q+1} = 1`. This implies `ω` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n*   `n = 4`\n*   `q = 997`\n*   `q+1 = 998`\n*   `d = gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 \\times 499) = 2` (since 499 is a prime number).\n\nSo, `Z(SU(4, 997))` has order 2. The elements are `ωI` where `ω^2=1`, which means `ω = \\pm 1`.\n`Z(SU(4, 997)) = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\nThis means we are looking for elements `g \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I` (and `g \\neq \\pm I`).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the case g² = -I**\n\nThis is a critical step that depends on the property of the field size `q`.\nLet `g \\in SU(4, q)`. This means `g` is a 4x4 matrix over `F_{q^2}` satisfying `g^† g = I` and `det(g) = 1`. (`g^†` is the conjugate transpose, where conjugation is the field automorphism `x \\mapsto x^q`).\n\nIf `g^2 = -I`, then `g^{-1} = -g`. The unitary condition `g^† = g^{-1}` becomes `g^† = -g` (i.e., `g` is skew-Hermitian).\n\nLet `λ` be an eigenvalue of `g`.\n1.  From `g^2 = -I`, we have `λ^2 = -1`.\n2.  From `g^† = -g`, for an eigenvector `v`, we have `(gv, v) = (\\lambda v, v) = \\lambda(v,v)` and `(v, g^†v) = (v, -gv) = (v, -\\lambda v) = -\\bar{\\lambda}(v,v)`. This implies `λ = -\\bar{\\lambda}`, or `λ^q = -\\lambda`.\n\nSo, an eigenvalue `λ` must satisfy both `λ^2 = -1` and `λ^q = -\\lambda`.\n\nNow we check the specific case `q = 997`.\n`997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1`, so `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`.\nFor fields where `char \\neq 2`, `x^2 = -1` has a solution in `F_q` if and only if `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`.\nThus, the solutions to `λ^2 = -1` (let's call them `\\pm i`) exist in the base field `F_q = F_{997}`.\nIf `λ \\in F_q`, then `λ^q = λ`.\nThe condition `λ^q = -\\lambda` becomes `λ = -\\lambda`, which implies `2λ = 0`. Since `char = 997 \\neq 2`, this means `λ=0`.\nBut `λ=0` does not satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\nThis is a contradiction. It means there are no eigenvalues `λ` that can satisfy both conditions. Therefore, there are no elements `g` in `U(4, 997)` (or `SU(4, 997)`) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This result is specific to `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. If `q \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4`, such elements do exist and contribute to the count of involutions.\n\n### **Step 4: Analyze the case g² = I**\n\nSince the case `g^2 = -I` is impossible, all involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` must arise from elements `g \\in SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = I` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`. These are precisely the non-central involutions of `SU(4, 997)`.\n\nAn involution `g` is diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues must be `\\pm 1`.\nLet `k` be the number of eigenvalues equal to `-1`.\nThe condition `det(g) = 1` means `(-1)^k = 1`, so `k` must be even.\nSince `g \\neq I`, `k` must be greater than 0.\nSince `g \\neq -I` (as `n=4` is even, `-I` has `k=4`), `k` must be less than 4.\nThus, the only possibility is `k=2`.\n\nSo, the preimages of all involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` are the elements in `SU(4, 997)` with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`.\n\n### **Step 5: Count the SU-involutions**\n\nThe elements `g` with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}` form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. The number of such elements is the size of this class, given by the formula `N = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(g)|`, where `g` is a representative of the class.\n\n*   The order of `SU(n, q)` is `|SU(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=2}^{n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`.\n    For `n=4`, `|SU(4, q)| = q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`.\n*   The centralizer `C_{SU(4, q)}(g)` is isomorphic to a subgroup of `GU(2,q) \\times GU(2,q)` of index `d/gcd(d,2)` where `d=gcd(4,q+1)=2`, so index is 1. The structure is more complex but the order is known to be `q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3`.\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class is:\n`N = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(g)|`\n`N = [q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3]`\n`N = [q^6 (q-1)(q+1)(q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)] / [q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3]`\n`N = [q^6 (q-1)^2(q+1)^3(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)] / [q^2(q-1)^2(q+1)^3]`\n`N = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n### **Step 6: Count the Involutions in PSU**\n\nWe have `N = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)` involutions in `SU(4, q)`. Let this set of involutions be `C`. We need to find the number of distinct elements in `PSU(4, q)` that these map to.\n\nThe quotient map is `φ: g -> gZ`.\nLet `g \\in C`. Then `g^2=I`. Is `-g` also in `C`?\n`(-g)^2 = g^2 = I`.\n`det(-g) = (-1)^4 det(g) = 1 \\times 1 = 1`.\nSo `-g` is also an involution in `SU(4,q)`. Since `g` is not central, `g \\neq -g`.\n`g` and `-g` are conjugate in `SU(4,q)` (and thus are in the same class `C`).\nThey map to the same element in `PSU`: `φ(g) = gZ` and `φ(-g) = -gZ = g(-I)Z = gZ`.\n\nSince every involution `g \\in C` is paired with another distinct involution `-g`, the mapping `φ: C -> PSU(4, q)` is exactly 2-to-1.\nTherefore, the total number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is `N/2`.\n\n### **Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` for `q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4` is:\n`Number = (1/2) * N = (1/2) * q^4 (q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`\n\nFor `q = 997`, the number of involutions is:\n`(1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)`\n\n<<< (1/2) * 997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1) >>>"
