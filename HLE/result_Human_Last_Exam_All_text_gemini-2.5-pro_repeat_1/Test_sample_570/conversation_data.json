    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Set of Lines**\n\nWe are looking for a convex domain `K` in the plane that has the smallest possible area, subject to the condition that it must intersect every line given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet's analyze the set of lines `L(p,q) : px + qy = 1`.\n*   The vector `v = (p, q)` is a normal vector to the line.\n*   The set of vectors `(p, q)` with `p, q` coprime are the primitive integer vectors in `Z^2`. Let's call this set `S`.\n*   The set `S` is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning if `v = (p,q)` is in `S`, then `-v = (-p, -q)` is also in `S` (since `gcd(-p, -q) = gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n*   Some example lines include:\n    *   `p=1, q=0`: `x = 1`\n    *   `p=-1, q=0`: `-x = 1` or `x = -1`\n    *   `p=0, q=1`: `y = 1`\n    *   `p=0, q=-1`: `-y = 1` or `y = -1`\n    *   `p=1, q=1`: `x + y = 1`\n    *   `p=1, q=-1`: `x - y = 1`\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Condition on the Convex Domain K**\n\nA convex domain `K` intersects a line `L: v · x = c` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in one of the open half-planes defined by `L`. Mathematically, this means the set of values `{v · x | x ∈ K}` must contain `c`.\nLet `sup_K(v · x) = sup_{x∈K} (v · x)` and `inf_K(v · x) = inf_{x∈K} (v · x)`.\nThe condition for `K` to intersect the line `v · x = 1` is:\n`inf_K(v · x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(v · x)`\n\nThis condition must hold for all primitive integer vectors `v = (p, q)`.\nSince the set of vectors `S` is symmetric, for every `v` in `S`, `-v` is also in `S`. So we must satisfy the condition for both `v` and `-v`.\nFor `v`: `inf_K(v · x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(v · x)`\nFor `-v`: `inf_K(-v · x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_K(-v · x)`\n\nLet's analyze the condition for `-v`. We know that `inf_K(-v · x) = -sup_K(v · x)` and `sup_K(-v · x) = -inf_K(v · x)`.\nSubstituting this into the inequality for `-v` gives:\n`-sup_K(v · x) ≤ 1 ≤ -inf_K(v · x)`\nMultiplying by -1 and reversing the inequalities, we get:\n`inf_K(v · x) ≤ -1 ≤ sup_K(v · x)`\n\nSo, for any primitive integer vector `v = (p, q)`, we must satisfy both conditions:\n1.  `sup_K(v · x) ≥ 1`\n2.  `inf_K(v · x) ≤ -1`\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Condition to the Width of the Domain**\n\nThe width of a convex domain `K` in the direction of a unit vector `u` is given by `w(u) = sup_K(u · x) - inf_K(u · x)`. If `v` is not a unit vector, the width in the direction of `v` is `w_v(K) = sup_K(v · x) - inf_K(v · x)`.\nFrom Step 2, for any `v = (p,q) ∈ S`, we have `sup_K(v · x) ≥ 1` and `inf_K(v · x) ≤ -1`.\nTherefore, the width `w_v(K)` satisfies:\n`w_v(K) = sup_K(v · x) - inf_K(v · x) ≥ 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nThis must hold for all primitive integer vectors `v=(p,q)`. Let's apply this to the simplest cases:\n*   For `v = (1, 0)`: `w_{(1,0)}(K) = sup_K(x) - inf_K(x) ≥ 2`. This is the width of `K` in the x-direction.\n*   For `v = (0, 1)`: `w_{(0,1)}(K) = sup_K(y) - inf_K(y) ≥ 2`. This is the width of `K` in the y-direction.\n\n**Step 4: Find a Lower Bound for the Area**\n\nThere is a well-known inequality in convex geometry relating the area of a convex body `K` to its widths in any two orthogonal directions. Let `w_1` and `w_2` be the widths of `K` in two perpendicular directions. Then the area of `K` is bounded by:\n`Area(K) ≥ (w_1 * w_2) / 2`\n\nLet's choose the x and y axes as our orthogonal directions. We have found that:\n*   `w_1 = w_x(K) = w_{(1,0)}(K) ≥ 2`\n*   `w_2 = w_y(K) = w_{(0,1)}(K) ≥ 2`\n\nPlugging these into the inequality:\n`Area(K) ≥ (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`\n\nThis proves that any convex domain `K` that satisfies the given conditions must have an area of at least 2.\n\n**Step 5: Construct a Convex Domain with the Minimal Area**\n\nNow we need to check if this minimum area of 2 can actually be achieved. We look for a convex domain `K` with area 2 that satisfies the conditions.\nConsider the square `K_0` with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. This is the set of points `(x, y)` such that `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n*   **Area**: This square is composed of two triangles with base 2 and height 1. Its area is `2 * (1/2 * 2 * 1) = 2`.\n*   **Condition Check**: We must verify that `K_0` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for coprime integers `p, q`. This is equivalent to checking if `inf_{K_0}(px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{K_0}(px+qy)`.\n    The expression `px+qy` is linear, so its supremum and infimum on the convex set `K_0` will be attained at one of the vertices `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n    *   `sup_{K_0}(px+qy) = max(p(1)+q(0), p(0)+q(1), p(-1)+q(0), p(0)+q(-1)) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`\n    *   `inf_{K_0}(px+qy) = min(p, q, -p, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`\n\n    The condition becomes `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`. This is equivalent to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime integers, they cannot both be zero. Therefore, at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer. This implies `|p| ≥ 1` or `|q| ≥ 1`. In either case, `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n    The condition is satisfied for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the area of any such convex domain must be at least 2, and we have found a specific convex domain (the square with vertices at `(±1,0), (0,±1)`) that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n>>>2"
