    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Origin of the Current Word \"Sister\"**: The first step is to understand the etymology of the word we use today. The Modern English word \"sister\" does not come directly from Old English. It is a borrowing from Old Norse, the language of the Viking invaders. The Old Norse word was *systir*. This borrowing replaced the native English word during the Middle English period, largely due to the heavy Norse settlement and influence in the north and east of England (the Danelaw).\n\n2.  **Identify the Native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) Word**: Before the Norse influence, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was **sweostor**. Both the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweostor* are cognates, meaning they both evolved from the same earlier root, the Proto-Germanic word *\\*swestēr*. This shared origin is why the two words were similar enough for one to replace the other.\n\n3.  **Trace the Hypothetical Evolution of \"Sweostor\"**: To figure out what \"sweostor\" would have become, we need to apply the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English, assuming no interference from Old Norse.\n    *   **Old English to Middle English**: The Old English diphthong \"eo\" (pronounced roughly as /e͜o/) in *sweostor* would have simplified. In this context, it would most likely have become a simple \"e\" vowel, as in the word \"bet\". This would have resulted in the Middle English form **swester**. This is not just a guess; the form *swester* is actually found in Middle English texts, coexisting with *suster* (another native variant) and the incoming Norse form *sister*.\n    *   **Middle English to Modern English**: The next step is to project *swester* forward. The pronunciation of Middle English *swester* would have been roughly [ˈswɛstər]. This word would not have been affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which primarily altered long vowels. The consonants and the short 'e' vowel would have remained stable. Therefore, the word's pronunciation and spelling would likely have stayed very close to its Middle English form.\n\n4.  **Careful Points and Corroboration**:\n    *   **Dialectal Variation**: It's important to note that another native form, *suster*, also existed in Middle English, where the 'w' sound was dropped. This could have potentially evolved into a modern word \"suster\" (pronounced with the vowel of \"cut\"). However, the *swester* form retained the original consonant cluster.\n    *   **Comparative Linguistics**: We can look at a closely related Germanic language that did not experience the same Norse influence on its core vocabulary: German. The modern German word for sister is **Schwester**. This word evolved from Old High German *swester*, which is a direct cognate to Old English *sweostor*. The parallel evolution provides very strong evidence that the English word would have likely been \"swester\". The Dutch word *zuster* shows the alternative path where the 'w' was lost.\n    *   **Conclusion of Analysis**: Given the direct line of phonetic evolution and the strong evidence from its German cognate, the most probable Modern English word for a female sibling, without Norse influence, would be **swester**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the linguistic evolution from Old English, the final answer is derived from the native word *sweostor*.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
