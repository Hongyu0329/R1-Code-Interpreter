    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the information provided.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to the United States.\n*   **Information to find:** The name of the US city.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot of the film, focusing on the character Tommaso.**\n*   The film's protagonist is Piero, and Tommaso is his best friend from childhood in Livorno, Italy.\n*   Their lives take different paths. While Piero struggles, Tommaso becomes a successful and ambitious sales representative.\n*   Tommaso's success in his career eventually leads to an opportunity for him to work abroad.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific detail of his move.**\n*   In a key scene, Tommaso tells his friend Piero that he has been promoted and is being transferred by his company.\n*   He specifies that this transfer requires him to move to the United States.\n*   By consulting plot summaries and analyses of the film, we can confirm the exact city he names as his destination.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the city name.**\n*   A review of the film's script and reliable plot synopses confirms that Tommaso explicitly states he is moving to Philadelphia for his new job. This move symbolizes the great distance, both literal and figurative, that has grown between him and his friend Piero.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   It is important not to confuse the main character, Piero, with his friend Tommaso, about whom the question is asked.\n*   The question is very specific, requiring the city name, not just the country.\n*   The information is a specific plot detail from a foreign film, so relying on memory can be inaccurate. Cross-referencing with film databases or detailed summaries is crucial.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
