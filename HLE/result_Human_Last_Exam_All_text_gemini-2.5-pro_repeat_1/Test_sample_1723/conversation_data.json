    "This is a classic and rather tricky question in mycology, as the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for a **single genus** of **mushroom** that is **known** to produce a **distinctly blue spore print**. Each of these parts is important.\n*   **Mushroom:** This term usually refers to a macrofungus with a distinct cap and stem, but can be used more broadly for any fleshy fungal fruiting body.\n*   **Distinctly blue spore print:** A spore print is the color of a mushroom's spores when viewed in a thick deposit. This color is a primary identification feature. \"Distinctly blue\" implies a true blue, not a bluish-gray or a lilac tint.\n*   **Single genus known to produce:** This implies that this is a unique and established fact within the field of mycology.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Common \"Blue\" Mushrooms\nMany mushrooms are blue in color, but this color rarely extends to their spores. It's important to eliminate these common but incorrect candidates.\n*   ***Entoloma***: This genus contains many species that are blue or violet, such as the beautiful *Entoloma hochstetteri*. However, the entire genus is defined by its pink, salmon, or pinkish-brown spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia***: Species like the Verdigris Agaric (*Stropharia aeruginosa*) can be a striking blue-green. However, their spore print is a dark purple-brown.\n*   ***Cortinarius***: This is a massive genus with a large sub-group of vividly blue and purple species. Their spore print, however, is characteristically rusty brown.\n*   ***Gyroporus***: The Bluing Bolete (*Gyroporus cyanescens*) is famous for its flesh instantly turning a deep blue when cut or bruised. Its spore print is pale yellow.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating the Most Famous Blue Mushroom\nThe most famous blue mushroom is arguably ***Lactarius indigo***. It is blue through-and-through and even \"bleeds\" a blue latex or \"milk\" when cut. Because of its profound blue color, it is a very common misconception that its spore print must also be blue. In reality, the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is cream to pale yellow. Due to this common misconception, **Lactarius** is often the intended answer in trivia quizzes, even though it is factually incorrect.\n\n### Step 4: Searching for the True Answer\nIf the question is taken as being factually correct, we must look for obscure or unusual fungi that actually have blue spores. Mycological literature points to a couple of possibilities, which unfortunately complicates the \"single genus\" claim.\n1.  ***Terana***: This genus contains the Cobalt Crust Fungus (*Terana caerulea*). This fungus forms a vibrant, blue crust on wood. While not a typical \"mushroom\" with a cap and stem, it is a macrofungus, and its spores are documented as being **pale blue** when seen in a mass deposit.\n2.  ***Bonomyces***: This is a much more obscure genus of gilled mushrooms. The species *Bonomyces subsinopicus* is described in authoritative European texts as having a **pale bluish-grey** spore print.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThere is no single, well-known mushroom genus that unambiguously fits the question's description. The premise of a \"single genus\" is flawed because at least two genera (*Terana* and *Bonomyces*) are documented to have species with blue or bluish spores.\n\nHowever, if this question is from a quiz or general knowledge context, it is most likely alluding to the common misconception about the most famous blue mushroom. The question may be designed to test the association with this iconic species, rather than strict mycological accuracy. In that context, the expected answer is almost certainly *Lactarius*.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most common answer associated with this specific question, despite the factual inaccuracy regarding the spore print, is the genus containing the famous Indigo Milk Cap.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
