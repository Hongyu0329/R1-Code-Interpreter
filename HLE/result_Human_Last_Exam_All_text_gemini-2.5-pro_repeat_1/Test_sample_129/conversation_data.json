    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\nThe allowed symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\nWe will systematically count the expressions by classifying them based on their top-level syntactic structure. An expression is defined by its unique sequence of 5 symbols.\n\n### Category 1: Expressions with Two Binary Operators\nThis category corresponds to expressions of the form `A op1 B op2 C`, where A, B, and C are the single characters `T` or `F`. The total length is 5.\n- **Form `A & B & C`**: Parsed as `(A & B) & C`. This is true only if A, B, and C are all `T`.\n  - `T & T & T`: 1 expression.\n- **Form `A | B | C`**: Parsed as `(A | B) | C`. This is true if at least one of A, B, or C is `T`. Out of 2Â³=8 combinations, only `F | F | F` is false.\n  - 7 true expressions.\n- **Form `A & B | C`**: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if `C` is `T`, or if `A` and `B` are both `T`.\n  - Cases: `T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`, `T&T|F`.\n  - 5 true expressions.\n- **Form `A | B & C`**: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if `A` is `T`, or if `B` and `C` are both `T`.\n  - Cases: `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T`.\n  - 5 true expressions.\n**Subtotal for Category 1: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n### Category 2: Expressions with One Binary Operator\n\nThis category includes expressions with a single `&` or `|`. To reach a length of 5, the remaining symbols must be operands (`T`, `F`), negations (`!`), or parentheses `()`.\n\n- **Form `(A op B)`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `(T & T)` (1)\n  - `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)` (3)\n  - Subtotal: 4 expressions.\n- **Form `!(A op B)`** where A, B are `T`/`F`. Expression is true if `A op B` is false.\n  - `!(T & F)`, `!(F & T)`, `!(F & F)` (3)\n  - `!(F | F)` (1)\n  - Subtotal: 4 expressions.\n- **Form `!A op !B`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `!F & !F` (1)\n  - `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, `!F | !F` (3)\n  - Subtotal: 4 expressions.\n- **Form `A op !!B` or `!!A op B`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `T & !!T`, `!!T & T` (2)\n  - `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` (6)\n  - Subtotal: 8 expressions.\n- **Form `A op !!!B` or `!!!A op B`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `T & !!!F`, `!!!F & T` (2)\n  - `T|!!!T`, `T|!!!F`, `F|!!!F`, `!!!T|T`, `!!!F|T`, `!!!F|F` (6)\n  - Subtotal: 8 expressions.\n- **Form `A op (!B)` or `(!A) op B`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `T & (!F)`, `(!F) & T` (2)\n  - `T|(!T)`, `T|(!F)`, `F|(!F)`, `(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F` (6)\n  - Subtotal: 8 expressions.\n- **Form `!(A op !B)` or `!(!A op B)`** where A, B are `T`/`F`.\n  - `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)` (3) and `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)` (3)\n  - `!(F|!T)` (1) and `!(!T|F)` (1)\n  - Subtotal: 8 expressions.\n\n**Subtotal for Category 2: 4 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 44**\n\n### Category 3: Expressions without Binary Operators\n\nThese expressions are built using only operands, `!`, and `()`.\n\n- **Purely unary sequence**: `!!!!T` (1 expression).\n- **Parenthesized forms**:\n  1.  `((T))`: length 5, value T.\n  2.  `((!F))`: `!F` is T, so this is T. Length is `2 + len((!F)) = 2 + (2+len(!F)) = 5`.\n  3.  `(!!T)`: `!!T` is T, so this is T. Length is `2 + len(!!T) = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n  4.  `(!(!T))`: `!T` is F, `!(!T)` is T. Length is `2 + len(!(!T)) = 2 + 3 = 5`.\n  - Subtotal: 4 expressions.\n- **Negated parenthesized forms**:\n  1.  `!((!T))`: `!T` is F, `(!T)` is F, `((!T))` is F, `!((!T))` is T. Length is `1 + len(((!T))) = 1+4 = 5`.\n  2.  `!(!(!!T))`: `!!T` is T, `!(!!T)` is F, `!(!(!!T))` is T. Length is `1 + len(!(!!T)) = 1+4=5`.\n  3.  `!(!!(F))`: `(F)` is F, `!!(F)` is F, `!(!!(F))` is T. Length is `1 + len(!!(F)) = 1+4=5`.\n  4.  `!(!!!!F)`: `!!!!F` is F, `!(!!!!F)` is T. Length is `1+4=5`.\n  5.  `!(!(!(!F)))`: `F` -> `!F`(T) -> `!(!F)`(F) -> `!(!(!F))`(T) -> `!(!(!(!F)))`(F). Whoops. Let's recheck. `!(!(!(!F)))` -> `!(!(!(T)))` -> `!(!(F))` -> `!(T)` -> F. This is false. Let's try `!(!(!(!T)))`. This is `!(!(!F))` -> `!(!(T))` -> `!(F)` -> T. Length is `1+4=5`.\n  - Subtotal: 5 expressions.\n\n**Subtotal for Category 3: 1 + 4 + 5 = 10**\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nSumming up the subtotals from all categories:\nTotal = (Category 1) + (Category 2) + (Category 3)\nTotal = 18 + 44 + 10 = 72\n\nThe structures in each category are distinct, so there is no double counting.\n\n- Category 1 has two binary operators.\n- Category 2 has one binary operator.\n- Category 3 has zero binary operators.\n\nThe sub-categories are also based on distinct symbolic structures. For example, `(T&T)` is structurally different from `T&!!T`.\n\nFinal count is 72.\n\n<<<72>>>"
