    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the momentum of an electron and $p$ is the momentum of the electron. The electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1), and the uncertainty in its position ($\\Delta x$) is given as 10 pm.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\nWe use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The principle states:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Convert the uncertainty in position to SI units (meters):\n        $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n    2.  Substitute the values into the uncertainty principle equation:\n        $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit**\nAccording to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit is quantized:\n$L = m_e v r = n \\hbar$\n\nwhere $p = m_e v$ is the linear momentum. So, we can write:\n$p \\cdot r = n \\hbar$\n$p = \\frac{n \\hbar}{r_n}$\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius $r_1$ is the Bohr radius, $a_0$.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so $n=1$.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr radius), $a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  Use the formula for momentum in the first orbit ($n=1$, $r_1=a_0$):\n        $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{a_0} = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$.\n    2.  Calculate the value:\n        $p \\approx 1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$)**\nNow, we compute the final ratio using the values calculated in the previous steps.\n\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}}{1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}}$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} \\approx 2.6455$.\n\nRounding the result to two decimal places gives 2.65.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Unit Consistency:** All physical quantities must be in SI units before performing calculations. The position uncertainty was given in picometers (pm) and needed to be converted to meters (m).\n2.  **Heisenberg's Principle Formula:** The standard formula for the minimum uncertainty is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$. Using $\\hbar$ or $h/2\\pi$ would yield a different result.\n3.  **Bohr Model Formulas:** It is crucial to use the correct formulas from the Bohr model for the momentum of an electron in a specific orbit, which is derived from the quantization of angular momentum ($L=n\\hbar$).\n4.  **Constants:** Use the standard accepted values for physical constants like the Bohr radius ($a_0$) and the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar$).\n5.  **Final Ratio:** The final answer is a dimensionless ratio, as the units (kg·m/s) in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\n<<<2.65>>>"
