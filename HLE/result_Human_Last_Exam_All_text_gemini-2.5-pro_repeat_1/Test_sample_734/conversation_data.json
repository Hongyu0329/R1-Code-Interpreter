    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n    *   They must be a **Christian theologian**.\n    *   They must be the **first** to do this.\n    *   They must have developed **specialized terminology**.\n    *   This terminology must be able to describe **changes in the laws of nature**.\n    *   This framework must be applicable to two specific events: the **virgin birth of Jesus** and the **alterations in natural laws at the Fall**.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The topic of miracles and their relationship to natural law is a major theme in Christian theology. Key thinkers who addressed this include:\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** An early and highly influential Church Father.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 AD):** A medieval theologian who systematized many aspects of Christian doctrine, heavily influenced by Aristotle.\n    *   **C.S. Lewis (1898-1963 AD):** A modern apologist who wrote extensively on miracles.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Candidates Against the Criteria:**\n\n    *   **C.S. Lewis:** While he developed powerful analogies in his book *Miracles*, arguing that miracles are not violations of nature but the introduction of a supernatural factor into the natural system, he was a 20th-century figure. He was certainly not the *first* to develop a theological framework for this.\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas provided a very detailed classification of miracles, categorizing them by whether they are things nature cannot do at all (e.g., the sun moving backward), things nature can do but not in that order or speed (e.g., instant healing), or things God does without natural secondary causes. His framework is robust and can explain the virgin birth. However, his work came centuries after the early Church Fathers and built upon their foundation. Therefore, he is not the *first*.\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo:** Augustine is the strongest candidate. He was one of the first major theologians to systematically wrestle with the relationship between God's action and the natural world.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the concept of **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin, ***rationes seminales*** or ***rationes causales***). This was his specialized terminology. He proposed that in the initial act of creation, God embedded all the potentials for everything that would ever come to be, like seeds planted in the earth.\n        *   **Changes in the Laws of Nature:** According to Augustine, what we call \"nature\" is simply the \"usual course of things\" (*consuetus naturae cursus*). A miracle is not something *contra naturam* (against nature), because nothing can defy the will of God who is the author of nature. Instead, a miracle is the activation by God of one of these latent \"seminal reasons\" that lies outside the usual, observable pattern. This provides a framework for how the operations of nature can change or be superseded.\n        *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth is a prime example. For Augustine, it was not a violation of nature, but a unique event where God activated a creative potential that He had placed within creation from the beginning, allowing a birth to occur without the \"usual course\" of sexual reproduction.\n        *   **Application to the Fall:** The same principle applies to the changes in nature after the Fall of Man. The pre-Fall state of harmony and immortality was one mode of nature's operation. The post-Fall state of decay, death, suffering, and toil is another mode. Augustine's framework suggests that the potential for this corrupted state was also present within the \"seminal reasons,\" contingent upon human free will. The Fall thus triggered a change in which set of \"reasons\" became manifest in the natural world.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo was the first major theologian to develop a specialized metaphysical vocabulary (*rationes seminales*) that could cohesively explain apparent changes in the laws of nature. His framework was specifically applicable to understanding both unique miracles like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in nature's operation, such as those believed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
