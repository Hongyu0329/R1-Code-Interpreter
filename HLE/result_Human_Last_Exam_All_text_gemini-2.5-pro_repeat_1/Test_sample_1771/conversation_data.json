    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **PIE Laryngeals:** The PIE form contains the laryngeal `*h₂`. The sequence `*eh₂` regularly develops into a long vowel `*ā` in many daughter languages, but into Proto-Germanic `*ō`.\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This is the primary consonant shift differentiating Proto-Germanic from PIE. It affects stops. Specifically, PIE voiced stops (`*b, *d, *g`) become Proto-Germanic voiceless stops (`*p, *t, *k`).\n3.  **Verb Class:** The PIE suffix `*-ie-` indicates a present tense formation that leads to a Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic, characterized by the suffix `*-ja-`.\n4.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*j` in the PGmc. suffix `*-ja-` causes the fronting of the root vowel in the North and West Germanic languages (Old Norse, Old English, Old High German). The specific outcome of the umlauted vowel differs in each language.\n5.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the `*j` also caused palatalization of a preceding velar consonant (`*k`, `*g`).\n6.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This set of changes distinguishes Old High German from the other Germanic languages. It affects the voiceless stops that resulted from Grimm's Law. PGmc. `*k` becomes a fricative (`hh`/`ch`) in Old High German in this environment.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc.)**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** `*seh₂g-ie-ti` (Root: `*seh₂g-`)\n*   **Vowel Development:** The PIE sequence `*eh₂` becomes PGmc. `*ō`.\n*   **Consonant Development (Grimm's Law):** The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc. voiceless stop `*k`. The initial `*s` remains `*s`.\n*   **PGmc. Root:** The root `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n*   **PGmc. Verb Form:** The verb falls into the Class 1 of weak verbs. The infinitive is formed with the root `*sōk-`, the suffix `*-ja-`, and the infinitive ending `*-aną`.\n*   **Result:** **`*sōkijaną`** ('to seek, to look for')\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **PGmc. Form:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` causes the back vowel `*ō` to be fronted to `œ`.\n*   **Suffix and Ending:** The `*j` is retained. The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n*   **Result:** **`sœkja`**\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **PGmc. Form:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` causes `*ō` to be fronted and raised to `ē`.\n*   **Palatalization:** The `*j` also palatalizes the PGmc. `*k`, turning it into the Old English affricate `c` (pronounced /tʃ/).\n*   **Suffix and Ending:** The `*j` is lost after causing these changes. The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Result:** **`sēcan`**\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **PGmc. Form:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Vowel Development:** The PGmc. `*ō` diphthongizes to `uo`. (I-umlaut exists in the paradigm, but is not typically written in the infinitive for this verb class).\n*   **Consonant Development (High German Shift):** The PGmc. `*k` shifts to the voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /xx/) after a long vowel.\n*   **Suffix and Ending:** The `*j` is lost. The infinitive ending becomes `-en`.\n*   **Result:** **`suohhen`**\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
