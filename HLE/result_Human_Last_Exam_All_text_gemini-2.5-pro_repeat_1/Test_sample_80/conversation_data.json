    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\nThe game is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The pieces are bishops, which move any number of squares diagonally. A key property of bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only ever move to and attack other white squares. Similarly, a bishop on a black square is confined to black squares. The goal is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Playing Area**\nThe problem specifies that bishops can only be placed on the **edge squares** of the board. The edge squares are those in the 1st and 8th ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files.\nLet's count them:\n*   There are 8 squares on the top edge (the 8th rank).\n*   There are 8 squares on the bottom edge (the 1st rank).\n*   There are 6 squares on the left edge (the 'a' file, excluding the two corners already counted).\n*   There are 6 squares on the right edge (the 'h' file, excluding the two corners already counted).\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = **28 squares**.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Problem by Color**\nBecause bishops on white squares do not interact with bishops on black squares, we can solve the problem for each color independently and then add the results.\nAn 8x8 board has 32 white and 32 black squares. The inner 6x6 area has 18 white and 18 black squares.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 32 - 18 = **14 white squares**.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 32 - 18 = **14 black squares**.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nWe need to find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares. Let's identify the pairs of white edge squares that lie on the same diagonal and can, therefore, attack each other.\n*   `h1` attacks `a8`\n*   `f1` attacks `a6`\n*   `d1` attacks `a4`\n*   `b1` attacks `a2`\n*   `h3` attacks `c8`\n*   `h5` attacks `e8`\n*   `h7` attacks `g8`\nThese are 7 distinct pairs of squares that attack each other. Notice that these 7 pairs account for all 14 white edge squares. To place the maximum number of bishops, we can place one bishop from each pair. For instance, we could place bishops on {h1, f1, d1, b1, h3, h5, h7}. Since each bishop is from a different attacking pair, none of them can attack each other.\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the white edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nWe follow the same logic for the 14 black edge squares. Due to the symmetry of the board, the result will be the same, but we can list the pairs to be sure.\n*   `a1` attacks `h8`\n*   `c1` attacks `h6`\n*   `e1` attacks `h4`\n*   `g1` attacks `h2`\n*   `a3` attacks `f8`\n*   `a5` attacks `d8`\n*   `a7` attacks `b8`\nAgain, we have 7 pairs that cover all 14 black edge squares. We can place one bishop from each pair, resulting in a maximum of **7** non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops**\nThe total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge of the board is the sum of the maximums for each color.\n*   Total Bishops = (Max on white squares) + (Max on black squares) = 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n\n**Step 7: Answer the Final Question**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would **lack** bishops (i.e., would be empty).\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Number of placed bishops = 14\n*   Number of empty squares = Total edge squares - Number of placed bishops\n*   Number of empty squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The problem is a placement puzzle, not a competitive game. \"Two people\" is flavor text suggesting a cooperative effort.\n*   The key is to realize bishops are color-bound, which simplifies the problem into two smaller, independent parts.\n*   Identifying the attacking pairs is the most direct way to prove the maximum number of placements for each color.\n*   The final question is about the number of *empty* squares, not the number of bishops placed.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: There are 28 edge squares in total. A maximum of 14 non-attacking bishops can be placed on them. Therefore, the number of edge squares left without bishops is 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
