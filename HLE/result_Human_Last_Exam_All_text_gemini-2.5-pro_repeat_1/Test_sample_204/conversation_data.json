    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by `n = (nx, ny, nz)` where:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nFirst, we check if `n` is a unit vector field.\n`nx² + ny² + nz² = sin²(G)cos²(f) + sin²(G)sin²(f) + cos²(G) = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`.\nSince `n` is always a unit vector, it defines a map from the 3D space R³ to the 2-sphere S².\n\nFor the Hopf charge to be well-defined, the field `n` must approach a constant value at infinity. Let's check this limit. As `(x,y,z) -> ∞`, the term `x*x+y*y` goes to infinity, which means `r2` also goes to infinity.\nAs `r2 -> ∞`, the argument of the exponential `-10*r2 -> -∞`.\nSo, `exp(-10*r2) -> 0`.\nThis means `G -> PI * 0 = 0`.\nThen, `nx -> sin(0)cos(f) = 0`, `ny -> sin(0)sin(f) = 0`, and `nz -> cos(0) = 1`.\nAt infinity, the field `n` approaches the constant vector `(0, 0, 1)`. This allows us to compactify R³ into a 3-sphere S³ by identifying the point at infinity. Thus, the vector field represents a map `n: S³ -> S²`, for which the Hopf charge is a well-defined topological invariant.\n\n### Step 2: The Whitehead Formula and the Linking Number Interpretation\n\nThe Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge `H` is given by a volume integral, but a more intuitive and practical way to calculate it is through the linking number of the preimages of two regular values (points) on the target sphere S².\n`H = Lk(n⁻¹(p₁), n⁻¹(p₂))`\nwhere `p₁` and `p₂` are two distinct points on S², and `n⁻¹(p)` is the set of points in R³ that map to `p`. For regular values `p`, these preimages are closed loops in R³.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Preimage of the South Pole\n\nLet's choose our first point `p₁` to be the South Pole of S², i.e., `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)`. We need to find the set of points `(x,y,z)` where `n(x,y,z) = (0, 0, -1)`.\nThis gives us the conditions:\n1.  `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 0`\n2.  `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`\n3.  `nz = cos(G) = -1`\n\nFrom `nz = -1`, we must have `G = (2k+1)π` for some integer `k`. Let's examine the range of `G`. The minimum value of `r2` is 0 (when `z=0` and `x²+y²=0.5`). At this minimum, `G = PI*exp(0) = PI`. The maximum value of `r2` is infinity, which gives `G=0`. So, the range of `G` is `(0, PI]`.\nThe only solution for `G = (2k+1)π` in this range is `G = PI` (for `k=0`).\nIf `G=PI`, then `sin(G)=sin(PI)=0`, which automatically satisfies the conditions `nx=0` and `ny=0`.\nSo, the preimage of the South Pole is the set of points where `G=PI`.\n`G = PI * exp(-10*r2) = PI`\n`exp(-10*r2) = 1`\n`-10*r2 = 0` => `r2 = 0`.\nFrom the definition of `r2`, `r2=0` implies:\n`sqrt((x²+y²-0.5)² + z²) = 0`\nThis requires both terms under the square root to be zero:\n1.  `z = 0`\n2.  `x² + y² - 0.5 = 0` => `x² + y² = 0.5`\n\nThis is the equation of a circle in the `z=0` plane (the xy-plane) with radius `r = sqrt(0.5) = 1/√2`, centered at the origin. Let's call this curve `C_S`.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Preimage of an Equatorial Point\n\nLet's choose our second point `p₂` on the equator of S², for instance `p₂ = (0, 1, 0)`. We find the set of points where `n(x,y,z) = (0, 1, 0)`.\n1.  `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 0`\n2.  `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 1`\n3.  `nz = cos(G) = 0`\n\nFrom `nz=0`, we have `G = π/2 + kπ`. Within the range `(0, PI]`, the only solution is `G = π/2`.\nIf `G=π/2`, then `sin(G)=1`. The conditions on `nx` and `ny` become:\n1.  `cos(f) = 0`\n2.  `sin(f) = 1`\nThis implies the angle `f = π/2`. From the definition `f=atan2(y,x)`, `f=π/2` corresponds to the positive y-axis, i.e., `x=0` and `y>0`.\n\nNow we use the condition `G=π/2`:\n`PI * exp(-10*r2) = π/2`\n`exp(-10*r2) = 1/2`\n`-10*r2 = ln(1/2) = -ln(2)`\n`r2 = ln(2) / 10`.\nSquaring both sides and using the definition of `r2`:\n`(x²+y²-0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\nWe must satisfy this equation along with the conditions `x=0` and `y>0`. Substituting `x=0`:\n`(y²-0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`, with `y>0`.\nThis is the equation of a closed loop in the yz-plane. Let's call this curve `C_N`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Linking Number of the Two Curves\n\nThe Hopf charge is `H = Lk(C_S, C_N)`.\n*   `C_S` is a circle of radius `1/√2` in the `xy`-plane.\n*   `C_N` is a loop in the `yz`-plane.\n\nWe can calculate the linking number by considering the surface `D_S` which is the disk bounded by `C_S` (`x²+y² ≤ 0.5, z=0`) and counting how many times `C_N` pierces this disk, including sign.\nThe curve `C_N` pierces the `z=0` plane when its `z` coordinate is zero. From the equation for `C_N`:\n`(y²-0.5)² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n`y²-0.5 = ± ln(2)/10`\n`y² = 0.5 ± ln(2)/10`.\nSince `y>0`, the piercing points occur at `y₁ = sqrt(0.5 - ln(2)/10)` and `y₂ = sqrt(0.5 + ln(2)/10)`. The x-coordinate is 0 for both.\nWe check if these points are inside the disk `D_S`. The disk has radius `sqrt(0.5)`.\n*   For the point with `y₁`: `x²+y² = 0 + (0.5 - ln(2)/10) < 0.5`. This point is inside the disk.\n*   For the point with `y₂`: `x²+y² = 0 + (0.5 + ln(2)/10) > 0.5`. This point is outside the disk.\nSo, the loop `C_N` pierces the disk `D_S` exactly once. The magnitude of the linking number is `|H| = 1`.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Sign of the Linking Number\n\nThe sign depends on the orientations of the curves.\n1.  **Orient `C_S`**: We use the standard counter-clockwise orientation (direction of increasing `f`). By the right-hand rule, the normal vector to the disk surface `D_S` is in the `+z` direction (`n_S = e_z`).\n2.  **Orient `C_N`**: The orientation of `C_N` is induced by the map. A tangent vector `T` to `C_N` must be orthogonal to the gradients of the functions that define it, so `T` is parallel to `∇G × ∇f`.\n3.  **Find Piercing Direction**: We need the direction of `T` at the piercing point `P₁ = (0, y₁, 0)`.\n    *   `∇f = (1/ρ)e_φ` (where `ρ=sqrt(x²+y²)`). At `f=π/2`, `e_φ = -e_x`.\n    *   `∇G = (∂G/∂ρ)e_ρ + (∂G/∂z)e_z`. At `z=0`, `∂G/∂z = 0`. The sign of `∂G/∂ρ` at `P₁` is positive (since `ρ₁²-0.5 < 0`). So `∇G` is in the `+e_ρ` direction. At `f=π/2`, `e_ρ=e_y`.\n    *   So at `P₁`, `∇G` is in the `+e_y` direction and `∇f` is in the `-e_x` direction.\n    *   `T ~ ∇G × ∇f ~ (+e_y) × (-e_x) = -(e_y × e_x)`.\n    *   Using the right-hand rule for a standard coordinate system (`e_x × e_y = e_z`), we get `e_y × e_x = -e_z`.\n    *   Therefore, `T ~ -(-e_z) = +e_z`.\n\nHold on, let me re-check the cross product.\n`e_ρ × e_φ = e_z`.\nAt `P₁`, `∇G` is in the `+e_ρ` direction. `∇f` is in the `+e_φ` direction.\nSo `T ~ (+e_ρ) × (+e_φ) = +e_z`.\nMy previous thinking had a sign error in the vectors. Let's re-verify the basis vectors at `f=π/2`.\n`e_ρ = cos(f)e_x + sin(f)e_y = cos(π/2)e_x + sin(π/2)e_y = e_y`. Correct.\n`e_φ = -sin(f)e_x + cos(f)e_y = -sin(π/2)e_x + cos(π/2)e_y = -e_x`. Correct.\n`∇G` points in the `+e_ρ = +e_y` direction.\n`∇f` points in the `+e_φ = -e_x` direction.\n`T ~ (+e_y) × (-e_x) = -(e_y × e_x) = -(-e_z) = +e_z`.\n\nWait, the standard cross product is `e_x × e_y = e_z`, so `e_y × e_x = -e_z`.\nSo `T ~ (+e_y) × (-e_x) = -(e_y × e_x) = -(-e_z) = +e_z`. This cannot be right.\nLet's do the cross product again:\n`T ~ (+e_y) × (-e_x)`. Let `e_y=(0,1,0)` and `-e_x=(-1,0,0)`.\n`T ~ (0,1,0) × (-1,0,0) = (1*0 - 0*0, 0*(-1) - 0*0, 0*0 - 1*(-1)) = (0, 0, 1) = +e_z`.\n\nLet me re-re-check my `∇G` direction.\n`∂G/∂ρ ∝ -ρ(ρ²-0.5)`. At `P₁`, `ρ²-0.5` is negative. `ρ` is positive. So `∂G/∂ρ` is positive. `∇G` is in `+e_ρ`. This seems correct.\n\nLet's assume the calculation `T ~ +e_z` is correct.\nThe tangent vector `T` points in the `+z` direction. This is the same direction as the normal vector `n_S` of the disk. Therefore, the linking number is `+1`.\n\nLet's try another reasoning path to check. A map of this form `n = (sinG cos(kf), sinG sin(kf), cosG)` where `G` goes from `π` at a central core to `0` at infinity has a Hopf charge `H=kN` where `k` is the winding of `f` and `N` is the winding of `G`. Here `k=1`. The winding `N` is defined as `(G_{center} - G_{infinity})/π = (π-0)/π = 1`. This gives `H=kN=1*1=1`. This confirms the result.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hopf charge of the field is 1.\n\n>>>1"
