    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d = 53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conductor $d$\nThe first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors. $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Testing for 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Now we factor 7657. Testing for small primes again: $7657$ is not divisible by 7 or 11.\n*   Testing for 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Now we factor 589. Testing for small primes: $589$ is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, or 17.\n*   Testing for 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   Both 19 and 31 are prime numbers.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nLet's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, which simplifies the analysis significantly.\n\n### Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where $\\chi_i$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p_i$.\nIn our case, $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Primitivity Condition\nA character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\dots \\chi_k$ with a square-free modulus $d = p_1 \\dots p_k$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is non-principal (non-trivial).\n*   A character $\\chi_i$ modulo a prime $p_i$ is principal if and only if its order is 1.\n*   So, for $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each $\\chi_i$, let's call it $k_i$, must be greater than 1.\n    $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The condition of primitivity translates directly to a condition on the orders of the component characters.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Order Condition\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\nSo, $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\n### Step 5: Combine Conditions and Count\nLet's combine the conditions on the orders $k_i$:\n1.  **Primitivity:** $k_i > 1$ for all $i$.\n2.  **Order of $\\chi$ is 6:** $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n3.  **Group Theory Constraint:** The order of any character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i - 1$.\n\nFrom condition (2), each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6. So $k_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombining with condition (1), we must have $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow let's check condition (3) for each prime factor:\n*   For $p_1 = 7$, $\\phi(p_1) = 6$. The divisors are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. So $k_1$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_2 = 13$, $\\phi(p_2) = 12$. The divisors are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\\}$. So $k_2$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_3 = 19$, $\\phi(p_3) = 18$. The divisors are $\\{1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\\}$. So $k_3$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n*   For $p_4 = 31$, $\\phi(p_4) = 30$. The divisors are $\\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\\}$. So $k_4$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\nAll our required orders are possible for all component characters.\n\n### Step 6: Count the Characters\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ such that their orders $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$ satisfy $k_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$.\n\nThe number of characters of a specific order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $k|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$:\n*   Number of characters $\\chi_i$ of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters $\\chi_i$ of order 3 is $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters $\\chi_i$ of order 6 is $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nLet's use a counting method. We will count all primitive characters whose order divides 6, and then subtract those whose order is a proper divisor of 6.\n1.  **Total primitive characters with order dividing 6:**\n    The order $k_i$ of each component $\\chi_i$ must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    For each component $\\chi_i$, there are $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ possible choices.\n    Since there are four components, the total number of such tuples of characters is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract characters with order being a proper divisor of 6:**\n    The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. The order cannot be 1 due to the primitivity condition.\n    *   **Case A: Order is 2.**\n        This happens if $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 2$. This requires each $k_i$ to be 2 (since $k_i>1$).\n        For each component, there is $\\phi(2) = 1$ character of order 2.\n        The total number of such characters is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case B: Order is 3.**\n        This happens if $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 3$. This requires each $k_i$ to be 3 (since $k_i>1$).\n        For each component, there are $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters of order 3.\n        The total number of such characters is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final number:**\n    The number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order 2, minus those with order 3.\n    Number of characters of order 6 = (Total) - (Number of order 2) - (Number of order 3)\n    Number = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The logic relies on the fact that the set of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is the disjoint union of the sets of primitive characters of order 2, 3, and 6. This is why a simple subtraction works.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Factor $d=53599$ into $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n*   $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$ is primitive means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) = k_i > 1$.\n*   $\\text{ord}(\\chi)=6$ means $\\text{lcm}(k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4)=6$.\n*   This implies $k_i \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$, all of which are valid orders for characters modulo 7, 13, 19, and 31.\n*   Number of choices for each $\\chi_i$ with order in $\\{2,3,6\\}$ is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n*   Total combinations of such characters is $5^4 = 625$.\n*   We subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n    *   lcm is 2: All $k_i=2$. Number of choices is $1^4=1$.\n    *   lcm is 3: All $k_i=3$. Number of choices is $2^4=16$.\n*   Final answer: $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
