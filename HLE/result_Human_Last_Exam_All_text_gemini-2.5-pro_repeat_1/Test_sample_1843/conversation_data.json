    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N.**\nThe conductor is $N = 36036$. We find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The factorization of the conductor is the foundation of the problem. A mistake here would invalidate the entire solution.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the structure of a primitive character with a composite conductor.**\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = q_1 q_2 \\dots q_k$, where the $q_i$ are powers of distinct primes, is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $q_i$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nHere, each $\\chi_q$ must be a primitive character modulo $q$.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial that *each* component character $\\chi_q$ is primitive modulo its respective prime-power conductor $q$.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the order condition.**\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\nWe are given that $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = 6$. This implies two conditions:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_q)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of component orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n**Careful Point:** The order is the lcm, not the product. This means we need to count the valid combinations of component characters, not just find the orders of individual components.\n\n**Step 4: Count the valid primitive characters for each prime-power factor.**\nWe need to determine, for each prime-power factor $q$ of $N$, how many primitive characters $\\chi_q$ exist such that their order divides 6.\n\n*   **Conductor q = 4 = 2²:**\n    The group of characters mod 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_2$. It has $\\phi(4)=2$ characters. The trivial character has conductor 1. The other character is primitive and has order 2. Since its order (2) divides 6, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor q = 9 = 3²:**\n    The group of characters mod 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders are divisors of 6, i.e., {1, 2, 3, 6}. The primitive characters are those with orders 3 or 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n*   **Conductor q = 7:**\n    The group of characters mod 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_6$. Since 7 is prime, any non-trivial character is primitive. The possible orders are {2, 3, 6}. All of these orders divide 6.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Conductor q = 11:**\n    The group of characters mod 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_{10}$. Any non-trivial character is primitive. The possible orders are {2, 5, 10}. We need the order to divide 6. Only order 2 satisfies this condition.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    Total choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1**.\n\n*   **Conductor q = 13:**\n    The group of characters mod 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^* \\cong C_{12}$. Any non-trivial character is primitive. The possible orders are {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. We need the order to divide 6. The orders {2, 3, 6} satisfy this.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results and find the total number.**\nWe have the number of choices for each component character. Let's verify that any combination of these choices results in a character of order 6.\n\n*   **Check for factor of 2:** For any choice, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4) = 2$. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 2.\n*   **Check for factor of 3:** For any choice, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$ is either 3 or 6. In either case, it is divisible by 3. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm is always divisible by 2 and 3, and all individual orders divide 6 (meaning no other prime factors like 5 can appear in the lcm), the lcm of the orders for any combination of our selected component characters is guaranteed to be 6.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$"
