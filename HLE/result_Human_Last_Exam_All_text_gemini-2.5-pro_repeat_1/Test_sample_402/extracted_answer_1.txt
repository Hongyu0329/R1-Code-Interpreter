A two-step filtering strategy to eliminate contamination from cancer genes in the CAR T samples not expressing IL-15.

**Step 1: Create a Cancer-Specific Gene List.**
First, generate a list of genes that are highly expressed in the specific cancer cell line used for co-culture but have very low or no expression in normal T cells. This requires comparing the expression profiles of the pure cancer cell line and pure T cells (from public data or internal controls). Save this list as a single-column text file (e.g., `cancer_genes.txt`).

**Step 2: Filter the Differential Expression Results using a Command-Line Tool.**
After performing the differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing CAR-IL15 vs. CAR-only cells, use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter the resulting table (e.g., `dge_results.tsv`). The filtering logic removes a gene if it meets two conditions simultaneously:
1.  The gene is present in the `cancer_genes.txt` list created in Step 1.
2.  The gene's log2 fold change is strongly negative (e.g., less than -2), which is characteristic of a contaminant present only in the control (CAR-only) group.

This approach precisely targets and removes the artifactual data points, cleaning the dataset for a more accurate interpretation of the true transcriptional differences between the two CAR T cell populations.
