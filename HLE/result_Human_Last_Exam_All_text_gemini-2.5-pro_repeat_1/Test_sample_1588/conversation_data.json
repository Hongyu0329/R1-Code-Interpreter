    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\n\nThe BCH formula provides an explicit expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting operators (or elements of a Lie algebra). The solution for $Z$ is given as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X,Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. For example:\n*   $Z_1 = X+Y$\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]]$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X,Y)$ is an element of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This refers to the term $Z_{10}(X,Y)$. This term is a linear combination of basis elements of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10.\nLet $\\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_m\\}$ be a basis for the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10. Then $Z_{10}$ can be written as:\n$Z_{10}(X,Y) = c_1 B_1 + c_2 B_2 + \\dots + c_m B_m$\n\nThe question is asking for the number of coefficients $c_i$ that are not equal to zero.\n\n### Step 3: Connect the Question to a Key Mathematical Theorem\n\nA fundamental result, known as the **Dynkin-Specht-Wever theorem**, states that when the BCH series is expressed in a suitable basis for the free Lie algebra (such as the basis formed from Lyndon words), all the coefficients are non-zero.\n\nThis theorem provides a crucial simplification: instead of calculating each of the coefficients for the order-10 term (which would be extremely complex), we only need to find the number of basis elements required to span the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10. This number is the dimension of the space.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the dimension of the 10th-degree homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators ($X$ and $Y$).\n\n### Step 4: Use Witt's Formula to Calculate the Dimension\n\nThe dimension of the $n$-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, denoted $\\dim(L_n(k))$, is given by **Witt's formula**:\n$\\dim(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the **Möbius function**, defined as:\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = -1$ if $d$ is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    *   $\\mu(d) = 0$ if $d$ has a squared prime factor.\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify parameters:**\n    *   $n = 10$\n    *   $k = 2$\n\n2.  **Find the divisors of n=10:**\n    The divisors $d$ of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition, as 1 has 0 prime factors, and 0 is even).\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime, so 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime, so 1 prime factor, which is odd).\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is the product of 2 distinct primes, which is even).\n\n4.  **Apply Witt's formula:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} + \\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} + \\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} + \\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} \\right)$\n\n5.  **Substitute the values and compute:**\n    $\\dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} + (1) \\cdot 2^{1} \\right)$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} (1 \\cdot 1024 - 1 \\cdot 32 - 1 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 2)$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2)$\n    $= \\frac{1}{10} (990)$\n    $= 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
