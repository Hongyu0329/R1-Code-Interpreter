    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes a junction formed by two Chern insulators.\n    *   **Component 1:** A Chern insulator with Chern number $C_1 = 1$.\n    *   **Component 2:** Another Chern insulator with Chern number $C_2 = 1$.\n    *   **Configuration:** They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a larger 2D system.\n    *   **Interface Condition:** The \"tunneling barrier is negligible.\" This is a crucial point, implying that the two systems are in direct contact and can be treated as a single, combined system. There is no insulating gap (like a vacuum with C=0) between them.\n\n2.  **Recall the Properties of the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number ($C$) is a topological invariant, an integer that characterizes the bulk electronic band structure of a 2D gapped system.\n    *   It determines the quantized Hall conductance via the formula $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n    *   **Additivity:** The Chern number is an additive quantity. If you combine two systems (System 1 and System 2) to form a larger system, the Chern number of the combined system ($C_{total}$) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers, provided the energy gap does not close in the process.\n    *   **Formula:** $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Additivity Principle to the Problem:**\n    *   We are given $C_1 = 1$ and $C_2 = 1$.\n    *   The two insulators are combined into a single junction.\n    *   Using the additivity principle, the Chern number of the combined system is:\n        $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Verify with the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence (Edge State Picture):**\n    *   The bulk-boundary correspondence states that a Chern insulator with Chern number $C$ will host $|C|$ protected, chiral (one-way) edge states at its boundary. The sign of $C$ determines the direction of propagation (chirality).\n    *   **System 1 ($C_1 = 1$):** Has one chiral edge state circulating along its boundary.\n    *   **System 2 ($C_2 = 1$):** Also has one chiral edge state circulating along its boundary, with the same chirality (direction) as System 1.\n    *   **Junction:** When the two systems are placed side-by-side, we must consider what happens at the internal interface and the new outer boundary.\n        *   **Outer Boundary:** On the outer edges of the combined system (e.g., the top edge), the edge state from System 1 and the edge state from System 2 will run parallel to each other in the same direction. This results in a total of two co-propagating edge states on the outer boundary.\n        *   **Internal Interface:** At the interface where the two insulators meet, the edge state from the right side of System 1 and the edge state from the left side of System 2 will be present. Since they belong to a continuous boundary trace, they are counter-propagating (e.g., one moves up, the other moves down). Because the tunneling barrier is negligible, these two counter-propagating states can interact, hybridize, and open an energy gap, effectively \"annihilating\" each other at the interface.\n    *   **Conclusion from Edge States:** The combined system is left with a net of 2 chiral edge states circulating along its new, larger outer boundary. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with 2 chiral edge states must have a bulk Chern number of $C = 2$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This is key. If there were a significant insulating barrier (e.g., vacuum, with $C=0$) between them, we would be analyzing a different system. The edge states of each insulator would exist at the interface with the barrier.\n*   **Additivity Principle:** This is a fundamental property of topological invariants like the Chern number. It makes calculating the properties of composite topological systems straightforward.\n*   **Chirality:** Since both insulators have the same sign of Chern number ($+1$), their edge states have the same chirality, leading to constructive addition on the outer boundary. If one had $C=1$ and the other had $C=-1$, the total Chern number would be $C_{total} = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe Chern number is an additive topological invariant. The total Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of its constituent parts.\nGiven:\nChern number of the first insulator, $C_1 = 1$.\nChern number of the second insulator, $C_2 = 1$.\nTotal Chern number of the junction, $C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$.\n$C_{total} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
