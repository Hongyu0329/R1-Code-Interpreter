    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and Her Work**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a famous British painter who specialized in military scenes, particularly those involving the British Army. To answer the question, we must identify her major paintings that depict specific battles and determine the dates of those battles.\n\n**Step 2: List Major Battle Paintings and their Historical Dates**\nHere is a list of some of Lady Butler's most famous paintings and the historical dates of the events they portray:\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted in 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the **Battle of Waterloo**, which occurred on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted in 1875): Depicts soldiers forming a square at the **Battle of Quatre Bras** on **June 16, 1815**.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted in 1879): Shows Dr. William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad, the lone survivor of a 16,000-strong column after the **1842 retreat from Kabul** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted in 1874): Depicts a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the **Battle of Inkerman (November 5, 1854)** during the Crimean War.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted in 1876): Shows the exhausted survivors of the Charge of the Light Brigade, which took place at the **Battle of Balaclava (October 25, 1854)**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted in 1880): A depiction of the **Battle of Rorke's Drift**, fought on **January 22–23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted in 1885): Depicts the aftermath of the **Battle of Tel El Kebir**, which was fought on **September 13, 1882**, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted c. 1890s): Portrays the Gordon Relief Expedition of **1884–1885**, which saw action in battles like Abu Klea.\n*   ***The Irish Guards in the Great War: The First Battalion at the First Battle of Ypres, November 1914*** (painted c. 1918): This painting explicitly depicts a scene from the **First Battle of Ypres**, which took place in **October–November 1914**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Battles**\nNow, let's arrange the battles in chronological order to find the latest one:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras / Waterloo: **1815**\n2.  Retreat from Kabul: **1842**\n3.  Battle of Balaclava / Inkerman (Crimean War): **1854**\n4.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n5.  Battle of Tel El Kebir: **1882**\n6.  Gordon Relief Expedition: **1884-1885**\n7.  First Battle of Ypres (First World War): **1914**\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the dates of the historical events depicted in her paintings, the latest battle is the First Battle of Ypres from the First World War.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The question asks for the latest **historical battle**, not the date the painting was completed. Lady Butler often painted historical events that occurred many years, or even decades, earlier.\n*   It is crucial to accurately identify the specific event and its date for each painting.\n*   Lady Butler lived through the First World War and created works depicting it, making it a strong candidate for the latest conflict she painted.\n\nThe latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the First Battle of Ypres.\n\n<<<First Battle of Ypres"
