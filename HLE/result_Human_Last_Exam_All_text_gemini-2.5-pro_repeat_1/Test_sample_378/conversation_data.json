    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for the specific year in which the former Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, publicly adopted or identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". The question presumes this event actually occurred.\n\n2.  **Verify the Subject's Full Name:** The first crucial step is to verify the official and complete name of the individual in question. All credible and official sources, including his own autobiography, government records, and reputable encyclopedias, list his full name as **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n\n3.  **Search for Evidence of Name Change or Identification:** The next step is to conduct a thorough search of public records, news archives (both Nigerian and international), and official statements from his time in office and beyond. The search is for any instance where he either legally changed his name to include \"Azikiwe\" or made a public declaration identifying himself as such.\n\n4.  **Analyze Search Results:**\n    *   There are no credible reports, news articles, or official documents that indicate Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name.\n    *   The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria and a key figure in its independence.\n    *   While Goodluck Jonathan, like many Nigerian leaders, may have referenced Nnamdi Azikiwe in speeches or writings to honor him as a founding father, this is fundamentally different from adopting his name or identifying himself *as* Azikiwe.\n\n5.  **Conclusion based on Lack of Evidence:** The premise of the question is incorrect. There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\". Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinction between Name and Title/Reference:** It is important to distinguish between a person's actual name and historical figures they might reference or be compared to.\n*   **Source Verification:** Relying on official and reputable sources is key to answering questions about public figures' biographical details.\n*   **False Premise:** The question is built on a false premise. The correct way to answer is not to guess a year, but to state that the event never occurred based on available evidence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on all available public records, former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no record of him ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\" or adding the name to his own. Therefore, there is no year in which this event took place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. The premise of the question is incorrect.>>>"
