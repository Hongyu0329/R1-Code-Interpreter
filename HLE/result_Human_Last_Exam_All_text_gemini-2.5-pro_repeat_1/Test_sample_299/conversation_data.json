    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Properties of the Function `f`**\n    Let the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous.\n\n    *   **Injectivity**: Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one), we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n    *   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. That is, $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n2.  **Case 1: `f` is Strictly Decreasing**\n    If $f$ is a strictly decreasing function, then for any $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ again, since it is decreasing, we get $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means that the composition $f \\circ f$ is a strictly increasing function. The function $\\exp(x)$ is indeed strictly increasing, so this is consistent.\n\n    Let's analyze the range of $f$. Since $f$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range, let's call it $I$, must be an interval. As $f$ is strictly decreasing, $I = (\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x), \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x))$. Let's denote these limits as $a$ and $b$ respectively, so $I=(a,b)$.\n\n    The range of $f(f(x))$ is the range of $\\exp(x)$, which is $(0, \\infty)$. The range of $f(f(x))$ is also the image of the range of $f$ under $f$, which is $f(I) = f((a,b))$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly decreasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, its restriction to the interval $(a,b)$ must also be strictly decreasing.\n    Therefore, $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y))$.\n    So we have $(\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y)) = (0, \\infty)$. This implies $\\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y) = 0$ and $\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y) = \\infty$.\n\n    This implies that $f$ has a vertical asymptote at $y=a$ (since its limit is $\\infty$). A function that is continuous on the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$ cannot have a vertical asymptote. This leads to a contradiction.\n\n    *Alternative contradiction for the decreasing case:*\n    If a strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ exists, it must have a unique fixed point if its graph intersects the line $y=x$. Let's assume $f$ maps its range to its range, which leads to $f|_{(0,\\infty)}: (0, \\infty) \\to (0, \\infty)$ being a decreasing bijection. Such a map must have a unique fixed point $x_0$, so $f(x_0) = x_0$. Applying $f$ to this gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. But from the original equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$. Thus, we would need $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. The equation $x = e^x$ has no real solution (since $e^x > x$ for all real $x$). This is a contradiction.\n\n    So, we conclude there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ satisfying the equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: `f` is Strictly Increasing**\n    If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $\\exp(x)$.\n    Similar to the decreasing case, let the range of $f$ be the interval $I=(a,b)$. The range of $f \\circ f$ is $f(I) = (0, \\infty)$.\n    Since $f$ is increasing, $f((a,b)) = (\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y))$.\n    So we have $(\\lim_{y \\to a^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to b^-} f(y)) = (0, \\infty)$.\n\n    A crucial property can be derived:\n    $f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$.\n    $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n    Therefore, $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means that $f$ commutes with the exponential function.\n\n4.  **Existence of Solutions and Their Cardinality**\n    *   **Existence**: The existence of such a function $f$, which is a \"half-iterate\" of the exponential function, is a non-trivial result. The German mathematician Hellmuth Kneser proved in 1949 the existence of a real analytic solution to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. A real analytic function is infinitely differentiable and thus continuous. Let's call one such solution $f_s(x)$.\n\n    *   **Constructing a Family of Solutions**: Let $f_s$ be one such solution. Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be any continuous, strictly increasing bijection that commutes with $\\exp(x)$, i.e., $\\phi(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(\\phi(x))$.\n    Consider the function $f(x) = (\\phi^{-1} \\circ f_s \\circ \\phi)(x)$. Let's check if it is a solution:\n    $f(f(x)) = (\\phi^{-1} \\circ f_s \\circ \\phi) \\circ (\\phi^{-1} \\circ f_s \\circ \\phi)(x)$\n    $= \\phi^{-1}(f_s(\\phi(\\phi^{-1}(f_s(\\phi(x))))))$\n    $= \\phi^{-1}(f_s(f_s(\\phi(x))))$\n    $= \\phi^{-1}(\\exp(\\phi(x)))$\n    Since $\\phi$ commutes with $\\exp$, $\\exp(\\phi(x)) = \\phi(\\exp(x))$.\n    $= \\phi^{-1}(\\phi(\\exp(x))) = \\exp(x)$.\n    So, any such function $f$ is also a solution. These functions are continuous and strictly increasing.\n\n    *   **Cardinality of Commuting Functions**: We need to find the cardinality of the set of such functions $\\phi$. A function $\\phi$ that commutes with $\\exp(x)$ is determined by its values on any interval of the form $[a, \\exp(a))$. Let's choose the interval $[1, e]$. For the function $\\phi$ to be continuous everywhere, its definition on $[1,e]$, say $\\psi(x)$, must satisfy the boundary condition $\\psi(e) = \\exp(\\psi(1))$.\n    We are free to choose the value $\\psi(1) = c$ for any real number $c$. This then fixes $\\psi(e) = e^c$. We can then define $\\psi(x)$ on $[1, e]$ as any continuous, strictly increasing function that connects the point $(1, c)$ to $(e, e^c)$.\n    There are uncountably many such functions. For example, for a fixed $c$, we can take a baseline linear function $L(x) = c + \\frac{e^c-c}{e-1}(x-1)$ and add a \"bump\" function like $A(x-1)(e-x)$ for a suitable range of constants $A$ that preserve monotonicity. The number of choices for the function $\\psi$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$. Each such choice defines a unique function $\\phi$. Thus, there are $c$ such functions $\\phi$.\n\n    *   **Cardinality of the Solution Set**: Each of these $c$ functions $\\phi$ can be used to generate a solution $f = \\phi^{-1} \\circ f_s \\circ \\phi$. It can be shown that distinct functions $\\phi$ lead to distinct solutions $f$. This means we have constructed a set of solutions of cardinality $c$.\n    The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $c$ (or $2^{\\aleph_0}$). Since we have found a set of solutions of cardinality $c$, and the total number of candidates cannot be larger, the cardinality of the set of solutions must be $c$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis shows that there are no decreasing solutions. Any solution must be strictly increasing. The existence of at least one solution is known. By using conjugation with the group of functions that commute with $\\exp(x)$, we can construct an entire family of solutions. The size of this family is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
