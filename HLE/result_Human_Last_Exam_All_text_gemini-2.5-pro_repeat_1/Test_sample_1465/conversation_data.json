    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Principles of Coiled-Coil Oligomerization**\n\nThe number of helices in a coiled-coil bundle (the oligomeric state) is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the core positions of the heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Heptad Repeat:** The sequence is a repeating pattern of 7 amino acids.\n*   **Hydrophobic Core:** Positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic residues (like I, L, V, A). The packing of these residues forms the stable core of the structure.\n*   **Register Identification:** The first step is to correctly identify the `a`, `d`, `e`, and `g` positions. In these designed sequences, the repeating `E...I...` pattern suggests a register where `E` is at a charged, solvent-exposed position (`g` or `e`) and the hydrophobic `I` is at a core position (`a` or `d`). The most consistent and chemically sound register is `g(E) a(I) b(c) d(e) f(g)`. This places `I` at the `a` position.\n\n**Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\n1.  **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   **Repeating Motif:** `EIAQALK` (with variations at position `c`).\n    *   **Register:** Following the `g(E)a(I)...` pattern, the register is `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(Q) d(A) e(L) f(K)`.\n    *   **Core Residues:** The `a` positions are all `I` (Isoleucine), and the `d` positions are all `A` (Alanine).\n    *   **Oligomer Rule:** An `a=I, d=A` core is a classic motif that strongly specifies a parallel **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n2.  **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   **Repeating Motif:** `EIAALK` (with a `KKE` insertion, a common feature called a 'stutter').\n    *   **Register:** `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(A) d(L) e(K) f(Q)`.\n    *   **Core Residues:** The `a` positions are `I` (Isoleucine), and the `d` positions are `L` (Leucine).\n    *   **Oligomer Rule:** An `a=I, d=L` core is the signature sequence of the GCN4 leucine zipper, which is the canonical parallel **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n3.  **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   **Repeating Motif:** `EIAAIK` (with insertions/substitutions).\n    *   **Register:** `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(A) d(I) e(K) ...`.\n    *   **Core Residues:** The `a` positions are `I` (Isoleucine), and the `d` positions are also `I` (Isoleucine).\n    *   **Oligomer Rule:** An `a=I, d=I` core strongly favors the formation of a parallel **trimer (3)**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The sequence contains a `W` (Tryptophan) substitution. In the most likely register, this bulky, hydrophobic residue is placed at a solvent-exposed position, which is highly destabilizing. In protein design, such a mutation can force a structural rearrangement to a higher-order, more open oligomer to better accommodate the residue. Therefore, it is plausible that the `I-I` trimer is forced into a **tetramer (4)**. This is a common type of \"trick\" in such questions.\n    *   **Oligomeric State: 4**\n\n4.  **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   **Repeating Motif:** `EIQKQLK` (with a `W` substitution).\n    *   **Register:** `g(E) a(I) b(Q) c(K) d(Q) e(L) f(K)`.\n    *   **Core Residues:** The `a` positions are `I` (Isoleucine), and the `d` positions are `Q` (Glutamine).\n    *   **Oligomer Rule:** This presents a conflict. `I` at the `a` position is a very strong determinant for a dimer. Placing the polar residue `Q` at the core `d` position is unusual. However, the dimeric preference from the `I` at `a` is typically dominant. The structure will likely form a **dimer (2)**, accommodating the polar `Q` residues in the core.\n    *   **Oligomeric State: 2**\n\n5.  **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   **Repeating Motif:** `EIAQTLK` (with variations).\n    *   **Register:** `g(E) a(I) b(A) c(Q) d(T) e(L) f(K)`.\n    *   **Core Residues:** The `a` positions are `I` (Isoleucine), and the `d` positions are `T` (Threonine).\n    *   **Oligomer Rule:** Again, there's a conflict: `I` at `a` prefers a dimer. However, a layer of the polar residue `T` at the `d` position is a classic, powerful motif that specifies a **trimer (3)**. The Threonine hydroxyl groups form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network within the core that is specific to the trimeric geometry. This trimer-specifying signal is stronger than the dimer signal from `I`.\n    *   **Oligomeric State: 3**\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer)\n*   Sequence 4: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 5: **3** (Trimer)\n\nThe resulting list of oligomeric states is 2, 2, 4, 2, 3. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
