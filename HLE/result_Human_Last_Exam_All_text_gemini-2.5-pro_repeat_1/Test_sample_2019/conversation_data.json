    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means row 1 is adjacent to row 5, and column 1 is adjacent to column 5. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(r, c)` where `r, c` are integers from 0 to 4. All arithmetic on coordinates will be modulo 5.\n*   **Queens:** We are placing 4 queens.\n*   **Non-attacking Condition:** Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` are attacking each other if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this means:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `r1 = r2`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `c1 = c2`\n    3.  **Main diagonal attack:** `r1 - c1 = r2 - c2 (mod 5)`\n    4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `r1 + c1 = r2 + c2 (mod 5)`\n\nA valid placement of 4 queens requires a set of 4 coordinates `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}` such that all 4 row numbers are distinct, all 4 column numbers are distinct, all 4 main diagonal indices (`r-c mod 5`) are distinct, and all 4 anti-diagonal indices (`r+c mod 5`) are distinct.\n\n### Step 2: Re-framing the Problem\n\nSince we are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, in any valid configuration, there will be:\n*   4 occupied rows and 1 unoccupied row. Let the unoccupied row be `R_u`.\n*   4 occupied columns and 1 unoccupied column. Let the unoccupied column be `C_u`.\n*   4 occupied main diagonals and 1 unoccupied main diagonal. Let the index of the unoccupied main diagonal be `D_u`.\n*   4 occupied anti-diagonals and 1 unoccupied anti-diagonal. Let the index of the unoccupied anti-diagonal be `S_u`.\n\nThe set of all possible row/column/diagonal indices is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. The sum of these indices is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10`, which is `0 (mod 5)`.\n\nLet the positions of the four queens be `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4`.\nThe sum of the occupied row numbers is `(10 - R_u)`.\nThe sum of the occupied column numbers is `(10 - C_u)`.\n\nThe diagonal indices are `d_i = r_i - c_i (mod 5)` and `s_i = r_i + c_i (mod 5)`. Summing over the 4 queens:\n*   `sum(d_i) = sum(r_i) - sum(c_i)`\n*   `sum(s_i) = sum(r_i) + sum(c_i)`\n\nThe sum of occupied diagonal indices is `(10 - D_u)` and `(10 - S_u)` respectively. Substituting these into the equations (and working modulo 5, where 10=0):\n*   `(0 - D_u) = (0 - R_u) - (0 - C_u)  =>  -D_u = -R_u + C_u  =>  D_u = R_u - C_u (mod 5)`\n*   `(0 - S_u) = (0 - R_u) + (0 - C_u)  =>  -S_u = -R_u - C_u  =>  S_u = R_u + C_u (mod 5)`\n\nThis shows that for any valid 4-queen placement, the indices of the unoccupied row, column, and diagonals are linked. Choosing the unoccupied row `R_u` and column `C_u` uniquely determines the unoccupied diagonals `D_u` and `S_u`.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Using Symmetries\n\nThis establishes a map from every valid 4-queen configuration to a pair `(R_u, C_u)`. There are `5 * 5 = 25` possible pairs for `(R_u, C_u)`. It is a known result in this area of combinatorics that for a prime-sized board `n`, this map is a bijection from the set of solutions to the set of pairs `(R_u, C_u)`, where each pair corresponds to a certain number of solutions. We can find the total number of solutions by finding how many correspond to one specific pair, say `(R_u, C_u) = (0, 0)`, and then multiply by 25.\n\nLet `k` be the number of solutions corresponding to a single pair `(R_u, C_u)`. The total number of solutions is `25 * k`. We can argue that `k` is constant for all pairs due to the translation symmetry of the torus. A solution `Q` for `(R_u, C_u)` can be translated by `(a,b)` to a solution `Q'` for `(R_u+a, C_u+b)`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Number of Solutions for a Specific Case\n\nLet's calculate `k`, the number of solutions for `(R_u, C_u) = (0, 0)`.\nThis choice implies `D_u = 0-0=0` and `S_u = 0+0=0`.\nThis means a solution must use:\n*   Rows `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n*   Columns `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n*   Main diagonals `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n*   Anti-diagonals `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n\nSince the rows and columns are fixed to `{1,2,3,4}`, any solution must be a permutation `p` of `{1,2,3,4}`, where the queens are at `(i, p(i))` for `i` in `{1,2,3,4}`. The constraints on the diagonals become:\n*   `i - p(i) (mod 5)` must take on the values `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This implies `i - p(i) != 0 (mod 5)`, which means `p(i) != i`. The permutation must be a derangement (have no fixed points).\n*   `i + p(i) (mod 5)` must take on the values `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. This implies `i + p(i) != 0 (mod 5)`, which means `p(i) != 5-i`.\n\nWe need to find all permutations `p` of `{1,2,3,4}` that satisfy these conditions. There are 9 derangements of 4 elements. Let's check them:\nThe derangements of `(1,2,3,4)` are:\n`(2,1,4,3), (2,3,4,1), (2,4,1,3), (3,1,4,2), (3,4,1,2), (3,4,2,1), (4,1,2,3), (4,3,1,2), (4,3,2,1)`\n\nLet's test them for the `p(i) != 5-i` condition:\n*   `p(1)!=4`, `p(2)!=3`, `p(3)!=2`, `p(4)!=1`.\n1.  `(2,3,4,1)`: Fails, `p(2)=3`.\n2.  `(3,4,2,1)`: Fails, `p(3)=2`.\n3.  `(4,1,2,3)`: Fails, `p(1)=4`.\n4.  `(4,3,1,2)`: Fails, `p(2)=3`.\n5.  `(4,3,2,1)`: Fails, `p(1)=4`.\n\nThis leaves 4 candidates: `(2,1,4,3)`, `(2,4,1,3)`, `(3,1,4,2)`, `(3,4,1,2)`. Now we check the full diagonal conditions.\n\n*   **Test `p = (2,1,4,3)`:** Queens at `(1,2), (2,1), (3,4), (4,3)`.\n    *   `r-c mod 5`: `1-2=4`, `2-1=1`, `3-4=4`, `4-3=1`. The values `{1,4}` are repeated. Fails.\n*   **Test `p = (2,4,1,3)`:** Queens at `(1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)`.\n    *   `r-c mod 5`: `1-2=4`, `2-4=3`, `3-1=2`, `4-3=1`. Values `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   `r+c mod 5`: `1+2=3`, `2+4=1`, `3+1=4`, `4+3=2`. Values `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   This is a valid solution.\n*   **Test `p = (3,1,4,2)`:** Queens at `(1,3), (2,1), (3,4), (4,2)`.\n    *   `r-c mod 5`: `1-3=3`, `2-1=1`, `3-4=4`, `4-2=2`. Values `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   `r+c mod 5`: `1+3=4`, `2+1=3`, `3+4=2`, `4+2=1`. Values `{1,2,3,4}`. OK.\n    *   This is another valid solution.\n*   **Test `p = (3,4,1,2)`:** Queens at `(1,3), (2,4), (3,1), (4,2)`.\n    *   `r-c mod 5`: `1-3=3`, `2-4=3`. The value `3` is repeated. Fails.\n\nSo, for the case `(R_u, C_u) = (0, 0)`, there are exactly `k=2` solutions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nSince there are 2 solutions for each of the 25 possible choices of `(R_u, C_u)`, the total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens is:\nTotal Ways = (Number of choices for `(R_u, C_u)`) × (Number of solutions per choice)\nTotal Ways = 25 × 2 = 50."
