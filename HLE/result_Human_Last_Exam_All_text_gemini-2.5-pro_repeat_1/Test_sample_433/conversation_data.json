    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **What is being asked?** The Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n*   **What is the container?** A single-dose container, specifically an **ampule**.\n*   **What is the action?** \"Puncture,\" which for an ampule means it has been opened by breaking its glass neck.\n*   **What is the environment?** A sterile environment, which implies an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC) like a laminar airflow workbench, as required by USP <797> standards.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Governing Standards**\nThe standards for sterile compounding in the United States are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically Chapter `<797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations`. We must refer to the rules within this chapter for handling single-dose containers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Nature of the Container (Ampule)**\n*   An ampule is a sealed glass container designed for a single use.\n*   To access the contents, the neck of the ampule is broken.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Once an ampule is opened, it **cannot be resealed**. It becomes an open system, fully exposed to the surrounding air. This is a critical distinction from a vial, which has a rubber stopper that can be resealed by its own elasticity after a needle puncture.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the USP <797> Rule for Ampules**\n*   USP <797> has very strict rules for opened ampules due to their inability to be resealed.\n*   The guidelines explicitly state that the contents of an opened ampule must be used **immediately**.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** \"Immediate use\" means the contents must be withdrawn and used right away as part of a single, continuous aseptic procedure. There is no permissible storage time.\n*   The standard also mandates that any unused portion of the medication from an opened ampule must be discarded. It cannot be saved for later use.\n\n**Step 5: Differentiate from Other Single-Dose Containers**\n*   **Careful Point 3:** It is crucial not to confuse the rule for an ampule with the rule for a single-dose *vial*.\n*   According to the 2022 USP <797> update, a single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) that has been punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture.\n*   This 12-hour rule **does not apply** to ampules because they cannot be resealed to protect against contamination after opening.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the official USP <797> standards, the sterile environment (ISO Class 5) protects the drug from contamination *during the transfer process*, but it does not grant a storage period or extended BUD to an opened, un-resealable ampule. The BUD is therefore \"immediate use.\"\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **Item:** Single-dose ampule.\n2.  **Action:** Opened in a sterile environment.\n3.  **Key Feature:** Cannot be resealed.\n4.  **USP <797> Rule:** Must be used immediately. Storage is not permitted.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The BUD for a single-dose ampule from the time of opening is immediate use. Any remaining contents must be discarded and cannot be stored.\n\n<<<According to USP <797> guidelines, once a single-dose ampule is opened, its contents must be used immediately. It cannot be stored for any period, even if opened in a sterile environment. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately after use."
