    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. It will act as the \"diene\" component in the reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This is an alkene (a molecule with a carbon-carbon double bond). The presence of electron-withdrawing halogen atoms (Cl and F) makes it electron-deficient, which is characteristic of a good \"dienophile\" (diene-loving) component.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a specific type of pericyclic reaction known as a [4+2] cycloaddition. It is a powerful method for forming six-membered rings.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Mechanism of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n1.  Three π (pi) bonds are broken: the two in butadiene and the one in 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n2.  Two new σ (sigma) bonds and one new π bond are formed.\n3.  The result is the formation of a six-membered ring, specifically a cyclohexene derivative.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Connectivity of the Product**\nLet's number the carbons of the reactants to trace where they end up in the product.\n*   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n*   Dienophile: CªCl₂=CᵇF₂\n\nThe reaction forms new sigma bonds between the ends of the diene system and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n*   A new sigma bond forms between C¹ of butadiene and one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., Cᵇ).\n*   A new sigma bond forms between C⁴ of butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile (Cª).\n*   The π bond between C¹ and C² and the π bond between C³ and C⁴ of the diene are consumed.\n*   A new π bond forms between C² and C³ of the original diene.\n*   The π bond between Cª and Cᵇ of the dienophile is consumed.\n\nThis results in a six-membered ring with the following connectivity: -C¹-C²=C³-C⁴-Cª-Cᵇ-, where Cᵇ is also bonded to C¹ to close the ring.\n\n**Step 4: Draw the Final Product Structure**\nBased on the connectivity determined above, we can draw the structure of the product.\n1.  Start with the cyclohexene ring skeleton.\n2.  The new double bond is between the carbons that were C² and C³ of butadiene.\n3.  The carbons that were C¹ and C⁴ of butadiene are now saturated (sp³-hybridized) CH₂ groups in the ring.\n4.  The carbons from the dienophile (Cª and Cᵇ) are also saturated and are adjacent to each other in the ring.\n5.  The substituents from the dienophile remain attached to their original carbons. So, one ring carbon is attached to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂), and the adjacent ring carbon is attached to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CH=CH\n     /     \\\n   CH₂       CH₂\n    |         |\n   CF₂ ----- CCl₂\n```\n*Note: Since the diene is symmetrical, it doesn't matter if the CCl₂ group adds to the C⁴ side and CF₂ to the C¹ side, or vice versa. The resulting molecule is identical.*\n\n**Step 5: Name the Product using IUPAC Nomenclature**\n1.  The parent hydrocarbon is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so it is a **cyclohexene**.\n2.  The double bond is given the lowest possible locants, so the carbons of the double bond are numbered 1 and 2.\n3.  We number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. We have two options for numbering (clockwise or counter-clockwise from the double bond).\n    *   **Option A:** Numbering gives the CCl₂ group position 4 and the CF₂ group position 5.\n    *   **Option B:** Numbering gives the CF₂ group position 4 and the CCl₂ group position 5.\n4.  In both cases, the set of locants for the substituents is {4,4,5,5}. Since there is a tie, we use alphabetical order to decide the numbering.\n5.  The substituent names are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n6.  Therefore, the chloro groups should be assigned the lower locant number (4). This corresponds to Option A.\n7.  The full name is constructed by listing the substituents alphabetically.\n\nThe final IUPAC name for the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Reaction Recognition:** The key is to recognize the classic diene/dienophile pairing for a Diels-Alder reaction.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This reaction has no regiochemical ambiguity because the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The carbons bearing the halogen substituents (C4 and C5) are not stereocenters because each has two identical groups (two Cl or two F). Thus, there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n*   **Nomenclature Rules:** Correctly applying IUPAC rules, especially the tie-breaking rule using alphabetical order, is crucial for arriving at the precise name.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
