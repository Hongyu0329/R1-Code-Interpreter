    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y). It is also known as a square lattice.\n*   **n-step walk:** A sequence of `n+1` points, starting from an origin p_0 = (0,0). Each point `p_{i+1}` in the sequence must be a direct neighbor of the previous point `p_i`. On a Manhattan lattice, a point (x, y) has four neighbors: (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).\n*   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk where all the points visited are distinct. The path never intersects or lands on itself.\n*   **a(n):** The total count of all possible n-step self-avoiding walks starting from the origin.\n\n**2. Calculating for Small `n`**\n\nLet's compute the first few values of `a(n)` to understand the process.\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    *   We start at (0,0). For the first step, there are 4 possible moves: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1).\n    *   All 4 of these 1-step walks are self-avoiding.\n    *   Therefore, **a(1) = 4**.\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    *   Let's take one of the 4 paths from n=1, for example, the walk to (1,0).\n    *   From (1,0), the neighbors are (2,0), (0,0), (1,1), and (1,-1).\n    *   To be self-avoiding, the walk cannot return to the origin (0,0).\n    *   This leaves 3 valid choices for the second step: (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n    *   By symmetry, each of the 4 initial paths has 3 valid extensions.\n    *   Total walks = (choices for step 1) * (choices for step 2) = 4 * 3 = 12.\n    *   Therefore, **a(2) = 12**.\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    *   Let's extend the 12 paths from n=2.\n    *   Consider a path like (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0). The endpoint is (2,0). The visited points are {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}. The neighbors of (2,0) are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The walk cannot go back to (1,0), leaving 3 choices.\n    *   Consider a path like (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1). The endpoint is (1,1). The visited points are {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)}. The neighbors of (1,1) are (1,0), (2,1), (0,1), (1,2). The walk cannot go back to (1,0), leaving 3 choices.\n    *   For any 2-step SAW, the third step has 3 valid options because the path is not long enough to form a loop and block off another potential move.\n    *   Total walks = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36.\n    *   Therefore, **a(3) = 36**.\n\n**3. Identifying the Complication (for n â‰¥ 4)**\n\nIt might seem like `a(n) = 4 * 3^(n-1)`. Let's test this for `a(4)`.\n\n*   Let's analyze the possible paths of length 3. One such path is (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n*   The set of visited points is {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)}.\n*   The endpoint is (0,1). Its neighbors are (0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), and (0,2).\n*   To be self-avoiding, the next step cannot be to a previously visited point. Here, both (0,0) and (1,1) are in the visited set.\n*   This leaves only **2** valid choices for the fourth step: (-1,1) and (0,2).\n*   Other 3-step paths, like the straight path (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0), still have 3 valid choices for the next step.\n*   Since the number of choices for the next step depends on the specific shape of the path, we cannot use a simple multiplicative formula. The problem requires careful enumeration.\n\n**4. Method for Finding a(10)**\n\n*   **Computational Complexity:** Calculating a(n) for larger `n` requires a computer algorithm, typically a backtracking (or depth-first search) approach, to enumerate all possible valid paths. This is a computationally intensive task.\n*   **Known Sequence:** This is a famous problem in combinatorics and statistical mechanics. The sequence for `a(n)` is well-known and documented in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\n**5. Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nWe will use the known, computed values for this sequence to find a(10).\n\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The definition of the lattice is critical. The result would be different for a triangular or hexagonal lattice.\n*   The starting point is fixed at the origin.\n*   The main difficulty arises when the path can form a \"trap\" by enclosing an area, reducing the number of available moves for the next step. This first happens for n=4.\n*   There is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). Its value is determined through exhaustive computational enumeration.\n\nBased on the established results for this sequence, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
