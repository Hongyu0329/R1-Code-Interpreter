    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character the protagonist marries in Jacek Dukaj's \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Character:** The protagonist of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant, post-human future.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Relationship:** Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a post-human being known as a \"phoebe.\" This character is central to his journey and their relationship forms the core emotional arc of the story.\n\n3.  **Determine the Name of the Partner:** The name of this phoebe, who becomes Adam's guide, protector, and eventual life partner, is Angelika.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel:** The term \"marriage\" is a simplification of their bond. In the novel's far-future context, relationships are not defined by traditional 21st-century ceremonies or legal contracts. The union between Adam and Angelika is a much deeper, more profound connection, involving a merging of consciousness and existence that transcends conventional partnership. However, in the narrative structure, she is unequivocally his partner and the character who fills the role of a wife.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Protagonist's Identity:** It's crucial to first correctly identify the main character as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **Context of the Union:** The question uses the simple word \"marries.\" While technically not a traditional marriage, the bond formed between Adam and Angelika is the narrative's equivalent, representing the ultimate partnership. The answer must reflect this functional role.\n*   **Correct Name:** The character's name is Angelika. It is sometimes written as Angelika Posedl, but Angelika is the primary name used.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the plot and characters, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a life-long, profound partnership that is the narrative equivalent of a marriage with the character named Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
