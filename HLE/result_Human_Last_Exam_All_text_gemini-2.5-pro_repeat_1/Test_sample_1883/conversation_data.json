    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of reaction and the system.**\nThe starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, an acyclic conjugated polyene. It undergoes a reaction under thermal conditions to form two isomeric cyclic products. This is an electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\nThe conjugated system is a tetraene, which has 4 double bonds and thus contains 4 × 2 = 8 π electrons. This is an 8π electron system.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory / Woodward-Hoffmann Rules.**\nAccording to FMO theory and the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the stereochemical outcome of an electrocyclic reaction depends on the number of π electrons and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\nFor a system with 4n π electrons (where n is an integer), the thermal reaction proceeds through a **conrotatory** motion of the termini.\nSince our system has 8π electrons (n=2, a 4n system), the ring closure under thermal conditions must be conrotatory.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stereochemistry of the starting material.**\nThe reacting termini are at carbons C2 and C9. The substituents on these carbons are a methyl group (from C1 and C10, respectively) and a hydrogen atom. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the geometry of the double bonds at the termini.\n*   **At C2:** The double bond is \\(2Z\\). In the reactive U-shaped or helical conformation, a substituent on a Z-double bond points towards the \"inside\" of the curve/helix. So, the methyl group at C2 is effectively \"in\".\n*   **At C9:** The double bond is \\(8E\\). A substituent on an E-double bond points \"outside\" of the curve/helix. So, the methyl group at C9 is effectively \"out\".\n\nWe have a system where one terminal methyl group is \"in\" and the other is \"out\".\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the two possible conrotatory pathways and their stereochemical outcomes.**\nConrotation means both termini rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\nThere is a general rule for predicting the outcome of conrotatory closures:\n*   (in, in) or (out, out) substituents end up **cis**.\n*   (in, out) substituents end up **trans**.\n\nIn our case, we have one methyl group \"in\" and one \"out\". Therefore, a conrotatory closure of the lowest-energy conformation of this molecule is predicted to give the **trans-isomer (B)**. Both possible conrotatory modes (all-clockwise or all-counter-clockwise) on this conformation lead to the trans product.\n\n**Step 5: Explain the formation of the minor product and predict the ratio.**\nThe problem states that two products are formed: \\(\\textit{cis}\\)-isomer A and \\(\\textit{trans}\\)-isomer B. Since the analysis of the most stable reactant conformation exclusively predicts the trans product B, the cis product A must be formed through a higher-energy pathway.\n\nThis introduces the concept of **torquoselectivity**, which is the preference for one conrotatory direction over the other based on steric factors in the transition state. The polyene chain is not planar but helical.\n*   The Z-substituent (Me at C2) is in a more sterically crowded \"axial-like\" position within the helix.\n*   The E-substituent (Me at C9) is in a less crowded \"equatorial-like\" position.\n\nThere are two diastereomeric transition states for conrotation starting from the same ground-state helical conformation:\n1.  **Favored Pathway:** Steric hindrance is minimized when the bulky axial-like Me(Z) group rotates \"outward\" (away from the helix interior) and the equatorial-like Me(E) group rotates \"inward\". This pathway has a lower activation energy and leads to the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n2.  **Disfavored Pathway:** The alternative conrotatory motion forces the bulky axial-like Me(Z) group \"inward\", causing a severe steric clash with the backbone of the helix. This pathway has a higher activation energy. It is this higher-energy transition state that leads to the **cis-isomer (A)**. (Note: While simple planar models predict trans for both pathways, a full analysis of the helical transition states shows that the two modes lead to different diastereomeric products).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the ratio.**\n*   The major product is formed via the lower-energy favored transition state. This is the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n*   The minor product is formed via the higher-energy disfavored transition state. This is the **cis-isomer (A)**.\n*   The energy difference between these two transition states (\\(\\Delta \\Delta G^\\ddagger\\)) is determined by the severity of the steric clash in the disfavored pathway (an axial-like group rotating inward). This clash is significant, leading to a large energy difference.\n*   A large \\(\\Delta \\Delta G^\\ddagger\\) means the reaction will be highly selective. A common selectivity for reactions with such clear steric control is approximately 9:1 in favor of the major product.\n*   Therefore, the ratio of B:A is predicted to be approximately 9:1.\n*   The question asks for the ratio of A and B, which is A:B. This ratio is **1:9**.\n\nAs a numerical value, the ratio A/B is 1/9.\n\n<<<1/9>>>"
