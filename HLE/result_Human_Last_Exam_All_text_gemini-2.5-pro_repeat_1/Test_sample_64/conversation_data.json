    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question about the pitch accent of 「弟」.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe question asks for the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」. Standard Japanese refers to the Tōkyō dialect (東京方言), which is the basis for the common language (共通語 - kyōtsūgo).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Word and its Pronunciation\n*   The kanji is 「弟」.\n*   The standard reading for \"younger brother\" is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Morae\nPitch accent in Japanese is based on morae (音拍 - onpaku), which are units of sound duration. Let's break down 「おとうと」 into its morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This is the long vowel part of とう (tō).\n4.  と (to)\nSo, 「おとうと」 is a four-mora word.\n\n### Step 4: Define the Pitch Accent Patterns\nThe answer choices are the main pitch accent patterns in standard Japanese:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles (like が, は, を). The accent number is [0].\n    *   Example: ねこ (neko, cat) -> ne(L) ko(H) ga(H) -> ねこが\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on all subsequent morae, including any following particles. The accent number is [1].\n    *   Example: はし (hashi, chopsticks) -> ha(H) shi(L) ga(L) -> はしが\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high for one or more morae, and then drops *within* the word. The following particles are low. The accent number is [2], [3], etc., depending on where the drop occurs.\n    *   Example: こころ (kokoro, heart) is Nakadaka [3] -> ko(L) ko(H) ro(L) ga(L) -> こころが\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the end of the word. It then drops on the following particle. The accent number is equal to the number of morae in the word.\n    *   Example: はな (hana, nose) is Odaka [2] -> ha(L) na(H) ga(L) -> はなが\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Accent Pattern for 「弟」 (otouto)\nAccording to standard Japanese accent dictionaries (like the NHK日本語発音アクセント新辞典), the pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is **[0]**.\n\nLet's apply the [0] pattern to the four-mora word 「おとうと」:\n*   The pitch starts low on the first mora: お (L)\n*   It rises on the second mora and stays high for the rest of the word: と(H)う(H)と(H)\n*   A following particle, like 「が」, also remains high: が(H)\n\nThe full pattern is: **お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(H)**\n\nThis pattern, where the pitch rises after the first mora and never drops, is the definition of the **Heiban (平板)** pattern.\n\n### Step 6: Match the Pattern to the Answer Choices\n*   The determined pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n*   Choice A is Heiban.\n*   Choices B, C, and D describe different, incorrect patterns.\n*   Choice E is incorrect because there is only one standard accent for this word.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
