    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Poem**\n'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (عقيدة العوام) is a didactic poem that summarizes the essentials of Islamic creed according to the Ash'ari school of thought. It is structured logically, moving from one article of faith to the next. The main sections cover:\n1.  The attributes of Allah (Necessary, Impossible, and Possible).\n2.  The attributes of the Prophets and Messengers (Necessary, Impossible, and Possible).\n3.  The names of the 25 Prophets and Messengers mentioned in the Qur'an.\n4.  Belief in the Angels, Revealed Books, the Last Day, and Divine Decree.\n5.  Information about the family of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs.\n\nOur focus is on the third section: the names of the 25 Prophets.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Section on Prophetology**\nBefore listing the names of the prophets, the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, first discusses their required attributes (truthfulness, trustworthiness, conveying the message, and intelligence). After this, he explicitly states that he will list the 25 prophets whose mention is binding upon every accountable person.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Preceding Verse that Sets the Context**\nThe verse immediately preceding the list of names is crucial for context. In most standard editions of the poem, this is **bayt 34**. It reads:\nتَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ  ***  كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n*Tafṣīlu khamsatin wa ‘ishrīna lazim, Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim*\n(The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding, upon every accountable person, so verify and take this opportunity).\n\nThis verse clearly indicates that the names which follow are the 25 prophets.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Starting Verse of the List**\nThe very next verse, **bayt 35**, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names, starting with Prophet Adam (عليه السلام). It reads:\nهُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ  ***  صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n*Hum Ādamun, Idrīsu, Nūḥun, Hūdun maʿ, Ṣāliḥin wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ*\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with, Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed).\n\nThis is the definitive start of the list.\n\n**Step 5: Follow the List to Identify the Ending Verse**\nThe list continues sequentially through the next couplets, naming the remaining prophets. The list concludes in **bayt 38**, which mentions the final prophets in the sequence, including Prophet 'Isa (Jesus) and ending with a reference to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). It reads:\nإِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى  ***  عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n*Ilyāsu, Yūnus, Zakariyyā, Yaḥyā, ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ghayyā*\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa and Taha [a name for Prophet Muhammad], the seal, so leave misguidance).\n\nThis verse completes the list of 25 prophets. The verses that follow move on to the topic of angels.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Range**\nBased on the analysis, the names of the prophets are mentioned starting from **bayt 35** and ending at **bayt 38**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering:** While the numbering from 1 to 57 is standard for this poem, minor variations can exist in different publications or manuscripts. However, the sequence and content of the verses remain consistent, and the range of 35-38 is the most widely accepted and recognized.\n2.  **The Preceding Verse (Bayt 34):** It's important to recognize that bayt 34 acts as an introduction to the list, explicitly stating the number of prophets to be named is 25.\n3.  **The Name \"Taha\" (طَهَ):** In the final verse of the list (bayt 38), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is referred to by the title \"Taha.\" This is a common reverential title for him, derived from the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n4.  **\"Bayt\" (بَيْت):** The term \"bayt\" in Arabic poetry refers to a full line or couplet, which consists of two halves (hemistichs). The question correctly uses this term.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Starting Point:** The list begins with Prophet Adam (عليه السلام) in bayt 35.\n*   **Ending Point:** The list concludes with Prophet 'Isa (عليه السلام) and the mention of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) as \"Taha\" in bayt 38.\n*   **Final Range:** The names are contained within the verses from 35 to 38, inclusive.\n\n<<<From bayt 35 to bayt 38.>>>"
