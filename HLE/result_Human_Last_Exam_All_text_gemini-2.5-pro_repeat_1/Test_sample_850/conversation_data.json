    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties\n\nFirst, let's define each condition in the context of the 32 crystallographic point groups (crystal classes).\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light is known as optical activity. This physical property is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). For the gyration tensor to have non-zero components, the crystal's point group **must not have a center of inversion (i)**. Such classes are called non-centrosymmetric. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** While non-centrosymmetry is a necessary condition, it is not quite sufficient. There are two non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, **$\\bar{6}$** and **$\\bar{6}$m2**, whose symmetry forces the gyration tensor to be identically zero. Therefore, \"having the correct symmetry for optical activity\" means being one of the 19 crystal classes for which the gyration tensor is non-zero.\n\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is achiral if it contains any **improper rotation axis ($S_n$)**. This includes a center of inversion ($i$ or $\\bar{1}$, which is $S_2$), a mirror plane ($m$, which is $S_1$), or other rotoinversion axes like $\\bar{4}$ or $\\bar{6}$. A class that is not achiral is chiral (it only contains proper rotation axes).\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The question requires the classes to be **achiral**, while the most commonly discussed examples of optical activity occur in chiral classes. This apparent contradiction points towards a more nuanced understanding of the symmetry requirements.\n\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is polar if it has a unique direction along which its properties are different in the positive and negative senses (e.g., pyroelectricity). Symmetry-wise, this corresponds to point groups with a unique polar axis. There are 10 polar crystal classes: **1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm**. A crystal class is **non-polar** if it is not one of these ten.\n    *   **Careful Point 3:** All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar. However, a class can be non-centrosymmetric and still be non-polar if it has other symmetry elements (like perpendicular two-fold axes) that prevent the formation of a net dipole moment.\n\n### Step 2: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will apply these three conditions sequentially to find the classes that satisfy all of them.\n\n**Filter 1: Apply the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" condition.**\n\nWe start with all 32 classes and eliminate those where the gyration tensor is zero.\n*   Eliminate the 11 centrosymmetric classes: $\\bar{1}$, 2/m, mmm, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}$m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 6/m, 6/mmm, m$\\bar{3}$, m$\\bar{3}$m.\n*   Eliminate the 2 special non-centrosymmetric classes: $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}$m2.\n\nThis leaves us with 19 candidate classes: {1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 3, 32, 3m, 4, $\\bar{4}$, 422, 4mm, $\\bar{4}$2m, 6, 622, 6mm, 23, 432, $\\bar{4}$3m}.\n\n**Filter 2: Apply the \"non-polar\" condition.**\n\nFrom the list of 19 candidates, we must remove all the polar classes.\n*   The 10 polar classes are: {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n\nRemoving these leaves a list of 9 classes that are non-polar and allow for optical activity:\n{222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, $\\bar{4}$3m}.\n\n**Filter 3: Apply the \"achiral\" condition.**\n\nFrom the remaining 9 classes, we must select only those that are achiral (i.e., possess an improper rotation axis).\n*   The classes {222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432} contain only proper rotation axes. They are the enantiomorphic, or **chiral**, classes. We must eliminate these.\n*   The remaining classes are:\n    *   **$\\bar{4}$**: Contains a four-fold rotoinversion axis. It is **achiral**.\n    *   **$\\bar{4}$2m**: Contains a $\\bar{4}$ axis and mirror planes. It is **achiral**.\n    *   **$\\bar{4}$3m**: Contains $\\bar{4}$ axes and mirror planes. It is **achiral**.\n\nThis leaves us with our final set of crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity (i.e., have a non-zero gyration tensor) are:\n$\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, and $\\bar{4}$3m.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}$2m, and $\\bar{4}$3m.>>>"
