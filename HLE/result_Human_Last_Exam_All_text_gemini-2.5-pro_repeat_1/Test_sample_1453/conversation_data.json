    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Pattern:** The first step is to recognize the characteristic repeating pattern of a coiled-coil, which is the heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. In this pattern, the residues at positions `a` and `d` are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, mediating the packing of the helices. The residues at positions `e` and `g` are often charged or polar and are involved in electrostatic interactions.\n\n2.  **Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence:** We need to find the correct \"phasing\" of the heptad repeat on the given sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`. A good strategy is to look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that could occupy the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test a few possible start points for the repeat.\n\n    *   If we start the repeat at the first `G` (position `a`), the `a` positions would be `G, K, K, K, K` and the `d` positions would be `A, A, A, A`. This is unlikely, as the core `a` positions are filled with charged Lysine (K) residues.\n    *   Let's try a different phasing. A very common pattern in coiled-coils involves Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), or Valine (V) at the core positions. Let's try to align the sequence so that `I` is at position `a`.\n    *   Sequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n    *   Phasing: `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Residues at Core Positions (`a` and `d`):** With this new phasing, let's identify the residues at each position of the heptad repeat.\n\n    *   **Position `a`:** I, I, I, I (All Isoleucine)\n    *   **Position `d`:** L, L, L, L (All Leucine)\n    *   **Position `e`:** E, E, E, E (All Glutamate)\n    *   **Position `g`:** G, K, K, K (Glycine and Lysine)\n\n    This phasing is highly plausible. The core `a` and `d` positions are consistently occupied by the large hydrophobic residues Isoleucine and Leucine. The solvent-exposed `e` and `g` positions are occupied by charged (E, K) and polar residues, which can form stabilizing salt bridges between helices.\n\n4.  **Apply Knobs-into-Holes Packing Principles:** The specific identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state due to packing efficiency and steric constraints (the \"knobs-into-holes\" model).\n\n    *   **Isoleucine (I)** is a β-branched amino acid (the side chain branches at the second carbon, Cβ).\n    *   **Leucine (L)** is not β-branched (the side chain branches at the third carbon, Cγ).\n\n    This difference is critical for how they pack in the core.\n\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a dimer, the `a` position of one helix packs against the `d` position of the other. This arrangement is relatively tolerant of different hydrophobic residues. While `I` at `a` and `L` at `d` can form a dimer, it is not as strong a predictor as it is for other states.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** In a parallel trimer, the `a` positions from all three helices pack against each other (`a-a'-a''`), and the `d` positions also pack against each other (`d-d'-d''`). This creates two distinct hydrophobic \"layers\". The packing at the `a` layer is tighter than at the `d` layer. This geometry strongly favors having a β-branched residue like **Isoleucine at the `a` position** and a non-β-branched residue like **Leucine at the `d` position**. The shape of Isoleucine fits perfectly into the `a` position pocket, while Leucine packs efficiently at the `d` position. The pattern found in the sequence (`a`=I, `d`=L) is the canonical signature for a trimeric coiled-coil.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** In a tetramer, the packing is even more constrained. Having a bulky, β-branched residue like Isoleucine at the `a` position generally leads to significant steric clashes and is highly unfavorable. Tetramers typically prefer smaller residues (like Alanine) at one core position and larger ones (like Leucine) at the other.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sequence consistently places Isoleucine (a β-branched amino acid) at the `a` position and Leucine (a non-β-branched amino acid) at the `d` position. This specific arrangement maximizes packing efficiency and minimizes steric hindrance for a three-helix bundle. It is the classic and most stable pattern for a **trimeric** coiled-coil.\n\n<<<B>>>"
