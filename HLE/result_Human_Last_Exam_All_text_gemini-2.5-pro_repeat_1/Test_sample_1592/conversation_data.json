    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe goal is to identify which Canadian province or territory has a border point that is closest to the community of Waskaganish. We must exclude Quebec, as Waskaganish is located within it.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Waskaganish**\nWaskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. Geographically, it sits on the southern shore of the Rupert River, very close to where it empties into Rupert Bay, an arm of James Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nWe need to consider the provinces and territories that border Quebec. Looking at a map of Canada, these are:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west and southwest of Waskaganish.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands in James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Proximity to Each Candidate**\nNow, let's assess the distance from Waskaganish to the border of each of these candidates.\n\n*   **New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador:** Waskaganish is in the far west of Quebec. Both New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador are located hundreds of kilometers to the southeast and east, respectively. They are clearly not the closest.\n\n*   **Nunavut:** The closest parts of Nunavut to Waskaganish are the islands within James Bay, such as Akimiski Island and the Twin Islands. These islands lie to the north and northwest of Waskaganish, across a significant expanse of water. The distance from Waskaganish to the nearest of these islands (e.g., South Twin Island) is over 150 kilometers.\n\n*   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario, south of James Bay, is a straight line that runs due north along the 79°31′ W longitude line until it reaches the bay's southern shore. Waskaganish is located at approximately 78°46′ W longitude. This means the land border with the province of Ontario is located a relatively short distance directly to the west of Waskaganish. The distance from the community to this provincial land border is only about 50-60 kilometers.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\n*   Distance to Ontario border: Approximately 50-60 km (overland).\n*   Distance to Nunavut border (islands in James Bay): Over 150 km (across water).\n*   Distance to other provinces: Several hundred kilometers.\n\nComparing these distances, the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the territorial border of Nunavut or any other province.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
