    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity\" that Fernand Braudel discusses. Key pieces of information provided are:\n    *   The discussion is framed by Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n    *   Braudel quotes another author, Paul Morand.\n    *   Morand's assertion is that this entity should be \"inscribed within a sphere,\" meaning it must be understood in a global context.\n    *   An *example* of this entity is \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Key Figures and Concepts:**\n    *   **Fernand Braudel:** A prominent historian of the Annales School, famous for his work on large-scale historical structures, particularly the *longue dur√©e* (the long term). His most famous works, like *Civilization and Capitalism* and *A History of Civilizations*, focus on vast, interconnected systems that transcend national boundaries. His primary unit of analysis is often the \"civilization\" or the \"world-economy.\"\n    *   **\"Inscribed within a sphere\":** This is a metaphor for placing a concept into a global context. The \"sphere\" represents the globe. The idea is that no entity can be understood in isolation; it must be seen in its relationship with the rest of the world.\n    *   **\"Exemplified by the symbol of a nation\":** This is a crucial point. The nation is not the entity itself, but an *example* or a specific case of it. The question asks for the broader category that Braudel is analyzing.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Reason:**\n    *   Braudel's historical method is to look beyond the history of individual nations. He is interested in the larger structures within which nations exist.\n    *   The quote from Paul Morand originally referred to a \"nation.\" However, Braudel uses this quote to illustrate a broader point about his own primary subject of study.\n    *   If a nation, a relatively self-contained unit, must be understood globally, then it follows that the larger entities Braudel studies must also be understood globally.\n    *   The question is, what is this larger entity? Given Braudel's body of work, the most logical candidate is **civilization**. He consistently argued that civilizations are not isolated monoliths but are shaped by continuous interaction, borrowing, and conflict with other civilizations.\n    *   To confirm this, we can locate the source of the quote. It appears in the preface to Braudel's book *A History of Civilizations* (*Grammaire des civilisations*). In this preface, Braudel is defining his subject matter and methodology. He uses Morand's statement about the nation to make his central argument: that the study of any **civilization** requires a global perspective, seeing it \"inscribed within a sphere.\" He explicitly states that a nation can be identified with a civilization and that, \"like any civilization, it must be seen in the context of the globe.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The distinction between the example and the entity:** The question is carefully worded to distinguish between the entity itself and the example used to illustrate it (the nation). The answer is the broader concept Braudel is defining.\n*   **The context of Braudel's work:** Understanding Braudel's overall historical project (studying long-term structures, world-economies, and civilizations) is key to interpreting his use of the quote.\n*   **The meaning of the metaphor:** \"Inscribed within a sphere\" is central. It directly points to the theme of global history and interconnectedness, a hallmark of Braudel's approach.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing Braudel's intellectual project and the specific context in which he uses Morand's quote, it becomes clear that he is using the idea of a nation needing global context as an analogy to support his main thesis about the need to study **civilization** from a global perspective. Therefore, the conceptual entity in question is civilization.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
