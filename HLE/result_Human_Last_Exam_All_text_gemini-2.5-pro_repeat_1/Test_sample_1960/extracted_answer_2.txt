*   **Function f:**
    Let `A` be the formula `1 ⊸ ⊥`. The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the formula `f(w)` defined as:
    `f(w) = A^{\otimes w}`, where `A^{\otimes w}` is the tensor product of `w` copies of `A`, and `f(0) = 1`.

*   **Formula C:**
    Let `A` be the formula `1 ⊸ ⊥`. The formula `C(W, m, b)` is defined as:
    `C(W, m, b) = (A^{\otimes b})^{\otimes m}`, which is the tensor product of `m` copies of the formula `A^{\otimes b}`.
