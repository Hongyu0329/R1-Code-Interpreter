    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Theoretical Framework and Physical System**\n\nThe question asks for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the framework of the Renormalization Group (RG) theory, using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. The specific heat $C$ is expected to diverge near the critical temperature $T_c$ as $C \\propto |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. The system has a spatial dimension of $d=3$. Although not specified, such questions typically refer to the simplest and most common universality class, the Ising model, which has an order parameter with a single component (N=1). The general O(N) model framework will be used initially.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$) and the Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$)**\n\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative technique performed around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. Above this dimension, mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents. For the O(N) model (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\nThe expansion parameter $\\epsilon$ is defined as the deviation from this critical dimension:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n\nFor the given spatial dimension $d=3$, the parameter is:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n**Step 3: Utilize Scaling Relations**\n\nThe critical exponents are not independent but are connected by scaling relations. The calculation of $\\alpha$ is greatly simplified by using the hyperscaling relation, which connects $\\alpha$, the spatial dimension $d$, and the correlation length exponent $\\nu$:\n$2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n\nThis relation is a fundamental result of RG theory, valid for $d < d_c$. We can rearrange it to find $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n**Step 4: Find the Correlation Length Exponent $\\nu$ from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\n\nThe next step is to find the expression for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ as a series in $\\epsilon$. The standard one-loop RG calculation for the O(N) model yields:\n$\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nHere, $N$ is the number of components of the order parameter. The term $1/2$ is the mean-field value for $\\nu$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Specific Heat Exponent $\\alpha$**\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the one-loop result for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. We only need to keep terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$.\n\n$\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right)$\n\nExpanding the product:\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{N+2}{4(N+8)}\\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n$\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{N+2}{N+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n$\\alpha = - \\left( \\frac{N+2}{N+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{N+2}{N+8} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nBringing the terms in the parenthesis to a common denominator:\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{N+8 - 2(N+2)}{2(N+8)} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{N+8 - 2N - 4}{2(N+8)} \\right) \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-N}{2(N+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 6: Obtain the Final Answer for d=3**\n\nAs discussed in Step 1, we assume the Ising universality class, where $N=1$. Substituting $N=1$ into the general expression for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{3}{18}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\nFinally, we substitute the value $\\epsilon = 1$ (for $d=3$) into this first-order result:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Universality Class Assumption:** The final numerical answer depends on the number of order parameter components, N. We have assumed N=1 (Ising model), which is the standard choice for such a general question. The result would be different for other models (e.g., N=2 for the XY model).\n2.  **Nature of the $\\epsilon$-Expansion:** The expansion is formally derived for infinitesimally small $\\epsilon$. Using it for $\\epsilon = 1$ is an approximation. While this is a standard procedure to get an estimate for 3D systems, the result is not exact. Higher-order corrections are known and would modify the value.\n3.  **Leading-Order Calculation:** The calculation presented is to the first order (one-loop) in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. This is typically what is meant when an \"$\\epsilon$-expansion result\" is requested without further specification.\n4.  **Use of Hyperscaling:** The use of the hyperscaling relation $2-\\alpha=d\\nu$ is a valid and crucial shortcut. This relation is a key success of the RG theory, as it is violated by mean-field theory for $d > d_c$.\n5.  **Mean-Field Limit:** In the mean-field limit ($\\epsilon \\to 0$), our formula gives $\\alpha \\to 0$. This is correct, as mean-field theory predicts a finite jump in the specific heat, not a power-law divergence, which corresponds to $\\alpha=0$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
