    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given system of equations.**\nThe problem provides a system of four linear ordinary differential equations, known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman system (or master equation), for the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3}.\nThe equations are:\n1.  $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n2.  $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n3.  $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n4.  $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n\nWe are also given the normalization condition, which states that the sum of probabilities must be 1 for all time $t$:\n5.  $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which represents the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n**Step 2: Check for consistency and identify potential issues.**\nA critical property of such a system is that the total probability must be conserved. If we differentiate the normalization condition (5) with respect to time $t$, we get:\n$P_{0}'(t) + P_{1}'(t) + P_{2}'(t) + P_{3}'(t) = 0$\n\nLet's sum the given differential equations (1) to (4):\nSum = $[-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}]$\n    + $[-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}]$\n    + $[\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}]$\n    + $[\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}]$\n\nCombining terms for each $P_i(t)$:\nFor $P_0$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\nFor $P_1$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\nFor $P_2$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\nFor $P_3$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n\nSo, the sum of the derivatives is $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\nFor the system to be consistent with the normalization condition, we must have $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) = 0$. Since $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this implies $P_0(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This would lead to a trivial solution where all probabilities are zero at steady state, contradicting the normalization.\nThis strongly suggests a typo in the second equation. In a standard Kolmogorov system, the flow from state $j$ to state $i$ contributes a positive term $\\lambda_{ji}P_j(t)$ to the equation for $P_i'(t)$. The term for flow from state 0 to state 1 in the equation for $P_1'(t)$ should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, not $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. We will proceed by correcting this typo.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the steady-state equations.**\nAssuming the corrected second equation is $P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$, the sum of the derivatives is now 0, which is consistent.\nTo find the steady-state probabilities $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, we set the time derivatives to zero, $P_i'(t) = 0$.\nThe system of algebraic equations is:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of linear equations.**\nWe will express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$ using equations (1), (3), and (4).\nThe given parameter values are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}p_0 = \\lambda_{10}p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_2 = \\lambda_{12}p_1 \\implies p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008} p_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} p_1 = p_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$\\lambda_{31}p_3 = \\lambda_{23}p_2 \\implies p_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_2 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} p_2 = p_2$.\nSince $p_2 = p_1$, we have $p_3 = p_1$.\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1\\right) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}\\right) = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\nThe question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\nWe know $p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$.\nSo, $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1\\right) p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}\\right) p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} p_1$.\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for $p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\times \\left(\\frac{0.019}{0.707}\\right)$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we perform the division:\n$p_0 + p_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of decimal places, we get 0.9463."
