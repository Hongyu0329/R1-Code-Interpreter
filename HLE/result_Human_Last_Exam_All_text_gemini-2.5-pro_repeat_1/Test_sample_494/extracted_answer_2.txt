Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic hydrogens would still exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon is a result of the molecule's potential energy surface, which is unchanged. The nuclear spin statistics only impose symmetry constraints that determine which rotational states are allowed, but they do not eliminate the tunneling itself.
