    "An analysis of the question follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the size (number of elements) of the smallest algebraic structure needed for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot.\n\n2.  **Define \"Knot Coloring\":** In knot theory, the most common type of coloring is **Fox n-coloring**.\n    *   Each arc in a knot diagram is assigned a \"color\", which is an integer from the set {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}.\n    *   At each crossing, the colors of the three meeting arcs must satisfy a specific rule. If the two under-arcs have colors `a` and `b`, and the over-arc has color `c`, the rule is `a + b ≡ 2c (mod n)`.\n    *   A coloring is considered \"trivial\" if all arcs have the same color. A knot is \"n-colorable\" if it admits a non-trivial coloring with `n` colors.\n\n3.  **Identify the Algebraic Structure:** The set of colors {0, 1, ..., n-1} combined with the arithmetic operations modulo `n` (addition and multiplication by 2) forms the algebraic structure. This structure is the ring of integers modulo n, denoted as `Z_n`. More abstractly, it's a specific type of quandle known as an affine quandle. The size of this structure is `n`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Condition for n-Colorability:** For a given knot, the coloring rules for all crossings form a system of linear homogeneous equations over `Z_n`. A non-trivial coloring exists if and only if this system of equations has a non-trivial solution. This condition is met if and only if the **determinant of the knot** is not coprime to `n`.\n    *   Mathematically, a knot K is n-colorable if and only if `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`, where `det(K)` is the absolute value of the determinant of the knot's coloring matrix.\n\n5.  **Identify the Knot and Find its Determinant:**\n    *   The knot in question is the **figure-eight knot**, also known as knot 4_1.\n    *   To find its determinant, we can draw a diagram, label the four arcs (let's say `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, `x₄`), and write down the coloring equation for each of the four crossings. This results in a 4x4 matrix of coefficients, often called the coloring matrix.\n    *   A standard coloring matrix for the figure-eight knot (after removing one redundant equation) is:\n        ```\n        | -2   1   1 |\n        |  0  -2   1 |\n        |  1   0  -2 |\n        ```\n    *   The determinant of this matrix needs to be calculated:\n        det = -2 * ((-2)*(-2) - 1*0) - 1 * (0*(-2) - 1*1) + 1 * (0*0 - (-2)*1)\n        det = -2 * (4) - 1 * (-1) + 1 * (2)\n        det = -8 + 1 + 2 = -5\n    *   The determinant of the knot, `det(K)`, is the absolute value of this number, so `det(4₁) = |-5| = 5`.\n\n6.  **Find the Smallest `n`:** We are looking for the smallest integer `n > 1` that satisfies the condition `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`.\n    *   `det(K) = 5`.\n    *   We need to find the smallest `n > 1` such that `gcd(5, n) > 1`.\n    *   Let's test values of `n` starting from 2:\n        *   `n = 2`: `gcd(5, 2) = 1`. Not 2-colorable.\n        *   `n = 3`: `gcd(5, 3) = 1`. Not 3-colorable.\n        *   `n = 4`: `gcd(5, 4) = 1`. Not 4-colorable.\n        *   `n = 5`: `gcd(5, 5) = 5`. Since `5 > 1`, the knot is 5-colorable.\n    *   The smallest integer `n > 1` that works is 5.\n\n7.  **State the Final Answer:** The smallest value for `n` is 5. This means the smallest algebraic structure (`Z₅`) that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot has 5 elements.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Knot Determinant:** The most crucial step is correctly calculating the knot determinant. An incorrect value would lead to the wrong answer. The determinant of the figure-eight knot is a standard result in knot theory and is confirmed to be 5.\n*   **Understanding \"Colorable\":** It's important to distinguish between the existence of *any* coloring (the trivial one always exists) and a *non-trivial* coloring. The condition `gcd(det(K), n) > 1` is specifically for the existence of non-trivial colorings.\n*   **\"Smallest Algebraic Structure\":** This phrase directly corresponds to finding the smallest `n` for Fox n-coloring, as this is the most fundamental coloring structure.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` for which the figure-eight knot is n-colorable is 5. The corresponding algebraic structure, `Z₅` (the integers modulo 5), contains 5 elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
