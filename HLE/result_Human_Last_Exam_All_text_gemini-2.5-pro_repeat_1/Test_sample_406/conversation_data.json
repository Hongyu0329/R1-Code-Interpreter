    "The question asks for the conditions that guarantee the existence of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" for a system of three functions F, G, and H. This is a concept in the mathematical field of fixed-point theory, which provides tools to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to various types of equations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the conditions required.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Problem and Correcting Notation**\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear definition of the problem. The question specifies the functions as `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Typo in Functions):** There is likely a typo in the function definitions provided. Using the same name `G` for two functions with different domains and codomains is ambiguous. Standard literature on this topic uses three distinct functions, typically denoted F, G, and H.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Function Signatures):** The argument structures `Y*X*Y` and `Z*Y*X` are slightly unusual. A more common and symmetric formulation in the study of tripled fixed points involves permutations of the variables `(x, y, z)`.\n\nBased on established mathematical conventions, we will analyze the problem using the following standard setup:\n\n*   **Spaces:** Three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n*   **Functions:** Three mappings:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Z → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × X × Y → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** A point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, z) = y`\n    *   `H(z, x, y) = z`\n\n### **Step 2: Identifying the Core Conditions**\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are given by a generalization of the celebrated **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**. These conditions relate to the properties of the spaces (X, Y, Z) and the behavior of the functions (F, G, H).\n\n**Condition 1: The Structure of the Spaces**\n\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n*   **Metric Space:** A set equipped with a \"distance function\" (or metric) `d` that measures the distance between any two elements. For our sets, we have metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n*   **Complete:** A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points has a limit that is also in the space. Informally, this means the space has no \"holes\" or \"missing points\". The set of real numbers (`ℝ`) is a classic example of a complete metric space.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Completeness is Crucial):** Completeness is essential because the proof of existence involves constructing a sequence and showing that it converges to a point. Without completeness, the sequence might converge to a \"hole\" outside the space, and a fixed point would not be guaranteed to exist within the space.\n\n**Condition 2: The Contractive Nature of the Functions**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a **joint contractive condition**. This condition ensures that applying the functions brings points closer together.\n\n*   Formally, there must exist three non-negative constants `α, β, γ` such that their sum is strictly less than 1 (i.e., **`α + β + γ < 1`**), and for any two points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following three inequalities must hold:\n\n    1.  `d_X( F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w) )  ≤  α * d_X(x, u) + β * d_Y(y, v) + γ * d_Z(z, w)`\n\n    2.  `d_Y( G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w) )  ≤  α * d_Y(y, v) + β * d_X(x, u) + γ * d_Z(z, w)`\n\n    3.  `d_Z( H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v) )  ≤  α * d_Z(z, w) + β * d_X(x, u) + γ * d_Y(y, v)`\n\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Structure of the Inequality):** Notice the careful matching of terms. In the inequality for `G`, whose arguments are `(y, x, z)`, the term `d_Y(y, v)` is multiplied by `α`, `d_X(x, u)` by `β`, and `d_Z(z, w)` by `γ`. This structure is symmetric with the inequality for `F`. The condition `α + β + γ < 1` is the key that guarantees convergence.\n\n### **Step 3: The Resulting Existence and Uniqueness Theorem**\n\nWhen the above conditions are met, we can state a powerful theorem.\n\n**Theorem:** Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. If the mappings `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy the joint contractive condition (Condition 2) for some non-negative constants `α, β, γ` with `α + β + γ < 1`, then:\n1.  There exists **one and only one** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x*, y*, z*) ∈ X × Y × Z`.\n2.  This fixed point can be found by starting with any initial point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)` and iterating the sequence:\n    *   `x_{n+1} = F(x_n, y_n, z_n)`\n    *   `y_{n+1} = G(y_n, x_n, z_n)`\n    *   `z_{n+1} = H(z_n, x_n, y_n)`\n    The sequence `(x_n, y_n, z_n)` will converge to `(x*, y*, z*)`.\n\n### **Final Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is not guaranteed in general. It requires a specific mathematical setting (completeness) and a strong property of the functions (contraction). The core idea is to transform the system of three equations into a single fixed-point problem on the product space `X × Y × Z` and then apply the logic of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The joint contractive condition is precisely what is needed to prove that the combined operator is a contraction, which is the engine of the proof.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions `F: X×Y×Z→X`, `G: Y×X×Z→Y`, and `H: Z×X×Y→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces, each with its own distance metric (`d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z`).\n2.  **Joint Contractive Condition:** There must exist non-negative constants `α`, `β`, `γ` such that their sum `α + β + γ < 1`, and for all `x,u ∈ X`, `y,v ∈ Y`, `z,w ∈ Z`, the following three inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X( F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w) ) ≤ α⋅d_X(x, u) + β⋅d_Y(y, v) + γ⋅d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   `d_Y( G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w) ) ≤ α⋅d_Y(y, v) + β⋅d_X(x, u) + γ⋅d_Z(z, w)`\n    *   `d_Z( H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v) ) ≤ α⋅d_Z(z, w) + β⋅d_X(x, u) + γ⋅d_Y(y, v)`>>>"
