    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Concepts**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements $x, y$ have a least upper bound, also called a join, denoted $x \\vee y$. We can view this poset as a category where objects are the elements of $J$ and there is a unique morphism from $x$ to $y$ if and only if $x \\le y$. The existence of a join means that any two objects in this category have a coproduct.\n    *   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\le j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects the structure of the poset (composition and identity). These functors are the objects of the category of representations, denoted $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$. This category is an abelian category.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: In representation theory, algebras and posets are classified into finite, tame, and wild representation types. A poset is of tame type if its indecomposable representations can be classified and occur in a finite number of one-parameter families. A \"tame functor\" is an indecomposable representation of a poset $J$ which is of tame representation type.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable**: An object $M$ in an abelian category is called $n$-resolvable if there exists a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there is an exact sequence of the form:\n        $$P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$$\n        where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category. This condition is equivalent to stating that the projective dimension of $M$, denoted $\\text{pd}(M)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n\n2.  **Rephrasing the Question**\n    The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that any tame functor $f$ has a projective dimension $\\text{pd}(f) \\le n$. This value $n$ would be the supremum of the projective dimensions over all tame functors for any upper semilattice $J$ of tame type. A good way to find such a bound is to determine the global dimension of the entire category $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$. The global dimension, $\\text{gl.dim}(\\text{Rep}(J, K))$, is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects in the category.\n\n3.  **Connecting Homological Dimension to the Structure of $J$**\n    There is a fundamental result in the representation theory of posets that connects the structure of the poset $J$ to the global dimension of the category $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$.\n    *   **Key Theorem**: For a poset $J$, the global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$ is at most 1 if for every pair of elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$ that have a common upper bound, their join $j_1 \\vee j_2$ exists.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to the Upper Semilattice $J$**\n    The definition of an upper semilattice is that for *any* two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their join $j_1 \\vee j_2$ exists. This condition is stronger than the one required by the theorem. Therefore, if $J$ is an upper semilattice, the condition of the theorem is satisfied.\n    *   **Conclusion**: For any upper semilattice $J$, the global dimension of the category $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$ is at most 1.\n    *   This means that for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension satisfies $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the \"Tame\" Condition and Determining the Value of $n$**\n    *   Since every functor in the category has a projective dimension of at most 1, this must also be true for the subset of functors that are \"tame\". Thus, a tame functor $f$ is guaranteed to be 1-resolvable. So, we know that $n=1$ is a valid answer.\n    *   The question is now whether $n$ could be smaller, i.e., can we say $n=0$?\n    *   An object is 0-resolvable if and only if it is projective. The question then becomes: are all tame functors projective?\n    *   A poset $J$ being of tame representation type implies it has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. These representations are typically partitioned into preprojective, preinjective, and regular representations. The regular representations form the \"tame\" part of the theory and are generally not projective (or injective).\n    *   For example, if $J$ is the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ with the usual order (which is an upper semilattice of tame type), the indecomposable \"interval\" representations are not projective.\n    *   Therefore, not all tame functors are projective. This means there exist tame functors with projective dimension equal to 1.\n    *   So, $n=0$ is not a sufficient answer. The smallest integer $n$ that works for all cases is $n=1$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The category of representations of an upper semilattice $J$, denoted $\\text{Rep}(J, K)$, has a global dimension of at most 1. This is a standard result from the homological theory of posets.\n2.  The global dimension is the maximum projective dimension of any object in the category. Thus, any functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ has a projective dimension $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.\n3.  An object is $n$-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most $n$. Therefore, any functor $f$ is 1-resolvable.\n4.  This applies to all functors, so it certainly applies to the specific class of \"tame\" functors.\n5.  To show that $n=1$ is the lowest possible value, we must show that there exists at least one tame functor that is not 0-resolvable (i.e., not projective). Posets of tame type, by their nature, possess non-projective indecomposable representations (the regular modules).\n6.  Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which any tame functor is $n$-resolvable is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
