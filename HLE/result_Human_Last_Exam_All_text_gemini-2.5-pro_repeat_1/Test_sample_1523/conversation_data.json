    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Context and the Objects**\n\nThe problem is set within the framework of finite-temperature quantum field theory, specifically using the imaginary-time (or Matsubara) formalism. In this formalism, the partition function $Z$ for a field $\\phi$ is given by a functional integral over all field configurations:\n\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** For a free, neutral scalar field $\\phi$ with mass $m$, the action is defined in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate $\\tau$ is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$ (where $T$ is the temperature).\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n    Here, $\\mu$ runs over Euclidean spacetime dimensions $(\\tau, \\vec{x})$, so $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla \\phi)^2$.\n\n*   **The Inner Product:** The notation $(\\phi, \\psi)$ refers to the standard $L^2$ inner product on the space of real-valued functions over Euclidean spacetime:\n    $(\\phi, \\psi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n*   **The Operator $D$ (from $D_\\phi$):** The operator $D$ is defined by rewriting the quadratic action in the form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$. We can achieve this by performing an integration by parts on the kinetic term of the action:\n    $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi) = - \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\phi) = - \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi (\\partial^2 \\phi)$\n    (The boundary terms vanish due to the periodic boundary condition in time and the assumption that fields vanish at spatial infinity).\n    Substituting this back into the action gives:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n    By comparing this with the form $S_E = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$, we identify the operator $D$ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$\n    The notation $D_\\phi$ in the question is understood to mean the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$, i.e., $D\\phi$.\n\nThe quantity we need to evaluate is the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, which is:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$\n\n**Step 2: Fourier Expansion in the Finite-Temperature Formalism**\n\nTo evaluate this expression, it is most convenient to work in momentum space.\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** For a neutral scalar field (a boson), the field configurations must be periodic in the imaginary time direction:\n    $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$\n\n*   **Fourier Representation:** This periodicity allows us to expand the field in a Fourier series for the time dimension and a Fourier transform for the spatial dimensions:\n    $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d p}{(2\\pi)^d} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$\n    where:\n    *   $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$ are the Fourier coefficients.\n    *   The periodicity condition forces the frequencies $\\omega_n$ to be discrete values known as **bosonic Matsubara frequencies**:\n        $\\omega_n = \\frac{2\\pi n}{\\beta} = 2\\pi n T$, for any integer $n$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Inner Product in Momentum Space**\n\nNow we substitute the Fourier expansion of $\\phi$ into the expression for $(\\phi, D\\phi)$.\n\n1.  **Action of the operator $D$:** First, let's see how $D$ acts on a single Fourier mode $e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})}$. The derivatives bring down factors of the momentum components:\n    $\\partial_\\tau \\rightarrow i\\omega_n \\implies \\partial_\\tau^2 \\rightarrow -\\omega_n^2$\n    $\\nabla \\rightarrow i\\vec{p} \\implies \\nabla^2 \\rightarrow -\\vec{p}^2$\n    Therefore, the operator $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2$ acting on this mode results in multiplication by its eigenvalue:\n    $(-\\partial^2 + m^2) e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})} = (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{x})}$\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Integral:** We insert the Fourier series for both instances of $\\phi$ in the inner product integral. To handle the complex exponentials correctly, we can write the first $\\phi(x)$ as its complex conjugate $\\phi^*(x)$ (which is valid since $\\phi$ is a real field). The reality condition on $\\phi(x)$ implies a condition on its Fourier coefficients: $\\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\vec{p}) = \\tilde{\\phi}(-\\omega_n, -\\vec{p})$.\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi^*(x) (D\\phi(x))$\n    Substituting the expansions and the action of $D$ gives a product of two Fourier sums/integrals. The spacetime integral can then be evaluated using the orthogonality relations of the Fourier modes:\n    $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, e^{i(\\omega_n - \\omega_{n'}) \\tau} = \\beta \\delta_{n,n'}$\n    $\\int d^d x \\, e^{i(\\vec{p} - \\vec{p}') \\cdot \\vec{x}} = (2\\pi)^d \\delta^{(d)}(\\vec{p} - \\vec{p}')$\n    The integral collapses the double sum/integral into a single one:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d p}{(2\\pi)^d} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2)$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Euclidean Space:** The entire calculation is performed in Euclidean spacetime, where $p^2 = p_E^2 = \\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2$. This is different from Minkowski space where $p^2 = p_M^2 = E^2 - \\vec{p}^2$.\n2.  **Bosonic Boundary Conditions:** The use of periodic boundary conditions and the resulting bosonic Matsubara frequencies ($\\omega_n=2\\pi n T$) is specific to bosons. For fermions, one would use anti-periodic boundary conditions, leading to different frequencies.\n3.  **Interpretation:** The result represents the value of the quadratic part of the action for a *specific* field configuration $\\phi$, expressed in terms of its momentum modes $\\tilde{\\phi}$. In the full path integral, one integrates over all possible $\\tilde{\\phi}$ weighted by $e^{-S_E} = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)}$.\n4.  **Normalization:** The normalization factors ($T$, $1/(2\\pi)^d$) are conventional and ensure that the transformation from position to momentum space is unitary and has a well-defined continuum limit.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a given field configuration $\\phi(x)$ is expressed in terms of its Fourier-Matsubara coefficients $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})$ as follows:\n\n<<<($\\phi$, $D\\phi$) = $T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d p}{(2\\pi)^d} (\\omega_n^2 + \\vec{p}^2 + m^2) |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\vec{p})|^2$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.>>>"
