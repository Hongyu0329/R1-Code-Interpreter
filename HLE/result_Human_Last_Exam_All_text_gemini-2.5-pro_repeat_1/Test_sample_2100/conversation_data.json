    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'\".\n    *   Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Soviet and Russian poet. This places the context within Russian culture and history.\n    *   The phrase \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic description of an explorer or traveler whose journey was associated with finding something wonderful, perhaps love or a new world. This suggests the man was a historical figure involved in exploration.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"...and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"\n    *   This line strongly indicates that the man's burial place was unknown or lost for a significant period. This adds a layer of mystery to his life story.\n    *   The combination of these first two clues points towards a specific work by Voznesensky about a historical explorer whose final resting place was a mystery. This leads us to Voznesensky's most famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»).\n\n3.  **Identify the subject of \"Juno and Avos\":**\n    *   The rock opera tells the story of the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov and his voyage to California in the early 19th century. Rezanov fits the description of a \"sailor\" or explorer. His tragic romance with Concepción Argüello in California can be poetically interpreted as the discovery of \"joy.\"\n\n4.  **Investigate Nikolai Rezanov's fate:**\n    *   On his return journey across Siberia, Rezanov fell ill, died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and was buried there in the graveyard of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n    *   In the 20th century, during the Soviet era, the cathedral was destroyed, and the cemetery was paved over. As a result, the exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost, which perfectly matches Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n\n5.  **Analyze the third clue:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n    *   This is the final, crucial piece of the puzzle. The immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" in the Soviet Union during the 1980s revived interest in the historical figure of Nikolai Rezanov.\n    *   Inspired by the opera, a group of enthusiasts in Krasnoyarsk began a search for the lost grave. In the late 1980s, they successfully located what is believed to be the site of Rezanov's burial. This discovery directly \"answered\" the question posed in Voznesensky's work.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The connection between Voznesensky's art and the historical event is direct and causal. The popularity of his rock opera led to the search for and discovery of the grave.\n*   The term \"sailor\" is used poetically. Rezanov was officially a Chamberlain of the Russian Imperial Court, a diplomat, and a leader of the Russian-American Company, but his famous journey was by sea.\n*   All three clues must work together. A person with a lost grave is not enough; they must be connected to Voznesensky and the discovery must have happened in the late 1980s. Rezanov fits all criteria perfectly.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe man described is Nikolai Rezanov. He was the subject of Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" His grave was lost for over a century and was rediscovered in the late 1980s due to the renewed interest sparked by the opera. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
