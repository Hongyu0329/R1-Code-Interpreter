    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is the set of oriented 3-dimensional homology spheres modulo the equivalence relation of homology cobordism. A homology sphere is a 3-manifold with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$. Two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ are homology cobordant if their disjoint union $M_1 \\sqcup -M_2$ bounds a 4-manifold $W$ that has the same integer homology as a cylinder ($M_1 \\times [0,1]$). This set forms an abelian group under the connected sum operation, with $S^3$ being the identity element.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** An $n$-surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$ (where $n$ is an integer) produces a new 3-manifold $S^3_n(K)$.\n*   **Condition for a Surgery to be a Homology Sphere:** The first homology group of the surgered manifold is $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this to be a homology sphere, we need $H_1=0$, which implies $|n|=1$. Thus, we are only concerned with $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the number of distinct elements in the group $\\Theta_3^H$ that can be represented by the manifolds $S^3_{+1}(K)$ or $S^3_{-1}(K)$, where $K$ is a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\n### **Step 2: List the knots to consider**\n\nWe list all prime knots up to 4 crossings, keeping in mind that a knot and its mirror image are distinct unless the knot is amphichiral.\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). It is amphichiral.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil (let's call it $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror, $-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the list of distinct knots to analyze is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the surgeries on each knot**\n\nFor each of the 4 knots, we consider both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery. This gives a total of 8 manifolds whose homology cobordism classes we must identify and count. To distinguish these classes, we will use invariants of homology cobordism, primarily the Casson invariant $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and the Heegaard-Floer correction term $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**1. The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$ is also diffeomorphic to $S^3$.\n*   Both represent the identity element [0] in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n*   **Contribution:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n**2. The Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**\n*   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This is the Poincar√© homology sphere.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: This is another well-known homology sphere, diffeomorphic to the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n*   To distinguish their classes, we compute their invariants:\n    *   The Casson invariant for surgery is $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\mp \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta''_K(-1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial. For $3_1$, $\\Delta_{3_1}(t)=t^2-t+1$, so $\\Delta''_{3_1}(-1)=2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -1$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = +1$.\n    *   The Heegaard-Floer d-invariant for both of these manifolds is $-2$ (in a standard normalization).\n*   Since their Casson invariants differ, $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$ and $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$ are distinct, non-trivial classes.\n*   **Contribution:** 2 new elements.\n\n**3. The Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**\n*   We use the general relation $S^3_n(-K) \\cong -S^3_{-n}(K)$, where $-M$ denotes the manifold $M$ with opposite orientation.\n*   $S^3_{+1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{-1}(3_1)$. Its class is $-[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(-3_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(3_1)$. Its class is $-[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$.\n*   We check the invariants using the properties $\\lambda(-M) = -\\lambda(M)$ and $d(-M) = -d(M)$.\n    *   For $-[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$: $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -1$. $d = -d(S^3_{-1}(3_1)) = -(-2) = 2$.\n    *   For $-[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$: $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -(-1) = 1$. $d = -d(S^3_{+1}(3_1)) = -(-2) = 2$.\n*   These two new classes are distinct from each other (different $\\lambda$) and from the classes from $3_1$ (different $d$).\n*   **Contribution:** 2 new elements.\n\n**4. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n*   This knot is amphichiral, so $-4_1 \\cong 4_1$.\n*   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$: This is a hyperbolic manifold known as the Seifert-Weber space.\n*   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$: Using the relations, $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(-4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. So the class is $-[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$.\n*   We compute the invariants for $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$:\n    *   For $4_1$, $\\Delta_{4_1}(t)=-t^2+3t-1$, so $\\Delta''_{4_1}(-1)=-2$.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = -\\frac{1}{2}(-2) = +1$.\n    *   The d-invariant for this manifold is $d(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = 0$.\n*   Now for the second class, $-[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$:\n    *   $\\lambda = -\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = -1$.\n    *   $d = -d(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = 0$.\n*   These two classes are distinct from each other (different $\\lambda$) and non-trivial. They are also distinct from all the trefoil surgery classes (which have $d = \\pm 2$).\n*   **Contribution:** 2 new elements.\n\n### **Step 4: Tally the results**\n\nLet's summarize the distinct homology cobordism classes found, represented by the pair of invariants $(\\lambda, d)$:\n1.  From the unknot: **1 class**\n    *   $[S^3] \\to (0, 0)$\n2.  From the right-handed trefoil: **2 classes**\n    *   $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)] \\to (-1, -2)$\n    *   $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)] \\to (1, -2)$\n3.  From the left-handed trefoil: **2 classes**\n    *   $[S^3_{+1}(-3_1)] \\to (-1, 2)$\n    *   $[S^3_{-1}(-3_1)] \\to (1, 2)$\n4.  From the figure-eight knot: **2 classes**\n    *   $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)] \\to (1, 0)$\n    *   $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)] \\to (-1, 0)$\n\nAll seven pairs of invariants $(\\lambda, d)$ are unique. Since these are homology cobordism invariants, the seven corresponding classes are all distinct.\n\nTotal number of distinct elements = 1 (from unknot) + 2 (from $3_1$) + 2 (from $-3_1$) + 2 (from $4_1$) = 7."
