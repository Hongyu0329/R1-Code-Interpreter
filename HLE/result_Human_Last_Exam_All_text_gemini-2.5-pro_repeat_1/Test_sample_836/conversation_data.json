    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical object within a particular scientific community. Let's break it down:\n1.  **The Object:** \"the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\".\n2.  **The Community:** \"the nuclear criticality community\".\n\nOur task is to identify the term used in this community for this object.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Generalized Pair Correlation Function\"\n\n*   In statistical physics, a system of particles (like neutrons in a reactor) can be described by its particle density. The one-particle density is $n(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, the average number of particles per unit volume at position $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$.\n*   The two-particle density, $n_2(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, gives the joint probability of finding a particle at $(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1)$ and another at $(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$.\n*   The **generalized pair correlation function**, $g(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, describes the correlation between the presence of particles at these two space-time points. It is defined by the relation:\n    $n_2(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) = n(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1) n(\\mathbf{r}_2, t_2) g(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$.\n*   For a system that is stationary in time and homogeneous in space (a good approximation for a large critical reactor operating at steady power), the correlation function only depends on the separation in time and space: $\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$ and $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$. So, the function simplifies to $g(\\Delta\\mathbf{r}, \\Delta t)$. This function essentially asks: \"Given a neutron was at the origin at time zero, what is the excess probability of finding another neutron at position $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$ at time $\\Delta t$?\"\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Space-Time, Double Fourier Transform\"\n\nThe question specifies a double Fourier transform, one over the spatial separation variable $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$ and one over the temporal separation variable $\\Delta t$.\n*   The Fourier conjugate variable to space ($\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$) is the **wavevector** ($\\mathbf{k}$).\n*   The Fourier conjugate variable to time ($\\Delta t$) is the **angular frequency** ($\\omega$).\n\nThe transformation is mathematically expressed as:\n$S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d(\\Delta t) \\int_{V} d^3(\\Delta\\mathbf{r}) \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\Delta\\mathbf{r} - \\omega \\Delta t)} g(\\Delta\\mathbf{r}, \\Delta t)$\n\nThe resulting function, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectrum of the correlation. It describes how much power the system's density fluctuations have at a specific spatial \"wavelength\" ($2\\pi/|\\mathbf{k}|$) and temporal frequency ($\\omega$).\n\n### Step 4: Connect to the \"Nuclear Criticality Community\"\n\nThis field is also known as reactor physics or reactor noise analysis. In this field, scientists and engineers study the fluctuations (or \"noise\") in the neutron population to diagnose the state of a nuclear system (e.g., a reactor or a subcritical assembly).\n*   **Experimental Measurement:** Experiments often measure the correlation between signals from two neutron detectors placed at different locations, $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$. The Fourier transform of this time-correlation signal gives the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**, which is a function of the detector positions and frequency, $\\text{CPSD}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2, \\omega)$.\n*   **Theoretical Quantity:** The quantity defined in the question, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, is the fundamental theoretical object that underlies the CPSD. The measured CPSD is a spatially-convolved version of $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Common Name\n\nWe are looking for the common name of $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n*   In the field of condensed matter physics, this exact quantity (the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function) was introduced by LÃ©on Van Hove to describe the results of inelastic neutron scattering experiments. It is universally called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**.\n*   The nuclear criticality community has deep roots in statistical mechanics and neutron transport, and it has adopted this precise and descriptive term from the broader physics community. Theoretical papers on neutron fluctuations in multiplying systems frequently use this name.\n*   While other descriptive phrases like \"space-frequency dependent power spectral density of the neutron noise\" might be used, the most specific and formally correct name for the mathematical object defined in the question is the Dynamic Structure Factor. It precisely captures its nature as a descriptor of the system's spatial structure ($Structure Factor$) and how that structure evolves in time ($Dynamic$).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is a fundamental quantity describing the spectrum of density fluctuations in both space and time. In the nuclear criticality community, as in condensed matter physics, the standard name for this quantity is the Dynamic Structure Factor.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
