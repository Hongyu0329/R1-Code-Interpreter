    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   **Filling Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **The Question:** We need to determine the geometric shape of the water's surface.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   Under gravity, the surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n*   A regular icosahedron has a property called central symmetry. This means it has a geometric center, and for any point within the solid, the point directly opposite through the center is also within the solid.\n*   Because of this central symmetry, any plane passing through the center of the icosahedron will divide its volume into two exactly equal halves.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Water Surface to the Icosahedron's Geometry**\n*   The tank is standing on a face, so its base is a horizontal triangle. A key property of the icosahedron is that for every face, there is an opposite face that is parallel to it. Therefore, the top face of the tank is also a horizontal triangle, parallel to the base.\n*   The water surface is a horizontal plane located exactly halfway between the base and the top face, passing through the icosahedron's center.\n*   The shape of the water surface is therefore the shape of the cross-section of the icosahedron, cut by a plane that is parallel to a face and passes through the center.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Cross-Section using Symmetry**\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The axis that passes perpendicularly through the center of the base face and the center of the top face is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. If you rotate the icosahedron 120° around this axis, it looks identical. Since the cutting plane (the water surface) is perpendicular to this axis, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Number of Sides:** To find the number of sides of the cross-sectional polygon, we need to determine how many edges of the icosahedron are intersected by the central plane.\n    *   Let's group the 12 vertices of the icosahedron by their vertical height. Let the center be at height z=0.\n    *   Due to the orientation and symmetry, there are four distinct height levels for the vertices:\n        1.  The 3 vertices of the base face (at a negative height, say -h₁).\n        2.  A set of 3 \"lower-middle\" vertices (at a height -h₂).\n        3.  A set of 3 \"upper-middle\" vertices (at a height +h₂).\n        4.  The 3 vertices of the top face (at a height +h₁).\n    *   The central plane (z=0) lies exactly between the lower-middle layer of vertices and the upper-middle layer.\n    *   An edge is intersected by the plane if and only if one of its endpoint vertices is above the plane (positive height) and the other is below (negative height).\n    *   The plane at z=0 intersects only the edges that connect the \"upper-middle\" vertices to the \"lower-middle\" vertices.\n    *   By analyzing the structure of the icosahedron, we find there are exactly **6** such edges forming a zig-zag pattern around the \"equator\" of the icosahedron in this orientation.\n*   **Conclusion on Shape:** The cross-section is a polygon with 6 sides and has 3-fold rotational symmetry. A 6-sided polygon that can be rotated by 120° and remain unchanged must have sides of equal length and angles that repeat in a pattern of three. Further analysis of the icosahedron's high degree of symmetry confirms that all sides and angles are equal. Therefore, the shape is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe water surface is a horizontal plane passing through the center of the icosahedron, parallel to its base. This cross-section cuts through 6 of the icosahedron's edges, resulting in a 6-sided figure. Due to the 3-fold symmetry of the icosahedron around the axis perpendicular to the base, this figure is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
