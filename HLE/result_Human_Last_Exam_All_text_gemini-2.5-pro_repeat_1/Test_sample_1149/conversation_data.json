    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the anatomical feature in question.**\nThe question asks about the \"lacrimal recess\" in the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri*. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull that is situated in front of the orbit (eye socket). A recess is a depression or fossa on the surface of a bone.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the primary scientific source describing this feature.**\nThe most detailed and authoritative description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* comes from the scientific paper \"On the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (Dinosauria: Theropoda: Spinosauridae)\" published in 2002 by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David Martill, and Diane Scott. This paper is based on the holotype specimen, SMNS 58022.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the description of the lacrimal bone in the source.**\nIn their detailed anatomical description, Sues and his colleagues examine each bone of the skull. When describing the lacrimal bone, they note the presence of a prominent lacrimal recess.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific detail about the structure of the recess.**\nThe crucial point in the paper's description is that this lacrimal recess is not a single, simple depression. The authors state that the large, deep lacrimal recess is \"subdivided into two smaller depressions or fossae\". This subdivision is a distinct anatomical feature of *Irritator*.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final count.**\nBased on the scientific description, the single large lacrimal recess itself contains two smaller, distinct depressions within it. Therefore, the number of depressions the lacrimal recess contains is two.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is important to distinguish between the single, large lacrimal recess and the smaller depressions it contains. The question specifically asks how many depressions the recess *contains*.\n*   Relying on primary scientific literature (like the Sues et al., 2002 paper) is crucial for accuracy in paleontological anatomy, as this is the source of the original description.\n*   The feature of a subdivided lacrimal recess is a notable characteristic used to compare *Irritator* with other theropod dinosaurs.\n\n<<<2>>>"
