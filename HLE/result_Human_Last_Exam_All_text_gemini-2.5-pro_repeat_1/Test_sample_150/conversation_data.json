    "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0, after executing a series of `n` statements.\n2.  **Variable:** There is only one variable, `x`. Its initial value is 0.\n3.  **Operations:** There are two operations:\n    *   `++`: Increments `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n4.  **Statements:** A statement consists of one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`. The order can be prefix (`++X`, `--X`) or postfix (`X++`, `X--`). The statement is a single string without spaces (e.g., \"X++\").\n5.  **Program:** A program is a sequence of `n` statements. We need to execute all of them.\n6.  **Input:** The first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150). The next `n` lines each contain one statement.\n7.  **Output:** A single integer representing the final value of `x`.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Initialization:** `int tresult = 0;` correctly initializes the counter variable (representing `x`) to 0.\n2.  **Looping:** `while (t-- > 0)` correctly iterates `n` times, once for each statement.\n3.  **Reading Input:** `String test = inpt.next();` correctly reads each statement as a string.\n4.  **Logic Flaw:** The core logic for updating the counter is flawed.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }` only checks for the prefix increment operation. It completely ignores the postfix increment, \"X++\".\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }` only checks for the prefix decrement operation. It completely ignores the postfix decrement, \"X--\".\n5.  **Conclusion:** The program is incorrect. For an input like `X++`, it will not increment `tresult`, leading to a wrong final answer.\n\n### Rewriting in C for Maximum Efficiency\n\nTo solve the problem correctly and efficiently, we need a method that handles all four possible statement formats: \"++X\", \"X++\", \"--X\", and \"X--\".\n\n**Careful Points for an Efficient C Solution:**\n\n1.  **Input Reading:** `scanf` is generally faster for competitive programming than `cin` in C++ or `Scanner` in Java.\n2.  **String Comparison:** Instead of using expensive string comparison functions like `strcmp`, we can exploit the structure of the input strings. Every valid statement is 3 characters long. The character that uniquely identifies the operation (`+` or `-`) is always present.\n3.  **Optimal Check:** The most efficient way to determine the operation is to inspect a single character. Let the input string be `s`.\n    *   For \"++X\", the characters are `s[0]='+', s[1]='+', s[2]='X'`.\n    *   For \"X++\", the characters are `s[0]='X', s[1]='+', s[2]='+'`.\n    *   For \"--X\", the characters are `s[0]='-', s[1]='-', s[2]='X'`.\n    *   For \"X--\", the characters are `s[0]='X', s[1]='-', s[2]='-'`.\n    Notice that the character at index 1, `s[1]`, is `'+'` for both increment operations and `'-'` for both decrement operations. This provides a simple, robust, and extremely fast check.\n4.  **Memory Usage:** To minimize memory, we should use the smallest data types that can hold the required values.\n    *   The number of statements `n` is at most 150. A `short int` (typically 2 bytes) is sufficient.\n    *   The final value of `x` will be between -150 and 150. A `short int` is also sufficient here.\n    *   To read the 3-character statement, a character array of size 4 is needed to accommodate the null terminator (`char s[4];`), which takes 4 bytes.\n\n### Calculation of Efficiency Metrics (x and y)\n\n*   **x: Smallest number of character comparisons for 100 inputs.**\n    *   Using the optimal check (`if (s[1] == '+')`), we perform exactly one character comparison for each of the 100 statements.\n    *   Total comparisons = 100 statements * 1 comparison/statement = 100.\n    *   Therefore, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **y: Smallest memory size in Bytes (B).**\n    *   This refers to the memory required for the variables in the function.\n    *   Variable for number of statements (`n`): `short int` -> 2 Bytes.\n    *   Variable for the result (`x`): `short int` -> 2 Bytes.\n    *   Buffer for reading the statement (`s`): `char[4]` -> 4 Bytes.\n    *   Total minimum memory = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 Bytes.\n    *   Therefore, **y = 8**.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   The submitted program is incorrect, so the answer must start with 'N'.\n*   The answer format is `Nx+y`.\n*   Substituting the calculated values: `N` + `100` + `+` + `8`.\n*   Final Answer: `N100+8`\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
