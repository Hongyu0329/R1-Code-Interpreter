    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold in question.**\nLet $K$ be the trefoil knot, which is denoted as $3_1$.\nThe knotted surface is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, denoted as $\\tau_5(K)$. This is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$.\nThe manifold, let's call it $M$, is the double branched cover of $S^4$ with the branch set being the surface $\\tau_5(K)$. In notation, $M = \\Sigma_2(\\tau_5(K))$.\n\n**Step 2: Use known results about the topology of such manifolds.**\nA key result in the study of twist-spun knots is a theorem by Young Sik Pao (1981). Pao's theorem describes the structure of branched covers of twist-spun knots. It states that if $K$ is a knot in $S^3$, and we consider the $d$-fold branched cover of $S^4$ over the $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m(K)$, this manifold has a simpler description provided that the number of twists $m$ and the degree of the cover $d$ are coprime, i.e., $\\gcd(m, d) = 1$.\n\nThe theorem states:\n$\\Sigma_d(\\tau_m(K)) \\cong \\#^m \\Sigma_d(K)$\nwhere $\\#^m$ denotes the connected sum of $m$ copies of the manifold, and $\\Sigma_d(K)$ is the $d$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^3$ over the knot $K$.\n\nIn our problem, we have:\n*   The knot $K$ is the trefoil knot.\n*   The degree of the cover is $d=2$ (a \"double\" cover).\n*   The number of twists is $m=5$.\n\nWe check the condition $\\gcd(m, d) = \\gcd(5, 2) = 1$. The condition is satisfied, so we can apply Pao's theorem.\nThis gives us the following identification for our manifold $M$:\n$M = \\Sigma_2(\\tau_5(\\text{trefoil})) \\cong \\#^5 \\Sigma_2(\\text{trefoil})$.\nSo, $M$ is the connected sum of 5 copies of the double branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the component manifold and its fundamental group.**\nThe component manifold is $\\Sigma_2(\\text{trefoil})$. It is a well-known result in knot theory that the 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot is the lens space $L(3,2)$ (which is homeomorphic to $L(3,1)$).\nThe fundamental group of the lens space $L(p,q)$ is the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\nSo, for our component manifold, the fundamental group is:\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(\\text{trefoil})) = \\pi_1(L(3,2)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the fundamental group of the full manifold M.**\nThe manifold $M$ is a connected sum of 5 copies of a manifold whose fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. For a connected sum of manifolds of dimension 3 or higher, the Seifert-van Kampen theorem implies that the fundamental group of the connected sum is the free product of the fundamental groups of the individual manifolds.\n$M = M_1 \\# M_2 \\# M_3 \\# M_4 \\# M_5$, where $\\pi_1(M_i) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3$ for each $i$.\nThus, the fundamental group of $M$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(M_1) * \\pi_1(M_2) * \\pi_1(M_3) * \\pi_1(M_4) * \\pi_1(M_5)$\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators for this group.**\nLet $\\Pi = \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$. We want to find the minimal number of generators for $\\Pi$, denoted $d(\\Pi)$.\nLet $g_i$ be a generator for the $i$-th copy of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ in the free product. Then the set $\\{g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4, g_5\\}$ is a generating set for $\\Pi$. This shows that the minimal number of generators is at most 5, i.e., $d(\\Pi) \\le 5$.\n\nTo find a lower bound, we can look at the abelianization of $\\Pi$, denoted $\\Pi^{ab}$. The minimal number of generators of a group is always greater than or equal to the minimal number of generators of its abelianization: $d(\\Pi) \\ge d(\\Pi^{ab})$.\nThe abelianization of a free product of groups is the direct sum of their abelianizations:\n$\\Pi^{ab} = (\\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\dots * \\mathbb{Z}_3)^{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_3)^{ab} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_3)^{ab}$.\nSince $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ is already an abelian group, its abelianization is itself.\n$\\Pi^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 = (\\mathbb{Z}_3)^5$.\n\nThe group $(\\mathbb{Z}_3)^5$ can be viewed as a 5-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_3$. The minimal number of generators for a vector space is its dimension.\nSo, $d(\\Pi^{ab}) = d((\\mathbb{Z}_3)^5) = 5$.\n\nCombining our findings:\n$d(\\Pi) \\le 5$\n$d(\\Pi) \\ge d(\\Pi^{ab}) = 5$\nTherefore, the minimal number of generators for $\\pi_1(M)$ must be exactly 5.\n\nFinal summary of careful points:\n1.  Correctly identify the manifold using the given description.\n2.  Recognize the applicability of Pao's theorem, checking that its conditions ($\\gcd(m,d)=1$) are met. This is the crucial step that incorporates the specific number \"5\" from the problem statement.\n3.  Correctly identify the double branched cover of the trefoil knot as the lens space $L(3,2)$.\n4.  Know the fundamental group of the lens space $L(p,q)$.\n5.  Know how to compute the fundamental group of a connected sum of manifolds.\n6.  Know how to find the minimal number of generators for a free product of groups, typically by using its abelianization to find a lower bound.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
