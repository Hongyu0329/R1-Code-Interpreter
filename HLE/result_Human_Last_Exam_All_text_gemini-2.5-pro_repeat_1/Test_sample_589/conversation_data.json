    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Core Elements of the Question**\nThe query asks for a specific film based on a very precise scene. The key elements that must all be present are:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Studio:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nThe image of a teenager on a bike is common in coming-of-age films. However, the combination of a *pink* bike and riding *toward* a car is highly specific.\n\n*   A common incorrect guess might be *Pee-wee's Big Adventure* (1985). While it features an iconic bike, the bike is red and white, not pink. Furthermore, the character of Pee-wee Herman is an adult man-child, not a teenager. This film does not match the criteria.\n*   Another potential thought could be a film with \"pink\" in the title, like *Pretty in Pink* (1986). However, the iconic vehicle in that movie is a pink Karmann Ghia car, not a bike. This film is also incorrect.\n*   Other teen movies featuring bikes, like *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* or *The Goonies*, do not feature this specific scene with a pink bike and an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Key Details**\nThe most distinctive clues are the \"pink bike\" and the \"oncoming car.\" We need to find a film that combines these with a teenage character. Let's consider the cult classic teen comedy *Napoleon Dynamite* (2004).\n\n**Step 4: Verifying *Napoleon Dynamite* Against the Criteria**\n1.  **Hollywood Feature Film?** Yes, it is a well-known feature film.\n2.  **Major Studio?** Yes, it was produced and/or distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and MTV Films, which are all considered major industry players. This criterion is met.\n3.  **Teenager?** The film's main characters are all high school students, so they are teenagers. This criterion is met.\n4.  **Pink Bike?** Now we must identify the specific character. The main character, Napoleon, does not ride a pink bike. However, his friend and love interest, **Deb Bradshaw**, does. She rides a distinctive light pink Huffy bike while going door-to-door to sell her boondoggle keychains and glamour photo sessions. This criterion is met.\n5.  **Pedaling Toward an Oncoming Car?** There is a specific scene where Uncle Rico is driving his van to Napoleon's house to give him the steak his \"bust must be busted.\" In a shot just before this, Deb is seen riding her bike down the street. The camera is positioned in front of her, showing her pedaling her pink bike in her lane, while Uncle Rico's van is in the same lane, driving directly toward her. While the primary action is not a game of \"chicken,\" the visual composition of the shot is precisely \"a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe film that matches all the specific details laid out in the question is *Napoleon Dynamite*. The scene involves the teenage character Deb, on her pink bike, pedaling on a street where Uncle Rico's van is approaching her from the opposite direction in the same lane.\n\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
