    "Answering this question involves analyzing the integral cohomology of a specific topological space, the Grassmannian manifold of 3-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. We are asked to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Space and the Mathematical Object\n*   **The space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n*   **The object:** We need to study the integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   **The quantity to find:** We need the rank of the torsion subgroup of this ring. The torsion subgroup of the ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group, $T = \\bigoplus_i \\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of the Cohomology of Grassmannians\n*   A key theorem by Borel states that for any real Grassmannian manifold $G(k, n)$, the torsion in its integral cohomology, if it exists, is entirely 2-torsion. This means that each torsion subgroup $\\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$ is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The rank of the torsion subgroup is its dimension when viewed as a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The existence of torsion is known to occur only in specific cases. Torsion appears in $H^*(G(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$ only when $n$ is odd, $k$ is odd, and $n-k$ is even. In our case, $n=5$ (odd), $k=3$ (odd), and $n-k=2$ (even). Thus, we are in the case where 2-torsion is expected.\n\n### Step 3: Relating Torsion to Steenrod Squares\nThe rank of the 2-torsion subgroup in $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ can be calculated using the tools of algebraic topology, specifically the Bockstein homomorphism associated with the coefficient sequence $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times 2} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$. The rank of the 2-torsion in $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is equal to the dimension of the image of the first Steenrod square $Sq^1: H^{i-1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of these dimensions over all degrees:\nRank(Torsion) = $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}} \\left( \\text{Im} \\left( Sq^1: H^{i-1}(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\right) \\right)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of the mod 2 Cohomology Ring\nThe mod 2 cohomology ring $H^*(G(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1, \\dots, w_k$ of the universal $k$-plane bundle over $G(k,n)$. These generators are subject to relations derived from the fact that the universal bundle and its orthogonal complement sum to a trivial bundle.\nFor $G(3, 5)$, the ring is $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}[w_1, w_2, w_3]/I$, where the ideal $I$ is generated by the relations $\\bar{w}_{5-3+j} = \\bar{w}_{2+j} = 0$ for $j>0$. The relevant relations are $\\bar{w}_3=0, \\bar{w}_4=0, \\bar{w}_5=0$.\nThe relations between $w_i$ and the dual classes $\\bar{w}_j$ yield the following relations in the ring:\n1.  $w_3 = w_1^3$\n2.  $w_2^2 = w_1^4 + w_1^2w_2$\n3.  $w_1^5 = w_1^3w_2$\n\nA basis for each cohomology group can be constructed using these relations:\n*   $H^0$: $\\{1\\}$\n*   $H^1$: $\\{w_1\\}$\n*   $H^2$: $\\{w_1^2, w_2\\}$\n*   $H^3$: $\\{w_1^3, w_1w_2\\}$\n*   $H^4$: $\\{w_1^4, w_1^2w_2\\}$\n*   $H^5$: $\\{w_1^5\\}$\n*   $H^6$: $\\{w_1^4w_2\\}$\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Action of $Sq^1$\nWe use the Wu formula, $Sq^1(w_i) = w_1w_i + w_{i+1}$ (with $w_j=0$ for $j>3$), and the Cartan formula, $Sq^1(xy) = Sq^1(x)y + xSq^1(y)$.\n\n*   **$Sq^1: H^0 \\to H^1$**: $Sq^1(1) = 0$. The image has dimension 0.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^1 \\to H^2$**: $Sq^1(w_1) = w_1^2 + w_2$. This is a non-zero element in $H^2$. The image is spanned by this element and has dimension 1.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^2 \\to H^3$**: We check the action on the basis $\\{w_1^2, w_2\\}$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1^2) = 0$ (since $Sq^1(x^2)=0$ in characteristic 2).\n    *   $Sq^1(w_2) = w_1w_2 + w_3 = w_1w_2 + w_1^3$. This is a non-zero element in $H^3$.\n    *   The image is spanned by $w_1w_2 + w_1^3$ and has dimension 1.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^3 \\to H^4$**: We check the action on the basis $\\{w_1^3, w_1w_2\\}$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1^3) = Sq^1(w_3) = w_1w_3 + w_4 = w_1(w_1^3) + 0 = w_1^4$. This is a basis element of $H^4$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1w_2) = Sq^1(w_1)w_2 + w_1Sq^1(w_2) = (w_1^2+w_2)w_2 + w_1(w_1w_2+w_3) = w_1^2w_2+w_2^2+w_1^2w_2+w_1w_3 = w_2^2+w_1w_3$. Using the relations, this simplifies to $w_1^2w_2$. This is also a basis element of $H^4$.\n    *   The image is spanned by $\\{w_1^4, w_1^2w_2\\}$, which are linearly independent. The dimension is 2.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^4 \\to H^5$**: We check the action on the basis $\\{w_1^4, w_1^2w_2\\}$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1^4) = Sq^1(w_1 \\cdot w_1^3) = (w_1^2+w_2)w_1^3 + w_1(w_1^4) = w_1^5+w_1^3w_2+w_1^5 = w_1^3w_2 = w_1^5$. This is the basis element of $H^5$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1^2w_2) = w_1^2Sq^1(w_2) = w_1^2(w_1w_2+w_3) = w_1^3w_2 + w_1^2w_3 = w_1^5+w_1^5=0$.\n    *   The image is spanned by $w_1^5$. The dimension is 1.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^5 \\to H^6$**: We check the action on the basis $\\{w_1^5\\}$.\n    *   $Sq^1(w_1^5) = Sq^1(w_1 \\cdot w_1^4) = (w_1^2+w_2)w_1^4 + w_1(w_1^5) = w_1^6+w_1^4w_2+w_1^6=w_1^4w_2$. This is the basis element of $H^6$.\n    *   The image is spanned by $w_1^4w_2$. The dimension is 1.\n*   **$Sq^1: H^6 \\to H^7$**: $H^7=0$, so the map is zero. The image dimension is 0.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nThe total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum of the dimensions of the images of $Sq^1$:\nTotal Rank = $0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup of $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ has rank 6. It is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^6$. The non-zero torsion appears in degrees 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with ranks 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\n<<<6>>>"
