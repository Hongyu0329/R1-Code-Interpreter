    "An analysis of the question requires a careful breakdown of the definitions provided.\n\n**1. Definitions:**\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ such that for all $x, y \\in S$, the product $xy \\notin S$. This implies $e \\notin S$ for any non-trivial group.\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set (MIPFS):** A product-free set $S$ such that for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **Fills G:** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ fills $G$ if $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}$.\n*   **Filled group:** A group $G$ is filled if *every* MIPFS in $G$ fills $G$.\n*   **Target groups:** Nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number ($m \\ge 1$).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of groups of order $2q^m$.**\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 1$. The order can be written as $2k$ where $k=q^m$ is an odd integer. A known theorem in group theory states that any finite group of order $2k$ with $k$ odd possesses a normal subgroup of index 2.\n*   *Proof sketch:* Consider the left regular representation $\\lambda: G \\to S_{2k}$. For any element $g \\in G$ of order 2 (which must exist by Cauchy's theorem), its permutation representation $\\lambda(g)$ consists of $k=q^m$ transpositions. Since $q$ is odd, $k$ is odd. Thus, $\\lambda(g)$ is an odd permutation. The sign homomorphism sgn: $S_{2k} \\to \\{1, -1\\}$ is surjective. The composition $\\phi = \\text{sgn} \\circ \\lambda: G \\to \\{1, -1\\}$ is a surjective group homomorphism. The kernel of $\\phi$, Ker($\\phi$), is a normal subgroup of $G$, and by the first isomorphism theorem, $G/\\text{Ker}(\\phi) \\cong \\{1, -1\\}$, so $|\\text{Ker}(\\phi)| = |G|/2 = q^m$. Thus, any group of order $2q^m$ has a normal subgroup $H$ of index 2 (and order $q^m$).\n\n**Step 2: Construct a specific MIPFS in these groups.**\nLet $G$ be a group of order $2q^m$ and let $H$ be its normal subgroup of index 2. Consider the set $S = G \\setminus H$.\n*   Since $[G:H]=2$, $S$ is the unique non-identity coset of $H$. Let $g$ be any element in $S$. Then $S=gH$.\n*   **Is S product-free?** Let $s_1, s_2 \\in S$. Then $s_1s_2 \\in (gH)(gH) = g(Hg)H = g(gH)H = g^2H$. In the quotient group $G/H \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$, the element $gH$ is not the identity, so $(gH)^2$ is the identity, i.e., $g^2H = H$. This means $g^2 \\in H$. Therefore, $s_1s_2 \\in H$. Since $S \\cap H = \\emptyset$, $s_1s_2 \\notin S$. Thus, $S$ is a product-free set.\n*   **Is S a MIPFS?** To be maximal, for any element $x \\in G \\setminus S = H$, the set $S \\cup \\{x\\}$ must not be product-free. Let's check. Let $x \\in H$ and $s \\in S$. The product $xs$ lies in $Hs = gH = S$. So, we have found two elements, $x \\in S \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $s \\in S \\cup \\{x\\}$, whose product $xs$ is also in $S \\cup \\{x\\}$. Thus, $S \\cup \\{x\\}$ is not product-free. This holds for any $x \\in H$. Therefore, $S = G \\setminus H$ is a maximal by inclusion product-free set.\n\n**Step 3: Check if this MIPFS fills the group G.**\nFor $G$ to be a filled group, *every* MIPFS must fill $G$. We can test the specific MIPFS $S = G \\setminus H$ we just found.\n*   The condition for $S$ to fill $G$ is $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}$.\n*   Let's analyze $S^{-1}$. $S = gH$, so $S^{-1} = (gH)^{-1} = H^{-1}g^{-1} = Hg^{-1}$. Since $H$ is normal, $Hg^{-1} = g^{-1}H$. As shown in Step 2, $g^2 \\in H$, which implies $gH = g^{-1}H$. So, $S=S^{-1}$.\n*   The filling condition becomes $G = S \\cup S \\cup \\{e\\}$, which is $G = S \\cup \\{e\\}$.\n*   This equality implies that $G$ consists of the elements of $S$ plus the identity element. Let's check the orders. $|G| = |S| + 1$.\n*   We know $|G|=2q^m$ and $|S| = |H| = q^m$. So the condition is $2q^m = q^m + 1$.\n*   This simplifies to $q^m = 1$.\n*   However, the problem states that $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number, so $q \\ge 3$ and $m \\ge 1$. This means $q^m \\ge 3$.\n*   The condition $q^m=1$ cannot be satisfied under the given constraints.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nWe have found that for any nonabelian group $G$ of order $2q^m$ (with $q$ odd and $m \\ge 1$), there exists at least one maximal by inclusion product-free set (namely $S = G \\setminus H$, where $H$ is the normal subgroup of index 2) that does not fill $G$.\n\nAccording to the definition, a group is filled only if *every* MIPFS fills it. Since we have found a counterexample for any group of the specified form, none of these groups can be filled.\n\nTherefore, the set of nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ is empty.\n\nFinal Answer: There are no such groups."
