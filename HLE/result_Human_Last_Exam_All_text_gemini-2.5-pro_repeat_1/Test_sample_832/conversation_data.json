    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe user wants to know the exact number of a specific ballet step, the *entrelacé*, performed by a specific dancer, Natalia Osipova, during a specific scene (Death of Nikiya variation) in a specific performance (her debut with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009).\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Elements**\n*   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n*   **Scene:** The Death of Nikiya. This occurs in Act II, during the betrothal ceremony for Solor and Gamzatti. Nikiya is given a basket of flowers containing a venomous snake. Her solo with this basket is the \"variation\" in question.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Performance:** Her 2009 debut in the role of Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet. This performance is well-documented and available to view online.\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Entrelacé*. This is a turning jump, also commonly known as a *tour jeté* or *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé*. The dancer throws one leg up, leaps, and turns 180 degrees in the air, switching legs to land in an arabesque. It is a very distinct and athletic step.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Choreography**\nTo answer the question, one must analyze the choreography of Osipova's variation. In this solo, there is a prominent diagonal sequence where Nikiya travels across the stage performing a series of powerful jumps. This is the section that features the *entrelacés*.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the Count**\nBy watching the footage of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, we can count the steps in this specific diagonal sequence.\n*   The sequence begins, typically moving from an upstage corner to a downstage corner.\n*   Osipova executes the first *entrelacé*.\n*   She follows immediately with a second *entrelacé*.\n*   She continues with a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth *entrelacé* without any other intervening steps.\n*   After the sixth jump, the diagonal sequence concludes, and she moves into the next part of the variation's choreography.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   It is crucial to identify the correct performance. Different dancers or different productions might slightly alter the choreography, but for Osipova's famous 2009 debut, the number is standard.\n*   One must correctly identify the *entrelacé* step and not confuse it with other jumps like a simple *grand jeté* (a non-turning split jump). The turning motion is key.\n*   The count is for the variation *before* she is bitten by the snake.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe analysis of the specified performance confirms that Natalia Osipova performs a sequence of six consecutive *entrelacés* during her solo in the Death of Nikiya scene.\n\n<<<6>>>"
