    "Answering this question requires analyzing the relationship between subgroups of a given index and homomorphisms to symmetric groups, and knowing specific structural properties of the Grigorchuk group (Γ).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Subgroups and Homomorphisms:** There is a well-established correspondence between subgroups of index `n` in a group `G` and transitive group actions of `G` on a set of `n` elements. Each such action is defined by a homomorphism `ψ: G → S_n` where the image `Im(ψ)` is a transitive subgroup of `S_n`. The subgroup `H` is the stabilizer of a point in this action.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Grigorchuk Group (Γ) and Index 4:**\n    *   We are looking for subgroups of index 4 in Γ. This corresponds to counting transitive homomorphisms `ψ: Γ → S_4`.\n    *   A crucial property of the Grigorchuk group is that it is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2.\n    *   Consequently, for any homomorphism `ψ: Γ → G'`, the image `Im(ψ)` must also be a 2-group.\n    *   We need to identify the transitive subgroups of `S_4` that are 2-groups. The transitive subgroups of `S_4` are `C_4`, `V_4`, `D_4`, `A_4`, and `S_4`.\n        *   `C_4` (cyclic group of order 4) is a 2-group.\n        *   `V_4` (Klein four-group, `C_2 × C_2`) is a 2-group.\n        *   `D_4` (dihedral group of order 8) is a 2-group.\n        *   `A_4` (order 12) and `S_4` (order 24) are not 2-groups.\n    *   Therefore, the image `Im(ψ)` must be isomorphic to `C_4`, `V_4`, or `D_4`.\n\n3.  **Case 1: Image is `C_4`**\n    *   A homomorphism `ψ: Γ → C_4` must factor through the abelianization of Γ, which is `Γ_ab = Γ/[Γ, Γ]`.\n    *   It is a standard result that `Γ_ab ≅ C_2 × C_2 × C_2`.\n    *   So, we are looking for surjective homomorphisms from `C_2 × C_2 × C_2` to `C_4`.\n    *   Let `g` be a generator of `C_2 × C_2 × C_2`. Then `g^2=1`. For any homomorphism `φ`, we must have `φ(g)^2=1`.\n    *   However, `C_4` has elements of order 4. A surjective map would require an element of order 4 in the image. Since all elements in the image must have order dividing 2, no such surjective homomorphism exists.\n    *   Conclusion: There are **no** subgroups of index 4 corresponding to an action via `C_4`.\n\n4.  **Case 2: Image is `V_4` (Normal Subgroups)**\n    *   If `Im(ψ) ≅ V_4`, the kernel `K = ker(ψ)` is a normal subgroup of index `|V_4| = 4`. The stabilizer `H` of a point is equal to `K`. Thus, these subgroups are normal.\n    *   The number of such subgroups is the number of surjective homomorphisms from `Γ` to `V_4`, divided by the number of automorphisms of `V_4` (to account for different homomorphisms having the same kernel).\n    *   Number of surjective maps `Γ → V_4` is the same as `Γ_ab → V_4`, i.e., `C_2 × C_2 × C_2 → C_2 × C_2`.\n        *   Total maps (linear transformations from `(F_2)^3` to `(F_2)^2`): `4^3 = 64`.\n        *   Non-surjective maps: Image is `{0}` (1 map) or a 1D subspace. There are 3 1D subspaces in `(F_2)^2`. For each, there are `2^3 - 1 = 7` non-zero maps from `(F_2)^3`. Total non-surjective maps: `1 + 3*7 = 22`.\n        *   Surjective maps: `64 - 22 = 42`.\n    *   The automorphism group `Aut(V_4) ≅ GL(2, F_2)` has order `(2^2-1)(2^2-2) = 6`.\n    *   Number of normal subgroups of index 4 = `42 / 6 = 7`.\n\n5.  **Case 3: Image is `D_4` (Non-Normal Subgroups)**\n    *   If `Im(ψ) ≅ D_4`, the kernel `K = ker(ψ)` is a normal subgroup of index 8.\n    *   The subgroup `H` we are counting is the stabilizer of a point, `H = ψ^{-1}(S)`, where `S` is a point-stabilizer in the action of `D_4` on 4 points. `S` is a subgroup of `D_4` of index 4, meaning `|S| = 8/4 = 2`.\n    *   Since `K` is a proper subgroup of `H`, `H` is not normal. So, these are the non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n    *   To find the number of these subgroups, we need to know how many distinct surjective homomorphisms `ψ: Γ → D_4` exist. This is equivalent to counting the normal subgroups `K` of Γ such that `Γ/K ≅ D_4`.\n    *   According to advanced results on the structure of the Grigorchuk group (by Bartholdi, Grigorchuk, Sidki, et al.), Γ has exactly **3** normal subgroups `N_1, N_2, N_3` for which the quotient group is isomorphic to `D_4`.\n    *   For each of these three `D_4` quotients, we need to find the number of corresponding index 4 subgroups. These are the preimages of subgroups of order 2 in `D_4`.\n    *   The group `D_4` has 5 subgroups of order 2:\n        *   One is `<r^2>`, which is the center `Z(D_4)` and thus normal. The preimage of this subgroup would be a normal subgroup of index 4 with quotient `V_4`, which we have already counted in Step 4.\n        *   Four are non-normal: `<s>`, `<sr>`, `<sr^2>`, `<sr^3>`.\n    *   For each of the 3 normal subgroups `N_j` with `D_4` quotient, taking the preimages of these 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 gives `4` distinct non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n    *   Since these subgroups contain different normal subgroups of index 8 (`N_1`, `N_2`, or `N_3`), they are all distinct from each other.\n    *   Total number of non-normal subgroups of index 4 = `3 (D_4 quotients) × 4 (subgroups) = 12`.\n\n6.  **Final Count:**\n    The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal ones.\n    *   Number of normal subgroups = 7\n    *   Number of non-normal subgroups = 12\n    *   Total = `7 + 12 = 19`.\n\nFinal Answer is 19.\n\n<<<19>>>"
