    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integrand**\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is of the form `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Antiderivative**\n\nWe know that the integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)| + C`.\nSo, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we use the formula:\n`∫[a, b] g(x) dx = G(b) - G(a)`, where `G'(x) = g(x)`.\n\nIn our case, `g(x) = F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` and `G(x) = ln|F₃(x)|`. The limits are `a=0` and `b=1`.\nTherefore, the value of the integral `V` is:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\n\nWe are given the definitions of the functions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\nNow, let's substitute `x = 0`:\n*   `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\n\nNow, let's substitute `x = 1`. **Careful point:** The argument of the sine function is in radians.\n*   `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n*   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Check the Sign of F₃(x) on the Interval [0, 1]**\n\n*   For `x` in `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is in `[sin(0), sin(1)]`, which is `[0, sin(1)]`. Since `sin(1)` is positive, `sin(x) ≥ 0`.\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(sin(x))` is therefore `≥ e⁰ = 1`.\n*   `1 + F₂(x) ≥ 2`.\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) ≥ ln(2)`.\nSince `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`. This means we can drop the absolute value signs. `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute the Values to Find V**\n\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 8: Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we need to calculate the numerical value of V.\n*   `sin(1)` (in radians) ≈ 0.84147\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147` ≈ 2.31977\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 1 + 2.31977 = 3.31977\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(3.31977)` ≈ 1.20000\n*   `ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n*   `[ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)]` ≈ 1.20000 / 0.69315 ≈ 1.73125\n*   `V = ln(1.73125)` ≈ 0.54888\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the Final Requested Value**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54888 = 5488.8`\n\nThe closest integer to 5488.8 is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
