    "This problem requires us to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length and find the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program to solve it.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Input:** Two strings, `s1` and `s2`, of the same length. The length is between 1 and 100. The strings are provided on two separate lines.\n2.  **Comparison Logic:** The comparison must be lexicographical, meaning it proceeds character by character from left to right. The comparison must also be case-insensitive, meaning 'a' is treated as equal to 'A'.\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if `s1` comes before `s2`.\n    *   \"1\" if `s1` comes after `s2`.\n    *   \"0\" if they are equivalent.\n4.  **Primary Constraint:** The solution must be the *most memory-efficient*. This means we need to minimize the total size of variables declared in the C program. We must then calculate this total memory usage in bytes.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Memory Optimization:** The most straightforward approach is to declare two character arrays, `char s1[101]` and `char s2[101]`, read both strings, and then compare them. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the strings. The key to memory efficiency is to determine if we can avoid storing both strings simultaneously.\n2.  **Input Stream Behavior:** Standard input is a single, sequential stream. The two strings appear as `string1\\nstring2`. When we read a character from the second string, `s2[i]`, the corresponding character from the first string, `s1[i]`, has already been consumed from the stream and is no longer accessible unless it was stored in memory.\n3.  **Minimal Storage Requirement:** Based on the point above, it's impossible to solve the problem without storing at least one of the strings. The most memory-efficient strategy is therefore to store only one string and process the second string character by character as it's read from the input.\n4.  **Data Type Selection:** To minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible data type for each variable.\n    *   A character is stored in a `char` (1 byte).\n    *   An index for a string of length 100 needs to count from 0 to 99. An `int` (typically 4 bytes) is overkill. An `unsigned char` (1 byte, range 0-255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient.\n5.  **Handling the Newline:** When reading the first string with `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`, the newline character `\\n` that separates the two strings is left in the input buffer. If we then try to read the second string character by character with `getchar()`, the first character we read will be this newline. It must be consumed and ignored.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer (Most Memory-Efficient Solution)\n\nHere is the step-by-step logic for the most memory-efficient C program and its memory calculation:\n\n1.  **Store the First String:** We must store the first string to compare against the second. The maximum length is 100, and C strings require a null terminator (`\\0`), so the buffer must be 101 characters.\n    *   `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory used: **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Read the Second String Character by Character:** We will read the second string from the input stream one character at a time, without storing the whole string. We need a variable to hold the currently read character.\n    *   `char c2;`\n    *   Memory used: **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Use an Index for the First String:** We need an index to access the characters of the stored string `s1` in order. As established, this index will range from 0 to 99. An `unsigned char` is the most memory-efficient data type for this.\n    *   `unsigned char i = 0;`\n    *   Memory used: **1 byte**.\n\n4.  **Algorithm Outline:**\n    a. Read the entire first string into `s1`.\n    b. Read and discard the single newline character separating the two lines of input.\n    c. Loop, reading one character `c2` of the second string at a time.\n    d. In each iteration, convert `s1[i]` and `c2` to lowercase and compare them.\n    e. If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`, print \"-1\" and terminate.\n    f. If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)`, print \"1\" and terminate.\n    g. Increment the index `i`.\n    h. If the loop finishes (i.e., all characters of the second string have been processed) without any differences found, print \"0\".\n\n5.  **Total Memory Calculation:** The total memory `m` used by the variables in this optimal program is the sum of the memory for each declaration.\n    *   `s1` buffer: 101 bytes\n    *   `c2` character variable: 1 byte\n    *   `i` index variable: 1 byte\n    *   **Total Memory (m) = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.**\n\nThis approach successfully solves the problem while adhering to the constraint of being maximally memory-efficient by only storing the necessary data.\n\n<<<103>>>"
