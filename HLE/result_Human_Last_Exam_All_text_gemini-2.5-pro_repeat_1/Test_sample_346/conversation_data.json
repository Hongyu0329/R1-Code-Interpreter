    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `log_2(n)`, where `n` is the Church integer represented by a given SKI combinator expression. We need to evaluate the expression to find the integer `n`.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the SKI Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\nThe basic reduction rules for the combinators are:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\nA Church numeral `n` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\n*   `n f x = f(f(...f(x)...)) = f^n(x)`\n*   `0 f x = x` (e.g., `K I`)\n*   `1 f x = f x` (e.g., `I`)\n*   `2 f x = f(f x)`\n\n### **Step 3: Deconstruct the Given Expression**\n\nThe expression is:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break this down into more manageable parts by identifying known patterns.\n\n1.  **The Successor Function (`SUCC`)**:\n    The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is a known representation of the successor function for Church numerals. Let's verify this.\n    *   Let `B = S(K S)K`. This is the composition combinator: `B f g x = S(KS)K f g x = (KSf)(Kf) g x = S(Kf) g x = (Kf x)(g x) = f(g x)`.\n    *   Let `SUCC = S B = S(S(KS)K)`.\n    *   Applying `SUCC` to a Church numeral `k`:\n        `SUCC k f x = (S B k) f x = B f (k f) x = f((k f) x)`\n    *   Since `k f x = f^k(x)`, then `f((k f) x) = f(f^k(x)) = f^(k+1)(x)`.\n    *   This shows that `SUCC k` is indeed the Church numeral `k+1`.\n\n2.  **Rewriting the Expression**:\n    Using `SUCC`, we can rewrite `E` as:\n    `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`\n    where:\n    *   `A = SUCC(I)`\n    *   `B = SUCC(S(I)(I))`\n\n### **Step 4: Reduce the Main Structure of the Expression**\n\nThe expression `E` has the form `S I M N`, where `M = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))` and `N = B`. Let's reduce this structure.\n*   `S I M N` reduces to `I N (M N)`, which further reduces to `N (M N)`.\n*   The Church integer `n` is therefore represented by `N (M N)`. Let's evaluate this.\n*   `M N = S(I)(S(I)(K(A))) N`\n    *   `= I N ( (S(I)(K(A))) N ) = N ( (S(I)(K(A))) N )`\n    *   `= N ( I N ( (K A) N ) ) = N ( N ( (K A) N ) )`\n    *   `= N ( N ( A ) )`\n*   So, the full expression for `n` is `N ( M N ) = N ( N ( N ( A ) ) )`.\n\n### **Step 5: Interpret the Application of Church Numerals**\n\nIn the context of Church numerals, applying one numeral `m` to another `k`, written as `m k`, corresponds to function composition (`m o k`). This composition results in the multiplication of the numbers they represent.\n*   `(m k) f x = (m o k) f x = m(k f)x`\n*   `m(k f)x = (k f)^m x`. Since `k f` applies `f` `k` times, applying `k f` `m` times results in applying `f` `m*k` times. So, `m k` represents the Church numeral `m * k`.\n\nTherefore, the expression `n = B (B (B A))` represents the numeral `B * B * B * A`.\n\n### **Step 6: Evaluate the Numerals A and B**\n\n1.  **Evaluating A**:\n    *   `A = SUCC(I)`\n    *   The combinator `I` is the Church numeral for `1` (`I f x = f x`).\n    *   `A = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Evaluating B**:\n    *   `B = SUCC(S(I)(I))`\n    *   This requires us to identify the Church numeral for `S(I)(I)`.\n    *   Let's analyze `S(I)(I)`: `S I I x = I x (I x) = x x`.\n    *   Applying this to `f` and `x` gives `(S I I) f x = (f f) x`. This is not a standard Church numeral, which should have the form `f^k(x)`.\n\n3.  **Resolving the `S(I)(I)` Anomaly**:\n    *   The expression `S(I)(I)` not being a standard Church numeral suggests it might be a typo in the problem statement. A very common and plausible typo involves confusing `I` and `K`.\n    *   Let's consider the expression `S(K)(K)`. `S K K x = K x (K x) = x`. Thus, `S(K)(K) = I`.\n    *   The expression `S(K)(K)` is a standard way to construct `I` from `S` and `K`, and it represents the Church numeral `1`.\n    *   Assuming `S(I)(I)` is a typo for `S(K)(K)`, then we have `S(I)(I) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Recalculating B**:\n    *   With this correction, `B = SUCC(1) = 2`.\n\n### **Step 7: Calculate the Final Value of n and log_2(n)**\n\nNow we have the values for the numerals `A` and `B`:\n*   `A = 2`\n*   `B = 2`\n\nThe expression for `n` is `B * B * B * A`.\n*   `n = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16`\n\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n*   `log_2(16) = 4`"
