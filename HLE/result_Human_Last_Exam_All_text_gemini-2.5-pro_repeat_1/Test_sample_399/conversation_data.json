    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{g(x)} = f(t)dt$.\n\n**2. Separate the variables.**\nTo separate the variables, we move all terms involving $x$ to the left side and all terms involving $t$ to the right side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt $$\n**Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we assume $x \\neq 0$. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The ODE becomes $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is true. So, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant zero solution, and we can safely proceed with the division.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides.**\nWe integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   The left-hand side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The right-hand side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution in implicit form, where $C$ is the constant of integration:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n**Careful Point:** Be careful with the signs.\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n\n**5. Write down the particular solution.**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1).**\nWe need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, to find $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
