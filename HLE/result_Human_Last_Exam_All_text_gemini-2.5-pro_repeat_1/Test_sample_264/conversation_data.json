    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Setting up the Coordinate System and Defining the Cubes**\n\nFirst, let's define the position and orientation of the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\n*   Let the first cube, **Cube A**, be an axis-aligned cube with a side length of 1. We can place its vertices at coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are either 0 or 1. This means Cube A occupies the region defined by the inequalities:\n    *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n    *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n*   The volume of Cube A is `1 × 1 × 1 = 1`.\n\n**2. Understanding the Shift and Defining the Second Cube**\n\nThe second cube, **Cube B**, is identical to Cube A but is shifted relative to it.\n*   The shift is specified as being \"along the main diagonal\". For Cube A defined above, the main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   Any shift along this diagonal will be represented by a displacement vector **v** that is a multiple of **d**. So, **v** = (s, s, s) for some constant `s`.\n*   Cube B is thus the region occupied by Cube A after being translated by the vector **v**. Its region is defined by:\n    *   `s ≤ x ≤ 1 + s`\n    *   `s ≤ y ≤ 1 + s`\n    *   `s ≤ z ≤ 1 + s`\n\n**3. Careful Point: Interpreting the Shift Amount \"1/2\"**\n\nThis is the most critical step, as the phrase \"shifted by 1/2\" is ambiguous. There are two primary interpretations:\n\n*   **Interpretation A (Literal Distance):** The magnitude (length) of the displacement vector **v** is 1/2. The length of **v** = (s, s, s) is `||v|| = sqrt(s² + s² + s²) = s√3`. If `||v|| = 1/2`, then `s√3 = 1/2`, which gives `s = 1 / (2√3)`. This would result in a complex, irrational answer for the volume.\n\n*   **Interpretation B (Component-wise Shift):** In the context of geometry problems designed to have \"clean\" solutions, the phrase is often intended to mean that the components of the shift vector are 1/2. This means `s = 1/2`. The displacement vector would be **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The actual shift distance in this case would be `(1/2)√3 = √3 / 2`. This interpretation corresponds to shifting one cube so that its center, initially at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), moves to the location of the other cube's vertex at (1, 1, 1). This is a geometrically significant alignment and leads to a simple, rational result.\n\nGiven the typical nature of such problems, we will proceed with **Interpretation B**, as it is the most plausible one intended by the question setter.\n\n**4. Finding the Region of Intersection**\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. Let's find the boundaries of this intersection.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** A point in the intersection must satisfy both `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` (for Cube A) and `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2` (for Cube B). The common interval for `x` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** Similarly, a point must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`. The common interval for `y` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** A point must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`. The common interval for `z` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Volume of the Intersection**\n\nThe region of intersection is defined by the inequalities:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\nThis describes a new, smaller cube.\n*   The side length of this intersection cube is the length of each interval: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   The volume of a cube is calculated as `(side length)³`.\n*   Volume of Intersection = `(1/2)³ = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
