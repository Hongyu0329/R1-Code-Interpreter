    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the definitions of a product-free set and maximality in the context of finite group theory.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse for each element.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This is equivalent to the condition `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, where `S.S = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n*   **Set of Size 2:** We are looking for a product-free set `S = {a, b}` where `a ≠ b`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and `S = {a, b}` be a subset of `G`.\n\n**Condition 1: S = {a, b} is product-free.**\nThis implies that the set of products `S.S = {a^2, b^2, ab, ba}` must be disjoint from `S`.\nThis leads to the following inequalities:\n*   `a^2 ≠ a` and `b^2 ≠ b`, which means `a` and `b` are not the identity element `e`.\n*   `ab ≠ a` and `ab ≠ b`, which also implies `a` and `b` are not `e`.\n*   `a^2 ≠ b` and `b^2 ≠ a`.\n*   `ab ≠ b` and `ba ≠ a` (implies `a,b ≠ e`). `ab ≠ a` and `ba ≠ b` (implies `a,b ≠ e`). We also require `ab, ba` not to be `b` or `a`. Let's recheck this. `ab=b` implies `a=e`. `ab=a` implies `b=e`. `ba=a` implies `b=e`. `ba=b` implies `a=e`.\nThe complete conditions for `S={a,b}` to be product-free are:\n1.  `a ≠ b`\n2.  `a, b ≠ e`\n3.  `a^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n4.  `b^2 ∉ {a, b}`\n5.  `ab ∉ {a, b}`\n6.  `ba ∉ {a, b}`\n\n**Condition 2: S = {a, b} is maximal.**\nThis means for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is *not* product-free.\nSince `S` is product-free, any product `xy=z` with `x,y,z ∈ S'` must involve `g`. This leads to two main scenarios for `g`:\n*   `g` is a product of elements from `S`: `g ∈ S.S = {a^2, b^2, ab, ba}`.\n*   A product involving `g` falls into `S'`:\n    *   `ag ∈ S'`: `ag=a` (impossible, `g≠e`), `ag=b`, `ag=g` (impossible, `a≠e`).\n    *   `ga ∈ S'`: Similar logic gives `ga=b`.\n    *   `bg ∈ S'`: Gives `bg=a`.\n    *   `gb ∈ S'`: Gives `gb=a`.\n    *   `g^2 ∈ S'`: `g^2=a`, `g^2=b`, or `g^2=g` (`g=e`).\n\nLet's test finite groups to see which ones satisfy these conditions for some set `S`. We will go through small groups and check for the existence of such a set.\n\n*   **C_2 = {e, a}**: No subset of size 2.\n*   **C_3 = {e, c, c^2}**: The only subset of size 2 is `S = {c, c^2}`. The product `c*c = c^2` is in `S`. So `S` is not product-free. `C_3` has no product-free sets of size 2.\n*   **C_4 = {e, c, c^2, c^3}**: Let `S = {c, c^3}`. `S.S = {c^2, c^6=c^2, c^4=e} = {e, c^2}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, so `S` is product-free.\n    To check maximality, consider `g ∈ G \\ S = {e, c^2}`.\n    If `g=e`, `S ∪ {e}` is not p.f. because `c*c^3=e`.\n    If `g=c^2`, `S ∪ {c^2}` is not p.f. because `c*c=c^2`.\n    So, `S = {c, c^3}` is a maximal product-free set of size 2. Thus, **C_4** is a solution.\n*   **C_2 x C_2 = {e, a, b, ab}**: Let `S = {a, b}`. `S.S = {a^2=e, b^2=e, ab, ba=ab} = {e, ab}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, so `S` is product-free.\n    `G \\ S = {e, ab}`.\n    If `g=e`, `S ∪ {e}` is not p.f. as `a*a=e`.\n    If `g=ab`, `S ∪ {ab}` is not p.f. as `a*b=ab`.\n    So `S = {a, b}` is maximal. Thus, **C_2 x C_2** is a solution.\n*   **C_5 = {e, c, c^2, c^3, c^4}**: Let `S = {c, c^4}`. `S.S = {c^2, c^8=c^3, e}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, so `S` is product-free.\n    `G \\ S = {e, c^2, c^3}`.\n    `g=e`: `c*c^4=e`. `g=c^2`: `c*c=c^2`. `g=c^3`: `c^4*c^4=c^8=c^3`.\n    In all cases, `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. `S` is maximal. Thus, **C_5** is a solution.\n*   **S_3** (Dihedral group D_6, order 6): Let `a=(12)` and `b=(123)`. `S={a,b}`.\n    `S.S = {a^2, b^2, ab, ba} = {e, (132), (12)(123)=(23), (123)(12)=(13)}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`, so `S` is p.f.\n    `G \\ S = {e, (13), (23), (132)}`. These are exactly the elements of `S.S`.\n    For any `g ∈ G\\S`, `g` is a product of elements from `S`, so `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. `S` is maximal. Thus, **S_3** is a solution.\n*   **C_6 = {e, c, ..., c^5}**: Let `S = {c^3, c^2}`. `a=c³` (order 2), `b=c²` (order 3).\n    `S.S = {a^2, b^2, ab, ba} = {e, c^4, c^5, c^5} = {e, c^4, c^5}`. `S.S ∩ S = ∅`. `S` is p.f.\n    `G \\ S = {e, c, c^4, c^5}`.\n    `g=e`: `(c³)²=e`. `g=c`: `c*c=c² ∈ S`. `g=c⁴`: `c²*c²=c⁴`. `g=c⁵`: `c³*c²=c⁵`.\n    `S` is maximal. Thus, **C_6** is a solution.\n*   **C_7**: Similar to `C_5`, `S = {c, c^6}` is a maximal p.f. set. `S.S = {e, c^2, c^5}`. `G\\S = {e, c^2, c^3, c^4, c^5}`. `g=e` (from `c*c^6`), `g=c^2` (from `c*c`), `g=c^3` (from `c^6*c^4`, no wait... `c^4*c^4=c^8=c ∈ S`!), `g=c^4` (from `c^2*c^2=c^4`, wait, `c^2` is not in S'), `g=c^5` (from `c^6*c^6=c^12=c^5`). Let's check `g=c^3`: `(c^5)^2 = c^{10}=c^3`... no. `(c^3)^2 = c^6 \\in S`. For `g=c^4`, `(c^2)^2=c^4`... `(c^4)^2=c \\in S`.\n    Let's recheck `C_7`: `S={c, c^6}`. `G\\S={e,c^2,c^3,c^4,c^5}`.\n    `g=e`: `c*c^6=e`. `g=c^2`: `c*c=c^2`. `g=c^3`: `(c^3)^2=c^6 \\in S`. `g=c^4`: `(c^4)^2=c \\in S`. `g=c^5`: `(c^6)^2=c^5`.\n    `S` is maximal. Thus, **C_7** is a solution.\n*   **C_8**: Let `S = {c^2, c^6}`. This set consists of the elements of order 4. `S.S = {c^4, e}`. `S` is p.f.\n    `G\\S = {e, c, c^3, c^4, c^5, c^7}`.\n    For each `g ∈ G\\S`, we can show `S ∪ {g}` is not p.f. For example, `g=c`: `c*c=c^2 \\in S`. `g=c^3`: `c^3*c^3=c^6 \\in S`. `g=c^5`: `c^5*c^5=c^{10}=c^2 \\in S`. `g=c^7`: `c^7*c^7=c^{14}=c^6 \\in S`. `g=e` and `g=c^4` are in `S.S`.\n    `S` is maximal. Thus, **C_8** is a solution.\n*   **D_8** (Dihedral group of order 8, also `D_4`): It can be shown that no set of size 2 is maximal. For any candidate set `S={a,b}`, one can always find an element `g` such that `S U {g}` is still product-free. For example, `S={s,r}` is product-free, but `S U {r³}` is also product-free. `S={s,sr}` is product-free, but `S U {r²}` is also product-free.\n*   **Q_8** (Quaternion group): Similarly, it can be shown that `Q_8` has no maximal product-free sets of size 2.\n\nThe analysis yields 7 such groups up to isomorphism. The list is: `C_4`, `C_2 x C_2`, `C_5`, `S_3`, `C_6`, `C_7`, `C_8`.\n\nFinal count: There are 7 such finite groups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
