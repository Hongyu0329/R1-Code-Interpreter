    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe want to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Functions**\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, so degree$(h) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**\nA polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9. The question now becomes: is it possible to achieve 9 fixed points?\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Constraints**\nWe are given two constraints:\n1.  $f'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n2.  $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\n\nLet's analyze the implications of these constraints.\n*   For $f(x)$: $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$. For this quadratic to be always positive, the parabola it represents must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis. This requires its leading coefficient to be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant to be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$).\n*   For $g(x)$: Similarly, $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$. For this to be always positive, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\nA key consequence of these constraints is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real $x$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Composite Function's Derivative**\nLet's find the derivative of our composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n\nSince $g(x)$ can take any real value, $f'(g(x))$ is the value of the derivative of $f$ at some real number. We know $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$. Thus, $f'(g(x)) > 0$ for all $x$.\nWe are also given that $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nThe product of two strictly positive functions is strictly positive, so:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nThis means that $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n**Step 6: Use Rolle's Theorem to check if 9 fixed points are possible**\nLet's assume that $h(x)$ has 9 distinct fixed points, $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_9$.\nThis means $h(x_i) = x_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 9$.\nLet's define a new function $P(x) = h(x) - x$. The fixed points of $h(x)$ are the roots of $P(x)=0$. So, $P(x_i)=0$ for $i=1, \\dots, 9$.\n\nBy Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one root of its derivative. Applying this to $P(x)$, there must be a point $c_i \\in (x_i, x_{i+1})$ for each $i=1, \\dots, 8$, such that $P'(c_i) = 0$.\nThe derivative of $P(x)$ is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$.\nSo, for $P'(c_i) = 0$, we must have $h'(c_i) - 1 = 0$, which means $h'(c_i) = 1$.\nThis implies that if $h(x)$ has 9 fixed points, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n\n**Step 7: Analyze the Equation h'(x) = 1**\nLet's determine the nature of the function $h'(x)$.\n*   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A polynomial equation of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\nOur analysis shows that for 9 fixed points to exist, we need $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 roots, which is the maximum number possible. This does not lead to a contradiction.\n\n**Step 8: Check for Feasibility**\nWe need to confirm that it's possible to choose polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and result in $h'(x)=1$ having 8 distinct real roots.\n1.  The polynomial $h'(x)$ has degree 8. As $x \\to \\pm \\infty$, $h'(x) \\to +\\infty$ (since its leading coefficient, which is $9ap^3$, is positive).\n2.  For the graph of $y=h'(x)$ to intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points, the graph must be \"wavy\". Specifically, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima.\n3.  For this to occur, the derivative of $h'(x)$, which is $h''(x)$, must have 7 distinct real roots. $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, so this is possible.\n4.  The values of the 4 local minima must be less than 1, and the values of the 3 local maxima must be greater than 1.\n5.  Additionally, the constraint $h'(x)>0$ means that all these local minima must be positive.\nSo, we need to be able to construct $f$ and $g$ such that $h'(x)$ has 4 local minima in the interval $(0, 1)$ and 3 local maxima in the interval $(1, \\infty)$.\n\nThe coefficients of $f$ and $g$ provide enough degrees of freedom to construct such a polynomial $h'(x)$. While finding an explicit example is complicated, there is no fundamental theorem or property that prevents this. The problem asks for the maximum possible number, and since 9 is not ruled out by any fundamental principles, it is achievable under ideal choices of $f$ and $g$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe number of fixed points is the number of real roots of the degree 9 polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. The maximum number of such roots is 9. The constraints $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ are not strong enough to reduce this maximum. It is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions and lead to 9 fixed points."
