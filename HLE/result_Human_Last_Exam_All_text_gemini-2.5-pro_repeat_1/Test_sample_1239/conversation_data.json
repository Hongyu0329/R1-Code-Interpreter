    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations involves finding the Lie group of transformations under which the equations remain invariant. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of this group.\n\n**Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations**\n\nIn three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbb{R}^3$), the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}) = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ and the pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ are given by the system:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $t$ is time, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ are the spatial coordinates, and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. The independent variables are $(t, x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and the dependent variables are $(u_1, u_2, u_3, p)$.\n\n**Step 2: Lie Group of Symmetries and Infinitesimal Generators**\n\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the equations to another solution. The dimension of the Lie group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of these transformations. We list the infinitesimal generators for the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of Symmetry Generators**\n\nThe full Lie algebra of point symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations is found by solving the determining equations derived from the invariance condition. This is a classic result in the field of group analysis of differential equations. The resulting Lie algebra consists of a finite-dimensional part and an infinite-dimensional part.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Finite-dimensional Symmetries**\nThe finite-dimensional part of the Lie algebra is spanned by generators corresponding to physical and scaling symmetries:\n\n1.  **Time Translation (1 dimension):** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$).\n    *   Transformation: $t' = t + s$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n\n2.  **Space Translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under translation in space.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + s\\mathbf{a}$\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are isotropic (invariant under rotations).\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = R\\mathbf{u}$ (where $R \\in SO(3)$)\n    *   Generators: $\\epsilon_{ijk}(x_j \\partial_{x_k} + u_j \\partial_{u_k})$\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + s\\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} + s\\mathbf{v}$\n    *   Generators: $t\\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n\n5.  **Scaling (or Dilation) (1 dimension):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry that relates solutions at different length and time scales.\n    *   Transformation: $t' = \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x}' = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = \\lambda^{-1}\\mathbf{u}, p' = \\lambda^{-2} p$\n    *   Generator: $2t\\partial_t + x_i\\partial_{x_i} - u_i\\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$ (summation over $i$ is implied).\n\nSumming the dimensions of these finite-dimensional symmetry groups:\n$1 (\\text{time}) + 3 (\\text{space}) + 3 (\\text{rotations}) + 3 (\\text{boosts}) + 1 (\\text{scaling}) = 11$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Infinite-dimensional Symmetry**\nThere is an additional symmetry that gives rise to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra.\n\n*   **Pressure Shift (infinite dimensions):** The pressure $p$ only appears under a gradient in the momentum equation and not at all in the incompressibility condition. This means one can add an arbitrary function of time to the pressure without altering the equations.\n    *   Transformation: $p' = p + h(t)$, where $h(t)$ is an arbitrary function.\n    *   Generators: $h(t)\\partial_p$. Since $h(t)$ is arbitrary, this part of the algebra is infinite-dimensional (it can be spanned by a basis like $\\{t^n \\partial_p\\}_{n=0}^\\infty$).\n\n**Step 4: Interpreting the Question**\n\nThe full Lie group of symmetries is infinite-dimensional. However, in physics and applied mathematics, when asked for \"the dimension\" of the symmetry group, it is a common convention to refer to the dimension of the maximal **finite-dimensional** subalgebra of \"non-trivial\" or \"geometric\" symmetries. The infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure is often considered a \"trivial\" or \"gauge-like\" symmetry and is treated separately. This is because it reflects a redundancy in the description of the system (pressure is only defined up to an additive function of time) rather than a fundamental spatio-temporal symmetry.\n\nIf the question were to be interpreted in the strictest mathematical sense, the answer would be infinity. But given the context of such problems, the question is most likely asking for the dimension of the finite-dimensional algebra described in Step 3.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Calculation**\n\nBased on the standard interpretation, we count the dimensions of the finite-dimensional generators:\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n<<<11>>>"
