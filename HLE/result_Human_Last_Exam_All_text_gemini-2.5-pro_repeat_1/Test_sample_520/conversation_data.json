    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure and Context:** The question concerns Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee who arrived in the United Kingdom during World War II. He was processed and interrogated by British counter-intelligence, specifically MI5, to ensure he was not an enemy agent.\n\n2.  **Understand the Core Problem:** Vernault was suspected of being a German spy. The reason for this suspicion, as stated in the question, was his concealment of his \"true profession\" from his interrogators. This implies his profession was unusual, sensitive, or something he was unwilling to discuss.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interrogators' Perspective:** For a counter-intelligence officer in wartime, any individual arriving from enemy-occupied territory who is evasive, tells inconsistent stories, or cannot provide a clear account of their past is a major red flag. This behavior is precisely what one would expect from a trained spy trying to protect their cover story. Vernault's refusal to be forthcoming fit this profile perfectly.\n\n4.  **Analyze Vernault's Motivation:** The key is to understand *why* Vernault would hide his profession. It wasn't because he was a spy, but because he was deeply embarrassed and ashamed of it. He believed revealing his line of work would lead to ridicule, judgment, and a loss of dignity, especially in front of the formal, military interrogators.\n\n5.  **Identify the True Profession:** Historical accounts, notably from sources like Ben Macintyre's book \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies,\" which draws on declassified MI5 files, reveal Andre Vernault's actual occupation. He worked as a **masseur whose clients were exclusively wealthy, elderly women**. This role is more colloquially described as a **gigolo** or male prostitute.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Information:** Vernault's shame over his profession as a gigolo led him to be evasive and dishonest during his interrogation. MI5, interpreting this evasiveness through the lens of counter-espionage, concluded that he was hiding a sinister secret, such as being a German agent. This misunderstanding, born from a clash between personal shame and professional suspicion, resulted in him being wrongly interned.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Setting:** The interrogations took place at centers like the Royal Victoria Patriotic School, which were designed to systematically vet thousands of refugees. The atmosphere was one of high stakes and suspicion.\n*   **The Misinterpretation:** This case is a classic example of misinterpreting evidence. Vernault's behavior (lying, evasion) was real, but the *reason* for it was misjudged by the authorities.\n*   **The Social Taboo:** In the 1940s, the profession of a gigolo was highly stigmatized and not something a man would readily admit to in any formal setting, let alone a wartime security interrogation.\n*   **The Outcome:** The false suspicion had real consequences for Vernault, who was detained for a considerable time based on this incorrect assessment.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the profession that Andre Vernault concealed.\n\n***\n\nHis true profession was a masseur for wealthy, elderly women, a role also known as a gigolo.\n\n<<<Masseur for wealthy women / Gigolo>>>"
