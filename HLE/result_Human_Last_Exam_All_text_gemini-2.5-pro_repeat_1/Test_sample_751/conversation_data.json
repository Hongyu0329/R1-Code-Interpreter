    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Duality Principle\n\nThe problem asks to reduce the system (A, C) to the observer canonical form (OCF). The principle of duality states that a system (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) is controllable. Furthermore, we can find the OCF of the original system by finding the Controller Canonical Form (CCF) of the dual system and then transposing the resulting matrices.\n\nIf the transformation T reduces the dual system (Aᵀ, Cᵀ) to CCF (A_c, B_c), then:\n*   `A_c = T⁻¹ Aᵀ T`\n*   `B_c = T⁻¹ Cᵀ`\n\nThe matrices for the OCF of the original system, (A_o, C_o), are then given by:\n*   `A_o = A_cᵀ`\n*   `C_o = B_cᵀ`\n\n### Step 2: Define the Original and Dual Systems\n\n**Original System:**\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`, `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\n**Dual System:**\nThe matrices for the dual system are `A_d = Aᵀ` and `B_d = Cᵀ`.\n`A_d = Aᵀ = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = Cᵀ = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n### Step 3: Transform the Dual System to Controller Canonical Form (CCF)\n\nThe dual system is a multi-input system since `B_d` has two columns. To find a CCF, we can select one input vector from `B_d` and check if the pair `(A_d, b_i)` is controllable. Let's choose the first column of `B_d`, which we'll call `b1`.\n\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]ᵀ`\n\n**a. Check Controllability of (A_d, b1):**\nThe controllability matrix is `W_c = [b1, A_d*b1, A_d²*b1]`.\n`A_d*b1 = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [0, 1, 0]ᵀ = [2, 1, 1]ᵀ`\n`A_d²*b1 = A_d * (A_d*b1) = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [2, 1, 1]ᵀ = [4, 5, 1]ᵀ`\n`W_c = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\nThe determinant of `W_c` is `det(W_c) = 0 - 2(1*1 - 5*0) + 4(1*1 - 1*0) = -2 + 4 = 2`.\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the matrix is full rank, and the pair `(A_d, b1)` is controllable. We can proceed with the transformation.\n\n**b. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of A_d:**\n`p(λ) = det(λI - A_d) = det([[λ-1, -2, 0], [-1, λ-1, -2], [0, -1, λ]])`\n`p(λ) = (λ-1)[λ(λ-1) - 2] + 2[-λ] = (λ-1)(λ² - λ - 2) - 2λ`\n`p(λ) = λ³ - λ² - 2λ - λ² + λ + 2 - 2λ = λ³ - 2λ² - 3λ + 2`\nLet the polynomial be `λ³ + a₁λ² + a₂λ + a₃`. Then `a₁ = -2`, `a₂ = -3`, `a₃ = 2`.\n\n**c. Find the Transformation Matrix T⁻¹ (also denoted as Q):**\nWe use Kalman's method to find the transformation matrix `Q = T⁻¹`. The rows of `Q` are calculated as follows:\n`q₃ = [0, 0, 1] * W_c⁻¹`\n`q₂ = q₃ * A_d`\n`q₁ = q₂ * A_d`\n\nFirst, find `W_c⁻¹`:\n`W_c⁻¹ = (1/det(W_c)) * adj(W_c) = (1/2) * [[-4, 2, 6], [-1, 0, 4], [1, 0, -2]]`\n`W_c⁻¹ = [[-2, 1, 3], [-1/2, 0, 2], [1/2, 0, -1]]`\n\nNow, calculate the rows of `Q`:\n`q₃ = [0, 0, 1] * W_c⁻¹ = [1/2, 0, -1]`\n`q₂ = q₃ * A_d = [1/2, 0, -1] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [1/2, 0, 0]`\n`q₁ = q₂ * A_d = [1/2, 0, 0] * [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] = [1/2, 1, 0]`\n\nSo, the transformation matrix `Q = T⁻¹` is:\n`Q = [[1/2, 1, 0], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 0, -1]]`\n\n**d. Calculate the new Input Matrix `B_c`:**\nThe new input matrix for the dual system in CCF is `B_c = Q * B_d`.\n`B_c = [[1/2, 1, 0], [1/2, 0, 0], [1/2, 0, -1]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[(0+1), (1/2+1)], [(0+0), (1/2+0)], [(0+0), (1/2+0)]] = [[1, 3/2], [0, 1/2], [0, 1/2]]`\n\n### Step 4: Find the Matrices for the Observer Canonical Form\n\nThe matrices for the original system in OCF are the transposes of the CCF matrices of the dual system. The question asks for the new matrix C, which is `C_o`.\n\n`C_o = B_cᵀ`\n`C_o = [[1, 3/2], [0, 1/2], [0, 1/2]]ᵀ`\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [3/2, 1/2, 1/2]]`\n\nFor completeness, the new state matrix `A_o` would be `A_cᵀ`. The CCF matrix `A_c` has the form `[[-a₁, -a₂, -a₃], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]` which is `[[2, 3, -2], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]`.\nTherefore, `A_o = A_cᵀ = [[2, 1, 0], [3, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 0]]`.\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is `C_o`.\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]]>>>"
