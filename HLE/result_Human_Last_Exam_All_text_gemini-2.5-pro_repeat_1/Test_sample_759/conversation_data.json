    "An automorphism of a graph $\\gamma$ is a permutation of its vertices that preserves the adjacency structure. The set of all such automorphisms forms the automorphism group, $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. We are looking for the smallest number of edges, $e$, in a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ for which the order of this group is exactly 3, i.e., $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Group Structure**: A group of order 3 is always the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ or $C_3$. This group consists of three elements: the identity ($id$), an element $\\phi$, and its inverse $\\phi^2$, where $\\phi^3 = id$. This means our graph must have a non-trivial automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3, and no other automorphisms besides $\\phi$, $\\phi^2$, and the identity.\n\n2.  **Action of the Automorphism on Vertices**: The automorphism $\\phi$ is a permutation of the vertex set $V$. Since its order is 3, its disjoint cycle decomposition can only contain cycles of length 1 (fixed points) or 3. This means the vertex set $V$ is partitioned into orbits of size 1 or 3 under the action of the group.\n\n3.  **Action of the Automorphism on Edges**: Similarly, the edge set $E$ is partitioned into orbits. The size of any edge orbit must divide the order of the group, so edge orbits can have size 1 or 3. An edge orbit has size 1 if the edge is fixed by $\\phi$. An edge $(u,v)$ is fixed by $\\phi$ if the pair $\\{\\phi(u), \\phi(v)\\}$ is the same as $\\{u,v\\}$. This can only happen if both $u$ and $v$ are fixed points of $\\phi$. If an edge connects vertices that are not both fixed points, it will belong to an orbit of size 3.\n\n4.  **Edge Count ($e$) must be a multiple of 3, or have fixed edges**: If there are no fixed points, or if fixed points are not connected to each other, then there are no fixed edges. In this case, all edge orbits must have size 3, which implies that the total number of edges $e$ must be a multiple of 3. If there are fixed edges (connecting fixed points), $e$ does not need to be a multiple of 3. However, constructions with fixed points often lead to higher symmetry (e.g., swapping the fixed points if they are structurally equivalent). For instance, a simple case with a fixed edge $(u,v)$ and a 3-cycle of vertices $\\{w_1,w_2,w_3\\}$ connected to both $u$ and $v$ results in a graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}|\\geq6$. Thus, we focus on the case where $e$ is a multiple of 3.\n\n5.  **Search for the minimal `e`**: We will test values of $e$ that are multiples of 3, starting from the smallest. The graph must be simple and connected.\n\n    *   **Can $e=3$?** A connected graph with 3 edges can be a path $P_4$ or a cycle $C_3$.\n        *   $P_4$ (path on 4 vertices): $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)|=2$.\n        *   $C_3$ (triangle): $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_3)|=|D_3|=6$.\n        *   No graph with $e=3$ works.\n\n    *   **Can $e=6$?** This would correspond to two edge orbits.\n        *   We need to find a graph with 6 edges and $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=3$. Many standard graphs with 6 edges have higher symmetry (e.g., $C_6$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=12$; the prism graph on 6 vertices has $e=9$).\n        *   Let's try to construct one. Let's use two vertex orbits of size 3, say $O_1=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ and $O_2=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$. The automorphism is $\\phi=(v_1,v_2,v_3)(u_1,u_2,u_3)$. We need 2 edge orbits. A common attempt is to connect $O_1$ and $O_2$. For instance, take edges $\\{(v_i, u_i)\\}$ and $\\{(v_i, u_{i+1})\\}$ (indices mod 3). This graph is the 6-cycle $C_6$, with $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=12$. Adding a fixed point and connecting it to orbits also tends to create more symmetry, not less. All attempts to build a suitable graph with $e=6$ fail because they retain reflectional symmetries, leading to an automorphism group of order at least 6.\n\n    *   **Can $e=9$?** This would correspond to three edge orbits.\n        *   Again, we can try to construct such a graph. Let's use vertex orbits $O_1=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$, $O_2=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$. A natural candidate is the triangular prism graph, which has $e=9$. Its automorphism group is $D_3 \\times S_2$, of order 12.\n        *   Other constructions with 9 edges can be made, but they all appear to possess a reflectional symmetry (an automorphism of order 2). For example, the graph with vertex orbits $O_1, O_2$ and edge orbits as a cycle on $O_1$, a \"straight\" connection $\\{(v_i,u_i)\\}$, and a \"twisted\" connection $\\{(v_i, u_{i+1})\\}$, has an automorphism group of order 6. The key challenge is creating a structure that is inherently \"chiral\" or asymmetric enough to forbid any reflections.\n\n    *   **Can $e=12$?** This requires 4 edge orbits. Let's try to construct a graph that breaks all reflectional symmetries.\n        *   Consider a graph with 9 vertices, partitioned into three orbits $A=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\}$, $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$, and $C=\\{c_1,c_2,c_3\\}$. The order-3 automorphism is $\\phi=(a_1,a_2,a_3)(b_1,b_2,b_3)(c_1,c_2,c_3)$.\n        *   Let's define 4 edge orbits, for a total of $e=12$ edges.\n            1.  $\\{(a_i, b_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$: 3 edges connecting A and B.\n            2.  $\\{(b_i, c_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$: 3 edges connecting B and C.\n            3.  $\\{(c_i, a_i) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$: 3 edges connecting C and A. (So far, this is 3 disjoint copies of $C_3$).\n            4.  To make it connected and break symmetry, add a \"twisted\" set of edges: $\\{(a_i, b_{i+1}) \\mid i=1,2,3\\}$ (indices mod 3). This is $\\{(a_1,b_2),(a_2,b_3),(a_3,b_1)\\}$.\n        *   Let's analyze this graph $\\gamma_{12}$:\n            *   **Connected?** Yes. For instance, $a_1$ is connected to $b_1$ and $b_2$. $b_1$ is connected to $c_1$. $c_1$ is connected back to $a_1$. All vertices are part of this structure.\n            *   **Vertex Degrees**:\n                *   $\\deg(c_i)$: connected to $a_i$ and $b_i$. So $\\deg(c_i)=2$.\n                *   $\\deg(a_i)$: connected to $c_i$, $b_i$, and $b_{i+1}$. So $\\deg(a_i)=3$.\n                *   $\\deg(b_i)$: connected to $a_i$, $c_i$, and $a_{i-1}$ (from the edge $(a_{i-1}, b_i)$). So $\\deg(b_i)=3$.\n            *   **Symmetry Analysis**: Any automorphism must preserve degrees. So the set of vertices of degree 2, $C$, must be mapped to itself. The set of vertices of degree 3, $A \\cup B$, must be mapped to itself.\n            *   Can an automorphism swap $A$ and $B$? Let's check the neighborhoods. $N(a_1)=\\{b_1,b_2,c_1\\}$. $N(b_1)=\\{a_1,a_3,c_1\\}$. The number of neighbors in $A$ and $B$ are different. $N(a_1)$ has two B-neighbors and zero A-neighbors. $N(b_1)$ has two A-neighbors and zero B-neighbors. This structural difference, preserved under automorphism, means an automorphism cannot map a vertex in A to a vertex in B. So $A$ and $B$ are invariant sets.\n            *   Thus, any automorphism $\\psi$ must map $A \\to A$, $B \\to B$, and $C \\to C$. This implies that there is a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,2,3\\}$ such that $\\psi(x_i) = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$.\n            *   For $\\psi$ to be an automorphism, it must preserve the edge orbits. The first 3 orbits are preserved by any such permutation $\\sigma$. The 4th orbit, $\\{(a_i, b_{i+1})\\}$, is preserved if and only if for any edge $(a_i,b_{i+1})$, the image $(\\psi(a_i), \\psi(b_{i+1}))=(a_{\\sigma(i)},b_{\\sigma(i+1)})$ is also an edge. This requires $a_{\\sigma(i)}$ to be connected to $b_{\\sigma(i+1)}$. The edges from $a_{\\sigma(i)}$ in this orbit go to $b_{\\sigma(i)+1}$. Thus we must have $\\sigma(i+1) = \\sigma(i)+1 \\pmod 3$. This property only holds if $\\sigma$ is a cyclic permutation, i.e., $\\sigma \\in \\{id, (1,2,3), (1,3,2)\\}$.\n            *   These three permutations correspond exactly to the group $\\{id, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$. No other permutations are allowed. Specifically, reflections like $\\sigma=(1,2)$ are not automorphisms because they do not satisfy $\\sigma(i+1) = \\sigma(i)+1$.\n        *   Therefore, this graph with $e=12$ has $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\nSince we have ruled out $e=3, 6, 9$ (as any such graphs appear to have larger symmetry groups) and found a valid graph with $e=12$, this is the smallest possible value."
