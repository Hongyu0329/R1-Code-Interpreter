    "An internal adjunction in a locally posetal 2-category, such as the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is equivalent to a Galois connection between the corresponding posets.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the context:**\n    *   The simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. These are totally ordered sets (and thus posets).\n    *   Morphisms in $\\Delta$ are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n    *   Viewing $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$ means that for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ pointwise, i.e., $f(k) \\le g(k)$ for all $k \\in [m]$.\n\n2.  **Defining an internal adjunction:**\n    An internal adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in this 2-category consists of:\n    *   A pair of 1-morphisms (order-preserving maps): a \"left adjoint\" $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and a \"right adjoint\" $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n    *   A unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\to R \\circ L$ and a counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$.\n    *   In this posetal context, these 2-morphisms translate to pointwise inequalities:\n        *   Unit: $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(k) \\le (R \\circ L)(k)$ for all $k \\in [m]$, which simplifies to $k \\le R(L(k))$.\n        *   Counit: $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n    *   These two conditions are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. The triangle identities for the adjunction are automatically satisfied in any poset-enriched category.\n\n3.  **Counting Galois connections:**\n    The number of adjunctions is the number of such pairs $(L, R)$. A key property of Galois connections is that the left adjoint $L$ and the right adjoint $R$ uniquely determine each other. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoints $L$ (or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoints $R$).\n\n4.  **Characterizing the adjoint maps:**\n    *   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). Since $[m]$ and $[n]$ are complete lattices, this condition is well-defined. A map preserves joins if and only if it is order-preserving and preserves the join of the empty set.\n        *   In $[m]$, the join of the empty set is the minimum element, $0$.\n        *   In $[n]$, the join of the empty set is the minimum element, $0$.\n        *   Thus, a join-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map satisfying $L(0) = 0$.\n    *   Dually, a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). This means $R$ must be an order-preserving map that preserves the meet of the empty set.\n        *   In $[n]$, the meet of the empty set is the maximum element, $n$.\n        *   In $[m]$, the meet of the empty set is the maximum element, $m$.\n        *   Thus, a meet-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is an order-preserving map satisfying $R(n) = m$.\n\n5.  **Setting up the counting problem:**\n    We need to find the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. So, we have $m=23$ and $n=37$. We can count the number of left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n    *   This is the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0) = 0$.\n    *   An order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values, $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$.\n    *   The conditions are: $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n    *   With the additional constraint $L(0)=0$, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $(L(1), \\dots, L(23))$ where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n    *   The problem becomes: choose 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be arranged into a unique non-decreasing sequence).\n\n6.  **Applying the stars and bars formula:**\n    This is a classic combinatorial problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $s$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $$ \\binom{s+k-1}{k} $$\n    *   Here, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose: $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$).\n    *   The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has size $s = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\n    *   The number of such maps is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n7.  **Verification using the dual approach:**\n    We can also count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   This is the number of order-preserving maps $R$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\n    *   We need to count non-decreasing sequences $(R(0), \\dots, R(36))$ where each element is chosen from $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n    *   Here, $k=37$ (the number of values to choose: $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$).\n    *   The values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has size $s = 23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.\n    *   The number of such maps is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n    *   Using the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n    *   Both approaches yield the same result, confirming the analysis.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
