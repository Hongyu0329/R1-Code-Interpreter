    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**1. Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\n\nWhen Al(OH)3 is added to pure water, two main equilibria involving aluminum occur, in addition to the autoionization of water.\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    `Al(OH)3 (s) <=> Al^3+ (aq) + 3OH^- (aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, `K_sp`.\n    `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n\n*   **Formation of Complex Ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, aluminate.\n    `Al^3+ (aq) + 4OH^- (aq) <=> Al(OH)4^- (aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, `K_f`.\n    `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium.\n    `H2O (l) <=> H^+ (aq) + OH^- (aq)`\n    `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n\n**Careful Point:** We cannot simply use the K_sp expression alone because the formation of the complex ion `Al(OH)4^-` provides an additional pathway for the solid to dissolve, thus increasing the overall solubility. Both aluminum-containing species, `Al^3+` and `Al(OH)4^-`, must be considered.\n\n**2. Define Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nThe total molar solubility, `S`, is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species in the solution.\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n**3. Establish Relationships using Equilibrium Constants**\n\nTo solve for `S`, we first need to find the equilibrium concentration of all species. A good strategy is to express the concentrations of the aluminum species in terms of a single variable, `[OH^-]`.\n\n*   From the `K_sp` expression:\n    `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n\n*   To find an expression for `[Al(OH)4^-]`, we can combine the `K_sp` and `K_f` reactions.\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`  (K_sp)\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)` (K_f)\n    Adding these two reactions is not the right approach. Instead, we can rearrange the K_f expression to include `[Al^3+]`:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4`\n    Now, substitute the expression for `[Al^3+]` from `K_sp`:\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4`\n    `[Al(OH)4^-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]`\n\n**4. Use the Principle of Charge Neutrality**\n\nThe solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the magnitudes of the positive charges must equal the sum of the magnitudes of the negative charges.\n*   Cations (positive ions): `Al^3+`, `H^+`\n*   Anions (negative ions): `Al(OH)4^-`, `OH^-`\n\nThe charge balance equation is:\n`3 * [Al^3+] + 1 * [H^+] = 1 * [Al(OH)4^-] + 1 * [OH^-]`\n\n**Careful Point:** Do not forget the stoichiometric coefficient (the charge of the ion) when writing the charge balance equation.\n\n**5. Solve for [OH-]**\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for `[Al^3+]`, `[Al(OH)4^-]`, and `[H^+] = K_w / [OH^-]` into the charge balance equation. Let `x = [OH^-]`.\n\n`3 * (K_sp / x^3) + (K_w / x) = (K_sp * K_f * x) + x`\n\nTo solve this equation, multiply the entire equation by `x^3` to eliminate the denominators:\n`3 * K_sp + K_w * x^2 = K_sp * K_f * x^4 + x^4`\n\nRearrange this into a standard polynomial form:\n`(1 + K_sp * K_f) * x^4 - K_w * x^2 - 3 * K_sp = 0`\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n`K_sp = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`\n`K_f = 1.1 * 10^31`\n`K_w = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`\n`K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4`\n\nThe equation becomes:\n`(1 + 5.83 * 10^4) * x^4 - (1.0 * 10^(-14)) * x^2 - 3 * (5.3 * 10^(-27)) = 0`\n`(58301) * x^4 - (1.0 * 10^(-14)) * x^2 - (1.59 * 10^(-26)) = 0`\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of `x^2`. Let `y = x^2`.\n`(58301) * y^2 - (1.0 * 10^(-14)) * y - (1.59 * 10^(-26)) = 0`\n\nSolving for `y` using the quadratic formula `y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a`:\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± sqrt((-1.0*10^-14)^2 - 4(58301)(-1.59*10^-26)) ] / (2 * 58301)`\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± sqrt(1.0*10^-28 + 3.705*10^-21) ] / 116602`\n`y = [ (1.0 * 10^(-14)) ± 6.087 * 10^(-11) ] / 116602`\n\nSince `y = [OH^-]^2` must be positive, we take the positive root:\n`y = (6.088 * 10^(-11)) / 116602 ≈ 5.221 * 10^(-16)`\n`x = [OH^-] = sqrt(y) = sqrt(5.221 * 10^(-16)) ≈ 2.285 * 10^(-8) mol L^-1`\n\n**6. Calculate the Molar Solubility (S)**\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of `[OH^-]`, we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species and sum them to find the total solubility `S`.\n\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^(-27)) / (2.285 * 10^(-8))^3 ≈ 4.44 * 10^(-4) mol L^-1`\n\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^(-8)) ≈ 1.33 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n*   `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-] = (4.44 * 10^(-4)) + (1.33 * 10^(-3)) = 0.000444 + 0.00133`\n    `S = 0.001774 mol L^-1` or `1.774 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n**7. Final Answer with Significant Figures**\n\nThe given constants (`5.3 * 10^(-27)` and `1.1 * 10^31`) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n`S ≈ 1.8 * 10^(-3) mol L^-1`\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
