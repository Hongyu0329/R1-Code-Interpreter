The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal atomic ratio is approximately 0.2. For Thermochemical Water Splitting (TWS), a much lower ratio of around 0.05 is ideal. For Electrocatalytic Water Splitting (EWS), particularly for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), a much higher, Ni-rich ratio of 1.0 to 2.0 is most effective.
