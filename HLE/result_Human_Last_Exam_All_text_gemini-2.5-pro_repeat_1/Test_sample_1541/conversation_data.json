    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The primary task is to reorder the numbers in a sum string (e.g., \"3+2+1\") so that they are in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+3\"). The numbers involved are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. The secondary and most crucial goal is to design a C program that achieves this using the absolute minimum amount of memory for its variables.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Input and Output:**\n    *   **Input:** A string of characters, up to 1000 characters long. It's a valid sum, meaning it alternates between digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and the '+' symbol. Example: `3+1+4+1+2`.\n    *   **Output:** A string representing the same sum with the numbers sorted. For the example `3+1+4+1+2`, the numbers are {3, 1, 4, 1, 2}. Sorted, they become {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}. The output should be the string `1+1+2+3+4`.\n\n3.  **Initial Strategy & Memory Consideration:**\n    A straightforward approach would be to:\n    a. Read the entire input string into a large character array (e.g., `char s[1001];` -> 1001 bytes).\n    b. Extract the numbers into an integer array. The maximum number of summands is 500, so `int nums[500];` -> 2000 bytes.\n    c. Sort the integer array.\n    d. Print the sorted numbers with '+' signs in between.\n    This approach is correct but uses over 3000 bytes, which is not memory-efficient.\n\n4.  **Developing a Memory-Efficient Strategy (Counting):**\n    A significant improvement can be made by noticing that the set of numbers is very small: {1, 2, 3, 4}. Instead of storing all the numbers, we can simply count the occurrences of each one.\n    *   We can use a small integer array of size 4 to store the counts of '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's.\n    *   This eliminates the need for a large array to store the individual numbers.\n\n5.  **Optimizing for Minimum Memory (Avoiding String Storage):**\n    The largest remaining memory allocation is the buffer for the input string (`char s[1001];`). To create the *most* memory-efficient program, we should question if we need to store the entire string at all.\n    *   The counting can be done by reading the input stream one character at a time. We don't need the whole string in memory simultaneously.\n    *   We can read a character, check if it's a digit, and if so, update our count. Then, we discard the character and read the next one.\n    *   Once the entire input has been processed this way, we will have the counts of all the numbers.\n    *   With these counts, we can directly generate the required output string without ever having stored the input string.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Data Types and Sizes:** We must use the smallest appropriate data types. `char` for single characters and `int` for counts and loop indices. In standard C implementations on modern systems, `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n*   **Variable Scope:** We only need to account for variables declared to solve the problem. We do not count memory used internally by library functions (e.g., I/O buffers).\n*   **Input Handling:** The program must correctly handle the end of the input line (typically a newline character `\\n`). The character-by-character reading loop should terminate correctly.\n*   **Output Formatting:** A flag variable is necessary to ensure that the '+' symbol is only printed *between* numbers, not before the first number or after the last one.\n\n### Final Memory Calculation for the Most Efficient Program\n\nBased on the optimized strategy (character-by-character read and counting), let's list the necessary variables and calculate their total memory footprint.\n\n1.  **Counts Array:** An array to store the frequency of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   Declaration: `int counts[4];`\n    *   Memory: `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4 bytes` = **16 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input Character Buffer:** A variable to hold a single character read from the input stream.\n    *   Declaration: `char c;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1 byte` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Loop Counter:** An integer variable to be used in the loops for printing the final result.\n    *   Declaration: `int i;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4 bytes` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Output Formatting Flag:** An integer to track whether the number being printed is the first term, to handle the placement of '+'.\n    *   Declaration: `int is_first_term;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4 bytes` = **4 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\nm = 16 (counts) + 1 (character buffer) + 4 (loop counter) + 4 (flag) = **25 bytes**.\n\n<<<25>>>"
