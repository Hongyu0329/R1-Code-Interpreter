    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific work \"Sir Launfal\".** The question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. It is important to distinguish this from the earlier 12th-century lai *Lanval* by Marie de France, upon which it is based.\n\n2.  **Locate the manuscript in which the poem is preserved.** The poem *Sir Launfal* survives in only one known manuscript. This makes identifying its companion texts very specific. The manuscript is known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**, now held in the British Library. It was compiled in the mid-15th century.\n\n3.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript.** The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it is a collection of different works bound together. It contains a number of popular Middle English romances, including:\n    *   *Sir Launfal*\n    *   *Libeaus Desconus*\n    *   *Emare*\n    *   *Octavian*\n    *   *Sir Isumbras*\n    *   *Sir Gowther*\n\n4.  **Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.** Among these romances, the manuscript also contains a text that is explicitly a \"book of manners\" or a conduct book. This work is titled ***The Boke of Curtasye***, which translates to **\"The Book of Courtesy\"**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the nature of *The Boke of Curtasye*.** A \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book\" was a popular genre in the Middle Ages. These books provided detailed instructions on proper etiquette, social conduct, table manners, and moral behavior, often for young men serving in noble households. *The Boke of Curtasye* fits this description perfectly, offering guidance on how to behave in a courtly setting.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Single Source:** The fact that *Sir Launfal* exists in only one manuscript makes the answer definitive. There is no ambiguity about which texts were preserved alongside it.\n*   **Genre Identification:** It is crucial to understand what a \"book of manners\" is. The medieval term for this genre was a \"courtesy book,\" and *The Boke of Curtasye* is a prime example.\n*   **Manuscript Context:** The manuscript itself provides context. It was likely compiled for an audience interested in romance, chivalry, and the proper conduct associated with courtly life, which explains why a romance poem like *Sir Launfal* and a conduct book like *The Boke of Curtasye* would be included in the same collection.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the book of manners preserved alongside *Sir Launfal* in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
