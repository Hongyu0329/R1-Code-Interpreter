    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecule is toluene, with the chemical formula C7H8.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\nThe term \"contracted Gaussian functions\" is synonymous with \"basis functions\" in this context. The 6-31G notation is a Pople-style split-valence basis set, and we can break it down to understand how many basis functions are assigned to each atom.\n\n*   **The hyphen (-)** separates the description of core orbitals from valence orbitals.\n*   **'6'**: This refers to the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **'31'**: This refers to the valence orbitals. It indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts (a \"double-zeta\" description).\n    *   The inner part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by one CGF composed of 1 PGF (an uncontracted Gaussian).\n*   **'G'**: This simply stands for Gaussian, indicating the type of functions used.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions (CGFs) per Carbon Atom**\nA Carbon atom (C) is a second-row element with atomic number 6. Its electron configuration is 1s², 2s², 2p².\n*   **Core Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. According to the '6' in 6-31G, it is described by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The 2s and 2p orbitals are valence orbitals. They are split into an inner and outer part according to the '31' notation.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part ('3'):** This part uses one basis function for the 2s orbital and a set of three basis functions for the 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). This gives a total of 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part ('1'):** This part adds another, more diffuse layer of functions. It also includes one basis function for the 2s orbital and a set of three for the 2p orbitals. This gives another 1 (s-type) + 3 (p-type) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions (CGFs) per Hydrogen Atom**\nA Hydrogen atom (H) is a first-row element with atomic number 1. Its electron configuration is 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the '6' rule does not apply.\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital is the valence orbital. Its description is split according to the '31' notation.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part ('3'):** The 1s orbital is described by **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence Part ('1'):** The 1s orbital is described by another **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)**\nNow, we sum the CGFs for all atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/Carbon atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/Hydrogen atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total Number of CGFs:** 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **CGFs vs. PGFs:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs). A CGF is a fixed linear combination of PGFs and represents a single basis function.\n2.  **Core vs. Valence:** The Pople notation (X-YZG) treats core and valence electrons differently. Correctly identifying which orbitals are core and which are valence for each atom is crucial.\n3.  **Split Valence:** The \"split\" applies to the entire valence shell. For Carbon, this means both the 2s and 2p orbitals are split. For Hydrogen, the 1s orbital is split.\n4.  **p-orbitals:** Remember that a set of p-orbitals consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz), so they contribute 3 basis functions for each layer (inner and outer).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nTotal Functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\nTotal Functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal Functions = 63 + 16\nTotal Functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
