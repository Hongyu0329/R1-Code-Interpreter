    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A specific statute (law).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (i.e., post-1948).\n    *   **Action:** The *first* to *explicitly introduce*. This means the literal term for \"good faith\" must appear in the text of the law, and we are looking for the earliest instance of this.\n    *   **Concept:** \"Good faith\". In Hebrew, this is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Identifying Key Candidates:**\n    *   The concept of \"good faith\" is most famously associated with Israeli contract law. This immediately brings to mind the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**.\n    *   Sections 12 and 39 of this law are foundational. Section 12 mandates good faith in negotiations, and Section 39 requires good faith in the fulfillment of contractual obligations. This law is widely recognized for elevating \"good faith\" to a supreme, overarching principle in Israeli private law.\n    *   Because of its profound impact, many people mistakenly believe this was the first law to introduce the concept.\n\n3.  **Searching for Earlier Instances:**\n    *   The question asks for the *first* statute. Therefore, we must investigate significant legislation enacted *before* 1973 to see if the term \"תום לב\" appears. The focus should be on private law codification that took place in the 1960s.\n    *   Let's examine major laws from that period in chronological order:\n        *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law establishes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*), which is related to but distinct from \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). The specific term is not used as a general principle.\n        *   **Land Law, 1969:** This is a major codification of property law. A review of this statute reveals a crucial section. **Section 10** of the Land Law deals with the rights of someone who acquires property in reliance on the official land registry. It states: \"Whoever acquires a right in registered land for consideration and in reliance **in good faith** (בתום-לב) on the registration, his right shall be valid even if the registration was not correct.\"\n\n4.  **Comparing the Candidates:**\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** Explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" (בתום-לב) in Section 10.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** Explicitly uses the term \"good faith\" (בתום לב) in Sections 12 and 39.\n    *   Chronologically, the Land Law was enacted in 1969, four years before the Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in 1973.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, is famous for making \"good faith\" a general, pervasive principle across all of contract law, it was not the first statute to explicitly use the term.\n    *   The Land Law, 1969, explicitly introduced the concept and term \"good faith\" into the statutory framework of the modern State of Israel, albeit in the specific context of property transactions.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question is about an *explicit* introduction. Prior to 1969, Israeli courts might have drawn on concepts similar to good faith from English common law or other sources, but the Land Law was the first *Israeli statute* to codify the specific term \"תום לב\".\n*   **Specific vs. General Principle:** It is crucial to distinguish between the first *use* of the term and its establishment as a *general principle*. The Land Law marks the first use, while the Contracts Law marks its generalization. The question asks for the former.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must not include \"the\" or the year of the statute. The correct name is \"Land Law\".\n\n<<<Land Law>>>"
