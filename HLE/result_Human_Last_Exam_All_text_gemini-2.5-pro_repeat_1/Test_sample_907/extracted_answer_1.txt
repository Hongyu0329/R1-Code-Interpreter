**a) Case of negligible interaction:**
The absorption cross-section is the incoherent sum of the absorption of each individual molecule. The equation is:
$\sigma_a(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega}{c\epsilon_0\hbar} |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \cdot g(\omega - \omega_{eg})$
where:
*   $N$ is the number of molecules in the chain.
*   $\vec{\mu}_{eg}$ is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
*   $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the light polarization vector.
*   $\omega_{eg}$ is the transition frequency of a single molecule.
*   $g(\omega - \omega_{eg})$ is a lineshape function (e.g., a Lorentzian or a delta function $\delta(\omega - \omega_{eg})$) centered at the monomer frequency.

**b) Case of near-neighbor interaction (Frenkel Exciton Model):**
The absorption cross-section is dominated by a single, coherent transition to the lowest-energy optically-active exciton state ($k=0$ for a periodic chain). The equation is:
$\sigma_b(\omega) = \frac{N \pi \omega}{c\epsilon_0\hbar} |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \cdot g(\omega - (\omega_{eg} + 2J/\hbar))$
where:
*   All variables are as defined above.
*   $J$ is the near-neighbor coupling energy (transfer integral).
*   The lineshape function $g(\dots)$ is now centered at a frequency shifted by $2J/\hbar$ from the monomer frequency. The oscillator strength of the entire chain is concentrated into this single transition.
