    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Object: The Great Icosahedron**\n    *   The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra (also known as star polyhedra).\n    *   It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n    *   Crucially, its 12 vertices are arranged in the same spatial configuration as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core of the Question: \"Outer-Hull\"**\n    *   The \"outer-hull\" refers to the **convex hull** of the object.\n    *   The convex hull of a set of points (like the vertices of a polyhedron) is the smallest convex solid that contains all of those points. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet over all the vertices of the shape; the resulting solid is the convex hull.\n    *   Since the 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are in the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, its convex hull is a **regular icosahedron**.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Task: \"Triangulating the Outer-Hull\"**\n    *   The question asks for the minimal number of triangles required to form the surface of this outer-hull.\n    *   The phrase \"the number of visible triangles from the outside\" confirms that we are only concerned with the surface of the convex hull, not the complex, intersecting internal faces of the great icosahedron itself.\n    *   So, the question simplifies to: \"What is the minimal number of triangles that form the surface of a regular icosahedron?\"\n\n4.  **Examine the Surface of the Regular Icosahedron**\n    *   A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids.\n    *   By definition, its surface is composed entirely of identical, regular polygons. For the icosahedron, these polygons are equilateral triangles.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has exactly **20** such triangular faces.\n\n5.  **Determine the \"Minimal Number\"**\n    *   The surface of the regular icosahedron is already perfectly tiled by these 20 triangles. This is a complete triangulation of its surface.\n    *   Any attempt to use fewer triangles would fail to create a closed, convex polyhedron with the given vertices.\n    *   Any further subdivision of these 20 triangles (e.g., splitting each triangle into smaller ones) would result in a *higher* number of triangles.\n    *   Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to form the surface is simply the number of faces the regular icosahedron has.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction:** It is vital not to confuse the great icosahedron (a non-convex, self-intersecting shape) with its convex hull (a regular icosahedron). The question is about the hull, not the original star polyhedron.\n*   **Coincidence of Face Count:** The great icosahedron has 20 intersecting triangular faces, and its convex hull also has 20 triangular faces. This is a fundamental property of their relationship, but they are different sets of triangles. The question concerns the faces of the hull.\n*   **\"Minimal\" Keyword:** The word \"minimal\" confirms that we should not subdivide the faces of the resulting convex hull. We are looking for the most efficient triangulation, which is the one defined by the polyhedron's own faces.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron whose surface is composed of 20 triangular faces. This is the minimal number of triangles required to form this surface.\n\n<<<20>>>"
