    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms in the question:\n\n*   **Graph on n = 128 vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and some lines (edges) connecting pairs of vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Clique size:** The number of vertices, `k`, in a clique.\n*   **Induced subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `V'`, the induced subgraph is the graph formed by `V'` and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect pairs of vertices in `V'`.\n*   **Induced clique:** An induced subgraph that is a clique. If a set of `k` vertices forms a clique in a graph `G`, the induced subgraph on these `k` vertices is, by definition, a `K_k`. Therefore, finding an \"induced clique of size k\" is the same as finding a \"clique of size k\".\n*   **Different clique sizes:** We are looking for a set of unique integers `{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m}` such that for each `k_i` in the set, the graph has a clique of that size.\n*   **The goal:** We need to construct a single graph `G` with 128 vertices that maximizes `m`, the number of different clique sizes it contains.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Set of Possible Clique Sizes\n\nLet's consider any graph `G`. Let `S` be the set of all possible clique sizes that can be found in `G`.\nLet `k_max` be the size of the largest clique in `G`. This value is a fundamental property of the graph `G`, known as its **clique number**, denoted `ω(G)`. So, `k_max = ω(G)`.\n\nBy definition, since `k_max` is the size of the largest clique, there must exist a set of `k_max` vertices in `G` that form a clique. Let's call this set of vertices `C_max`.\n\nNow, let's consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ k_max`. Can we find a clique of size `j` in `G`?\nYes. We can simply choose any `j` vertices from the set `C_max`. Since every pair of vertices in `C_max` is connected by an edge, any subset of `C_max` will also have all its vertices mutually connected. Therefore, any subset of `j` vertices from `C_max` forms a clique of size `j`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial insight: If a graph contains a clique of size `k_max`, it must also contain cliques of all sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., k_max - 1`.\n\nTherefore, for any graph `G`, the set of its clique sizes `S` is always of the form:\n`S = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}`\n\n### Step 3: Reframing the Problem\n\nThe number of different clique sizes in a graph `G` is the size of the set `S`, which is `|S| = ω(G)`.\n\nThe original question asks for the \"maximum possible number of different clique sizes\". Based on our analysis, this is equivalent to asking for the **maximum possible clique number `ω(G)`** for a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Maximum Clique Number\n\nThe problem is now simplified to: What is the maximum value of `ω(G)` for any graph `G` with 128 vertices?\n\n1.  A clique is a subset of the graph's vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. For our case, `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n2.  We now need to determine if this maximum possible value of 128 can actually be achieved by some graph.\n3.  Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `K_128`. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n4.  In `K_128`, the set of all 128 vertices forms a clique.\n5.  Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is `ω(K_128) = 128`.\n\nThis shows that the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is indeed 128.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number, which is 128. The graph that achieves this is the complete graph `K_128`. This graph contains cliques (and thus induced cliques) of every size from 1 to 128. The set of different clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
