The general representation for the transformation on x, denoted by $x'$, is given in two forms depending on the arbitrary constant $c_1$:
Case 1: If $c_1 \neq 0$, the transformation is $x' = x + c_2 \epsilon - \frac{2c_a}{k_1^2 c_1} e^{k_1 t} (e^{k_1 c_1 \epsilon} - 1)$.
Case 2: If $c_1 = 0$, the transformation is $x' = x + \left( c_2 - \frac{2c_a}{k_1} e^{k_1 t} \right) \epsilon$.
Here, $\epsilon$ is the group parameter, and $c_1, c_2, c_a$ are arbitrary constants corresponding to the choice of generator in the Lie algebra.
