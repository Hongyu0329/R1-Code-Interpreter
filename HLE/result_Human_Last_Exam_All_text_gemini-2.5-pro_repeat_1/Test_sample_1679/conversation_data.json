    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks.\n1.  One remains at its original location in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  The second was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n\nA film could depict either of these obelisks to satisfy the question. This means we should look for Best Picture winners set in either Paris or Egypt.\n\n**Step 2: Chronologically review Best Picture winners for relevant settings.**\nWe will go through the list of winners from the beginning and look for films with scenes in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1st Awards (1927/1928) - *Wings***: This World War I film contains a notable sequence where the protagonists visit Paris. However, the scenes focus on the Folies Bergère and general street revelry, not on major landmarks like the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **10th Awards (1937) - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This biopic is set almost entirely in Paris. While it is plausible that an establishing shot might show the Place de la Concorde, the film's visual focus is on interiors, courtrooms, and the specific courtyard of the École Militaire for the Dreyfus affair. There is no clear, prominent depiction of the obelisk.\n*   **16th Awards (1943) - *Casablanca***: The famous opening montage establishing the refugee trail to Casablanca includes shots of Paris. It clearly shows the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, but it does not show the Place de la Concorde or its obelisk.\n*   **24th Awards (1951) - *An American in Paris***: The title itself indicates the setting. The film's celebrated 17-minute climactic ballet sequence is a journey through stylized sets designed to evoke famous Parisian landmarks and artworks. One of these sets is an unmistakable recreation of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk as its centerpiece. This is a clear and intentional depiction.\n\n**Step 3: Consider films set in Egypt.**\nWe also need to check for depictions of the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **35th Awards (1962) - *Lawrence of Arabia***: This film has scenes in Egypt, specifically Cairo and the Suez Canal area. However, the narrative does not take the characters to the city of Luxor, and the Luxor Temple and its obelisk are not shown.\n*   **69th Awards (1996) - *The English Patient***: This film features extensive scenes in Egypt, but they are set in Cairo and the remote desert, not in Luxor.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nWhile earlier Best Picture winners like *Wings* and *The Life of Emile Zola* were set in Paris, there is no confirmed on-screen depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in them. The first winner with a definitive, prominent depiction is *An American in Paris* (winner for 1951). Its final ballet sequence explicitly features a set representing the Place de la Concorde, with the obelisk as the central element. This predates any other potential candidates.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
