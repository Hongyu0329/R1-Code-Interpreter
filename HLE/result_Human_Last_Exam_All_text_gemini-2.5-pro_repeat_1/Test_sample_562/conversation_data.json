    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Analyze the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄. The first and most crucial step is to correctly identify its components.\nThe character 謄 is a compound character with a left-right structure.\n*   The left-hand side component is **言**.\n*   The right-hand side component is **朕**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn Japanese kanji, for characters with a left-right structure, the left-hand component is very often the radical, especially when it is a common radical form like 言, 水 (氵), or 人 (亻). The radical typically gives a clue to the character's general meaning.\n*   The radical **言** relates to \"words,\" \"speech,\" or \"language.\"\n*   The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is an action related to words and documents.\nTherefore, the left-hand component, 言, is the radical. This can be confirmed by looking up the character in a kanji dictionary.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Japanese Name of the Radical**\nRadicals have specific names in Japanese, which can change depending on their position within the character.\n*   The radical is **言**.\n*   When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (へん).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is **ごんべん (gonben)**.\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to convert the Japanese name into Hepburn transcription, as requested by the user's example (\"Onnahen\").\n*   Japanese name: ごんべん\n*   Hiragana breakdown: ご (go) + ん (n) + べ (be) + ん (n)\n*   Hepburn transcription: **Gonben**\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correct Character Identification:** It is important not to confuse 謄 (tō, to copy) with similar-looking characters like 騰 (tō, to rise), which has the 馬 (umahen) radical, or 朕 (chin, imperial \"we\"), which has the 月 (nikuzuki) radical. The character provided is clearly 謄.\n2.  **Radical Naming Convention:** Be aware that the name of a radical can change with its position. 言 as a standalone character is \"gen\" or \"koto\". At the bottom of a character (like in 誓), it might be referred to differently. On the left side, it is consistently called \"gonben\".\n3.  **Transcription System:** The request specifies Hepburn transcription, which is the standard system for romanizing Japanese. Following the example \"Onnahen,\" the answer should be capitalized.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct radical and its name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
