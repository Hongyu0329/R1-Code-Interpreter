    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Question**\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length 'a'. The box extends from x = 0 to x = a.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the second energy level, which corresponds to the principal quantum number n = 2.\n*   **Question:** We need to find the probability of locating the particle in a very small interval from $x_1 = 0.495a$ to $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Quantum Mechanics Principles**\n\n*   **Wavefunction:** The state of a particle in a 1D box is described by a normalized wavefunction, $\\psi_n(x)$. The general form is:\n    $\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   **Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position *x* is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, $|\\psi_n(x)|^2$. This is called the probability density function.\n*   **Probability in an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle in an interval between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is found by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n    $P(x_1 \\le x \\le x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |\\psi_n(x)|^2 dx$\n\n**3. Apply the Specifics of the Problem**\n\n*   For n = 2, the wavefunction is:\n    $\\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability density is:\n    $|\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability we need to calculate is the integral:\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n**4. Choose a Method to Solve the Integral**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Nature of the Interval.** The interval is from 0.495a to 0.505a. This is a very small interval of width $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$. It is centered at $x = 0.5a$.\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Behavior of the Wavefunction.** For n=2, the wavefunction has a node (a point where the wavefunction is zero) at the center of the box, $x = a/2 = 0.5a$. This means $\\psi_2(0.5a) = 0$ and the probability density $|\\psi_2(0.5a)|^2 = 0$.\n*   **Approximation Strategy:** Since the interval is very small, we can approximate the integral. However, a simple approximation like $P \\approx |\\psi_2(x_{center})|^2 \\Delta x$ would give $P \\approx 0 \\times (0.01a) = 0$, which is incorrect. The probability is very small, but not exactly zero. We need a more sophisticated approximation. We can approximate the integrand function itself for values of x near the center of the box.\n\n**5. Perform the Calculation using Approximation**\n\n*   **Change of Variables:** To simplify the math, let's shift the origin to the center of the box. Let $u = x - 0.5a$. When $x = 0.495a$, $u = -0.005a$. When $x = 0.505a$, $u = 0.005a$. And $dx = du$.\n*   **Rewrite the Integrand:** Substitute $x = u + 0.5a$ into the probability density function:\n    $|\\psi_2(u)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (u + 0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a} + \\pi\\right)$\n    Using the identity $\\sin(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get $\\sin^2(\\theta + \\pi) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$.\n    So, the integrand becomes: $\\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)$\n*   **Set up the New Integral:**\n    $P = \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right) du$\n*   **Small-Angle Approximation:** In the interval of integration, the value of $u$ is very small. Therefore, the argument of the sine function, $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi u}{a}$, is also very small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n    **Careful Point 3:** This approximation is valid because the largest value of the argument is $\\frac{2\\pi(0.005a)}{a} = 0.01\\pi \\approx 0.0314$ radians, which is a small angle.\n*   **Apply the Approximation:**\n    $P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi u}{a}\\right)^2 du$\n    $P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\frac{4\\pi^2 u^2}{a^2} du = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 du$\n*   **Evaluate the Integral:**\n    $P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005)^3 a^3$\n*   **Calculate the Final Value:** The '$a^3$' terms cancel out.\n    $P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{16 \\times (9.8696)}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $P \\approx \\frac{157.914}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $P \\approx (52.638) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $P \\approx 65.7975 \\times 10^{-7}$\n    $P \\approx 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
