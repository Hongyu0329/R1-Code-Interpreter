    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several definitions from point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. The phrase \"not necessarily metric\" is a crucial qualifier.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Define the key terms.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. If the space is also metric, it is a *metric continuum*. The question explicitly states we should not assume the space is metric.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected). A *proper* subcontinuum of X is a subcontinuum that is not equal to X.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum X is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `x` in a continuum X, the composant of `x`, denoted `C(x)`, is the set of all points `y` in X for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of X containing both `x` and `y`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the properties of composants in an indecomposable continuum.**\n\n*   **Partition:** The composants of any continuum (indecomposable or not) form a partition of the space. This means that for any two points `x` and `y`, their composants `C(x)` and `C(y)` are either identical or disjoint.\n*   **Density:** In an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a dense subset of the space.\n*   **Crucial Theorem:** A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum `X` is indecomposable if and only if for every `x ∈ X`, the composant `C(x)` is a *proper* subset of `X` (i.e., `C(x) ≠ X`).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimum possible number of composants.**\n\n*   **Can there be only one composant?**\n    Let's assume an indecomposable continuum `X` has only one composant, `C`. Since the composants must partition the space, this single composant must be the entire space, so `C = X`. But this directly contradicts the crucial theorem mentioned in Step 2, which states that for an indecomposable continuum, every composant must be a *proper* subset of the space. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant.\n\n*   **The number of composants must be at least 2.**\n    Since the number of composants cannot be 1, the smallest possible integer value is 2.\n\n**Step 4: Determine if a continuum with two composants can exist.**\n\n*   Now we must ask: does there exist an indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants?\n*   If we restrict ourselves to **metric** continua, the answer is no. A famous result by Stefan Mazurkiewicz shows that every composant in an indecomposable *metric* continuum is a \"meager\" set (a countable union of nowhere-dense sets). By the Baire Category Theorem, a complete metric space (like a metric continuum) cannot be a meager set. If there were only a countable number of composants, the whole space would be a countable union of meager sets, which is itself meager—a contradiction. Thus, any indecomposable metric continuum must have an *uncountable* number of composants.\n*   However, the question specifies **not necessarily metric**. The argument above fails for non-metric spaces because the property that a composant is a meager set does not necessarily hold. In fact, there are known constructions of non-metric indecomposable continua that have a finite number of composants. Specifically, topologists have constructed examples of indecomposable continua with exactly two composants. These constructions are complex and fall outside the scope of this explanation, but their existence confirms that 2 is an achievable number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  An indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant.\n2.  Therefore, the minimum number of composants must be at least 2.\n3.  Examples of non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly two composants are known to exist.\n\nCombining these points, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
