    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their atomic numbers to find the total number of electrons.\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$.\n-   One Carbon (C) atom: Atomic number 6, so 6 electrons.\n-   Three Hydrogen (H) atoms (two on C, one on Si): Atomic number 1, so 3 x 1 = 3 electrons.\n-   One Silicon (Si) atom: Atomic number 14, so 14 electrons.\n-   One Fluorine (F) atom: Atomic number 9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons is:\n$N = 6 (\\text{C}) + 3 (\\text{H}) + 14 (\\text{Si}) + 9 (\\text{F}) = 32$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (K)**\n\nNext, we determine the number of atomic orbital basis functions provided by the 6-31G** basis set for each atom. The `**` notation is equivalent to `(d,p)`. This means a set of d-type polarization functions is added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, and a set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms. We will assume the standard use of 5 spherical d-orbitals.\n\n-   **For Carbon (C), a heavy atom:**\n    -   The 6-31G part provides 9 basis functions (1s, 2s', 2s'', 2px', 2px'', 2py', 2py'', 2pz', 2pz'').\n    -   The `*` (or `d`) adds one set of d-type polarization functions (5 orbitals: $d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}, d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{z^2}$).\n    -   Total for C: 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n\n-   **For Silicon (Si), a heavy atom:**\n    -   The 6-31G part provides 13 basis functions (for the core 1s, 2s, 2p and split-valence 3s, 3p).\n    -   The `*` (or `d`) adds one set of d-type polarization functions (5 orbitals).\n    -   Total for Si: 13 + 5 = 18 basis functions.\n\n-   **For Fluorine (F), a heavy atom:**\n    -   Same as Carbon, the 6-31G part provides 9 basis functions.\n    -   The `*` (or `d`) adds one set of d-type polarization functions (5 orbitals).\n    -   Total for F: 9 + 5 = 14 basis functions.\n\n-   **For each Hydrogen (H), a light atom:**\n    -   The 6-31G part provides 2 basis functions (split 1s orbital).\n    -   The second `*` (or `p`) adds one set of p-type polarization functions (3 orbitals: $p_x, p_y, p_z$).\n    -   Total for H: 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule:\n$K = (1 \\times \\text{C}) + (3 \\times \\text{H}) + (1 \\times \\text{Si}) + (1 \\times \\text{F})$\n$K = 14 + (3 \\times 5) + 18 + 14$\n$K = 14 + 15 + 18 + 14 = 61$\nSo, there are $K=61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: State the formula for the number of CSFs**\n\nA full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation considers all possible ways of distributing the N electrons among the K spatial orbitals (or 2K spin-orbitals). We are interested in the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs), which are spin-adapted linear combinations of Slater determinants.\n\nThe molecule has an even number of electrons (N=32), so its ground state is a singlet state with total spin S=0. The number of singlet CSFs is given by the formula:\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} (S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2+1}\\binom{K}{N/2-1} $\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of CSFs**\n\nWe substitute our values for K and N into the formula:\n-   $K = 61$\n-   $N = 32 \\implies N/2 = 16$\n\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{16+1}\\binom{61}{16-1} $\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{61}{16}^2 - \\binom{61}{17}\\binom{61}{15} $\n\nNow we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n-   $\\binom{61}{15} = 17,363,355,541,725$\n-   $\\binom{61}{16} = 49,907,458,556,125$\n-   $\\binom{61}{17} = 139,433,699,574,200$\n\nSubstitute these values back into the formula:\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = (49,907,458,556,125)^2 - (139,433,699,574,200) \\times (17,363,355,541,725) $\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = 2,490,751,939,521,319,703,125,000,000 - 2,420,842,065,369,674,687,500,000,000 $\n$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = 69,909,874,151,645,015,625,000,000 $\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Correctly count atoms:** Ensure all atoms from the chemical formula ($\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$) are accounted for. (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F).\n2.  **Correctly count electrons:** Sum the atomic numbers for all atoms.\n3.  **Interpret the basis set notation:** 6-31G** means 6-31G(d,p). The first `*` adds d-functions to heavy atoms, the second `*` adds p-functions to hydrogens.\n4.  **Know the number of basis functions:** You need to know how many functions correspond to each part of the basis set name for each type of atom. The most common source of error is distinguishing between heavy and light atoms and using the correct polarization functions. Assuming spherical d-functions (5 orbitals) is the modern standard.\n5.  **Use the correct formula:** The formula for the number of CSFs for a given spin S is required. For a singlet state (S=0), the formula used is standard.\n6.  **High-precision calculation:** The numbers involved are enormous, so a standard calculator will overflow. A computational tool that supports arbitrary-precision integers is necessary to get the exact final number.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of CSFs is $69,909,874,151,645,015,625,000,000$.\n\n<<<69,909,874,151,645,015,625,000,000>>>"
