    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has exactly five vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, regardless of how their vertices are labeled.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no **articulation points** (or **cut vertices**). An equivalent condition is that any two vertices lie on a common cycle.\n\n### Step 2: Establish Basic Properties and Constraints\n\n1.  A graph must be connected to be 2-vertex-connected.\n2.  A 2-vertex-connected graph with `n` vertices must have at least `n` edges. For `n=5`, the number of edges `m` must be at least 5.\n3.  The minimum degree of any vertex in a 2-vertex-connected graph must be at least 2.\n4.  The total number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is at most `C(5,2) = 10`.\n5.  Therefore, we only need to check graphs with 5 to 10 edges.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate and Analyze Graphs by Number of Edges\n\nWe will systematically count the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs for each possible number of edges `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Case m = 4:**\nGraphs with `n=5` vertices and `m=4` edges are trees. All trees with more than 2 vertices have at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). Removing a vertex adjacent to a leaf will disconnect that leaf, making the adjacent vertex a cut vertex. Thus, no tree on 5 vertices is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 0**\n\n**Case m = 5:**\nConnected graphs with `n=5` vertices and `m=5` edges are unicyclic (contain exactly one cycle).\n*   **C5 (the 5-cycle):** Every vertex has a degree of 2. Removing any vertex results in a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, **C5 is 2-vertex-connected**.\n*   **Other unicyclic graphs:** These consist of a C3 or C4 with one or more edges attached as a \"tail\". The vertex where the tail attaches to the cycle is a cut vertex. For example, in a C4 with a pendant edge, removing the vertex of degree 3 disconnects the graph.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case m = 6:**\nWe look for connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges that have no cut vertices.\n1.  **C5 with a chord:** This graph is 2-connected. Removing any vertex leaves a connected subgraph.\n2.  **K2,3 (complete bipartite graph):** This graph has a C4 and a fifth vertex connected to opposite vertices of the C4. It is 2-connected.\n3.  **C4 with a \"cap\":** This graph is formed by a C4 and a fifth vertex connected to two adjacent vertices of the C4. It is also 2-connected.\nOther graphs with 6 edges, like the Friendship graph (two C3s sharing a vertex) or K4 with a pendant edge, have cut vertices.\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n**Case m = 7:**\nThese graphs are \"dense\", so it's easier to analyze their complements, which have `10 - 7 = 3` edges. A graph `G` is 2-connected if it's connected and has no cut vertices.\nThe nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 3 edges are: P4+K1, K1,3+K1, C3+2K1, and P3 U K2.\n1.  **Complement of P4 + K1:** This graph is 2-connected.\n2.  **Complement of C3 + 2K1:** This graph has two vertices of degree 4. It is 2-connected.\n3.  **Complement of P3 U K2:** This graph is also 2-connected.\n4.  **Complement of K1,3 + K1:** This graph is connected, but it has a cut vertex (the vertex that was isolated in the K1,3+K1 graph becomes a \"hub\" that connects two otherwise separate components).\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n**Case m = 8:**\nThe complements have `10 - 8 = 2` edges. The two nonisomorphic graphs on 5 vertices with 2 edges are P3+2K1 and 2K2+K1.\n1.  **Complement of P3 + 2K1:** This graph is K5 with two incident edges removed. It is 2-connected.\n2.  **Complement of 2K2 + K1:** This is the Wheel graph W5 (a central vertex connected to a C4). The wheel graph Wn is 3-connected for n>=4, so W5 is 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**Case m = 9:**\nThe complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge. This is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). The minimum degree is 3. The graph is 3-connected, and therefore 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case m = 10:**\nThis is the complete graph K5. K_n is (n-1)-connected, so K5 is 4-connected, which is also 2-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 3\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 such graphs.\n\n<<<11>>>"
