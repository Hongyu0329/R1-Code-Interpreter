  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the relevant information**\n\nFirst, we must parse the problem description and extract only the data that is relevant to calculating the message length.\n\n*   **Information Carrier (Ciphertext):** The Ching book. It contains a total of 9999 symbols.\n*   **Encoding Alphabet (from the Ching):** The symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\". This implies a combination of two sets of properties:\n    *   Yin/Yang: 2 possibilities.\n    *   Wuxing (Five Elements: water, fire, wood, metal, earth): 5 possibilities.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of unique symbol types that can be used for encoding is 2 * 5 = 10.\n*   **Message Alphabet (Plaintext):** The secret message is written using the \"120 most common Chinese characters\" found in the Shu book. So, the alphabet of the final message has 120 unique characters.\n*   **Irrelevant Information (Red Herrings):** Several pieces of information are not needed for this calculation and are designed to be distractors:\n    *   The total number of characters in the Shu (\"around 3000\").\n    *   The time it takes to recognize a character with computer vision (12 ms).\n    *   The computation time for integer and float operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the encoding requirements**\n\nThe core of the problem is to figure out how many symbols from the Ching are needed to represent a single character of the secret message. This is a problem of information capacity.\n\n*   We have an encoding alphabet of 10 unique symbols (from the Ching).\n*   We need to represent an alphabet of 120 unique characters (from the Shu).\n*   Let `k` be the number of symbols from the Ching needed to represent one character of the message. We need to find the smallest integer `k` such that the number of possible combinations (`10^k`) is greater than or equal to the number of characters we need to represent (120).\n*   We test values of `k`:\n    *   If `k = 1`, we can represent `10^1 = 10` unique characters. This is less than 120, so it's not enough.\n    *   If `k = 2`, we can represent `10^2 = 100` unique characters. This is still less than 120, so it's not enough.\n    *   If `k = 3`, we can represent `10^3 = 1000` unique characters. This is greater than 120, so it is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, we need a sequence of **3 symbols** from the Ching to encode each single character of the secret message.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the maximum message length**\n\nNow that we know the encoding requirement, we can calculate the maximum possible length of the message based on the total number of symbols available.\n\n*   Total symbols available in the Ching: 9999.\n*   Symbols required per message character: 3.\n*   Maximum message length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols per character)\n*   Maximum message length = 9999 / 3\n\n**Calculation:**\n9999 / 3 = 3333\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n\n1.  **Did I correctly identify the relevant information?** Yes, the core data are the number of total symbols (9999), the size of the encoding alphabet (10), and the size of the message alphabet (120).\n2.  **Did I correctly identify the irrelevant information?** Yes, the processing times and the total size of the Shu book do not affect the information capacity of the Ching.\n3.  **Is the calculation of the encoding alphabet size correct?** Yes, \"yinyang-wuxing\" implies a multiplicative combination, so 2 * 5 = 10 unique symbol types.\n4.  **Is the logic for determining symbols per character sound?** Yes, we need to find the smallest power `k` of the base (10) that can accommodate the number of possibilities (120), which is `10^k >= 120`. This correctly yields `k=3`.\n5.  **Is the final calculation correct?** Yes, dividing the total number of symbols by the number of symbols required per character gives the maximum length of the message. 9999 / 3 = 3333.\n\nThe analysis is complete and the steps are logically sound.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
