    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The user wants to know the specific name for the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The context given is that this value is captured as a \"beat-to-beat interval\" using a PPG sensor.\n\n2.  **Define HRV:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is not the heart rate itself, but rather the measurement of the variation in time between each heartbeat. A high HRV indicates a healthy, adaptable autonomic nervous system, while a low HRV can be a sign of stress or health issues.\n\n3.  **Identify the Fundamental Measurement:** The \"value between heartbeats\" is a measurement of time. Specifically, it is the duration of the interval from one heartbeat to the next. This is the \"beat-to-beat interval\" mentioned in the question.\n\n4.  **Consider the Sensor Type (ECG vs. PPG):**\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram):** This is the clinical gold standard. It measures the electrical activity of the heart. The most prominent feature of an ECG waveform is the QRS complex, with the \"R\" wave being the highest peak. The time interval between two consecutive R-waves is called the **RR interval**.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology used in most smartwatches and fitness trackers. It shines a light into the skin and measures changes in light absorption, which correspond to blood volume pulses caused by heartbeats. The time interval between the peaks of two consecutive blood pulses is technically called an **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or sometimes a **Peak-to-Peak (PP) interval**.\n\n5.  **Connect the Terminology:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** Although PPG technically measures IBI, the term **RR interval** is extremely common and widely used in both scientific literature and consumer applications as the standard term for the beat-to-beat interval, even when the data originates from a PPG sensor. The IBI from a PPG is used as a direct proxy for the RR interval from an ECG. Therefore, \"RR interval\" is a correct and widely understood answer.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** For accurate HRV analysis, the raw RR intervals (or IBIs) must be processed to remove errors, artifacts, and physiologically abnormal beats (e.g., ectopic beats). The resulting sequence of \"normal\" beat-to-beat intervals is called the **NN interval** (Normal-to-Normal interval). Most standard HRV metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD) are calculated from this cleaned list of NN intervals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe \"value between heartbeats\" is the time duration of the interval. Based on the analysis:\n*   The most common and standard term used in the context of HRV is the **RR interval**.\n*   A more technically precise term for data from a PPG sensor is the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n*   The cleaned interval used for the final calculation is the **NN interval**.\n\nAll three terms are relevant, but **RR interval** is the most fundamental and widely recognized term for the beat-to-beat time measurement used for HRV.\n\n<<<RR interval (or Inter-Beat Interval/IBI)>>>"
