    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Base Health**\n\nFirst, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu specifically in Expert Mode. According to the game's source code, the stats for monsters are adjusted for Expert Mode.\n*   Normal Mode Base Health: 2,800 HP\n*   **Expert Mode Base Health:** 3,640 HP\n\nWe will use the Expert Mode value of 3,640 HP as our starting point.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Health Scaling Formula in Multiplayer**\n\nIn Terraria, the health of bosses increases in multiplayer to provide a suitable challenge for a larger group of players. The formula for this scaling is different depending on the game mode. For Expert Mode, the health of a boss is calculated as follows:\n\n`Total Health = Base Expert Health × Health Multiplier`\n\nThe `Health Multiplier` is determined by the number of active players (`N`) in the world when the boss is summoned. The formula for the multiplier in Expert Mode is:\n\n`Health Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 × (N - 1)`\n\nThis formula means that for the first player (`N=1`), the multiplier is 1, and the boss has its base health. For each additional player, 35% of the boss's base health is added to its total health pool.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Condition of Infinite Players**\n\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This requires us to analyze the behavior of the health formula as `N` approaches infinity (∞).\n\nLet's substitute the base health and the multiplier formula into a single equation for the Eye of Cthulhu's health:\n\n`Health(N) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`\n\nWe can simplify this formula algebraically:\n\n1.  Distribute the 0.35:\n    `Health(N) = 3640 × (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n2.  Combine the constant terms inside the parenthesis:\n    `Health(N) = 3640 × (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n3.  Distribute the 3640:\n    `Health(N) = (3640 × 0.65) + (3640 × 0.35)N`\n    `Health(N) = 2366 + 1274N`\n\nThis final equation shows that the Eye of Cthulhu's health is a linear function of the number of players, `N`.\n\nNow, we need to find the limit of this function as `N` approaches infinity:\n\n`lim (N→∞) (2366 + 1274N)`\n\nAs `N` becomes infinitely large, the `1274N` term also becomes infinitely large. The constant `2366` is insignificant in comparison. Therefore, the total health approaches infinity.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Potential In-Game Caps and Careful Points**\n\nIt is important to consider if the game's code imposes any hard limits that would prevent the health from reaching infinity.\n\n*   **Player Limit:** A standard Terraria server has a practical limit of 255 players. However, the question asks for a *theoretical* maximum with an *infinite* number of players, so we disregard this practical limit.\n*   **Multiplier Cap:** A review of the Terraria source code for boss scaling reveals that there is no coded cap on the `Health Multiplier`. It increases linearly without a ceiling.\n*   **Data Type Limit:** The boss's health is stored in a 32-bit integer variable (`int`), which has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. While this is a technical limitation, the \"theoretical\" nature of the question implies we should follow the mathematical formula, which has no such limit.\n*   **Boss Phases:** The Eye of Cthulhu's behavior changes at different health percentages (e.g., entering its second phase at 65% health in Expert Mode). These phases are relative to its maximum health (`lifeMax`) and do not affect the calculation of the maximum health itself.\n\nGiven these points, the scaling formula itself is the deciding factor. Since the formula is linear and uncapped, the theoretical health is also uncapped.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode increases linearly with each player added to the game. Because there is no upper limit on this scaling in the game's formula, the theoretical maximum health, given an infinite number of players, is also infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
