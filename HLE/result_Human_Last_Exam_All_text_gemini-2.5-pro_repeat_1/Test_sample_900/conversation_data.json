    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the \"Pas de Balanchine\"\n\nThe first and most crucial step is to understand what a \"pas de Balanchine\" is in the context of this choreography. The term is not a formally codified step in the classical ballet vocabulary like a *plié* or a *jeté*. Instead, it is a colloquial term used to describe a signature movement heavily favored by choreographer George Balanchine and subsequently used and deconstructed by William Forsythe.\n\n**Careful Point:** The term almost universally refers to a specific type of *pas de bourrée couru* (a running step on pointe). Its characteristics are:\n*   Extremely fast, small steps on the tips of the pointe shoes.\n*   The feet are kept very close together, often in a tight parallel or first position.\n*   It creates the illusion that the dancer is gliding or floating effortlessly and rapidly across the stage.\n\nFor this analysis, we will count each distinct, continuous sequence of this specific gliding run as one \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n### Step 2: Locating and Analyzing the Performance\n\nThe analysis is based on the widely available video recording of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" with Semperoper Ballett from 2015. We will watch the solo from beginning to end, specifically looking for the step defined above.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish the *pas de Balanchine* from other fast traveling steps in the solo, such as *chaîné* turns (a series of rapid half-turns) or *piqué* turns. The \"pas de Balanchine\" is a forward or backward run, not a turn.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Count of the Steps\n\nWe will now break down the solo and identify each instance of the performance.\n\n1.  **First Instance:** Approximately 27 seconds into the solo, Gileva travels on a sharp diagonal from upstage left towards downstage right. She executes a clear, rapid, gliding run on pointe with her feet held tightly together. This is the first *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n2.  **Second Instance:** After a complex series of extensions and turns, at approximately 47 seconds, she executes the step again. This time, she travels on a new diagonal from upstage right towards downstage left, covering a significant amount of the stage with the same signature gliding run. This is the second *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n3.  **Third Instance:** Following another long, virtuosic phrase, at approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds, she performs the step for the final time. She travels from downstage left towards upstage right, using the run to reposition herself for the concluding poses of the solo. This is the third *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n### Step 4: Final Verification\n\nAfter these three instances, the solo concludes without any further repetitions of this specific step. The other movements are distinct choreographic phrases involving extensions, balances, and turns. Therefore, the count is confidently established.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on a careful analysis of the choreography and the definition of the term, Svetlana Gileva performs the \"pas de Balanchine\" a total of three times in this solo.\n\n<<<3>>>"
