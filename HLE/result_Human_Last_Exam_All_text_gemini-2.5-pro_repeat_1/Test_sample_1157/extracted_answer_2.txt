The patient's management must begin with an urgent referral to a physician to control her diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.5%) and manage her obesity. Dentally, the immediate steps involve radiographic assessment (CBCT), cleaning and suturing the wounds, and administering antibiotics and a tetanus shot, as replantation is not possible after 28 hours. The key cells of interest are the non-viable Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells on the avulsed teeth, and the patient's own osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells, whose function is impaired by her diabetes. After healing and medical stabilization, the most appropriate treatment is a **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** with a **Cobalt-Chromium cast metal framework**. The abutment teeth will be the **left second premolar (#25)** and **left central incisor (#21, with a rest seat)**, but crucially, the design must include the **right canine (#13)** and **right first premolar (#14)** for cross-arch stabilization to counteract the forces from her skeletal Class III malocclusion (SNB 88‚Å∞) and ensure the prosthesis is stable and does not damage the remaining teeth.
