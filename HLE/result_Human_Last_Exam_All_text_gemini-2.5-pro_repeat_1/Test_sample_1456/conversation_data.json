    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a disk, or more exotic spaces like the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. The interval `[0, 1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is degenerate.\n    *   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A **proper subcontinuum** is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. In other words, a point `q` is in the same composant as `p` if and only if there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` of `X` such that `{p, q} ⊂ K`. The set of all composants partitions the space `X`.\n    *   **Product of two continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their product `X × Y` with the product topology is also a continuum.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Composants to the Structure of the Continuum:**\n    The number of composants of a continuum is determined by whether it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, i.e., `X = A ∪ B` where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n        *   **Careful Point:** For a decomposable continuum, any two points lie in a proper subcontinuum. This means all points belong to the same composant. Therefore, a decomposable continuum has exactly **one** composant (which is the space itself).\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n        *   **Careful Point:** For a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it can be proven (using the Baire Category Theorem) that there are uncountably many composants. The cardinality of the set of composants is **`c`**, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers). Each composant is a dense subset of the space. A classic example of such a space is the pseudo-arc.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `Z = X × Y`:**\n    The problem asks for the *largest possible* number of composants of `Z = X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are non-degenerate continua. Based on Step 2, this reduces to determining the conditions under which `Z` is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n4.  **Case Analysis:**\n    Let `X` and `Y` be non-degenerate continua.\n\n    *   **Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n        Let's assume `X` is decomposable. By definition, `X = A ∪ B` for some proper subcontinua `A` and `B` of `X`.\n        Now consider the product space `Z = X × Y`. We can write it as:\n        `Z = X × Y = (A ∪ B) × Y = (A × Y) ∪ (B × Y)`\n        Let's analyze the terms `A × Y` and `B × Y`:\n        -   `A` and `Y` are continua, so their product `A × Y` is a continuum.\n        -   Since `A` is a proper subset of `X` (i.e., `A ≠ X`), `A × Y` is a proper subset of `X × Y`.\n        -   Therefore, `A × Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n        -   Similarly, `B × Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n        Since we have expressed `Z` as the union of two of its proper subcontinua, `Z` is decomposable.\n        As established, a decomposable continuum has **1** composant.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n        In this case, both `X` and `Y` are non-degenerate and indecomposable continua.\n        There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory (by R. H. Bing and D. P. Bellamy) which states: **The product of a collection of non-degenerate continua is indecomposable if and only if each of the factor continua is indecomposable.**\n        Since both `X` and `Y` are non-degenerate and indecomposable, this theorem implies that their product `Z = X × Y` is also indecomposable.\n        As established, a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. This case is achievable, for example, by taking `X` and `Y` to be two pseudo-arcs.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    By analyzing the cases, we find that the number of composants of the product of two non-degenerate continua `X × Y` can be:\n    *   **1**, if at least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n    *   **`c`**, if both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n    The question asks for the *largest possible* number. Comparing the possible values, `c` is larger than 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
