    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the mathematical objects and the question.**\nThe question asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link. This link is defined by a polynomial equation in an ambient space determined by a set of weights.\n*   **Polynomial:** $P(z) = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n*   **Weights:** $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\nThese weights define a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, $W = \\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is a property of a Gorenstein Fano variety. In this context, the ambient space $W$ is the Fano variety, and the Calabi-Yau variety is a special hypersurface within it. The invariant we need to calculate belongs to $W$.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Calabi-Yau condition and quasihomogeneity.**\nA hypersurface $X_d$ defined by a polynomial of degree $d$ in a weighted projective space $W = \\mathbb{P}(w_1, \\dots, w_n)$ is Calabi-Yau if its degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights, $S = \\sum w_i$.\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of the weights:\n$S = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nSo, for the hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its defining polynomial must be quasihomogeneous of degree $d=225$. Let's check the weighted degrees of the monomials in the given polynomial:\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8(22) + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4(22) + 3(29) + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 22 + 7(29) = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4(49) = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3(50) + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot w_5 = 3(75) = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The polynomial is not quasihomogeneous because the monomial $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a degree of 224, while all other terms and the Calabi-Yau condition require a degree of 225. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. However, the Crawley-Nordström invariant is an intrinsic property of the ambient space $W$ and depends only on the weights, not on the specific equation of the hypersurface. Therefore, we can proceed with the calculation for $W = \\mathbb{P}(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Crawley-Nordström invariant.**\nThe ambient space $W$ is a Fano variety because its anticanonical bundle $-K_W = \\mathcal{O}(\\sum w_i) = \\mathcal{O}(225)$ is ample. The Crawley-Nordström invariant of $W$ is its Gorenstein index. This is the smallest positive integer $l$ such that the bundle $-lK_W$ is a Cartier divisor.\nFor a line bundle $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ on $\\mathbb{P}(w_1, \\dots, w_n)$ to be Cartier, $k$ must be divisible by each weight $w_i$.\nWe need to find the smallest integer $l \\geq 1$ such that $-lK_W = \\mathcal{O}(l \\cdot S) = \\mathcal{O}(225l)$ is Cartier. This means $w_i$ must divide $225l$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 5$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the calculation.**\nThe condition $w_i | 225l$ for all $i$ is equivalent to $l$ being a multiple of $\\frac{w_i}{\\gcd(w_i, 225)}$ for all $i$. To find the smallest such positive integer $l$, we must compute the least common multiple (LCM) of these values.\nThe formula is:\n$l = \\text{lcm} \\left( \\frac{w_1}{\\gcd(w_1, S)}, \\frac{w_2}{\\gcd(w_2, S)}, \\frac{w_3}{\\gcd(w_3, S)}, \\frac{w_4}{\\gcd(w_4, S)}, \\frac{w_5}{\\gcd(w_5, S)} \\right)$\nwhere $S=225$.\n\n**Step 5: Perform the calculation.**\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $S$: $S = 225 = 9 \\times 25 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$.\nNow, we compute each term for the LCM:\n\n*   **For $w_1 = 22 = 2 \\times 11$**:\n    $\\gcd(22, 225) = \\gcd(2 \\times 11, 3^2 \\times 5^2) = 1$.\n    The term is $\\frac{22}{1} = 22$.\n\n*   **For $w_2 = 29$ (a prime number)**:\n    $\\gcd(29, 225) = \\gcd(29, 3^2 \\times 5^2) = 1$.\n    The term is $\\frac{29}{1} = 29$.\n\n*   **For $w_3 = 49 = 7^2$**:\n    $\\gcd(49, 225) = \\gcd(7^2, 3^2 \\times 5^2) = 1$.\n    The term is $\\frac{49}{1} = 49$.\n\n*   **For $w_4 = 50 = 2 \\times 5^2$**:\n    $\\gcd(50, 225) = \\gcd(2 \\times 5^2, 3^2 \\times 5^2) = 5^2 = 25$.\n    The term is $\\frac{50}{25} = 2$.\n\n*   **For $w_5 = 75 = 3 \\times 5^2$**:\n    $\\gcd(75, 225) = \\gcd(3 \\times 5^2, 3^2 \\times 5^2) = 3 \\times 5^2 = 75$.\n    The term is $\\frac{75}{75} = 1$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We now need to calculate the LCM of these resulting values.\n$l = \\text{lcm}(22, 29, 49, 2, 1)$.\nSince 2 is a factor of 22, and 1 is a factor of any integer, this simplifies to:\n$l = \\text{lcm}(22, 29, 49)$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** To find the LCM, we look at the prime factorizations:\n*   $22 = 2 \\times 11$\n*   $29 = 29$\n*   $49 = 7^2$\nThese three numbers are pairwise coprime (they share no common prime factors). Therefore, their LCM is simply their product.\n\n$l = 22 \\times 29 \\times 49$.\n\nLet's compute the product:\n$22 \\times 29 = 22 \\times (30 - 1) = 660 - 22 = 638$.\n$638 \\times 49 = 638 \\times (50 - 1) = (638 \\times 50) - 638 = 31900 - 638 = 31262$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant is 31262.\n\n<<<31262>>>"
