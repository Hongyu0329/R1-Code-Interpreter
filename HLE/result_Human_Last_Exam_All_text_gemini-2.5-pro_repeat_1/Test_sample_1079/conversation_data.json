    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Group and its Properties**\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3**: This is a finite Coxeter group, also known as the full icosahedral group. Its order is $|H_3| = 120$. It represents the full symmetry group of a regular icosahedron or dodecahedron.\n*   **Coxeter Number**: For a finite Coxeter group, the Coxeter number, denoted by $h$, is a fundamental invariant. For the group of type H3, the Coxeter number is $h=10$.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10**: We are interested in an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of an element $w \\in H_3$ such that $\\lambda^{10} = 1$ and $\\lambda^k \\neq 1$ for any $1 \\le k < 10$. This means $\\lambda$ is a primitive 10th root of unity. Since the Coxeter number $h=10$, these are precisely the primitive $h$-th roots of unity.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector $v$ of an element $w$ is called *regular* if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes associated with the group H3. The reflecting hyperplanes for H3 are the 15 planes of symmetry of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Key Theorem**\n\nA crucial theorem in the theory of reflection groups (due to T.A. Springer) provides a powerful connection between these concepts:\n\n**Theorem**: An element $w$ in a finite Coxeter group $W$ has a regular eigenvector if and only if $w$ is conjugate to a *Coxeter element*.\n\nFurthermore, the eigenvalues of a regular element $w$ that correspond to regular eigenvectors are precisely the primitive $h$-th roots of unity among its eigenvalues.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10. Since $h=10$, this is equivalent to asking for the number of elements that have a regular eigenvector. By the theorem, this is the set of all elements in H3 that are conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Coxeter Elements and their Conjugacy Class**\n\n*   **Coxeter Element**: A Coxeter element is a product of all the simple reflections of the group, each appearing exactly once. For H3, with simple reflections $s_1, s_2, s_3$, a Coxeter element is of the form $c = s_1s_2s_3$ or any other permutation of the product.\n*   **Conjugacy**: In any finite Coxeter group, all Coxeter elements are conjugate to one another. Therefore, they all belong to a single conjugacy class.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element in H3.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Size of the Conjugacy Class**\n\nThe size of the conjugacy class of an element $c$ in a group $G$ is given by the formula:\nSize of Class = $|G| / |C_G(c)|$\nwhere $|G|$ is the order of the group and $|C_G(c)|$ is the order of the centralizer of $c$ in $G$.\n\n*   **Order of H3**: $|H_3| = 120$.\n*   **Centralizer of a Coxeter Element**: For an irreducible finite Coxeter group (which H3 is), there is a theorem stating that the centralizer of a Coxeter element $c$ is the cyclic group generated by $c$ itself. So, $C_{H_3}(c) = \\langle c \\rangle$.\n*   **Order of a Coxeter Element**: The order of the centralizer is therefore equal to the order of the element $c$. The order of $c$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its eigenvalues.\n*   **Eigenvalues of a Coxeter Element**: The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element are given by the formula $\\lambda_j = e^{2\\pi i (d_j - 1)/h}$, where $d_j$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariant polynomials of the group. For H3, the degrees are $d_1 = 2$, $d_2 = 6$, and $d_3 = 10$. With $h=10$, the eigenvalues are:\n    *   $\\lambda_1 = e^{2\\pi i (2-1)/10} = e^{2\\pi i / 10}$. The order of this eigenvalue is 10.\n    *   $\\lambda_2 = e^{2\\pi i (6-1)/10} = e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 5/10} = e^{\\pi i} = -1$. The order of this eigenvalue is 2.\n    *   $\\lambda_3 = e^{2\\pi i (10-1)/10} = e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 9/10}$. The order of this eigenvalue is 10.\n*   **Calculating the Order**: The order of the Coxeter element $c$ is lcm(10, 2, 10) = 10.\n*   **Size of the Centralizer**: $|C_{H_3}(c)| = |\\langle c \\rangle| = 10$.\n*   **Size of the Conjugacy Class**: Size = $|H_3| / |C_{H_3}(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of elements that are conjugate to a Coxeter element is 12. Based on the theorems discussed, this is exactly the number of elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\bf{12}$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
