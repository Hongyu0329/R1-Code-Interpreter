    "**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n        *   This is a substituted cyclohexane. The substituents are a bromine atom at position 1 and a methyl group at position 2.\n        *   The stereochemistry is given as (1S, 2R). Let's determine the relative stereochemistry (cis/trans). For (1S, 2R) on adjacent carbons, the substituents are *cis*. Therefore, the reactant is cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH).\n        *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n        *   Tert-butyl alcohol is a polar aprotic solvent.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide.\n    *   The reagent is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   These conditions strongly favor an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. SN2 is disfavored due to the bulky base and secondary substrate. E1/SN1 reactions are disfavored by the strong base.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements for E2:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br⁻) and a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions, one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Conformations of the Reactant:**\n    *   The reactant, cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, exists as an equilibrium of two chair conformations.\n    *   **Conformation A:** Let's place the bulky methyl group in the more stable equatorial position. For the substituents to be cis, the bromine atom must be in the axial position.\n        *   CH₃: equatorial\n        *   Br: axial\n    *   **Conformation B (after ring flip):** The methyl group becomes axial and the bromine atom becomes equatorial.\n        *   CH₃: axial\n        *   Br: equatorial\n    *   The E2 reaction can only proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must occur via **Conformation A**. This is also the more stable of the two conformers, so it will be present in a higher concentration at equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Identify Possible Products (Regiochemistry):**\n    *   In Conformation A (axial Br), we need to find β-hydrogens that are also axial. The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The methyl group at C2 is equatorial. Therefore, the hydrogen at C2 is axial. Elimination of this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene (trisubstituted), known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** Carbon 6 has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination of this hydrogen would form a double bond between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (disubstituted), known as the **Hofmann product**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Major Product (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev Rule):**\n    *   The regioselectivity of the E2 reaction depends on the base.\n    *   **Small bases** (like ethoxide) favor the formation of the more stable, more substituted alkene (Zaitsev's Rule).\n    *   **Bulky bases** (like potassium tert-butoxide) favor the removal of the sterically most accessible proton, leading to the less substituted alkene (Hofmann's Rule).\n    *   In this reaction, the base is potassium tert-butoxide, which is bulky. It will preferentially attack the less sterically hindered proton.\n    *   The proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2 (which is on the same carbon as the methyl group).\n    *   Therefore, the **Hofmann product is the major product**.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n    *   The reaction proceeds through the conformer with an axial bromine.\n    *   The bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) favors the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n    *   The major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
