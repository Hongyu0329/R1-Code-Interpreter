    "This problem asks for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set contained within the real interval [0, 1].\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set `E` is a Sidon set (also known as a B2 set) if the sums of pairs of its elements are unique. For a set `E ⊂ [0, 1]`, this means that for any `x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄ ∈ E`, the equation `x₁ + x₂ = x₃ + x₄` implies that the pair of elements `{x₁, x₂}` is the same as `{x₃, x₄}` (as multisets). This means either `x₁ = x₃` and `x₂ = x₄`, or `x₁ = x₄` and `x₂ = x₃`.\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted `dim_H(E)`, is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension of a set `E`. It generalizes the concept of dimension to non-integer values. For example, the dimension of a point is 0, a line is 1, a plane is 2, but the middle-third Cantor set has a dimension of `log(2)/log(3) ≈ 0.63`.\n\n**Step 2: Explore simple candidate sets**\n\nLet's see if we can construct a Sidon set with a large Hausdorff dimension. A natural candidate for a fractal set is a Cantor-like set.\n\nConsider the standard middle-third Cantor set, `C`. Its elements are numbers in `[0, 1]` that can be written in base 3 using only the digits 0 and 2. Its Hausdorff dimension is `log(2)/log(3)`. Let's check if `C` is a Sidon set.\nLet:\n*   `x₁ = 1` (which is `0.222...` in base 3 and belongs to `C`)\n*   `x₂ = 0` (which belongs to `C`)\n*   `x₃ = 3/4` (which is `0.2020...` in base 3 and belongs to `C`)\n*   `x₄ = 1/4` (which is `0.0202...` in base 3 and belongs to `C`)\n\nWe have `x₁ + x₂ = 1 + 0 = 1`, and `x₃ + x₄ = 3/4 + 1/4 = 1`.\nSo, `x₁ + x₂ = x₃ + x₄`. However, the set of elements `{x₁, x₂} = {1, 0}` is not the same as `{x₃, x₄} = {3/4, 1/4}`.\nTherefore, the standard Cantor set is **not** a Sidon set.\n\nSimilar arguments show that many simple Cantor-like sets constructed with a fixed base and a fixed set of digits (e.g., `x = Σ dₖ / Mᵏ` where `dₖ ∈ D`) are not Sidon sets. The reason is that one can often construct different pairs of numbers whose digits sum to the same value at each position, leading to a violation of the Sidon condition.\n\n**Step 3: Finding an upper bound for the dimension**\n\nThis is a deep result in harmonic analysis. A theorem, attributed to Jean Bourgain, states that if `E ⊂ [0, 1]` (or more generally, on the circle `ℝ/ℤ`) is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1/2.\n\n`dim_H(E) ≤ 1/2`\n\nThe proof is quite advanced and uses Fourier analysis. Here is a very high-level sketch:\n1.  If a set `E` has Hausdorff dimension `α`, then by Frostman's Lemma, it can support a probability measure `μ` with finite `s`-energy for any `s < α`. The `s`-energy `I_s(μ)` is related to the decay of the Fourier coefficients `μ̂(n)` of the measure. Specifically, `I_s(μ) < ∞` implies that `Σ |μ̂(n)|²|n|ˢ⁻¹ < ∞`.\n2.  On the other hand, the Sidon property of the set `E` imposes a strong constraint on any measure `μ` it supports. This property implies that `Σ |μ̂(n)|⁴` is bounded.\n3.  The core of the proof is to show that these two conditions on the Fourier coefficients `μ̂(n)` are contradictory if we assume the dimension `α` is greater than 1/2. If `α > 1/2`, we could pick an `s` between 1/2 and `α`, and the rate of decay required by the finite `s`-energy condition would contradict the properties derived from the bound on the sum of `|μ̂(n)|⁴`.\n\n**Step 4: Finding a lower bound for the dimension (existence)**\n\nTo show that 1/2 is the maximum possible dimension, we need to show that there actually exists a Sidon set that achieves this dimension.\n*   In 1954, Salem and Zygmund proved that for any `α < 1/2`, there exists a Sidon set `E` with `dim_H(E) ≥ α`. This established that the maximum dimension is at least 1/2.\n*   The construction of a Sidon set with dimension *exactly* 1/2 is more recent and highly non-trivial. S. V. Astashkin (2011) provided a probabilistic construction of a Sidon set `E` with `dim_H(E) = 1/2`.\n\nThese constructions are typically probabilistic, defining a set `E` as the set of all possible sums of a random series, for instance, `E = { Σ cₖ ωₖ }` where `ωₖ` are random variables and the coefficients `cₖ` are chosen very carefully. Proving that such a set is simultaneously a Sidon set and has dimension 1/2 is a significant achievement.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\n*   From Step 3, we know that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set `E ⊂ [0, 1]` is at most 1/2.\n*   From Step 4, we know that Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1/2 exist.\n\nCombining these two facts, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0, 1]` is exactly 1/2.\n\nFinal Answer is 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
