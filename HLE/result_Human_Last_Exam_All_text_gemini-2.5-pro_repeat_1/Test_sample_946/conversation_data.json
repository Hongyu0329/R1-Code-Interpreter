    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific media and episode.**\nThe question asks about the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\", and specifically the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the event within the episode.**\nThe event is the Junior Prom that the Teen Girl Squad attends.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the \"performer\" at the event.**\nThe question states the performer is a cardboard cutout. We need to find out who this cutout depicts.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the scene at the Junior Prom in Teen Girl Squad #15.**\nIn the episode, the narrator (Cheerleader) describes the prom's entertainment. The dialogue is: \"The entertainment was a cardboard cutout of... a slightly more popular singer!\"\n\n**Step 5: Identify the name of the fictional singer.**\nThe scene then cuts to the cardboard cutout. It shows a man with spiky hair and a soul patch holding a microphone. On the screen, there is a caption with an arrow pointing to the cutout. The caption reads \"ARROWED GUY\". This is the name given to the fictional singer.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question specifies a **fictional** singer. The character \"Arrowed Guy\" is indeed fictional and exists only within the Homestar Runner universe.\n*   The name is a literal description, a common comedic device in the series. The character is named \"Arrowed Guy\" because there is an arrow pointing to him with those words.\n*   The cutout also includes the text \"Live* from 'the stick'\", with a footnote clarifying \"*not live\", adding to the joke. However, the singer's name is clearly identified as \"Arrowed Guy\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the visual evidence and text provided in the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior prom is of the fictional singer named \"Arrowed Guy\".\n\n<<<Arrowed Guy>>>"
