    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the diagrams\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction vertex connects four field lines. A second-order diagram contains two such vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram has no external legs, meaning all lines must start and end on vertices within the diagram. For a diagram to be a true second-order contribution, it must be connected. There are two topologically distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n1.  **The \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:** The two vertices are connected to each other by all four available lines from each vertex. This means there are four distinct propagators running between the two vertices.\n    \n2.  **The \"Figure-8\" (or \"Double-Scoop\") Diagram:** In this topology, two lines from each vertex connect to each other, forming a loop (a tadpole) on that vertex. The remaining two lines from each vertex are used to connect the two vertices. So, this diagram consists of two vertices, each with a self-loop, connected to each other by two propagators.\n\nDisconnected diagrams, such as two separate single-vertex diagrams, are not included as they are accounted for by the exponentiation of connected diagrams in the linked-cluster theorem.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n**Diagram 1: The \"Setting Sun\" Diagram**\n\nLet's count the symmetries of this diagram:\n*   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices are identical. They can be swapped without changing the diagram's structure. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n*   **Propagator Permutation:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted among themselves in any way. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n\nThese two types of symmetries are independent. Therefore, the total symmetry factor for the \"Setting Sun\" diagram is the product of these factors.\n\n$S_1 = (\\text{Vertex Symmetries}) \\times (\\text{Propagator Symmetries}) = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to recognize that both vertex and line permutations contribute to the symmetry factor.\n\n**Diagram 2: The \"Figure-8\" Diagram**\n\nLet's count the symmetries of this diagram:\n*   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices are structurally identical. Each has one self-loop and is connected to the other vertex by two lines. Swapping them leaves the diagram invariant. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n*   **Propagator Permutation (Connecting Lines):** There are two identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These can be swapped. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n*   **Propagator Permutation (Loops):** Each vertex has a loop formed by a single propagator connecting the vertex to itself. This involves two of the four \"legs\" of the vertex. Since the four fields at the vertex are identical, the two legs forming the loop can be swapped without changing the diagram.\n    *   For the loop at the first vertex, there is a factor of 2 symmetry from swapping its two legs.\n    *   For the loop at the second vertex, there is also a factor of 2 symmetry.\n\nThese symmetries are all independent operations. The total symmetry factor is the product of all these individual factors.\n\n$S_2 = (\\text{Vertex Swap}) \\times (\\text{Connecting Line Swap}) \\times (\\text{Loop 1 Flip}) \\times (\\text{Loop 2 Flip}) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n**Careful Point:** A common mistake is to overlook the symmetry of the loops themselves. Since a loop in $\\phi^4$ theory is formed by contracting two of the four identical fields at a vertex, the two ends of the propagator forming the loop are interchangeable.\n\n### Step 3: Sum the Symmetry Factors\nThe question asks for the sum of all the symmetry factors for each second-order vacuum bubble diagram.\n\n*   Symmetry factor of the \"Setting Sun\" diagram, $S_1 = 48$.\n*   Symmetry factor of the \"Figure-8\" diagram, $S_2 = 16$.\n\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
