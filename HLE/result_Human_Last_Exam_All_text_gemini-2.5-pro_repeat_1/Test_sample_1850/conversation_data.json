    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Key Terms**\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\":** In the context of Milton, a Protestant poet, the term \"saint\" is not limited to figures canonized by the Catholic Church. It can more broadly refer to any holy or righteous person recognized in the biblical narrative. For this analysis, we will include major revered figures from the Old and New Testaments who are part of salvation history.\n*   **\"Paradise Lost\":** The analysis is strictly confined to the text of Milton's epic poem.\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\":** This is a crucial constraint. The figure must be referred to by their proper name (e.g., \"Moses\"), not just by a title or description (e.g., \"the great lawgiver\" or \"the virgin\").\n\n### **Step 2: Searching the Text for Named Saints**\n\nWe will systematically review the poem, primarily focusing on Books XI and XII, where the Archangel Michael reveals future biblical history to Adam.\n\n1.  **Abel:** In Book XI, Michael shows Adam the first murder. Abel is explicitly named: \"...the blood of righteous **Abel** slain...\" (XI, 453). (Count: 1)\n\n2.  **Enoch:** In Book XI, Michael recounts the story of Enoch's assumption into heaven: \"the only son of Jared, **Enoch**...\" (XI, 665). (Count: 2)\n\n3.  **Noah:** In Book XI, the story of the Great Flood is told, and Noah is named as the man chosen for salvation: \"One Man except, the only Son of light... from righteous **Noah**...\" (XI, 808 & 871). (Count: 3)\n\n4.  **Abraham:** In Book XII, Michael tells Adam of the covenant with Abraham, who is mentioned by name (both as Abram and Abraham): \"I will bring him forth... **Abram**, and his seed...\" (XII, 130) and \"From **Abraham's** loins...\" (XII, 148). (Count: 4)\n\n5.  **Jacob:** In Book III, God himself refers to the patriarch Jacob while speaking of the chosen people: \"From Abraham his loins, and **Jacob** named Israel...\" (III, 161). (Count: 5)\n\n6.  **Moses:** He is alluded to in the opening of Book I (\"that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed\"). He is explicitly named in Book XII when Michael explains the giving of the Law: \"...they beseech that **Moses** might report to them his will...\" (XII, 243). (Count: 6)\n\n7.  **Joshua:** In Book XII, Michael speaks of the one who will lead the Israelites into the promised land, explicitly naming him: \"But **Joshua**, whom the Gentiles Jesus call, / His name and office bearing...\" (XII, 310). (Count: 7)\n\n8.  **David:** In Book XII, Michael prophesies about the line of kings that will lead to the Messiah, naming King David: \"...the imperial throne / Of **David's** house...\" (XII, 329). (Count: 8)\n\n### **Step 3: Considering and Excluding Other Figures**\n\nIt is important to consider figures who are mentioned but do not meet all the criteria.\n\n*   **Mary, Mother of Jesus:** She is a central figure in the Incarnation story told in Book XII, but she is only referred to as \"**a virgin**\" or \"**his mother**.\" She is not mentioned by the name \"Mary.\"\n*   **The Apostles (Peter, Paul, John, etc.):** None of the twelve apostles or St. Paul are mentioned by their proper names in the poem. Peter is alluded to as \"the Rock,\" but not named.\n*   **Elijah:** He is clearly described being taken to heaven in a fiery chariot in Book XI, but he is never explicitly named.\n*   **Isaac and Joseph:** Isaac is referred to as Abraham's \"son of his great promise\" but not named. Joseph is referenced via his lineage (\"the house of Joseph\"), which is a metonym for the northern kingdom of Israel, not a direct mention of the person himself.\n*   **Adam and Eve:** While they are the central human characters and are revered as saints in some traditions, they are the protagonists of the poem's main narrative rather than historical figures \"mentioned\" as examples from a later time. The question's phrasing implies figures brought into the narrative from subsequent history.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on a careful reading of *Paradise Lost* and adhering strictly to the condition that the saints must be \"mentioned by name,\" we arrive at a final count. The historical saints named are Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, and David.\n\nThe final count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
