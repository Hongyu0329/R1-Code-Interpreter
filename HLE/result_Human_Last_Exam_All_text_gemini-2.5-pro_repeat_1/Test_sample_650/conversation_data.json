    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;`: This is a single assignment operation. It takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   `x := n;`: This is another single assignment. It takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This involves one division. Assuming that `n` and `c` fit into machine-sized words, this operation takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication and one subtraction. These are also O(1) operations.\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The initialization part of the algorithm consists of a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, its time complexity is O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Loop (Step 2):**\n    *   The algorithm's core is the `while q > 0` loop. The total time spent in this part is the cost of the operations inside the loop multiplied by the number of times the loop executes.\n    *   **Work inside one loop iteration (Step 2.1):**\n        *   `i := i + 1;`: One increment operation, O(1).\n        *   `x := q;`: One assignment, O(1).\n        *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: One division, O(1).\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc;`: One multiplication and one subtraction, O(1).\n        *   **Conclusion for one iteration:** The body of the loop performs a constant number of operations. Thus, each iteration takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Number of loop iterations:** To find the overall complexity of the loop, we must determine how many times it runs. The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's track the value of `q`.\n        *   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After the 1st iteration: The new `q` is calculated from the old `q`. So, `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is equal to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n        *   After the 2nd iteration: `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋`, which is equal to `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations: The value of `q` will be `⌊n / c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   **Loop Termination:** The loop stops when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n / c^(k+1) < 1`.\n    *   We can solve for `k`:\n        `n < c^(k+1)`\n        `log_c(n) < k+1`\n        `k > log_c(n) - 1`\n    *   This shows that the number of iterations, `k`, is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of times the loop runs is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 2:** The loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times, and each iteration takes O(1) time. Therefore, the total time complexity of the loop is `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Return (Step 3):**\n    *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`: This step simply returns the computed digits. It does not involve any further computation that depends on `n`. This is an O(1) operation.\n\n4.  **Overall Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n        Time(Total) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n        Time(Total) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)\n    *   For large values of `n`, the `O(log_c(n))` term is the dominant one.\n    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Assumption on Arithmetic:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, addition, subtraction) take constant time (O(1)). This is a standard assumption in algorithm analysis when numbers fit into a computer's word size. If `n` were an arbitrarily large number requiring special data structures, the cost of these operations would depend on the number of bits in `n`, leading to a different complexity (typically `O((log n)²) `).\n2.  **Logarithm Base:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class because `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`, and `1/log_b(c)` is just a constant factor. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n3.  **Input Parameter:** The complexity is a function of the input value `n`. As `n` increases, the number of loop iterations increases logarithmically.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the `while` loop. The loop executes a number of times proportional to the number of digits in the base-c representation of `n`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Since each loop iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
