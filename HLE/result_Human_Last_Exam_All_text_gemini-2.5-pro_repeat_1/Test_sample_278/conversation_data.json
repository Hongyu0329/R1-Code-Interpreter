    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nwhere the parameter $b$ depends on the interval of $t$:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.\n\nLet's analyze the two parts of the curve separately.\n\n**Part 1: $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nWe can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.\nSince $t$ is in the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, which means $y \\ge 0$.\nThis part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of radius 1.\n*   At $t=0$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi/2, \\sin \\pi/2) = (0, 1)$.\n*   At $t=\\pi$: $(x, y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n\n**Part 2: $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nWe can write this as $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$.\nThen $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\nSince $t$ is in the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t < 0$, which means $y < 0$.\nThis part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n*   As $t \\to \\pi^+$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1, 0)$.\n*   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x, y) = (\\cos 3\\pi/2, 5\\sin 3\\pi/2) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$: $(x, y) \\to (\\cos 2\\pi, 5\\sin 2\\pi) = (1, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the boundaries of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first need to find the overall extent of the figure in the x and y directions. This is given by the minimum and maximum values of x and y.\n\n*   **x-coordinates:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1 and the maximum value is 1.\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **y-coordinates:** The y-coordinate depends on the interval.\n    *   For the upper semi-circle ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$).\n    *   For the lower semi-ellipse ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value is -5 (at $t=3\\pi/2$).\n    So, the overall range for the y-coordinate is from -5 to 1.\n    *   $y_{min} = -5$\n    *   $y_{max} = 1$\n    The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest circumscribing square**\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle defined by the boundaries we found: $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 1]$. This rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6.\n\nA square that \"outcircles\" or circumscribes this figure must be large enough to contain this entire bounding rectangle. Let the side length of the square be $S$. The side length $S$ must be at least as large as the width of the figure and at least as large as the height of the figure.\n*   $S \\ge W = 2$\n*   $S \\ge H = 6$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, the smallest possible side length for the square is the larger of these two dimensions.\n$S = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length $S$ is $A = S^2$.\nWith $S=6$, the area is:\n$A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The piecewise definition of `b` is crucial. It creates a composite figure made of two different conic sections.\n*   It's important to find the extrema (min/max values) for both x and y over the entire domain of $t$ to correctly establish the figure's dimensions.\n*   The term \"smallest square that outcircles\" is typically interpreted as the smallest axis-aligned square, whose side is the maximum of the figure's overall width and height.\n\nThe final answer is the area of this smallest square.\n\n<<<36>>>"
