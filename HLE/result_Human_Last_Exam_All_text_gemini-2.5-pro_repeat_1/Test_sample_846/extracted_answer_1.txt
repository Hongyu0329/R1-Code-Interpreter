To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, when exposed to the sun's UV light, the table should bend or fold, mimicking the isomerization of the stable, straight *trans*-azobenzene to the bent *cis*-azobenzene. At sunset, when the UV light source is gone, the table must straighten back out to its original shape, mimicking the thermal relaxation of the *cis* isomer back to the more stable *trans* form.
