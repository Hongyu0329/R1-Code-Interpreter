    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **$\\Sigma_g$**: This denotes the oriented, closed surface of genus $g$. It is a 2-dimensional manifold. For $g=0$, it is the sphere $S^2$. For $g=1$, it is the torus $T^2$. For $g \\ge 2$, it is a hyperbolic surface.\n*   **Simplicial Volume ($||M||_1$)**: This is a topological invariant of a closed, oriented manifold $M$. It measures the minimal \"complexity\" of the manifold's fundamental class in terms of real singular simplices.\n\n**Step 2: Recall Key Formulas**\n\nTwo main results from the theory of simplicial volume are crucial here:\n\n1.  **Simplicial Volume of a Surface ($\\Sigma_g$):**\n    The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ depends on its Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. The formula, due to Gromov, is:\n    *   $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 0$ if $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) \\ge 0$ (which corresponds to $g=0$ and $g=1$).\n    *   $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$ if $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) < 0$ (which corresponds to $g \\ge 2$).\n    For $g \\ge 2$, this simplifies to $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$.\n\n2.  **Simplicial Volume of a Product (Gromov's Product Formula):**\n    For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n    $||M \\times N||_1 = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M||_1 ||N||_1$\n    where $\\binom{k}{j}$ is the binomial coefficient. This formula holds provided the simplicial volumes of the factors are non-zero. If either factor has zero simplicial volume, the product also has zero simplicial volume.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Simplicial Volume of Each Factor**\n\nWe need to compute the simplicial volumes for $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{31}$**:\n    The genus is $g=31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, we use the formula $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 4g-4$.\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}||_1 = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma_{17}$**:\n    The genus is $g=17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, we again use the formula $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 4g-4$.\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}||_1 = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\nSince both factors have non-zero simplicial volume, the product will also have a non-zero simplicial volume.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Product Formula**\n\nNow we apply Gromov's product formula to find $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}||_1$.\n\n*   The manifold is $M \\times N = \\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$.\n*   The dimension of $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ is $m=2$.\n*   The dimension of $N = \\Sigma_{17}$ is $n=2$.\n*   The simplicial volumes of the factors are $||\\Sigma_{31}||_1 = 120$ and $||\\Sigma_{17}||_1 = 64$.\n\nThe formula is $||M \\times N||_1 = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M||_1 ||N||_1$.\nFirst, calculate the binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{m+n}{m} = \\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\nNow, substitute all the values into the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}||_1 = 6 \\times ||\\Sigma_{31}||_1 \\times ||\\Sigma_{17}||_1$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}||_1 = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nPerform the arithmetic:\n$6 \\times 120 = 720$\n$720 \\times 64 = 46080$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Correct Formula for Surface Volume**: It is essential to use the correct formula $||\\Sigma_g||_1 = 4g-4$ for $g \\ge 2$ and to recognize that the genera 31 and 17 fall into this category.\n2.  **Correct Binomial Coefficient**: The product formula depends on a binomial coefficient which must be calculated correctly. For the product of two surfaces (both dimension 2), the coefficient is always $\\binom{4}{2}=6$.\n3.  **Applicability of the Product Formula**: The product formula works as stated because the simplicial volumes of the factor manifolds are non-zero.\n4.  **Arithmetic Precision**: The final step is a simple multiplication, but care must be taken to avoid errors.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is calculated as follows:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}||_1 = \\binom{4}{2} \\times (4 \\times 31 - 4) \\times (4 \\times 17 - 4)$\n$= 6 \\times (124 - 4) \\times (68 - 4)$\n$= 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 720 \\times 64$\n$= 46080$\n\n<<<46080>>>"
