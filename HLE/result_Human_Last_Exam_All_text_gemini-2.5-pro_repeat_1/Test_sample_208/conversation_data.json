    "This is a classic geometry problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". We are asked to find the radius of the smallest circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understanding the \"Tightly Packed\" Condition**\n    The term \"tightly packed\" implies that the arrangement of the 14 smaller circles is such that the radius of the larger, containing circle is minimized. For such an arrangement to be stable and well-defined, we can assume it forms a rigid structure, meaning the circles are locked in place by a chain of tangencies.\n\n2.  **Proposing a Plausible Configuration**\n    For `N=14`, there is no simple, perfectly symmetrical arrangement like for smaller `N`. However, a common and highly symmetric configuration to consider is a central cluster of circles surrounded by an outer ring. Given the number 14, a `3-9` configuration is a strong candidate. This consists of:\n    *   An inner cluster of 3 circles, themselves tightly packed in an equilateral triangle.\n    *   An outer ring of 9 circles packed around the inner cluster.\n    We will analyze this rigid `3-9` configuration.\n\n3.  **Setting up the Coordinate System**\n    Let the radius of the small circles be `r = 1`. We place the center of the large containing circle at the origin `O = (0, 0)`. For maximum stability and symmetry, the centroid of the inner 3-circle cluster is also placed at the origin.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Inner Cluster**\n    *   The centers of the three inner circles, let's call them `P1`, `P2`, and `P3`, form an equilateral triangle.\n    *   Since the circles are tangent, the side length of this triangle is `r + r = 2`.\n    *   The distance from the centroid (origin `O`) to any vertex (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`) is the circumradius of this triangle, which is `d_in = (side) / √3 = 2 / √3`.\n    *   Let's place `P1` on the positive x-axis: `P1 = (2/√3, 0)`.\n    *   Then `P2` and `P3` are at `P2 = (-1/√3, 1)` and `P3 = (-1/√3, -1)`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Outer Ring**\n    The 9 outer circles are packed around this central cluster. Due to the 3-fold symmetry of the inner cluster, the outer circles will not be identical in their positioning. There are two distinct types:\n    *   **Type D (3 circles):** Each lies in a \"valley\" formed between two inner circles.\n    *   **Type G (6 circles):** Each lies behind one of the inner circles.\n\n    We need to find the coordinates of the centers of these outer circles to see which ones extend furthest from the origin.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Position of a Type D Circle**\n    *   Let's find the center, `P_D`, of an outer circle that lies in the valley between `P2` and `P3`. By symmetry, `P_D` must lie on the negative x-axis. Let `P_D = (-x, 0)`.\n    *   This circle is tangent to the circle at `P2`. The distance between their centers is `r + r = 2`.\n    *   `|P_D P2|^2 = (-x - (-1/√3))^2 + (0 - 1)^2 = 2^2`\n    *   `(-x + 1/√3)^2 + 1 = 4`\n    *   `(-x + 1/√3)^2 = 3`\n    *   `-x + 1/√3 = -√3` (we choose the negative root as `-x` is negative).\n    *   `-x = -√3 - 1/√3 = -4/√3`.\n    *   So, the center is `P_D = (-4/√3, 0)`. The distance of this center from the origin is `|OP_D| = 4/√3`.\n\n7.  **Calculating the Position of a Type G Circle**\n    *   Let's find the center, `P_G`, of an outer circle that is tangent to the inner circle at `P1`. In a rigid structure, this circle will also be tangent to its two neighbors in the outer ring.\n    *   By symmetry, one of these neighbors is a Type D circle, let's say the one in the valley between `P1` and `P3`. Its center, `P_F`, can be found by rotating `P_D` by -120 degrees, which gives `P_F = (2/√3, -2)`.\n    *   Now, `P_G = (x_g, y_g)` is defined by two tangencies:\n        1.  Tangent to the circle at `P1=(2/√3, 0)`: `(x_g - 2/√3)^2 + y_g^2 = 2^2 = 4`.\n        2.  Tangent to the circle at `P_F=(2/√3, -2)`: `(x_g - 2/√3)^2 + (y_g - (-2))^2 = 2^2 = 4`.\n    *   From these two equations, we can equate `y_g^2 = (y_g + 2)^2`.\n    *   `y_g^2 = y_g^2 + 4y_g + 4`, which simplifies to `4y_g = -4`, so `y_g = -1`.\n    *   Substitute `y_g = -1` into the first equation:\n        `(x_g - 2/√3)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4`\n        `(x_g - 2/√3)^2 = 3`\n        `x_g - 2/√3 = √3` (we choose the positive root as it's an outer circle).\n        `x_g = 2/√3 + √3 = 5/√3`.\n    *   So, the center is `P_G = (5/√3, -1)`.\n\n8.  **Determining the Outermost Circle**\n    *   The radius `R` of the large containing circle is determined by the small circle whose center is furthest from the origin. We compare the distances `|OP_D|` and `|OP_G|`.\n    *   `|OP_D| = 4/√3 ≈ 2.309`.\n    *   `|OP_G| = √((5/√3)^2 + (-1)^2) = √(25/3 + 1) = √(28/3) ≈ 3.055`.\n    *   Since `|OP_G| > |OP_D|`, the Type G circles are further out and will define the radius of the containing circle.\n\n9.  **Calculating the Final Radius**\n    *   The radius `R` is the distance from the origin to the center of this outermost circle, plus its own radius `r`.\n    *   `R = |OP_G| + r = √(28/3) + 1`.\n    *   `R = (√28 / √3) + 1 = (2√7 / √3) + 1 = (2√21 / 3) + 1`.\n    *   Numerically, `√21 ≈ 4.582576`.\n    *   `R ≈ (2 * 4.582576) / 3 + 1 ≈ 9.165152 / 3 + 1 ≈ 3.05505 + 1 = 4.05505`.\n\n10. **Final Answer**\n    The radius of the circle, up to 4 significant digits, is 4.055.\n\n<<<4.055>>>"
