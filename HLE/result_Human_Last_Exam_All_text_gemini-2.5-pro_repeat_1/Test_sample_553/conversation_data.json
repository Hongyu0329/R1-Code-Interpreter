    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Question:**\n    *   **Artist:** The Beatles.\n    *   **Placement:** The musical event happens at the very start of the song.\n    *   **Musical Event:** A chord jump (a direct progression) from a \"tonic\" chord to a \"minor fifth\" chord.\n\n2.  **Understand the Music Theory Terms:**\n    *   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of G major, the tonic chord is G major.\n    *   **Fifth Chord (V or v):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n        *   In a major key, the fifth chord is naturally a major chord (or a dominant 7th). For example, in G major, the fifth note is D, and the V chord is D major.\n        *   A **minor fifth chord (v)** is when this chord is made minor. In our G major example, this would be a D minor chord. This is an unusual chord in a major key, often \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key (in this case, G minor).\n    *   **The Progression (I → v):** We are looking for a song in a major key that starts with the major tonic chord and immediately moves to the minor fifth chord.\n\n3.  **Analyze Potential Beatles Songs:**\n    *   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Famous for its opening chord, but it's a complex, dissonant chord (often analyzed as a G11sus4 or Fadd9 played on multiple instruments), not a simple I → v progression.\n    *   **\"Help!\"**: The song is in A major, but it starts on a B minor chord (the ii chord), not the tonic.\n    *   **\"I Feel Fine\"**: The song is in G major. It starts with feedback and a guitar riff based on D7 → C → G chords, which is V7 → IV → I. This is not the progression we are looking for.\n    *   **\"Michelle\"**: This song is a prime candidate. Let's analyze its intro.\n        *   The song's verses are in F minor, but the instrumental introduction and chorus sections are centered around F major. Therefore, F can be considered the tonic center.\n        *   The first chord played clearly in the instrumental intro is **F major**. This is our **tonic (I)** chord.\n        *   The chord it immediately jumps to is **C minor**. In the key of F, the fifth note is C. A C minor chord is therefore the **minor fifth (v)** chord.\n        *   The progression is **F major → C minor**, which is exactly **I → v**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The song \"Michelle\" begins with an instrumental introduction where the defining chord progression is from F major (the tonic) to C minor (the minor fifth). This perfectly matches the criteria of the question.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Tonic Ambiguity:** The song \"Michelle\" famously shifts between the key of F minor (for the verses) and F major (for the chorus). The intro uses the F major chord as the tonic, setting up the F tonal center before the verse begins in F minor. This use of the parallel major tonic (I) followed by the minor dominant (v) is a key part of the song's sophisticated and melancholic sound.\n*   **\"Chord Jump\":** The transition is immediate and forms the basis of the opening guitar melody, making it a distinct \"jump.\"\n*   **Uniqueness:** This I → v progression is quite uncommon, especially to start a pop song, which is what makes the intro to \"Michelle\" so memorable and musically interesting.\n\nBased on this analysis, the song is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
