    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the given curve.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Curve and its Properties**\nThe given curve is defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve, which has the general form x(t) = A cos(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt). In this case, A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and δ=0 (by choosing sin(9t+π/2) for x, but the standard form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) is also well-studied).\n\n**Step 2: Understand Self-Intersection Points**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) that the curve passes through at two or more distinct times. That is, we are looking for the number of unique points (x, y) for which there exist at least two different time values, t1 and t2, within the primary period of the curve, such that:\nx(t1) = x(t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)\nt1 ≠ t2\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Period of the Curve**\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe curve completes a full cycle and starts to retrace itself after a time T, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π / 1 = 2π.\nSo, we need to find the number of self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 4: Use the Known Formula for Lissajous Curves**\nCalculating the self-intersections from first principles by solving the trigonometric equations is very complex, as it requires finding all pairs (t1, t2) and then identifying how many unique (x, y) points they correspond to. A more direct and reliable method is to use the established formula for the number of self-intersections of Lissajous curves.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Verify the conditions for the formula.**\nThe formula for the number of self-intersections of the curve x = cos(at), y = sin(bt) depends on the properties of 'a' and 'b'.\nThe formula we will use is N = (a-1)(b-1)/2. Let's check if its conditions are met.\n1.  **Integers:** The parameters 'a' and 'b' must be integers. Here, a=9 and b=5, which are integers.\n2.  **Coprime:** The parameters 'a' and 'b' must be coprime (their greatest common divisor must be 1).\n    GCD(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n3.  **Parity:** This specific formula is valid when both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers. Here, 9 and 5 are both odd.\n\nSince all the conditions are met, we can confidently apply the formula.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Formula to Calculate the Number of Self-Intersections**\nThe number of self-intersection points (N) is given by:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nSubstitute the values a = 9 and b = 5:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\n**Careful Point 2: Interpretation of the result.**\nThe formula correctly counts the number of distinct points in the xy-plane where the curve crosses itself. It does not count the number of times the curve passes through these points. The curve does not pass through the origin (0,0), because cos(9t) = 0 and sin(5t) = 0 cannot be satisfied for the same value of t.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step analysis, relying on the established mathematical formula for Lissajous curves, leads to the conclusion that there are 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
