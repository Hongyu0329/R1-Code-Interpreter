    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n*   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **For which company:** Enron.\n*   **When:** The year 2000.\n*   **What was the tagline:** \"Ask Why\".\n*   **Why is it notable:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which is due to Enron's spectacular collapse due to massive accounting fraud shortly after the campaign aired.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Advertising Campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major brand-building effort by Enron. The goal was to position the company as an innovative, forward-thinking entity that was fundamentally changing markets, rather than just a simple energy trading company. To achieve this, they used intellectuals and respected figures in their commercials.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the First Nobel Laureate**\n*   Research into the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials reveals that one of the featured experts was the economist and philosopher **Amartya Sen**.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify his Nobel status and the timing. Amartya Sen was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1998**. Since the commercial aired in 2000, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time of the filming.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Second Nobel Laureate**\n*   The same advertising campaign also featured another prominent economist, **Paul Krugman**.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must also verify his Nobel status and the timing. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**. This means that at the time the commercial aired in 2000, he was a well-respected economist but *not yet* a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" (a status they both now hold) *were featured* in the ad. Both individuals fit this description.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe two individuals who are now Nobel laureates and were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial are Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman. The campaign became infamous because its message of questioning and seeking truth stood in stark, ironic contrast to the massive corporate deception Enron was engaged in at the time.\n\n<<<Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman>>>"
