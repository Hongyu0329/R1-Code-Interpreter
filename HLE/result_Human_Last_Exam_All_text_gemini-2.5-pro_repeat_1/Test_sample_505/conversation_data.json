    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code\nThe surface code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Physical qubits are arranged on a 2D lattice. The number of logical qubits it can protect depends on the topology (shape) of this lattice, specifically its boundaries and holes.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Formula for Logical Qubits\nFor a single, connected patch of surface code (which is topologically a planar surface), the number of logical qubits ($k$) it can encode is determined by the number of holes ($N_h$) it contains. The formula is:\n$k = N_h$\n\n*   **Why is this the case?** Each hole introduces a new \"inner\" boundary to the code. A logical qubit can be formed by creating a pair of logical operators (like logical X and Z) that loop around these topological features in non-trivial ways. For a planar code, each hole allows for the creation of one such independent logical qubit.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the First Patch of Surface Code\nThe problem states we have a patch of surface code with two holes.\n\n*   Number of holes in the first patch, $N_{h1} = 2$.\n*   Using the formula from Step 2, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this first patch is $k_1 = N_{h1} = 2$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Second Patch of Surface Code\nThe problem states we have a second, separate patch of surface code, which is identical to the first one. It also has two holes.\n\n*   Number of holes in the second patch, $N_{h2} = 2$.\n*   The number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this second patch is $k_2 = N_{h2} = 2$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Logical Qubits\nThe question specifies **two patches** of surface code. This implies two physically separate, non-interacting systems. To find the total number of logical qubits in a composite system made of independent parts, we simply add the number of logical qubits from each part.\n\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n*   Total $k = k_1 + k_2$\n*   Total $k = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Separate Patches:** The key is that the two patches are distinct. If they were connected to form a single, larger surface, the topology would be different, and the calculation would change.\n*   **\"Holes\" in Planar Code:** In the context of a planar surface code, a \"hole\" is a puncture within the lattice. This is different from the \"genus\" of a surface like a torus (which has a hole going through it, like a donut). For a planar code patch, each puncture adds one logical qubit.\n*   **Boundaries:** A single patch has an outer boundary. Each hole adds an inner boundary. The number of logical qubits for a planar code with $b$ total boundaries is $k = b-1$. For a patch with 2 holes, we have 1 outer boundary + 2 inner boundaries, so $b=3$. The formula gives $k = 3 - 1 = 2$, which confirms our simpler $k=N_h$ rule.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nEach of the two patches with two holes can encode 2 logical qubits. Since there are two such patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n\n$2 \\text{ (from patch 1)} + 2 \\text{ (from patch 2)} = 4$\n\n<<<4>>>"
