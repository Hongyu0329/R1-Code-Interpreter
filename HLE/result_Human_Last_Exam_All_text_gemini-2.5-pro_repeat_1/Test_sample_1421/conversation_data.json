    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, listing all the careful points required to arrive at the final formula.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Definition of the Partition Function**\n\nThe starting point in quantum statistical mechanics is the canonical partition function, $Z$. It is defined as the trace of the statistical operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ over a complete basis of the Hilbert space:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}})$\nwhere:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature).\n*   $\\text{Tr}(\\cdot)$ denotes the trace operation.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing the Path Integral**\n\nFeynman's path integral formalism provides a way to calculate the partition function by integrating over all possible field configurations (or \"paths\") in imaginary time. The operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ can be interpreted as an evolution operator in imaginary time $\\tau = it$, where $\\tau$ goes from $0$ to $\\beta$.\n\nThe trace operation imposes a specific boundary condition on the paths in the imaginary time direction.\n\n**Step 3: The Crucial Point for Fermions - Grassmann Variables**\n\nFermions are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which arises from the anti-commutation relations of their creation ($\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger$) and annihilation ($\\hat{\\psi}$) operators. To construct a path integral for fermions, we cannot use ordinary commuting numbers (c-numbers). Instead, we must use **anti-commuting Grassmann numbers**.\n\n*   Let $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$ be two Grassmann numbers. Their defining property is the anti-commutation relation:\n    $\\{\\psi_i, \\psi_j\\} = \\psi_i \\psi_j + \\psi_j \\psi_i = 0$\n*   A direct consequence is that any Grassmann number squared is zero: $\\psi_i^2 = 0$.\n*   In the path integral, the fermionic field operators $\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x})$ are replaced by independent Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$, which are functions of position $\\mathbf{x}$ and imaginary time $\\tau$.\n\n**Step 4: The Euclidean Action**\n\nThe path integral is weighted by the factor $e^{-S}$, where $S$ is the Euclidean action of the system. The action is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}_E$, over imaginary time and space.\n\n$S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi, \\partial_\\tau \\psi)$\n\nThe Lagrangian density itself is constructed by replacing the operators in the Hamiltonian with their corresponding Grassmann fields. A generic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}(\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger, \\hat{\\psi})$ becomes a function $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ in the action. A crucial term, $\\bar{\\psi} \\partial_\\tau \\psi$, which is first-order in the time derivative, arises naturally from the formalism and acts as the kinetic term in imaginary time.\n\nThe full Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau))$\n\nwhere $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ corresponds to the normally ordered Hamiltonian of the system. For a typical system with a single-particle Hamiltonian $h$ (e.g., kinetic energy and chemical potential) and an interaction part $H_{int}$, this would be:\n$H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi) = \\bar{\\psi} h \\psi + H_{int}(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$\n\n**Step 5: The Crucial Point for Fermions - Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n\nThis is the most defining feature of the fermionic path integral. The trace operation, when performed over fermionic states (the Fock space), enforces **anti-periodic boundary conditions (APBC)** on the Grassmann fields in the imaginary time direction.\n\n*   $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = 0)$\n*   $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = \\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau = 0)$\n\nThis is fundamentally different from the path integral for bosons, which requires periodic boundary conditions. The APBC directly encode the Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\n**Step 6: Assembling the Final Formula**\n\nCombining all the elements, the partition function $Z$ for a fermionic system in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by a functional integral over all anti-periodic Grassmann field configurations, weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is:\n\n$Z = \\int_{\\text{APBC}} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nwhere:\n\n*   $\\int_{\\text{APBC}} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi$ is the functional integral over all configurations of the independent Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$.\n*   The subscript **APBC** (Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions) signifies that the integral is restricted to fields that satisfy $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, 0)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, 0)$.\n*   $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is the Euclidean action, given by:\n    $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)) \\right]$\n    *   $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, integrated from $0$ to $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}$ are the spatial coordinates in $d$ dimensions.\n    *   $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ is the function corresponding to the system's Hamiltonian, obtained by replacing the fermionic creation/annihilation operators with the Grassmann fields $\\bar{\\psi}$ and $\\psi$.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function $Z$ is given by the functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nThe integral is performed over all field configurations that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\\tau$: $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=\\beta) = -\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau=0)$.\nThe Euclidean action $S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]$ is given by:\n$S[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) + H(\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)) \\right]$\nwhere $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ and $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ is the classical Hamiltonian function corresponding to the quantum operator $\\hat{H}$.>>>"
