Charles needs to first adjust his diet. The current plan of limiting animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates simultaneously is overly restrictive and unsustainable. This approach would lead to severe fatigue, hunger, and a lack of energy, which explains why he is "struggling to keep up." He should modify his diet to be more balanced, ensuring he gets adequate protein for satiety and muscle maintenance, and sufficient carbohydrates and fats for energy to support his daily activities, travel, and new exercise regimen.
