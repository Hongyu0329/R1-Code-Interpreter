    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Group and the Question\n\n*   **The Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. In general, the generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$. So the presentation for our group is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Key Properties of Q_128:**\n    *   The order of the group is 128.\n    *   Every element can be uniquely written as $x^i$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n    *   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. This is a normal subgroup of index 2.\n    *   The order of $y$ is 4, since $y^2 = x^{32}$ and $(y^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    *   The center of the group is $Z(Q_{128}) = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle = \\{1, x^{32}\\}$, which is the unique subgroup of order 2.\n\n*   **The Question:** The question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\". A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a power subgroup if it is generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**.\n    So, our goal is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step 2: Strategy for Counting Cyclic Subgroups\n\nTo find all cyclic subgroups, we can find the subgroup generated by each element of $Q_{128}$ and then count the number of distinct subgroups. We can simplify this by partitioning the elements of $Q_{128}$ into two disjoint sets:\n1.  The elements within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n2.  The elements outside the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, which are of the form $x^k y$.\n\nWe will count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements in each set and then sum the results, after ensuring there is no overlap between the two sets of subgroups.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Cyclic Subgroups in $\\langle x \\rangle$\n\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\n*   The order of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is $m = 64 = 2^6$. The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $6+1=7$.\n*   Therefore, there are **7** distinct subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Since all subgroups of a cyclic group are cyclic, these are 7 distinct cyclic subgroups. They are:\n    *   $\\langle x^0 \\rangle = \\langle 1 \\rangle$ (order 1)\n    *   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n    *   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n    *   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8)\n    *   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16)\n    *   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n    *   $\\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64)\n\n### Step 4: Counting Cyclic Subgroups Generated by Elements of the form $x^k y$\n\n*   Now consider the elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are the 64 elements of the form $g_k = x^k y$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n*   First, let's find the order of these elements.\n    $(g_k)^2 = (x^k y)^2 = x^k y x^k y = x^k (y x^k) y$.\n    Using the relation $y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}$, we get $xy = yx^{-1}$, and by induction $x^k y = y x^{-k}$.\n    So, $(g_k)^2 = x^k (y x^k) y = x^k (x^{-k} y) y = (x^k x^{-k}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The order of $x^{32}$ is 2. Since $(g_k)^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$ and $(g_k)^4 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$, the order of every element $g_k = x^k y$ is 4.\n*   Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. Now we must count how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n*   Let's find when two such subgroups, $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ and $\\langle x^j y \\rangle$, are identical. This happens if and only if they are generated by the same set of elements. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators. The generators of $\\langle g_k \\rangle = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $g_k$ and $(g_k)^3$.\n    $(g_k)^3 = g_k \\cdot (g_k)^2 = (x^k y) x^{32}$. Since $x^{32}$ is in the center of $Q_{128}$, it commutes with all elements.\n    $(g_k)^3 = x^k x^{32} y = x^{k+32} y$.\n*   So, the two generators of the subgroup $\\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$. This means that $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$.\n*   The 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ are thus partitioned into pairs, where each pair generates the same cyclic subgroup. For example, $\\langle y \\rangle = \\langle x^{32} y \\rangle$, $\\langle xy \\rangle = \\langle x^{33} y \\rangle$, etc.\n*   The number of distinct subgroups is the number of such pairs, which is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\n*   We found 7 cyclic subgroups that are subsets of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   We found 32 cyclic subgroups that are generated by elements of the form $x^k y$.\n*   Are these two sets of subgroups disjoint? Yes. The first set contains subgroups where every element is a power of $x$. The second set contains subgroups which, by definition, have generators of the form $x^k y$ and therefore contain elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$. Thus, no subgroup from the second set can be equal to a subgroup from the first set.\n*   The total number of cyclic subgroups (power subgroups) is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint sets.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = (Subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (Subgroups not within $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
