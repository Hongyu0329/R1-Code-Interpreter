    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Setup**\n\nWe are given a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the matrices:\n*   State matrix `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at the desired locations `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: The Closed-Loop System Form**\nThe problem specifies the closed-loop system as `A + BF`. This is a crucial detail. In many contexts, the control law is defined as `u = -Kx`, leading to a closed-loop system `A - BK`. Here, the form `A + BF` implies a control law `u = Fx`. We must use the specified form `A + BF`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair: `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial of a matrix is a polynomial whose roots are the eigenvalues of the matrix. For a 2x2 system, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` can be found as:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a² - b²`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j²`\nSince `j² = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\nSo, we need the characteristic polynomial of `A + BF` to be `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\n\nLet the unknown state feedback gain matrix be `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`.\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`\n`BF = [[1*f₁ + 2*f₃, 1*f₂ + 2*f₄], [1*f₁ + 0*f₃, 1*f₂ + 0*f₄]]`\n`BF = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n\nNow, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**4. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `p_cl(λ)` of `A_cl` is given by `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`. For a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ² - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\n`trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n`det(A_cl) = -f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `p_cl(λ)` is:\n`p_cl(λ) = λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n`p_cl(λ) = λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`\n\n**5. Match Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe equate the coefficients of `p_cl(λ)` with `p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing the `λ` terms:\n    `1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ = 2  =>  -f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ = 1  =>  f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing the constant terms:\n    `-f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2  =>  -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point 2: Non-Unique Solution**\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). This indicates that there is no unique solution for the matrix `F`. This is typical for multi-input systems. The existence of a solution is guaranteed if the system is controllable. The controllability matrix `C = [B, AB]` has rank 2, so the system is controllable, and we can find a suitable `F`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Finding a Particular Solution**\nSince the solution is not unique, we have the freedom to simplify the problem by making arbitrary choices for some of the variables. A common strategy is to set some elements of `F` to zero. Let's assume `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n\nWith `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`, our equations become:\n*   `f₁ + f₂ + 2(0) = -1  =>  f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n*   `-f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂(0) - 2(0) - 2f₁(0) = 3  =>  -f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2.  `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2  =>  f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1  =>  f₁ = 1`\n\nSo, one possible solution is `f₁ = 1, f₂ = -2, f₃ = 0, f₄ = 0`.\n\nThis gives the state feedback gain matrix:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**6. Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check if this `F` produces the desired eigenvalues.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1+1, 1-2], [1+1, 0-2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = 0`\n`λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = 0`\n`λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis matches our desired characteristic polynomial. Using the quadratic formula, the roots are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j`. The solution is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
