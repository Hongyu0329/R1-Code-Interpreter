    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides three distinct clues, all attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Author Description:** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n    *   **Quote about the Novel (Part 1):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger.\"\n    *   **Quote about the Novel (Part 2):** It has \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Author Description:** The comparison to William Faulkner is a major pointer. Faulkner is known for his complex narratives, stream-of-consciousness style, and the creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional world (Yoknapatawpha County). A \"continuator\" would be a writer who works in a similar vein. The addition of \"simplifier\" suggests this writer might distill Faulkner's sprawling style into something more focused, perhaps more bleak or existentially condensed. This description is famously applied by Borges and other critics to the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**, who created the mythical city of Santa Mar√≠a as the setting for many of his works.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Quotes about the Novel:**\n    *   **\"The intensity of a tiger\"**: This metaphor suggests a work of literature that is powerful, visceral, primal, and possibly dangerous in its emotional or psychological impact.\n    *   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This suggests a work that is intellectually complex, highly structured, and filled with intricate moves and counter-moves, much like a game of chess. The narrative is likely not straightforward but rather a carefully constructed puzzle with multiple layers and possibilities.\n\n4.  **Connect the Clues:** We need to find a specific instance where Borges connects Juan Carlos Onetti with these precise descriptions of one of his novels. Borges wrote a review of Onetti's 1950 novel, **La vida breve** (A Brief Life), which was published in the literary magazine *Sur* in 1951.\n\n5.  **Verify the Source:** In this review, Borges praises the novel's ambition and complexity. He compares Onetti's work to Faulkner's and then applies the specific metaphors to *La vida breve*. He sees the novel as a masterwork that combines raw, existential power (the tiger's intensity) with a sophisticated, multi-layered narrative structure where the protagonist creates alternate realities and plots (the variety of a chess duel).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All the pieces of the puzzle fit together. The author described as a \"continuator...of Faulkner\" is Juan Carlos Onetti. The novel praised by Borges for its tiger-like intensity and chess-like variety is *La vida breve*.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe novel is **La vida breve** (1950) by the Uruguayan author **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n<<<La vida breve>>>"
