    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the periodicity of the tangent function**\nThe tangent function, `tan(x)`, is periodic with a period of `π`. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x + kπ)` for any integer `k`. To find the value of `tan(10^100)`, we can find the value of `10^100` modulo `π`. This simplifies the problem from dealing with a very large number to dealing with a number in the range `[0, π)`.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the remainder of 10^100 divided by π**\nWe need to compute `r = 10^100 mod π`. This remainder `r` is the value such that `10^100 = kπ + r`, where `k` is a very large integer and `0 ≤ r < π`.\nTo find `r`, we can use the following relationship:\n`r = π * {10^100 / π}`\nwhere `{x}` denotes the fractional part of `x`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the fractional part of 10^100 / π**\nTo find the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, we need to know the decimal expansion of `1/π`.\n`10^100 / π` is the number `1/π` with its decimal point shifted 100 places to the right.\nLet the decimal expansion of `1/π` be `0.d_1 d_2 d_3 ...`.\nThen `10^100 / π` will be `d_1 d_2 ... d_100 . d_{101} d_{102} d_{103} ...`.\nThe integer part of this number is `k = d_1 d_2 ... d_100`.\nThe fractional part is `f = {10^100 / π} = 0.d_{101} d_{102} d_{103} ...`.\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the digits of `1/π` starting from the 101st decimal place.\n\n**Step 4: Find the high-precision value of 1/π**\nWe need to consult a reliable source for the digits of `1/π`. Using a computational mathematics tool or a database of constants, we find the digits of `1/π`.\nThe decimal expansion of `1/π` begins:\n`1/π = 0.3183098861837906715377675267450287240689192914809128514513540901379538379864299493381944194433606543...`\nThe 100th digit after the decimal point is the last `3`. The digits starting from the 101st place are:\n`d_{101} d_{102} d_{103} ... = 539419...`\nTherefore, the fractional part we need is:\n`f = {10^100 / π} ≈ 0.53941913`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the argument of the tangent function**\nNow we calculate the remainder `r` using the formula from Step 2:\n`r = π * f`\nUsing a precise value for `π ≈ 3.14159265`:\n`r ≈ 3.14159265 * 0.53941913 ≈ 1.69463532` radians.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final tangent value**\nFinally, we compute `tan(r) = tan(1.69463532)`.\nIt's important to use a calculator in **radian mode**.\nWe can note that `π/2 ≈ 1.5708`. Since our value `r ≈ 1.6946` is greater than `π/2` but less than `π`, it lies in the second quadrant, so its tangent will be negative.\n`tan(1.69463532) ≈ -8.034149...`\n\n**Step 7: Identify the first 3 digits after the comma**\nThe calculated value is approximately `-8.034149`. The part of the number after the decimal point (the \"comma\") is `034149...`.\nThe first three digits after the comma are `0`, `3`, and `4`."
