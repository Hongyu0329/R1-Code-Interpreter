    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and key figures.**\nThe question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407–1427). The key figure is the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟). His opponent was the Vietnamese rebel leader Lê Lợi, who led the Lam Sơn Uprising and later became the founder of the Later Lê dynasty.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the meaning of \"first major defeat\".**\nThis refers not just to a minor skirmish but to a significant military engagement or campaign where Mu Sheng's forces were decisively beaten, resulting in a strategic setback for the Ming army. Mu Sheng's final and most catastrophic defeat occurred in 1427, so we must look for an earlier event.\n\n**Step 3: Trace Mu Sheng's campaigns against Lê Lợi.**\nThe Lam Sơn Uprising began in 1418 in the mountains of Thanh Hóa. For the first few years, the rebels were on the defensive. A crucial turning point came in 1424 when Lê Lợi, following the advice of his general Nguyễn Chích, decided to shift the main theater of operations from the mountains of Thanh Hóa southward into the large, populous, and less-defended province of Nghệ An.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific campaign and battle.**\nLê Lợi's push into Nghệ An was highly successful. In response, the Ming court ordered General Mu Sheng to lead a large army to crush the rebellion. In late 1424, a major battle took place, known as the Battle of Khả Lưu (or Bồ Ải). The Vietnamese forces, commanded by Lê Lợi's generals, set up an ambush and inflicted a heavy defeat on the Ming army.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the significance of this battle for Mu Sheng.**\nWhile Mu Sheng may not have been personally present at the ambush site, he was the supreme commander of the entire Ming campaign to retake Nghệ An. The defeat of his army at Khả Lưu, coupled with his subsequent inability to dislodge Lê Lợi from the region, constituted the complete failure of his mission. This was the first time a top Ming general had been strategically defeated and had lost control of an entire province to the Lam Sơn rebels. It was, therefore, Mu Sheng's first major defeat of the war.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the modern geographical location of the battle.**\nHistorical records place the site of the Battle of Khả Lưu - Bồ Ải in the western part of Nghệ An. Specifically, these locations are in the modern-day district of Anh Sơn.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the final answer.**\nThe Anh Sơn District is a part of a larger administrative unit. The current Vietnamese province that contains the district of Anh Sơn is **Nghệ An Province**.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
