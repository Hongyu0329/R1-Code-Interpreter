    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it occurs in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). This typically happens when a suffix is added to a base word.\n\nThe common tense-lax pairs involved are:\n*   /iː/ (as in *ser**e**ne*) → /ɛ/ (as in *ser**e**nity*)\n*   /eɪ/ (as in *s**a**ne*) → /æ/ (as in *s**a**nity*)\n*   /aɪ/ (as in *div**i**ne*) → /ɪ/ (as in *div**i**nity*)\n*   /oʊ/ (as in *prof**ou**nd*) → /ʌ/ (as in *prof**u**ndity*)\n\nTo check if a word has undergone TSL, we need to verify two conditions:\n1.  A tense vowel in a base form has become lax in the derived form.\n2.  This lax vowel is in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of the derived word.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern:**\n    *   **Base word:** `south` (phonetically /saʊθ/). The diphthong /aʊ/ developed from a tense (long) vowel in Middle English.\n    *   **Derived word:** `southern` (phonetically /ˈsʌðərn/). The vowel has laxed to /ʌ/.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has two syllables: `south-ern`. The laxed vowel is in the penultimate (second-from-last) syllable, not the antepenultimate.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It has undergone vowel laxing, but because the condition of being in the third-to-last syllable is not met, it is **not** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative:**\n    *   **Base word:** `derive` (phonetically /dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel is the tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `derivative` (phonetically /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). The vowel has laxed to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has four syllables: `de-riv-a-tive`. The laxed vowel /ɪ/ is in the `-riv-` syllable, which is the third from the end.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a classic example of a word that **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity:**\n    *   **Base word:** `serene` (phonetically /səˈriːn/). The vowel is the tense /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `serenity` (phonetically /səˈrɛnɪti/). The vowel has laxed to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has four syllables: `se-ren-i-ty`. The laxed vowel /ɛ/ is in the `-ren-` syllable, which is the third from the end.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is another classic example of a word that **has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant:**\n    *   **Base word:** `please` (phonetically /pliːz/). The vowel is the tense /iː/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `pleasant` (phonetically /ˈplɛzənt/). The vowel has laxed to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has two syllables: `pleas-ant`. The laxed vowel is in the penultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Like `southern`, it shows laxing but **not** trisyllabic laxing due to incorrect syllable position.\n\n*   **gratitude:**\n    *   **Base word:** There is no simple English base word like `*grate` from which `gratitude` is derived.\n    *   **Derived word:** `gratitude` (phonetically /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). The first vowel is /æ/, which is a lax vowel.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has three syllables: `grat-i-tude`. The lax vowel /æ/ is in the antepenultimate syllable. So, structurally, it *fits the pattern* of TSL (compare `sane`/`sanity`).\n    *   **Careful Point (Etymology):** This word was borrowed into English from Old French `gratitude`, which came from Latin `gratitudo`. The vowel was already short/lax when the word entered the English language. Therefore, it did not *undergo* the change from tense to lax *within English*. It was borrowed in its current form.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While it conforms to the TSL pattern, it **has not undergone** the historical process in English.\n\n*   **shadow:**\n    *   **Base word:** `shade` (phonetically /ʃeɪd/). The vowel is the tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Derived word:** `shadow` (phonetically /ˈʃædoʊ/). The vowel has laxed to /æ/.\n    *   **Syllable position:** The word has two syllables: `shad-ow`. The laxed vowel is in the penultimate syllable.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It shows laxing but **not** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**3. Final Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe have four words that have not undergone TSL: `southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`, and `gratitude`.\n*   `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` failed because they do not meet the \"trisyllabic\" (i.e., antepenultimate syllable) condition. The laxing is due to other historical sound laws.\n*   `gratitude` is a unique case. It meets the structural condition (a lax vowel in the antepenultimate syllable) but fails because it did not actually *undergo* the process in English; it was borrowed with the lax vowel already present.\n\nIn linguistic problems of this nature, the word that fits the structural pattern but has a different history is often the intended answer. It's a \"false positive\" that requires deeper etymological knowledge to disqualify. The others are more straightforwardly disqualified based on syllable structure alone. Therefore, `gratitude` is the best answer for a word that has \"not undergone\" the process.\n\n<<<gratitude>>>"
