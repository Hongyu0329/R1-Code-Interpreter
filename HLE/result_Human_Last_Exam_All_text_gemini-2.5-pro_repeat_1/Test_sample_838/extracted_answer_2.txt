The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. This molecule is achiral. The chirality of the starting material is lost in the first step (E2 elimination), which creates an achiral alkene. Subsequent reactions are performed on achiral intermediates and do not generate any new stereocenters, resulting in an achiral final product.
