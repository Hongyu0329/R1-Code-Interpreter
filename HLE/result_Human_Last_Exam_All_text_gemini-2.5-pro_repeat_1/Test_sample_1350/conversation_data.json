    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific character in William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three criteria:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They must describe Roman religious practices.\n3.  This description must contain a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Allusion**\nThe core of the question is the allusion to \"Romulus and Remus.\" The most famous part of their myth is being abandoned as infants and then discovered and suckled by a she-wolf. Therefore, the character's description should mention an image or story involving a she-wolf nursing two human children. This is a direct reference to the Capitoline Wolf, a famous Roman symbol.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Characters and their Backstories**\n*   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader of the Wolfings. He is the protagonist and has experience fighting the Romans, but the narrative doesn't focus on him having lived within a Roman city.\n*   **Hall-Sun:** Thiodolf's wife, a supernatural being (a Vala or daughter of a god). Her knowledge is mystical and not derived from travel to a Roman city.\n*   **Wood-Sun:** Thiodolf's daughter. She is young and has not traveled to Roman lands.\n*   **Otter:** A thrall (a servant or bondsman) of the Wolfings. His backstory is crucial: he was once a captive of the Romans and lived among them before escaping and returning to his people. This makes him the most likely candidate to have firsthand knowledge of Roman cities and customs.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Specific Scene in the Novel**\nGiven Otter's backstory, we should look for a scene where he shares his experiences. In Chapter 6, titled \"Otter tells of the Romans,\" he does exactly this. He is asked to describe the enemy to the assembled chieftains of the Goths.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Character's Description**\nIn Chapter 6, Otter recounts what he saw in the Roman cities during his captivity. He says the following about their gods and symbols:\n\n\"...I have been in their cities, and I have seen the images of their Gods; and they have a she-wolf for a God, and a she-wolf that they worship, and her giving suck to two men-children; and this is a token of their lives and their friendships; for they are wolf-full of masterful guile, and wolf-greedy, and wolf-lonely...\"\n\n**Step 6: Confirm the Match**\n*   **Character:** The speaker is Otter.\n*   **Visited a Roman city:** He explicitly states, \"I have been in their cities.\"\n*   **Describes religious practices:** He talks about \"the images of their Gods\" and what \"they worship.\"\n*   **Refers to Romulus and Remus:** His description of \"a she-wolf... giving suck to two men-children\" is an unmistakable reference to the founding myth of Rome.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who fits all the criteria laid out in the question is Otter, the former Roman captive.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
