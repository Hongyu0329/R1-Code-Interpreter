    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s), we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves forming a composite matrix by stacking P1(s) and P2(s) and then reducing it using elementary row operations.\n\n**Step 1: Define the matrices and form the composite matrix.**\n\nLet the given polynomial matrices be:\nP1(s) = [s^2 + s, -s;\n         -s^2 - 1, s^2]\n\nP2(s) = [s,   0;\n         -s - 1, 1]\n\nWe form the composite matrix M(s) by stacking P1(s) on top of P2(s):\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[s^2 + s,  -s]     (Row 1)\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]    (Row 2)\n[s,        0]      (Row 3)\n[-s - 1,   1]      (Row 4)\n\nA GCRD, let's call it G(s), can be found by applying elementary row operations to M(s) to transform it into the form [G(s); 0], where 0 is a zero matrix. The matrix G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce the matrix.**\n\nThe goal is to simplify the matrix M(s) by introducing zeros. A good strategy is to combine rows to create simpler rows (e.g., with constant elements or lower-degree polynomials).\n\n1.  Observe the last two rows, R3 and R4. Their sum is a very simple row with constant entries.\n    Let's perform the operation R4' = R3 + R4:\n    R4' = [s, 0] + [-s - 1, 1] = [-1, 1]\n\n    Now, we can replace R4 with R4' in our set of rows to simplify, since the row space remains the same. Our matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n    [s^2 + s,  -s]\n    [-s^2 - 1, s^2]\n    [s,        0]\n    [-1,       1]\n\n2.  Now, use the new simple row R4' = [-1, 1] to eliminate polynomial entries in the other rows.\n    -   Replace R1 with R1 + s*R4':\n        [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s, -s + s] = [s^2, 0]\n    -   Replace R2 with R2 + s^2*R4':\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s^2*[-1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 - s^2, s^2 + s^2] = [-2s^2 - 1, 2s^2]. This is getting complicated.\n    \n    Let's try a different simplification using R4' = [-1, 1].\n    -   Replace R1 with R1 + (s) * (column 2 of R4') added to column 1. This isn't an elementary op.\n    - Let's stick to full row operations. Use R4' = [-1, 1] to simplify R3 = [s, 0].\n        Replace R3 with R3 + s*R4':\n        [s, 0] + s*[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]\n    - Now use R4' to simplify R2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2].\n        Replace R2 with R2 - (s^2)*R4':\n        [-s^2-1, s^2] - s^2*[-1, 1] = [-s^2-1+s^2, s^2-s^2] = [-1, 0]\n    - The original R1 was [s^2+s, -s]. Replace R1 with R1 + (s^2+s)*R4':\n        [s^2+s, -s] + (s^2+s)*[-1, 1] = [s^2+s-s^2-s, -s+s^2+s] = [0, s^2]\n    \n    After these operations, the new set of rows that span the same space are:\n    [0, s^2], [-1, 0], [0, s], and [-1, 1].\n\n3.  Let's reduce this set of four row vectors.\n    - We have `[-1, 0]`. Let's use it to simplify `[-1, 1]`.\n      `[-1, 1] - 1 * [-1, 0] = [0, 1]`\n    - Our set of vectors is now { [0, s^2], [-1, 0], [0, s], [0, 1] }.\n\n4.  Now we have `[0, 1]`. Let's use it to simplify the other vectors.\n    -   `[0, s^2] - s^2 * [0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n    -   `[0, s] - s * [0, 1] = [0, 0]`\n    - The vectors `[0, s^2]` and `[0, s]` are eliminated.\n\n5.  The final set of non-zero row vectors that forms a basis for the row space of M(s) is {[-1, 0], [0, 1]}.\n\n6.  We can form the GCRD matrix G(s) from these basis vectors.\n    G(s) = [-1, 0;\n             0, 1]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the result.**\n\nThe matrix G(s) we found is a GCRD. Let's check its determinant:\ndet(G(s)) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1.\n\nSince the determinant of G(s) is a non-zero constant, G(s) is a **unimodular** matrix. When the GCRD of two matrices is unimodular, the matrices are said to be **right coprime**.\n\nThe GCRD is not unique. If G(s) is a GCRD, then any matrix U(s)G(s) is also a GCRD, provided U(s) is unimodular. It is standard practice to represent a unimodular GCRD by the identity matrix, I.\n\nWe can obtain the identity matrix from our G(s) by left-multiplying by another unimodular matrix. Let U(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1]. `det(U) = -1`, so U is unimodular.\nU(s) * G(s) = [-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I.\n\nTherefore, the identity matrix I is also a GCRD, and it is the most common and simplest representation."
