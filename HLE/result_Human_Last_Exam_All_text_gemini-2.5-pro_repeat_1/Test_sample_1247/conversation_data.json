    "Answering this question requires analyzing permutations with a specific number of inversions and checking if they avoid a certain pattern.\n\nLet \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) be the number of permutations of length \\(n\\) that avoid the pattern \\(\\sigma\\) and have exactly \\(k\\) inversions. We are asked to find \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\).\n\nThis means we need to find the number of permutations \\(\\pi\\) of \\(\\{1, 2, ..., 333\\}\\) such that:\n1.  \\(\\pi\\) has exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions. An inversion is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\).\n2.  \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324. This means there are no indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\nFor a large length like \\(n=333\\), a permutation with only 3 inversions must be a \"small\" modification of the identity permutation \\((1, 2, ..., n)\\). Most elements will be in their natural sorted position. The elements that are not in their sorted position, i.e., \\(\\pi(i) \\neq i\\), must be close to their original positions and form a \"core\" pattern.\n\nThe number of permutations with \\(k\\) inversions is independent of \\(n\\) for \\(n \\ge 2k\\). For \\(k=3\\), this is true for \\(n \\ge 6\\). The number of permutations in \\(S_n\\) with 3 inversions for \\(n \\ge 4\\) is 8. These permutations are formed by applying a specific local rearrangement to a block of consecutive integers, leaving the others fixed.\n\nLet's list the fundamental \"core\" permutations (\\(\\sigma\\)) with 3 inversions. These are permutations of a small set \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\).\n1.  \\(\\sigma = 321\\) (from \\(S_3\\)). Inversions: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). Total 3.\n2.  \\(\\sigma = 4123\\) (from \\(S_4\\)). Inversions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Total 3.\n3.  \\(\\sigma = 1432\\) (from \\(S_4\\)). Inversions: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2). Total 3.\n4.  \\(\\sigma = 2341\\) (from \\(S_4\\)). Inversions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). Total 3.\n5.  \\(\\sigma = 2413\\) (from \\(S_4\\)). Inversions: (2,1), (4,1), (4,3). Total 3.\n6.  \\(\\sigma = 3142\\) (from \\(S_4\\)). Inversions: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2). Total 3.\n7.  \\(\\sigma = 21534\\) (from \\(S_5\\)). Inversions: (2,1), (5,3), (5,4). Total 3.\n8.  \\(\\sigma = 214365\\) (from \\(S_6\\)). Inversions: (2,1), (4,3), (6,5). Total 3.\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) of length 333 with 3 inversions will be of the form \\(id_{i-1} \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_{333-m-i+1}\\), which means it's the identity permutation except for a block of \\(m\\) elements starting at position \\(i\\), which are permuted according to \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nNow, we must check which of these permutations avoid the 1324 pattern.\nA key insight is how the 1324 pattern can be formed in such a permutation \\(\\pi = id_k \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_l\\). A 1324 pattern can be formed by elements all within the \\(\\sigma\\) block, or by elements from the identity parts and the \\(\\sigma\\) part.\n\nLet's analyze the condition for such a permutation to be 1324-avoiding.\n- If \\(\\sigma\\) itself contains a 1324 pattern, \\(\\pi\\) will too.\n- If \\(\\sigma\\) contains a 132 pattern (\\(a<b<c\\), \\(\\sigma(a)<\\sigma(c)<\\sigma(b)\\)), we can form a 1324 pattern in \\(\\pi=\\sigma \\oplus id_l\\) by picking the element \\(d=m+1\\). Its value \\(\\pi(d)=m+1\\) will be larger than any value in \\(\\sigma\\), so \\(\\pi(a)<\\pi(c)<\\pi(b)<\\pi(d)\\) is a 1324 pattern.\n- If \\(\\sigma\\) contains a 213 pattern (\\(a<b<c\\), \\(\\sigma(b)<\\sigma(a)<\\sigma(c)\\)), we can form a 1324 pattern in \\(\\pi=id_k \\oplus \\sigma\\) by picking an element \\(d=1\\) from the identity part. We can find indices \\(i_2, i_3, i_4\\) from the \\(\\sigma\\) block and \\(i_1=d=1\\) from the identity part. We have \\(\\pi(i_1) < \\pi(i_3) < \\pi(i_2) < \\pi(i_4)\\).\n\nSo, a permutation of the form \\(id_k \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_l\\) (with \\(k,l>0\\)) can avoid 1324 only if \\(\\sigma\\) avoids both 132 and 213. If \\(k=0\\), \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus id_l\\), it avoids 1324 if \\(\\sigma\\) avoids 132. If \\(l=0\\), \\(\\pi = id_k \\oplus \\sigma\\), it avoids 1324 if \\(\\sigma\\) avoids 213.\n\nLet's check our 8 core patterns:\n1.  \\(\\sigma=321\\): Avoids 132. Avoids 213.\n    - Can be placed anywhere. However, if placed in the middle, e.g., \\((1, 4, 3, 2, 5)\\), a 1324 pattern emerges: indices (1,2,3,5) give values (1,4,3,5), and \\(1<3<4<5\\). So only boundary placements are allowed.\n    - At the start: \\((3,2,1,4,...,333)\\). This is 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n    - At the end: \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\). This is 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n2.  \\(\\sigma=4123\\): Avoids 132. Avoids 213.\n    - Similar to 321, only boundary placements work.\n    - At the start: \\((4,1,2,3,5,...)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n    - At the end: \\((1,...,329,333,330,331,332)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n3.  \\(\\sigma=1432\\): Contains 132 (1,4,3). Avoids 213.\n    - Cannot be at the start. Cannot be in the middle.\n    - At the end: \\((1,...,329,330,333,332,331)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n4.  \\(\\sigma=2341\\): Avoids 132. Avoids 213.\n    - Only boundary placements work.\n    - At the start: \\((2,3,4,1,5,...)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n    - At the end: \\((1,...,329,331,332,333,330)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n5.  \\(\\sigma=2413\\): Contains 132 (2,4,3). Contains 213 (2,4,1).\n    - No placement works. (0 permutations)\n6.  \\(\\sigma=3142\\): Contains 132 (1,4,2). Avoids 213.\n    - Cannot be at the start or middle.\n    - At the end: \\((1,...,329,332,330,333,331)\\). 1324-avoiding. (1 permutation)\n7.  \\(\\sigma=21534\\): Contains 132. Contains 213.\n    - No placement works. (0 permutations)\n8.  \\(\\sigma=214365\\): Contains 132. Contains 213.\n    - No placement works. (0 permutations)\n\nSumming up the allowed permutations:\n- From \\(\\sigma=321\\): 2 permutations.\n- From \\(\\sigma=4123\\): 2 permutations.\n- From \\(\\sigma=1432\\): 1 permutation.\n- From \\(\\sigma=2341\\): 2 permutations.\n- From \\(\\sigma=2413\\): 0 permutations.\n- From \\(\\sigma=3142\\): 1 permutation.\n- From \\(\\sigma=21534\\): 0 permutations.\n- From \\(\\sigma=214365\\): 0 permutations.\n\nThe total number of such permutations is \\(2+2+1+2+1 = 8\\). These 8 permutations are distinct for \\(n=333\\).\n\nFinal list of permutations:\n1.  \\((3,2,1,4,5,...,333)\\)\n2.  \\((1,2,...,330,333,332,331)\\)\n3.  \\((4,1,2,3,5,...,333)\\)\n4.  \\((1,2,...,329,333,330,331,332)\\)\n5.  \\((1,2,...,329,330,333,332,331)\\)\n6.  \\((2,3,4,1,5,...,333)\\)\n7.  \\((1,2,...,329,331,332,333,330)\\)\n8.  \\((1,2,...,329,332,330,333,331)\\)\n\nTotal number of permutations is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
