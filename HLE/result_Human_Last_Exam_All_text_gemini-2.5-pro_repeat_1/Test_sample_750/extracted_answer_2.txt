The solutions for $z \in \mathbb{C}$ are:
1. The real numbers $z=1$ and $z=-1$.
2. An infinite sequence of purely imaginary numbers $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $y = -e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}$. These solutions can be written as $z_k = i\left(-\frac{W_0(-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi))}{-(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}\right)$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
3. For each integer $k$, a set of non-axial complex numbers $z=x+iy$ that are solutions to the system of equations:
   $x = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}\sin\left(x(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)\right)$
   $y = -e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)}\cos\left(x(\frac{\pi}{2}+2k\pi)\right)$
