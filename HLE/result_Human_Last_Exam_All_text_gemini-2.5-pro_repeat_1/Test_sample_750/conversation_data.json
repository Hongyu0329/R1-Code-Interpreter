    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Rewrite the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation**\n\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nLet $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is defined as $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. The complex logarithm $\\log a$ is a multi-valued function, given by $\\log a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor our equation, $a=i$. We have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define the constant $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = iA_k$.\n\nNow, we can write the RHS as:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log(i)} = e^{(x+iy)(iA_k)} = e^{ixA_k + i^2yA_k} = e^{-yA_k + ixA_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, this becomes:\n$i^z = e^{-yA_k} (\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + ix$.\n\nSo the original equation becomes:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yA_k} (\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\n**Step 2: Form a system of real equations**\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation above, we get a system of two equations for the real variables $x$ and $y$:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(xA_k)$\n2.  $x = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(xA_k)$\n\nWe need to find all pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy this system for any integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the system for specific cases**\n\n**Case I: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system simplifies to:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xA_k) \\implies \\cos(xA_k) = 0$\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xA_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xA_k)$\n\nFrom $\\cos(xA_k)=0$, it must be that $\\sin(xA_k) = \\pm 1$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $x = \\pm 1$.\nLet's check these values:\n*   If $z=1$ (so $x=1, y=0$):\n    Equation 1: $\\cos(A_k) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 0$. This is true for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Equation 2: $1 = \\sin(A_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 1$. This is also true for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $z=-1$ (so $x=-1, y=0$):\n    Equation 1: $\\cos(-A_k) = \\cos(A_k) = 0$. This is true for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Equation 2: $-1 = \\sin(-A_k) = -\\sin(A_k) = -1$. This is also true for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case II: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system simplifies to:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yA_k}$\n2.  $0 = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This equation is always satisfied.\n\nSo we only need to find the real roots $y$ of the equation $-y = e^{-yA_k}$ for each integer $k$.\nLet's analyze the function $f(y) = y + e^{-yA_k}$. We are looking for the roots of $f(y)=0$.\n*   **Subcase IIa: $k \\ge 0$.**\n    In this case, $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{2}, \\dots$ are all positive. Let $c=A_k>0$.\n    We analyze $f(y) = y+e^{-cy}$. The derivative is $f'(y) = 1-ce^{-cy}$. The function has a global minimum at $y_0 = \\frac{\\ln c}{c}$, and the minimum value is $f(y_0) = \\frac{\\ln c}{c} + \\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1+\\ln c}{c}$.\n    For $k \\ge 0$, $A_k \\ge \\pi/2 > e^{-1} \\approx 0.367$. Therefore, $\\ln(A_k) > -1$, which implies $1+\\ln(A_k) > 0$.\n    Since the minimum value of $f(y)$ is positive, $f(y)$ is always positive. There are no real solutions for $y$.\n*   **Subcase IIb: $k \\le -1$.**\n    In this case, $A_k = -\\frac{3\\pi}{2}, -\\frac{7\\pi}{2}, \\dots$ are all negative. Let $c=-A_k>0$.\n    The equation becomes $-y = e^{cy}$, or $g(y) = y+e^{cy}=0$.\n    The derivative is $g'(y) = 1+ce^{cy}$. Since $c>0$, $g'(y) > 1$ for all $y$.\n    Thus, $g(y)$ is a strictly increasing function. Since $g(y) \\to \\infty$ as $y\\to\\infty$ and $g(y)\\to-\\infty$ as $y\\to-\\infty$, there is exactly one real root $y_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n    This root can be expressed using the Lambert W function. The equation $y=-e^{cy}$ can be solved to give $y_k = -\\frac{W_0(c)}{c} = -\\frac{W_0(-A_k)}{-A_k}$.\n    So, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k = i\\left(-\\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\right)$.\n\n**Case III: Other complex solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nFor this general case, we have the system:\n1.  $x = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(xA_k)$\n2.  $y = -e^{-yA_k} \\cos(xA_k)$\n\nIf we square and add these two equations, we get $x^2+y^2 = (e^{-yA_k})^2$, which is equivalent to $|z|=e^{-yA_k}$. This is the magnitude part of the original equation and provides no new information for solving the system.\n\nIf we divide the second equation by the first (assuming $x\\ne0$ and $\\sin(xA_k)\\ne0$):\n$\\frac{y}{x} = -\\cot(xA_k)$.\nThis implies $y = -x\\cot(xA_k)$.\n\nSubstituting this relation back into the first equation yields a single transcendental equation for $x$:\n$x = e^{-(-x\\cot(xA_k))A_k} \\sin(xA_k) \\implies \\frac{x}{\\sin(xA_k)} = e^{xA_k \\cot(xA_k)}$.\n\nFor each integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, this equation may have solutions for $x$. Any such solution $x$ would then determine a corresponding $y=-x\\cot(xA_k)$, defining a complex solution $z=x+iy$. These solutions exist but cannot be expressed in a simple closed form.\n\n**Summary of Solutions**\n\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of the following:\n\n1.  **Two real solutions:** $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  **An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions:** For each integer $k \\le -1$, there is one solution of the form $z_k = iy_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $y = -e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. These can be expressed using the principal branch of the Lambert W function as $z_k = i\\left(-\\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\right)$.\n3.  **Other complex solutions:** For each integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, there exists a set of solutions $z=x+iy$ (with $x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$) that satisfy the system of equations $x=e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$ and $y=-e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$.\n\n<<<The solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ are:\n1. The real numbers $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2. An infinite sequence of purely imaginary numbers $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique real solution to the equation $y = -e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}$. These solutions can be written as $z_k = i\\left(-\\frac{W_0(-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))}{-(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\right)$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n3. For each integer $k$, a set of non-axial complex numbers $z=x+iy$ that are solutions to the system of equations:\n   $x = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\sin\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)\\right)$\n   $y = -e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)}\\cos\\left(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)\\right)$\n>>>"
