    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Convert the Roman numerals to modern (Arabic) numbers.**\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `X` represents 10.\n    *   `V` represents 5.\n    *   `I` represents 1.\n    *   In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (I) comes before a larger value (V), it is subtracted. So, `IV` is 5 - 1 = 4.\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 10 + 10 + 4 = **24**.\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   Therefore, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n*   **CCXVII**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   `X` represents 10.\n    *   `V` represents 5.\n    *   `I` represents 1.\n    *   Therefore, `CCXVII` = 100 + 100 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = **217**.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the equation with modern numbers.**\n\nThe original equation `XXIV / CCC - CCXVII = ?` becomes:\n`24 / 300 - 217 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Solve the equation following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).**\n\nAccording to the order of operations, division must be performed before subtraction.\n\n*   **First, perform the division:**\n    *   24 / 300 = 0.08\n*   **Next, perform the subtraction:**\n    *   0.08 - 217 = -216.92\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Roman Numeral Conversion:** Be careful with the subtractive principle (e.g., IV = 4, not 6).\n2.  **Order of Operations:** It is crucial to perform the division (`XXIV / CCC`) first, before subtracting `CCXVII`. The problem is not `XXIV / (CCC - CCXVII)`.\n3.  **Calculation:** Ensure the arithmetic (division and subtraction) is done accurately.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n\n1.  Equation in modern numbers: `24 / 300 - 217`\n2.  Division: `24 / 300 = 0.08`\n3.  Subtraction: `0.08 - 217 = -216.92`\n\n<<<-216.92>>>"
