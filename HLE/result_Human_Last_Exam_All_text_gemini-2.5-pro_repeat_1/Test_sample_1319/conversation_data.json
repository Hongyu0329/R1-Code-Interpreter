    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Task**\nThe request asks to identify the tallest historical (i.e., real) mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nFirst, we must compile a list of all mountains explicitly named in the epic poem.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the poem. This is our baseline and is excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This name refers to a mountain near Troy from which Zeus often watches the battle (e.g., in Book 8 and Book 14). It is crucial to distinguish this from another Mount Ida on Crete, which is not the one featured in the *Iliad*'s main narrative. The mountain in the epic is the Phrygian or Trojan Ida, known today as Kaz Dağı in Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the sea god Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the Trojan War. The peak is now known as Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her journey takes her \"to the snowy mountains of the horse-loving Thracians, with their high peaks,\" and she steps from the summit of Athos.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the great ash-wood spear given to Achilles's father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron (e.g., Book 16).\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), the warriors from Maeonia are described as living \"under the snowy heights of Tmolus.\" This is a real mountain range in ancient Lydia, modern-day Turkey, now known as Bozdağlar.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Real-World Elevations of These Mountains**\nNow, we must find the modern, accepted elevations for each of these historical mountains to compare them.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet) - The tallest in Greece.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar):** The highest peak is 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Elevations and Determine the Second Tallest**\nArranging the mountains (excluding Olympus) from tallest to shortest based on their elevation:\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida (Trojan):** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
