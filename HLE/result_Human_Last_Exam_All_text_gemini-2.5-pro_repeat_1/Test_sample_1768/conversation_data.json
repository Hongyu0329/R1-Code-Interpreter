    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to translate a given nucleotide sequence, which is known to be from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that codes for a protein and is not interrupted by stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). We must find which of the three possible reading frames yields a protein sequence without any stop codons.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Reading Frames**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on the same strand, depending on which nucleotide you start with.\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\nWe will translate the sequence in each frame and check for the presence of stop codons.\n\n**Given Nucleotide Sequence:**\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n*   The key clue is \"middle of an ORF\". This strongly implies the correct frame will not have any stop codons.\n*   We need the standard genetic code to translate DNA codons into one-letter amino acid codes.\n*   Stop codons are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Frame 1**\n*   **Grouping:** We start reading from the first nucleotide (`g`).\n    `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `cat` -> H (Histidine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cysteine)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early in the sequence. This cannot be the correct frame for the middle of an ORF.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Frame 2**\n*   **Grouping:** We ignore the first nucleotide (`g`) and start reading from the second nucleotide (`a`).\n    `g` `acattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n    The codons are:\n    `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion:** This frame translates into a continuous sequence of 32 amino acids with no stop codons. This is the correct reading frame.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Frame 3**\n*   **Grouping:** We ignore the first two nucleotides (`gg`) and start reading from the third nucleotide (`a`).\n    `gg` `acattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n    The codons are:\n    `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa ...`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `aca` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `act` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains a stop codon (`tga`). This is not the correct frame.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, Frame 2 is the only frame that does not contain a stop codon.\n\n*   **Frame:** Frame 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLYPPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
