    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his specific 1905 scientific paper concerning Brownian motion.\n\n*   **Subject:** Albert Einstein\n*   **Document:** His 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The German title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen.\"\n*   **Object of inquiry:** The name of the person whose *lectures* were cited in that paper.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of Einstein's 1905 papers.**\nIn 1905, his \"Annus Mirabilis\" or \"miracle year,\" Einstein published several groundbreaking papers. While some, like the one on special relativity, are famous for having very few citations, this is not true for all of them. The paper on Brownian motion was deeply rooted in the existing fields of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the content and citations of the Brownian motion paper.**\nEinstein's goal in this paper was to show how the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (Brownian motion) could be explained by the kinetic theory of heat, thereby providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. This work built upon the statistical framework developed by earlier physicists.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the specific citation.**\nTo build his theoretical model, Einstein relied on the principles of statistical mechanics, a field pioneered by Ludwig Boltzmann. Within the text of his Brownian motion paper, Einstein makes an explicit reference to Boltzmann's work.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **The specific work cited:** The question specifies \"lectures.\" Einstein cited a book by Ludwig Boltzmann titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"** This directly matches the query.\n2.  **Location of the citation:** In the scientific papers of that era, citations were often not in a separate bibliography section but were included directly in the text or in footnotes. Einstein's reference to Boltzmann's lectures appears within the body of his paper.\n3.  **Distinguishing from other papers:** It's crucial not to confuse this paper with Einstein's 1905 paper on special relativity, which famously contained no citations to the work of other physicists like Lorentz or Poincaré, contributing to a myth that Einstein worked in complete isolation. The Brownian motion paper clearly shows he was engaged with the work of his predecessors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy examining the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, we can confirm that Albert Einstein cited the published lectures of the Austrian physicist who was a founder of statistical mechanics.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
