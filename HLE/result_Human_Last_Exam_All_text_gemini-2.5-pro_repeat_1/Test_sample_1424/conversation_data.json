    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, describes the propagation of a particle from one spacetime point to another. The *bare* Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the two-point Green's function is defined as the time-ordered expectation value of the field operators. For a fermionic system (the logic is analogous for bosons), this is:\n\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x, t) \\psi^*(x', t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]/\\hbar}}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\psi(x,t)$ and $\\psi^*(x,t)$ are Grassmann fields representing the particle.\n*   $\\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi]$ represents the functional integral over all possible field configurations (paths).\n*   $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe action for a non-interacting system is determined by the single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. The action is given by:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(x, t)$\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the operator $(i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)$. The Green's function is fundamentally the inverse of this operator.\n\n**Step 3: Diagonalize the Hamiltonian and the Action**\n\nThe key to finding the dependence on the energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is to work in the basis where the single-particle Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal. Let $|\\phi_k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n\n$\\hat{H}_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\n\nWe can expand the field operator $\\psi(x, t)$ in this basis:\n\n$\\psi(x, t) = \\sum_k c_k(t) \\phi_k(x)$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthonormality of the eigenstates ($\\int d^dx \\, \\phi_k^*(x) \\phi_{k'}(x) = \\delta_{kk'}$), the action simplifies and decouples:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\nThe total action is now a sum of independent actions for each mode $k$. This means the propagation of a particle in mode $k$ is independent of all other modes.\n\n**Step 4: Transform to the Frequency Domain**\n\nThe dependence on energy is most clearly seen in the frequency (or energy) domain. We perform a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$):\n\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi} e^{-i\\omega t} c_k(\\omega)$\n\nUnder this transformation, the time derivative operator becomes algebraic: $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$. (Setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity, which is common practice, this is $i\\partial_t \\rightarrow \\omega$). The action in the frequency domain becomes:\n\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int d\\omega \\, c_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Green's Function**\n\nIn this diagonal $(k, \\omega)$ basis, the path integral for the Green's function also becomes diagonal. The Green's function in this basis, $G_{0,k}(\\omega)$, is the expectation value $\\langle c_k(\\omega) c_k^*(\\omega) \\rangle$. For Gaussian integrals of this quadratic form, the two-point correlator is simply the inverse of the kernel in the action.\n\nThe kernel for mode $k$ is the term multiplying $c_k^*c_k$, which is $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Therefore, its inverse is:\n\n$G_{0,k}(\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Feynman Prescription**\n\nThe expression has a pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. To handle this singularity and correctly implement the time-ordering specified in the definition of the Green's function, the Feynman path integral implicitly includes a prescription. This amounts to adding a small imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\rightarrow 0^+$), to the denominator. This shifts the pole slightly off the real axis, allowing for a well-defined contour integration when transforming back to the time domain.\n\nThe causal (Feynman) Green's function is:\n\n$G_{0,k}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. A simpler, common form that captures the essential dependence is:\n\n$G_{0,k}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThis form is correct for particle propagation (for $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) and can be adjusted for hole propagation. The crucial point remains: the denominator contains the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is strictly for the **bare** (non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$. In an interacting system, the full Green's function $G$ is related to $G_0$ via the Dyson equation, $G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy. The poles of the full Green's function are at the *quasiparticle* energies, which are shifted from the bare energies $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  **Importance of Diagonal Basis**: The simple functional form is only apparent in the basis of energy eigenstates $\\{|\\phi_k\\rangle\\}$. In any other basis (like position space), the Green's function is a sum over all modes, $G_0(x, x', \\omega) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(x)\\phi_k^*(x')}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, making the dependence on any single $\\epsilon_k$ less direct.\n3.  **Frequency vs. Time Domain**: The algebraic dependence $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ is in the frequency domain. In the time domain, the dependence is exponential, of the form $\\sim e^{-i\\epsilon_k t}$. The frequency domain makes the relationship to energy most transparent.\n4.  **The $i\\eta$ Prescription**: The term `$i\\eta$` is not an arbitrary mathematical convenience. It is a direct consequence of the path integral formulation for a time-ordered correlator and is essential for ensuring causality (i.e., effects cannot precede their causes).\n5.  **Bosons vs. Fermions**: The derivation is essentially the same for bosons and fermions. The primary difference is that the fields $\\psi, \\psi^*$ are commuting complex numbers for bosons and anti-commuting Grassmann numbers for fermions. This affects the overall sign of loop diagrams but does not change the functional form of the propagator's denominator.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on a single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is found by analyzing the propagator for the corresponding mode $k$. In the frequency-momentum (or energy-eigenstate) space $(k, \\omega)$, the action for the system decouples into a sum of independent terms, one for each mode $k$. The term for mode $k$ is $S_{0,k} = \\int d\\omega \\, c_k^*(\\omega) (\\omega - \\epsilon_k) c_k(\\omega)$. The Green's function for this mode, $G_{0,k}(\\omega)$, is the inverse of the quadratic kernel $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. Including the Feynman prescription to handle the pole, the result is $G_{0,k}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$. This shows that the Green's function for mode $k$ has a **simple pole** where the frequency $\\omega$ is equal to the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe functional dependence is therefore of the form $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n\n<<<In the frequency domain, the bare Green's function for a specific mode k, denoted $G_{0,k}(\\omega)$, has a simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The functional form is given by: $G_{0,k}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$ where $\\omega$ is the frequency, and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal term from the Feynman prescription. This means $G_0$ has a simple pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$.>>>"
