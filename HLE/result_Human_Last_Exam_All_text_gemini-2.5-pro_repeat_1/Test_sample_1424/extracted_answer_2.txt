In the frequency domain, the bare Green's function for a specific mode k, denoted $G_{0,k}(\omega)$, has a simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The functional form is given by: $G_{0,k}(\omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$ where $\omega$ is the frequency, and $i\eta$ is an infinitesimal term from the Feynman prescription. This means $G_0$ has a simple pole at $\omega = \epsilon_k$.
