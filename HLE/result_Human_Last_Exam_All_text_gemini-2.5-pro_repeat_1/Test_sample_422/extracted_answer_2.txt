The two problems the JTB definition runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** For a belief to be justified, the justification must be based on reasons. Under the given constraints, these reasons must themselves be "Knowledge," as a mere "Belief" is defined as being either false or unjustified and thus cannot provide justification. This means that to gain any piece of knowledge, one must already possess other knowledge to justify it, leading to an infinite regress and making it impossible to account for the acquisition of foundational knowledge.

2.  **The Problem of Collapsed Distinctions:** The JTB model aims to analyze knowledge by distinguishing it from other states, particularly "unjustified true belief." However, by allowing only two epistemic states (Knowledge and Belief), the model is forced to categorize all forms of non-knowledge together. A "justified false belief" and an "unjustified true belief" (a lucky guess) are put into the exact same state of "Belief." This collapses the crucial distinction between being reasonably wrong and being luckily right, thereby weakening the analytical power and purpose of the "Justification" condition.
