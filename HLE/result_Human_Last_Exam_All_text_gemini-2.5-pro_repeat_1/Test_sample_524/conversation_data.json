    "This is a classic question in point-set topology. To answer it, we must first understand the definitions of the terms involved and then apply a known classification theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the terms in the question.**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Since we are in the plane, this means a closed, bounded, and connected subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space that is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Euclidean plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The question specifies planar continua, so we are already considering subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that $h(x) = y$. Intuitively, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to one another. The question asks for the number of these distinct classes.\n\n**Step 2: Consider the trivial case (the degenerate continuum).**\n\n*   A single point is a continuum (it is compact, connected, and non-empty).\n*   It is planar.\n*   It is trivially homogeneous: for any two points $x, y$, they must be the same point, so the identity map $h(x)=x$ serves as the required homeomorphism.\n*   Therefore, **the point** constitutes one homeomorphism class of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the non-degenerate cases.**\n\nFor non-degenerate continua (those with more than one point), we rely on a deep classification theorem in topology, primarily due to the work of R. H. Bing and R. D. Anderson. The theorem states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of exactly three types of spaces.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and analyze the three non-degenerate classes.**\n\n1.  **The Circle (SÂ¹):**\n    *   **Description:** The familiar unit circle in the plane.\n    *   **Properties:** It is a planar continuum. It is homogeneous because any point can be mapped to any other point via a simple rotation, which is a homeomorphism of the circle onto itself. It is also locally connected.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The circle is the only locally connected, non-degenerate, homogeneous planar continuum. This forms our second distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n2.  **The Pseudo-arc:**\n    *   **Description:** A very complex, \"snake-like\" continuum. It is arc-like but has the bizarre property of being *hereditarily indecomposable* (meaning any of its subcontinua cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua).\n    *   **Properties:** The pseudo-arc is a planar continuum. A major result by Bing proved that it is homogeneous. It is fundamentally different from the circle because it is *not* locally connected at any point. Furthermore, when embedded in the plane, it does not separate the plane into multiple regions. All pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The pseudo-arc forms our third distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n3.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:**\n    *   **Description:** This is another exotic object, constructed by replacing each point of a circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous way.\n    *   **Properties:** It is a planar continuum and was shown to be homogeneous. Like the pseudo-arc, it is not locally connected. However, it is topologically distinct from the pseudo-arc because, unlike the pseudo-arc, it *does* separate the plane into an \"inside\" and an \"outside,\" just as a simple circle does. All circles of pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The circle of pseudo-arcs forms our fourth distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the classes are distinct and the list is complete.**\n\n*   **Distinctness:**\n    *   The **point** is distinct from the others as it is a single point (degenerate).\n    *   The **circle** is distinct from the pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs because it is locally connected, whereas the other two are not.\n    *   The **pseudo-arc** is distinct from the **circle of pseudo-arcs** because the latter separates the plane while the former does not. A homeomorphism must preserve the property of separating the plane.\n\n*   **Completeness:** The classification theorem of Bing, Anderson, and others asserts that this list (circle, pseudo-arc, circle of pseudo-arcs) is a complete list of all non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua up to homeomorphism.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count.**\n\nWe have identified the following distinct homeomorphism classes:\n1.  The Point (degenerate case)\n2.  The Circle\n3.  The Pseudo-arc\n4.  The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n\nCounting these classes, we find there are a total of four.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. They are: the point, the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\n<<<4>>>"
