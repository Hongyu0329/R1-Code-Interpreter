    "An analysis of the question and the derivation of the answer are as follows.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\)\". The notation \\(m_{p/q}\\) indicates that the object of interest is derived from the rational number \\(p/q\\). In the context of the theory of Markov and Lagrange spectra, there is a standard construction that associates a quadratic irrational number (represented by its continued fraction) to any given rational number \\(p/q\\). The \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_{p/q}\\) is a value derived from this quadratic irrational. Therefore, computing the \"associated continued fraction\" means finding the continued fraction of this fundamental quadratic irrational.\n\n**2. The Standard Construction**\n\nThe procedure to find the associated continued fraction for a rational number \\(p/q\\) is as follows:\n*   First, find the regular (or simple) continued fraction expansion of the rational number \\(p/q\\). Let this be \\([0; c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n]\\), where all \\(c_i\\) are positive integers. For uniqueness, we can require \\(c_n > 1\\) if \\(n>1\\).\n*   Next, take the sequence of these partial quotients \\((c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n)\\) and reverse it to get \\((c_n, c_{n-1}, \\dots, c_1)\\).\n*   Finally, form a purely periodic continued fraction using this reversed sequence of coefficients. The resulting continued fraction, \\([0; \\overline{c_n, c_{n-1}, \\dots, c_1}]\\), is the continued fraction associated with the number \\(m_{p/q}\\). This is a fundamental object in the study of Diophantine approximation, from which the corresponding Markov number is defined.\n\n**3. Applying the Construction to \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n\nWe will now follow this procedure for the specific case where \\(p/q = 4/7\\).\n\n**Step 3.1: Find the continued fraction of 4/7.**\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the partial quotients:\n*   \\(\\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4}\\)\n*   \\(\\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4}\\), so the first partial quotient \\(c_1\\) is 1.\n*   The remainder is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). We take its reciprocal: \\(\\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\). So the second partial quotient \\(c_2\\) is 1.\n*   The remainder is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). We take its reciprocal: \\(\\frac{3}{1} = 3\\). So the third partial quotient \\(c_3\\) is 3.\nThe algorithm terminates. The continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\]\nThe sequence of partial quotients is \\((c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n**Step 3.2: Reverse the sequence of coefficients.**\nReversing the sequence \\((1, 1, 3)\\) gives us the new sequence \\((3, 1, 1)\\).\n\n**Step 3.3: Form the associated purely periodic continued fraction.**\nUsing the reversed sequence \\((3, 1, 1)\\) as the repeating block (period), we construct the associated continued fraction:\n\\[ [0; \\overline{3, 1, 1}] \\]\n\nThis is the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Generalized Markov Number\"**: The term \"generalized Markov number\" can have different meanings in different mathematical contexts. However, the indexing by a rational number \\(p/q\\) is a very strong indicator that the intended meaning comes from the theory of Lagrange and Markov spectra, where the construction based on the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\) is standard.\n*   **Correctness of the Continued Fraction for \\(p/q\\)**: The initial step of finding the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is crucial. A mistake here would propagate through the entire calculation. The calculation \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\) is verified as correct: \\(1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/3)) = 1/(1 + 3/4) = 1/(7/4) = 4/7\\).\n*   **Reversal of Coefficients**: The construction rule requires reversing the entire sequence of coefficients from the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\).\n*   **Notation**: The final answer should be expressed in the standard notation for a periodic continued fraction, using a bar (vinculum) over the repeating part.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n1.  **Input Rational:** \\(p/q = 4/7\\).\n2.  **Continued Fraction of \\(p/q\\):** \\(4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The coefficients are \\((1, 1, 3)\\).\n3.  **Reversed Coefficients:** The reversed sequence is \\((3, 1, 1)\\).\n4.  **Associated Continued Fraction:** Form a purely periodic continued fraction with the reversed sequence: \\([0; \\overline{3, 1, 1}]\\).\n\nThis completes the step-by-step analysis."
