    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integral equation and its kernel.**\nThe given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)$, for $0 ≤ x ≤ 1$.\n\nThis is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Let's analyze the kernel, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y).\nUsing the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, we can expand the kernel as:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + xⁿ⁻³y² + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹\nThis can be written as a sum:\nK(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k\n\n**Step 2: Convert the integral equation into a system of linear equations.**\nSince the kernel is a sum of products of functions of x and functions of y, it is a separable (or degenerate) kernel. We can rewrite the integral equation as:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y) dy\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) [∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy]\n\nLet's define the constants c_k as the moments of the function u(y):\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nSubstituting these constants back into the equation for u(x), we get:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nThis shows that if a solution u(x) exists, it must be a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1.\nNow, we can find a system of equations for the unknown constants c_k. We substitute the expression for u(y) into the definition of c_j:\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy\nc_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j + n-1-k) dy\nPerforming the integrations:\n∫₀¹ y^j dy = [y^(j+1) / (j+1)]₀¹ = 1 / (j+1)\n∫₀¹ y^(j + n-1-k) dy = [y^(j + n-k) / (j + n-k)]₀¹ = 1 / (j + n-k)\n\nSo, we obtain a system of n linear equations for the n unknowns c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1):\nc_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) [1 / (j + n - k)] c_k, for j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition for no solution.**\nWe can write the system of equations in matrix form. Let c be the column vector [c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1)]^T, b be the column vector [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]^T, and M be the n x n matrix with elements M_jk = 1 / (j + n - k).\nThe system is:\nc = b + λMc\n(I - λM)c = b\n\nAccording to the theory of linear systems, this system has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, and the system is inconsistent.\ndet(I - λM) = 0\n\nThis condition means that 1/λ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix M. Let μ be an eigenvalue of M. Then the values of λ for which there might not be a unique solution are λ = 1/μ.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, for such a λ, the inhomogeneous equation has no solution if the forcing term (in this case, the function f(x)=1) is not orthogonal to the solutions of the corresponding adjoint homogeneous equation. Since the kernel is symmetric (K(x,y)=K(y,x)), the adjoint equation is the same as the homogeneous equation.\nThe condition for no solution is that there exists an eigenfunction u_h (a non-trivial solution to u = λ ∫ K u dy) such that the inner product (1, u_h) = ∫₀¹ 1 * u_h(x) dx ≠ 0.\n\nThe integral of an eigenfunction is:\n∫₀¹ u_h(x) dx = c₀.\nSo, the equation has no solution for a characteristic value λ if the corresponding eigenfunction has a non-zero zeroth moment c₀.\n\nThe homogeneous equation leads to the system Mc = (1/λ)c. So c is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue μ = 1/λ. The condition for no solution is that for a given λ=1/μ, the corresponding eigenvector c has c₀ ≠ 0.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze a specific case (n=2) to verify the method.**\nFor n=2, the kernel is K(x,y) = x+y. The system of equations for c₀ and c₁ is:\n(1 - λ/2)c₀ - λc₁ = 1\n(-λ/3)c₀ + (1 - λ/2)c₁ = 1/2\n\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix is D = (1-λ/2)² - λ²/3 = 1 - λ - λ²/12.\nSetting D=0 gives the quadratic equation λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0.\nThe roots are λ = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 4(1)(-12))] / 2 = [-12 ± sqrt(192)] / 2 = [-12 ± 8√3] / 2 = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nFor these values of λ, the determinant is zero. To check for inconsistency, we can use Cramer's rule. The numerator determinant for c₀ is:\nD_c₀ = | 1   -λ   |\n       | 1/2 1-λ/2 | = (1 - λ/2) - (-λ)(1/2) = 1 - λ/2 + λ/2 = 1.\nSince D_c₀ = 1 ≠ 0, while D=0, the system is inconsistent and has no solution.\nSo for n=2, the values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n**Step 5: General Conclusion.**\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation det(I - λM) = 0, where M is the n x n matrix with entries M_jk = 1/(j + n - k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1, provided that for these values of λ the linear system (I - λM)c = b is inconsistent.\n\nThis analysis shows that for any given integer n ≥ 1, the problem reduces to an eigenvalue problem for an n x n matrix. The values of λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this matrix M, under the condition of inconsistency which generally holds. Explicitly solving for these eigenvalues for an arbitrary n is not straightforward as it involves finding roots of a degree-n polynomial. The question asks for \"what values\", and the most precise general description is this characterization.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the polynomial equation det(I - λM) = 0, where I is the n x n identity matrix and M is the n x n matrix with elements M_jk = 1/(j + n - k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nFor n=1, M is a 1x1 matrix M₀₀=1/1=1. The equation is 1-λ=0, so λ=1.\nFor n=2, the equation is λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0, which yields λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\nWithout a specified value for n, the general answer is the set of roots of the characteristic polynomial.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the nth-degree polynomial equation det(I - λM) = 0, where M is the n x n matrix with entries M_ij = 1/(i + n - j) for i, j ∈ {0, 1, ..., n-1}.>>>"
