    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integrand and identify the dominant contribution**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\n\nLet's denote the polynomial in the denominator as $P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$. The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$. We are interested in the behavior of this integral for small positive values of $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\n\nA key point is to analyze the behavior of the denominator, $\\epsilon + P(x)$, over the integration interval $[0, 15]$.\nLet's analyze $P(x) = x^5(9 + 5x + 9x^3)$. For $x > 0$, all terms are positive, so $P(x) > 0$. At the lower limit of integration, $x=0$, we have $P(0)=0$.\nThis means that for small $\\epsilon$, the denominator $\\epsilon + P(x)$ becomes very small when $x$ is close to 0. Consequently, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)}$ develops a tall, narrow peak at $x=0$. The area under this peak provides the dominant contribution to the integral. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the function P(x) near the dominant region**\n\nSince the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$, we can approximate the polynomial $P(x)$ by its behavior for small $x$. The term with the lowest power of $x$ will dominate.\nFor $x \\to 0$:\n$P(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5$\nThis approximation allows us to replace the full polynomial $P(x)$ with its leading term to find the leading-order behavior of the integral.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the integral by extending the integration limit**\n\nThe next careful point is to assess the contribution from the upper part of the integration range. For $x$ away from 0, the term $9x^5$ grows quickly. For example, at $x=15$, the denominator is very large, and the integrand is very small. Let's consider the error introduced by extending the upper limit of integration from 15 to $\\infty$:\n$\\int_{15}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\nFor small $\\epsilon$, this integral is approximately $\\int_{15}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{9x^5} dx = \\frac{1}{9} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4x^4} \\right]_{15}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{36 \\cdot 15^4}$. This is a small constant value. The dominant part of $I(\\epsilon)$ depends on $\\epsilon$ and diverges as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. A small, constant term is a lower-order correction. Therefore, we can extend the integration limit to $\\infty$ to simplify the calculation without affecting the leading-order asymptotic formula for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the approximate integral using a change of variables**\n\nLet's evaluate $I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$.\nTo evaluate this integral, we use a substitution that simplifies the denominator. Let's rescale $x$ so that the two terms in the denominator become comparable. Let $9x^5 = \\epsilon u$.\nThis implies $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon u}{9}$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u^{1/5}$.\nThe differential $dx$ is then $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} du$.\nThe denominator becomes $\\epsilon + 9x^5 = \\epsilon + \\epsilon u = \\epsilon(1+u)$.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1+u)} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\frac{1}{5} u^{-4/5} \\right] du$\nNow, we pull the constants and terms with $\\epsilon$ out of the integral:\n$I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{5\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{5\\epsilon \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n$I_{approx}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the value of the constant definite integral**\n\nThe remaining integral, $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5}}{1+u} du$, is a standard integral related to the Euler Beta function. The relevant identity is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{z-1}}{1+t} dt = \\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$\nIn our case, the exponent is $-4/5$, so $z-1 = -4/5$, which gives $z=1/5$. The identity is valid for $0<z<1$, which is satisfied.\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{1/5 - 1}}{1+u} du = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results to obtain the final analytical formula**\n\nSubstituting the value of this definite integral back into our expression for $I_{approx}(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5}} \\epsilon^{-4/5} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\nThis is the final analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. It captures the leading-order singular behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon$ approaches zero.\n\n<<<I(epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
