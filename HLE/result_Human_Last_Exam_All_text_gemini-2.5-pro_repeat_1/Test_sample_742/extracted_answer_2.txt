No, it is not possible. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (Hilbert spaces, linear operators) is designed to model the physical world and has no capacity to represent or analyze the metaphysical concepts (e.g., "positive properties," "necessary existence") and modal logic upon which GÃ¶del's ontological proof is built. The two domains are conceptually and formally incommensurable.
