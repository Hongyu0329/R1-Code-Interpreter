    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and reagents.**\n*   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   This is an aromatic compound (benzene ring derivative).\n    *   At position 1, there is an N,N-diethylamide group: -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   At position 3, there is a dimethylamino group: -N(CH₃)₂.\n*   **Reagents (First Step):** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF (tetrahydrofuran).\n    *   sec-BuLi is a very strong base.\n    *   TMEDA is a ligand that chelates the lithium ion (Li⁺), increasing the basicity and reactivity of the organolithium reagent.\n    *   This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction, where a proton on the aromatic ring is abstracted by the strong base.\n*   **Reagent (Second Step):** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   This is an electrophile. It is used to introduce a methyl group onto a nucleophilic site.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the site of deprotonation (metalation).**\n*   In a Directed Ortho Metalation reaction, the deprotonation occurs at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to a \"directing group\". A directing group is a functional group containing a heteroatom (like O or N) that can coordinate with the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent.\n*   The starting material has two directing groups:\n    1.  The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂). The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base for coordinating Li⁺. This is a very powerful directing group.\n    2.  The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). The nitrogen's lone pair can also coordinate Li⁺. This is also a good directing group.\n*   **Comparing the directing ability:** The amide group (-CONR₂) is a significantly stronger directing group than the amino group (-NR₂). Therefore, the metalation will occur at a position ortho to the amide group.\n*   The positions ortho to the amide group (at C1) are C2 and C6. We must determine which of these two positions will be deprotonated.\n    *   The C2 position is ortho to the strong directing group (-CONEt₂) *and* ortho to the weaker directing group (-NMe₂).\n    *   The C6 position is only ortho to the strong directing group (-CONEt₂).\n*   The C2 proton is flanked by two directing groups. This has two effects: (1) The C2 proton is more acidic due to the inductive effects of the adjacent groups. (2) The transition state for deprotonation is stabilized by the chelation of the lithium ion by both the amide oxygen and the amino nitrogen. This is a synergistic effect.\n*   **Conclusion:** The deprotonation will occur selectively at the C2 position. This forms a highly nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the reaction with the electrophile.**\n*   The aryllithium intermediate, with a negative charge (and lithium counterion) at the C2 position, is a strong nucleophile.\n*   This nucleophile is then treated with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   The carbanion at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻) as a leaving group. This is a standard nucleophilic substitution reaction that forms a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the final product.**\n*   Starting with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, a proton at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃).\n*   The final compound is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
