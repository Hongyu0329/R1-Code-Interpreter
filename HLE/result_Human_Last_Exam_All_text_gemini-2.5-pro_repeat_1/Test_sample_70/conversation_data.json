    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Describe the Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is composed of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar.\n2.  **Represent as a Matrix:** To analyze the flag using linear algebra, we represent it as a matrix. Each distinct color is assigned a unique, linearly independent value. For instance, we can model the colors as vectors, like Red = R and White = W, where R and W are linearly independent (e.g., R=(1,0) and W=(0,1) in a 2D vector space). This ensures the \"maximal rank\" condition mentioned in the question is met, meaning the rank is determined by the flag's geometric pattern, not an accidental choice of color values.\n3.  **Analyze the Rows and Columns:** The matrix of the Danish flag has rows of two distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1:** Rows that form the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows consist entirely of the color White. Let's call this row vector `v_W = [W, W, W, ...]`.\n    *   **Type 2:** Rows that are part of the red field, intersected by the vertical bar of the cross. These rows consist mostly of Red, with a segment of White. Let's call this row vector `v_RW = [R, R, ..., W, ..., R, R]`.\n4.  **Determine Linear Independence:** The entire set of rows in the matrix is composed of repetitions of these two vectors, `v_W` and `v_RW`. The row space of the matrix is therefore spanned by `{v_W, v_RW}`. These two vectors are linearly independent because one is not a scalar multiple of the other (as R and W are linearly independent).\n5.  **Conclusion on Rank:** Since the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the dimension of the row space, which is the rank of the matrix, is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Find African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe now need to identify African flags whose matrix representation also has a rank of 2. A flag has a rank of 2 if its matrix is spanned by exactly two linearly independent row or column vectors.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags with a single solid color would have a rank of 1.\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2:**\n    *   Simple horizontal or vertical tricolors with three distinct colors (e.g., Gabon, Sierra Leone, Guinea) have a rank of 3, as they are spanned by three distinct, linearly independent row or column vectors.\n    *   Flags with central emblems (stars, shields, etc.) on a simple field typically have a rank of 3 or higher. The emblem introduces new row/column patterns that are linearly independent from the background rows/columns. For example, the flag of Somalia (blue field, white star) has a rank greater than 2 because rows intersecting the star are linearly independent from plain blue rows and from each other.\n    *   Flags with complex patterns like diagonal stripes, multiple fimbriations (thin borders), or many colors will have a rank greater than 2.\n\nBased on this, we screen for flags with patterns that generate exactly two basis vectors.\n\n1.  **Nigeria**\n    *   **Design:** Three vertical stripes: Green, White, Green.\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag uses two colors, Green (G) and White (W). Analyzing the columns, we find two distinct types: an all-Green column (`c_G`) and an all-White column (`c_W`). The column space is spanned by `{c_G, c_W}`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   **Rank:** 2.\n\n2.  **Benin**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical Green band at the hoist with two horizontal bands of Yellow and Red on the fly.\n    *   **Analysis:** This flag has three colors, but its structure is key. Let's analyze the rows. There are only two types of rows:\n        *   **Top half:** A segment of Green followed by a segment of Yellow. (`r_top = [G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y]`)\n        *   **Bottom half:** A segment of Green followed by a segment of Red. (`r_bot = [G, ..., G, R, ..., R]`)\n    *   The row space is spanned by `{r_top, r_bot}`. These two vectors are linearly independent.\n    *   **Rank:** 2.\n\n3.  **Madagascar**\n    *   **Design:** A vertical White band at the hoist with two horizontal bands of Red and Green on the fly.\n    *   **Analysis:** The geometric structure is identical to that of Benin's flag. There are two types of rows:\n        *   **Top half:** A segment of White followed by a segment of Red. (`r_top = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`)\n        *   **Bottom half:** A segment of White followed by a segment of Green. (`r_bot = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`)\n    *   The row space is spanned by these two linearly independent vectors.\n    *   **Rank:** 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flags of Denmark, Nigeria, Benin, and Madagascar all share a linear algebraic rank of 2. The question asks for the African nations whose flags match this rank.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
