    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core clues provided in the question.**\n*   **Interpreter:** The analysis is based on \"Veronika Campan's interpretation.\" This points to a specific academic or philosophical reading of a text. Veronika Campan is a scholar known for her work on psychoanalysis, particularly the teachings of Jacques Lacan.\n*   **The Subject (\"HE\"):** We are looking for the full name of a male figure.\n*   **The Work (\"HIS work\"):** This figure created a significant work.\n*   **Location in the Work (\"at the end of HIS work\"):** The specific issue is addressed in the final part of this work.\n*   **The Issue:** The topic is \"another's material possessions.\" This suggests a law or commandment related to coveting or theft.\n*   **The Method:** \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This is the most critical clue. It implies two distinct rules within the same work: one that forbids representation (like making images or idols) and another, later rule that seems to bypass the first one.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the clues to a specific text.**\n*   The combination of a \"prohibition against representation\" and a law against coveting \"another's material possessions\" strongly points to the Ten Commandments (the Decalogue) from the Hebrew Bible.\n*   The Second Commandment is a classic \"prohibition against representation\": \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...\"\n*   The Tenth Commandment, which comes at the end of the list, deals directly with \"another's material possessions\": \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house... nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.\"\n\n**Step 3: Identify the figure (\"HE\").**\n*   The person traditionally credited with receiving and delivering the Ten Commandments is Moses. Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses, and \"HIS work\" is the Decalogue.\n\n**Step 4: Understand Veronika Campan's interpretation.**\n*   Campan's work, often interpreting Lacan, analyzes the structure of the Ten Commandments. The interpretation is that the Decalogue starts with abstract prohibitions, like the one against representing God (who is unrepresentable).\n*   However, when it gets to the final commandment about coveting, the law must become concrete to be understood. To forbid the desire for the neighbor's things, the law has to *name* or *represent* those very things in language (\"house,\" \"ox,\" \"ass\").\n*   In this act of naming specific, tangible objects of desire, the text \"naturally ignores\" the spirit of the earlier, absolute \"prohibition against representation.\" It must use representation to make its point about material possessions. This is the paradox the interpretation highlights.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity.**\n*   All the clues converge on the figure of Moses as the author/transmitter of the Ten Commandments. The specific, nuanced interpretation described in the prompt is a known psychoanalytic reading of his work. The question asks for HIS full name. For this historical and religious figure, his given name is his full name.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe figure is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
