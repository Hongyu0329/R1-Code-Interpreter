    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\n*   **What is being asked?** To identify the rarest noble gas.\n*   **What is the scope?** \"On Earth,\" meaning we must consider the entire planet (atmosphere, crust, mantle, etc.), not just the atmosphere.\n*   **What is the metric for rarity?** \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter,\" which means we should compare the total mass of each noble gas to the total mass of the Earth.\n*   **What is the timeframe?** \"in 2002.\" For the abundance of natural elements on a planetary scale, the values do not change significantly over decades. Therefore, data from around that time or even current data is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Candidate Noble Gases**\n\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not considered.)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\n\nWe need to consider the total amount of each gas on Earth. While the atmosphere is a major reservoir for noble gases, we must also account for their presence in the Earth's crust and mantle.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** Argon is the most abundant of the rarer noble gases, making up about 0.93% of the Earth's atmosphere. Its most common isotope, Argon-40, is continuously produced by the radioactive decay of Potassium-40, which is common in the Earth's crust. This constant production makes it relatively plentiful.\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium is the second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere (after argon). It is also continuously produced by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Although it is light enough to escape Earth's gravity and be lost to space, its continuous production keeps its overall abundance higher than the other noble gases below it on the list.\n*   **Neon (Ne), Krypton (Kr), and Xenon (Xe):** These gases are considered primordial, meaning the amount present on Earth today is largely what was captured when the planet formed. They are not significantly produced by any ongoing natural processes. Their atmospheric abundance decreases with increasing atomic mass:\n    *   Neon: ~18 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere.\n    *   Krypton: ~1 ppm in the atmosphere.\n    *   Xenon: ~0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion) in the atmosphere.\n    Based on this, Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases.\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This is the crucial element to consider. Unlike the others, all isotopes of Radon are radioactive. Radon is not a primordial gas; it exists only as a short-lived intermediate product in the radioactive decay chains of uranium and thorium. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Total Abundances to Find the Rarest**\n\n*   We compare the stable gases (Ne, Kr, Xe) with the radioactive gas (Rn).\n*   While Xenon is extremely rare, a stable quantity of it exists, primarily in the atmosphere.\n*   Radon, due to its extremely short half-life, decays almost as quickly as it is formed. This means that the total amount of Radon present on the entire planet at any single moment (the \"steady-state\" amount) is extraordinarily small. Estimates place the total amount of radon in the atmosphere at any given time at only a few tens of kilograms.\n*   Even when considering the radon trapped in the crust and oceans, its total mass is minuscule compared to the total mass of Xenon.\n*   Therefore, because it decays so rapidly, the total instantaneous quantity of Radon on Earth is far less than that of any other noble gas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rarity of the noble gases on Earth, from most abundant to least abundant by mass, is: Argon > Helium > Neon > Krypton > Xenon > Radon. The key point is the instability of Radon. Its very short half-life ensures that its total quantity on Earth at any given moment is vanishingly small, making it the rarest of all the noble gases.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
