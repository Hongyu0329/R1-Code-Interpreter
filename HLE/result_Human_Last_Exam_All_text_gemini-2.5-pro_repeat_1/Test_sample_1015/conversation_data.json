    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the careful points to consider.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the key difference between a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) as taught and performed in two specific schools of ballet: the Vaganova method and the Balanchine method.\n\n2.  **Define *Cambré Derrière*:** This is a fundamental ballet movement where the upper body bends backward from the waist. The goal is to create an elegant, curved line while maintaining balance and control. Key body parts involved are the spine, hips, head, and arms.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Vaganova method, developed in Russia, emphasizes strength, precision, and clean, unbroken lines. It is very academic and focuses on building a strong, stable core and lower body from which the upper body can move with expressive freedom.\n    *   ***Cambré Derrière* Execution:** In a Vaganova cambré, the primary focus is on spinal flexibility. The bend originates from the upper back, with the chest lifting towards the ceiling. A crucial rule is that the hips must remain perfectly square and directly over the feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault, as it breaks the line from the hip to the foot and is seen as \"cheating\" the backbend by using the pelvis for counterbalance instead of pure spinal articulation. The line from the waist down should remain stable and vertical.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine in the United States, is a neoclassical style. It prioritizes speed, musicality, and extreme, dynamic lines. Balanchine often pushed the boundaries of classical technique to create a more athletic and visually exciting aesthetic.\n    *   ***Cambré Derrière* Execution:** In the Balanchine style, the aesthetic goal is often a deeper, more dramatic backbend. To achieve this greater range of motion, dancers are taught to press their hips *forward* as the upper body bends back. This use of the hips as a counterbalance allows the spine to curve more deeply. This creates a visually distinct, \"broken\" line at the hip, which is a signature element of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n\n5.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While subtle stylistic differences in the arms might exist, the fundamental positions (like 5th en haut) are similar. This is not the primary distinguishing factor.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant point of divergence. Vaganova insists on hips staying *over* the feet. Balanchine encourages hips to push *forward*. This is a fundamental mechanical and aesthetic difference.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is often faster, a cambré can be performed at various tempos in either style depending on the exercise. Speed is a quality of the performance, not the core technical difference in *how* the step is built.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the technique used, specifically the hip placement. The hip placement is the *cause* of the difference in degree, making it the more fundamental answer.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine. The head might go further back in a Balanchine cambré simply because the backbend itself is deeper, but the principle of the head following the spine is the same. The hip action is what initiates this greater potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most defining and technically precise difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the action and placement of the hips. Vaganova maintains a stable, stationary pelvis, while Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips to achieve a deeper bend.\n\n<<<B>>>"
