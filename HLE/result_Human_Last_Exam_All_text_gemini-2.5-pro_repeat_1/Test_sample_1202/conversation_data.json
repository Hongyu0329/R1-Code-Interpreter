    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism that explains two key outcomes after a gene is duplicated:\n1.  **Retention:** The duplicate copy is kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than being lost.\n2.  **Divergence:** The two copies (the original and the duplicate) evolve to become different from one another in terms of sequence, function, or regulation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Initial State After Gene Duplication**\nImmediately after duplication, an organism has two identical copies of a gene. One copy is usually sufficient to perform the original function. This makes the second copy redundant. Because it is redundant, it is largely freed from the pressure of purifying selection, which would normally remove harmful mutations. This allows the duplicate copy to accumulate mutations at a higher rate.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Possible Fates and Mechanisms**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicate genes, it would cause one copy to be overwritten by the sequence of the other, making them identical again. This process promotes sequence homogeneity and works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for retention *and* divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization (or Nonfunctionalization):** This is the most common fate for a duplicate gene. The redundant copy accumulates deleterious mutations (like nonsense or frameshift mutations) that render it non-functional. It becomes a \"pseudogene.\" This outcome represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention. Therefore, this mechanism does not explain the retention of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy retains the original, ancestral function, while the duplicate copy accumulates mutations that lead to a completely new, beneficial function. The selective advantage conferred by this new function ensures the retention of the duplicate gene. This mechanism successfully explains both **retention** (due to the benefit of the new function) and **divergence** (the new function is different from the original).\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) applies when the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in several different tissues). After duplication, it's possible for each copy to accumulate different degenerative mutations, causing them to lose complementary sub-functions. For instance, the original gene was functional in both liver and muscle. After duplication, copy 1 loses the liver function but keeps the muscle function, while copy 2 loses the muscle function but keeps the liver function. Now, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions of the single ancestral gene. This co-dependence ensures that both copies are retained. This mechanism also explains both **retention** (both copies are now essential) and **divergence** (they have diverged in their expression pattern and/or function).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many new species, often to fill new ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that facilitates such diversification, but adaptive radiation itself is the large-scale outcome, not the specific molecular mechanism that governs the fate of an individual duplicate gene pair. It operates at the level of species and lineages, not molecules.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Most Plausible Mechanisms (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization)**\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid and well-supported mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks for the **\"most likely\"** one.\n\n*   Neofunctionalization requires the occurrence of a rare beneficial mutation to create a new function.\n*   Subfunctionalization can occur through much more common, randomly occurring degenerative mutations.\n\nBecause degenerative mutations are far more frequent than novel, beneficial gain-of-function mutations, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization provides a more common and passive pathway for the initial preservation of duplicate genes. It allows the duplicate pair to escape the primary fate of pseudogenization without requiring immediate positive selection for a new function. Once preserved via subfunctionalization, the genes can continue to diverge and may even neofunctionalize later. Therefore, as a mechanism to explain the widespread retention of duplicates in genomes, subfunctionalization is considered a very probable route.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWhile neofunctionalization is a critical source of evolutionary novelty, subfunctionalization provides a more likely general mechanism for the initial retention of duplicate genes, allowing them the time to diverge. It relies on more frequent mutational events (degeneration) to make both copies essential through complementation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
