    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Group and the Question**\n\nThe group is $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. This is an abelian group, which is the direct product of 2024 copies of the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$. The identity element of $G$ is the zero vector, $0 = (0, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible size of a subset $A \\subset G$ with the following property: every cyclic subgroup of $G$ must contain at least one element of $A$.\n\nLet's denote the set of all cyclic subgroups of $G$ by $\\mathcal{C}$. The condition on the set $A$ can be written formally as:\nFor every $H \\in \\mathcal{C}$, the intersection $H \\cap A$ must be non-empty ($H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Properties of Cyclic Subgroups**\n\nA cyclic subgroup is a subgroup generated by a single element $g \\in G$. We denote it as $\\langle g \\rangle$. A fundamental property of any subgroup of a group is that it must contain the identity element of the group.\n\nIn our group $G$, the identity element is $0$. Therefore, for any element $g \\in G$, the cyclic subgroup $\\langle g \\rangle$ must contain $0$. This is true for all cyclic subgroups, from the trivial subgroup $\\langle 0 \\rangle = \\{0\\}$ to the largest cyclic subgroups of order 49.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Candidate Set A and Verify the Condition**\n\nLet's consider the simplest possible non-empty subset of $G$, the set containing only the identity element.\nLet $A = \\{0\\}$.\nThe size of this set is $|A|=1$.\n\nNow, let's check if this set $A$ satisfies the required condition. The condition is that for any cyclic subgroup $H$, we must have $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$.\nLet $H$ be an arbitrary cyclic subgroup of $G$.\nAs established in Step 2, any subgroup $H$ must contain the identity element, $0$.\nSo, $0 \\in H$.\nOur proposed set is $A = \\{0\\}$.\nLet's compute the intersection: $H \\cap A = H \\cap \\{0\\}$.\nSince $0$ is an element of both $H$ and $A$, the intersection is $\\{0\\}$.\nThe set $\\{0\\}$ is not the empty set.\nThus, for any cyclic subgroup $H$, the condition $H \\cap A \\neq \\emptyset$ is satisfied.\n\nThis shows that the set $A=\\{0\\}$ is a valid set that fulfills the property described in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Minimality of the Size**\n\nWe have found a set $A$ of size 1 that satisfies the condition. To find the *smallest* size, we need to check if a smaller size is possible.\nThe size of a set must be a non-negative integer.\nIf we choose $A$ to be the empty set ($|A|=0$), then for any subgroup $H$, the intersection is $H \\cap \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. This violates the condition that the intersection must be non-empty.\nTherefore, the set $A$ cannot be empty, and its size must be at least 1.\nSince we have found a valid set of size 1, this must be the minimum possible size.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Role of the Specific Group Structure**\n\nThe detailed structure of the group, $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, might lead one to perform complex calculations involving the number of subgroups of different orders. For example, one could calculate the number of subgroups of order 7, which is $\\frac{7^{2024}-1}{6}$.\n\nHowever, the logic presented in Steps 2-4 holds for *any* group, regardless of its structure. The fact that every subgroup contains the identity element is a universal property from basic group theory. This implies that the specific details of $G$ are not necessary for solving the problem as it is literally stated. The problem is a test of careful reading and understanding of fundamental definitions, where the complex group structure serves as a potential distraction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe smallest size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that every cyclic subgroup of $G$ contains at least one element of $A$ is 1. The set $A=\\{0\\}$ satisfies the condition, and no smaller non-empty set is possible.\n\n<<<1>>>"
