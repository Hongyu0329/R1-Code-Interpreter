    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is that this character expresses shame over having forgotten, or missing, the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This points to a character who has been away from Earth for a long time and feels profoundly alienated.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist who has just arrived at the Solaris station from Earth. The film opens with him on Earth, surrounded by nature, including the sounds of water and leaves. While he is deeply affected by his experiences, he is the most recent arrival and still has a fresh connection to Earth. It's less likely he would express having forgotten something so fundamental so soon. His primary shame and guilt revolve around his late wife, Hari.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is not a human from Earth. She is a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no firsthand experience of Earth and therefore cannot miss or be ashamed of forgetting its sounds. Her journey is one of self-discovery and understanding her own unnatural existence.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the scientists who has been on the station for a long time before Kris's arrival. He is cynical, world-weary, and often serves as the philosophical voice of the film. He frequently reflects on the crew's psychological state and their disconnection from humanity and Earth. A statement expressing shame about losing touch with fundamental earthly experiences fits his character perfectly, as he embodies the long-term psychological toll of being isolated in space.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other long-term scientist. He is portrayed as cold, rational, and almost obsessively focused on the scientific aspects of their predicament. He is less given to sentimental or philosophical reflections about Earth. His priority is to study and control the phenomenon, not to lament his lost connection to his home planet. Such a poetic and emotional admission would be out of character for him.\n\n*   **E. Dr. Gibarian:** Gibarian is a friend of Kris who was on the station but committed suicide just before Kris arrived. We only see him through a video message he left behind. In his message, he expresses despair and warns Kris, but the specific line about missing the rustling leaves is not part of his final message.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Dialogue**\nIn a key conversation with Kris, Dr. Snaut delivers a monologue about why the crew is in no hurry to return to Earth. He explains that they have become \"unaccustomed\" to it and feel a sense of shame. He says: \"We've become crude here. We haven't had Earth in us for a long time. We go back a little ashamed. Ashamed... I can't even remember the sound of rustling leaves.\" (This is a common translation of the line). This directly confirms that Snaut is the character who expresses this sentiment.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Answer**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to have forgotten the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n\n<<<C>>>"
