    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. It is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Its structure is:\n    (CH₃)₃C-CHO\n\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. Let's break down the name to determine its structure:\n    *   `triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane`: This indicates a phosphorus atom bonded to three phenyl groups (Ph₃P). The λ⁵ notation specifies the bonding state of phosphorus, which is typical for ylides.\n    *   `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)`: This describes the group attached to the phosphorus via a double bond.\n        *   `ethylidene`: A two-carbon group attached by a double bond, `=CH-CH₃`.\n        *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: A 2-chlorophenyl group (an ortho-substituted chlorine on a benzene ring) is located on the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the ylide carbon (C1, double-bonded to P) is a CH, and the second carbon (C2) is a CH₂ group attached to a 2-chlorophenyl ring. The structure of the Wittig reagent is:\n        Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It involves the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with a phosphorus ylide. The overall transformation replaces the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) with the carbon group from the ylide (the part double-bonded to the phosphorus).\n\nThe key bond formation is between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylidic carbon of the Wittig reagent, resulting in a new C=C double bond. A stable byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O), is also formed.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the Product Structure**\n\nWe combine the two reactant fragments at the site of the reaction:\n*   From pivalaldehyde: The `(CH₃)₃C-CH` part.\n*   From the ylide: The `CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)` part.\n\nThese two fragments join to form the alkene:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product**\n\nThe newly formed double bond can be either *Z* (cis) or *E* (trans). The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the stability of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized ylides** have an electron-withdrawing group (like -C=O, -CN, -COOR) attached to the ylidic carbon. They are resonance-stabilized and generally lead to the thermodynamically more stable *E*-alkene.\n*   **Non-stabilized (or unstabilized) ylides** have alkyl or hydrogen groups on the ylidic carbon. They are more reactive and the reaction is kinetically controlled, typically yielding the *Z*-alkene as the major product.\n\nLet's classify our ylide: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-Cl-C₆H₄). The group attached to the ylidic carbon is a (2-chlorophenylethyl) group, which is an alkyl-type group. It does not provide resonance stabilization. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\nFor a reaction between an aldehyde and a non-stabilized ylide, the major product is the **Z-isomer**.\n\n**Step 5: Name the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain that includes the double bond has five carbon atoms. Thus, the parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  **Number the chain:** We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number.\n    *   Numbering from the left: `(o-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₃`. The double bond starts at C2.\n    *   Numbering from the right: This would place the double bond at C3.\n    *   Therefore, we use the first numbering scheme, and the parent name is **pent-2-ene**.\n3.  **Identify and locate substituents:**\n    *   At C1, there is a `2-chlorophenyl` group.\n    *   At C4, there are two `methyl` groups.\n4.  **Assign stereochemistry:** As determined in Step 4, the major product is the *Z*-isomer. To confirm, we use Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules on the double bond carbons (C2 and C3):\n    *   On C2: The `-(CH₂)-(o-Cl-C₆H₄)` group has a higher priority than the hydrogen atom.\n    *   On C3: The tert-butyl group `-C(CH₃)₃` has a higher priority than the hydrogen atom.\n    *   In the *Z*-isomer, the two higher-priority groups are on the same side of the double bond.\n5.  **Assemble the full name:** Combining all the parts, the name of the product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
