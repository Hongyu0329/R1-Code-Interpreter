The edges of the image will be smoothed. Specifically, sharp corners will be rounded off, with convex corners (points) being eroded and concave corners (dents) being filled in. Small, thin, or noisy features along the edges will be removed. As the process continues towards infinity, the boundaries between black and white regions will converge to a state of low curvature, becoming straight lines or very gentle curves. The overall effect is a geometric simplification of the shapes in the image.
