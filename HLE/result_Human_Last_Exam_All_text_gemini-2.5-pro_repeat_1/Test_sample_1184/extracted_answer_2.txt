Here is the final answer based on the detailed analysis. The residue positions correspond to the human beta-1b subunit isoform (UniProt ID P54283-1).

**1) The exact residues from the human beta-1b subunit that are hotspots for INTERACTION (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit are:**

*   **Tyr392 (Y392):** Forms a key hydrophobic stacking interaction at the bottom of the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) binding pocket.
*   **Trp441 (W441):** Forms a critical hydrogen bond with a conserved glutamine in the AID.
*   **Val490 (V490) and Ile491 (I491):** Contribute to the hydrophobic floor of the binding pocket, making essential van der Waals contacts.
*   **Glu487 (E487):** Provides electrostatic stabilization by forming a salt bridge with a conserved arginine in the AID.

These residues collectively form the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) and are essential for the physical association of the two subunits.

**2) The exact residues from the human beta-1b subunit that are hotspots for FINE-TUNING GATING PROPERTIES (gating modulation) of the alpha-1 subunit are:**

The primary hotspots for gating modulation are located in the flexible N-terminus of the beta-1b subunit, which directly influences channel opening and closing after the subunit is bound.

*   **The Proximal N-terminal Region (residues 1-27):** This entire segment is the key modulatory domain. Its presence is responsible for shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation.
*   **Specific key residues within this region include:**
    *   **Lys3 (K3)**
    *   **Lys4 (K4)**
    *   **Lys10 (K10)**

These positively charged lysine residues are critical for the modulatory effect. They are believed to interact electrostatically with the channel's gating machinery. While the binding residues listed in part (1) are necessary for modulation to occur (as they anchor the subunit), these N-terminal residues are the direct effectors of the functional fine-tuning.
