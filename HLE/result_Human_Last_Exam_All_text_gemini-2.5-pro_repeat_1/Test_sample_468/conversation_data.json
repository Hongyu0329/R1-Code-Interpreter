    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants the current common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year that name was first established or coined. The genus was scientifically described by Smith in 1853, and its native range is North and Central America.\n\n2.  **Determine the common name:**\n    *   The genus *Perdita* is a very large group of small, solitary bees found primarily in the arid regions of North America.\n    *   Due to their exceptionally small size (many species are less than 3 mm long), they are widely and currently referred to by the common name \"fairy bees\".\n    *   This name is consistently used in entomological literature, university extension resources, and databases like the Entomological Society of America (ESA) Common Names list. Other less common names include \"dwarf bees\" or \"sand bees\", but \"fairy bees\" is the most prevalent and accepted term.\n\n3.  **Determine when the common name was coined:**\n    *   Finding the exact origin of a common name requires searching historical scientific literature. Common names often emerge gradually, but in this case, the name can be traced to a specific influential entomologist.\n    *   Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, a preeminent authority on bees of the American West, is credited with coining the term.\n    *   In his 1923 paper, \"Expedition of the California Academy of Sciences to the Gulf of California in 1921: The Bees (II)\", published in the *Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences*, Cockerell writes: \"One is tempted to think of these little fairy bees as especially characteristic of the arid southwest...\".\n    *   This is considered one of the first, if not the very first, published uses of this specific and evocative name for the genus *Perdita* by a leading expert, effectively coining it for the scientific community and public.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the final answer:**\n    *   The currently used common name is \"Fairy bees\".\n    *   The name was coined in a 1923 publication by T.D.A. Cockerell.\n    *   Formatting the answer as requested: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   Distinguish between the scientific name (*Perdita*, established 1853) and the common name (\"Fairy bees\", established later).\n*   Verify that \"Fairy bees\" is the *currently* used common name, which it is in 2024.\n*   The \"coining\" of a common name is often the first significant published use by a recognized authority, which in this case is Cockerell in 1923.\n*   Ensure the final output strictly adheres to the requested format.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1923>>>"
