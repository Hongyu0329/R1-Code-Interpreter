    "This question requires a metrical analysis (scansion) of a line of Latin poetry from Plautus. The meter is the iambic senarius, which consists of six iambic feet. Plautine meter is known for its flexibility and frequent use of substitutions.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Preliminary Analysis and Syllabification**\n\nThe line is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n*   **Meter**: The line is an iambic senarius, the common meter for dialogue in Plautine comedy. The basic pattern is six iambs (S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L), but with many allowed substitutions.\n*   **Elision vs. Hiatus**: The word `bene` ends with a vowel, and `esse` begins with one. Elision (`ben' esse`) is possible. However, Plautus often uses hiatus (leaving the vowels as separate syllables), especially at a metrical break (caesura or dieresis). We will test the hiatus option as it often produces a smoother scansion in Plautine verse.\n*   **Syllabification (with Hiatus)**:\n    `et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`\n    This gives a total of 15 syllables.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Scansion (Working from both ends)**\n\nWe will determine the quantity (Long or Short) of each syllable and group them into six feet.\n\n*   **Foot 6 (the final foot):**\n    *   Syllables: `ma-le`\n    *   `ma-`: The 'a' is naturally short, and it's in an open syllable (followed by one consonant). It is **S**.\n    *   `-le`: The final syllable of a hexameter or senarius line is *anceps* (can be long or short to fit the meter). The iambic pattern requires a long syllable here. So, we scan it as **L**.\n    *   **Foot 6 is an Iamb (S L)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5:**\n    *   Syllables: `si-bi sit`\n    *   `si-`: The 'i' in `sibi` is short. **S**.\n    *   `-bi`: The second 'i' in `sibi` is also short. **S**.\n    *   `sit`: The 'i' is short, but it is followed by two consonants ('t' from `sit` and 'm' from the next word `male`). This makes the syllable long by position. **L**.\n    *   **Foot 5 is an Anapest (S S L)**, a common substitution for an iamb.\n\n*   **Foot 1 (the first foot):**\n    *   Syllables: `et ti-bi be-`\n    *   `et`: This monosyllable, though normally long by position, is very frequently scanned as **S** in comedy.\n    *   `ti-`: Short 'i'. **S**.\n    *   `-bi`: Short 'i'. **S**.\n    *   `be-`: The first syllable of `bene`. Short 'e'. **S**.\n    *   **Foot 1 is a Proceleusmatic (S S S S)**, a resolution of a spondee, which is a valid substitution in the first foot.\n\n*   **Foot 2:**\n    *   This foot begins after the dieresis (foot-break) where we assumed a hiatus.\n    *   Syllables: `-ne es-`\n    *   `-ne`: The second syllable of `bene`. Short 'e'. **S**.\n    *   `es-`: The first syllable of `esse`. The vowel 'e' is followed by 'ss', making it long by position. **L**.\n    *   **Foot 2 is an Iamb (S L)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3:**\n    *   Syllables: `-se so-`\n    *   `-se`: The second syllable of `esse`. The final 'e' of an infinitive is short. It is followed by a single consonant 's' from `soli`. **S**.\n    *   `so-`: The first syllable of `soli`. The 'o' in `solus` is naturally long. **L**.\n    *   **Foot 3 is an Iamb (S L)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4:**\n    *   Syllables: `-li quom`\n    *   `-li`: The second syllable of `soli`. The dative ending `-i` is long. **L**.\n    *   `quom`: The vowel 'o' is followed by two consonants ('m' from `quom` and 's' from `sibi`). This makes it long by position. **L**.\n    *   **Foot 4 is a Spondee (L L)**. A spondee in an even-numbered foot (2, 4) is not allowed in strict classical iambics but is a feature of the more flexible Plautine style.\n\n**3. Final Assembled Scansion**\n\nPutting the six feet together:\n*   Foot 1: `et tibi be-` -> **S S S S**\n*   Foot 2: `-ne es-` -> **S L**\n*   Foot 3: `-se so-` -> **S L**\n*   Foot 4: `-li quom` -> **L L**\n*   Foot 5: `sibi sit` -> **S S L**\n*   Foot 6: `male` -> **S L**\n\nThe final scansion, with spaces between the feet, is:\n\n<<<S S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
