    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\"**: This is the crucial part. It implies a specific, identifiable point in time, not just the oldest evidence of writing or a calendar.\n    *   **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact.\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a script native to the Americas, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec script, or Epi-Olmec script.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Calendar Systems:**\n    To record a specific, non-repeating date over a long period, a civilization needs more than a simple ritual or solar calendar. In Mesoamerica, two calendar systems were often used together:\n    *   **260-day Ritual Calendar (Tzolk'in in Maya):** A repeating cycle of 260 days. A date like \"7 Deer\" is a valid calendrical notation, but it repeats every 260 days, so by itself, it does not mark a unique historical moment.\n    *   **365-day Solar Calendar (Haab' in Maya):** A repeating cycle that approximates the solar year.\n    *   **The Long Count:** This is the key system for this question. It is a non-repeating, linear calendar that counts the number of days from a mythological starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). A Long Count date pinpoints a single, unique day in history, making it an absolute chronological record. The earliest recorded specific dates are therefore found using this system.\n\n3.  **Examine the Earliest Evidence of Calendrics (but not specific dates):**\n    *   **San José Mogote (Oaxaca, Zapotec culture):** Monument 3, dated archaeologically to around 600 BCE, bears a glyph interpreted as \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day calendar. This is considered the earliest evidence of a calendrical name written in Mesoamerica. However, it's a repeating date, not a unique historical anchor point.\n    *   **San Bartolo (Guatemala, Maya culture):** Recently discovered painted murals and fragments dated between 300 and 200 BCE show the date \"7 Deer,\" also from the 260-day calendar. Like the San José Mogote example, this is extremely early but not a specific, non-repeating date.\n\n4.  **Survey the Earliest *Long Count* Dates:**\n    Since the Long Count is the only system that provides a unique, non-repeating date, we must look for the earliest artifact with a Long Count inscription. Several artifacts are contenders:\n    *   **Tikal Stela 29 (Maya):** For a long time, this was the earliest known Maya artifact with a Long Count date. It records the date **8.12.14.8.15**, which correlates to **July 6, 292 CE**.\n    *   **La Mojarra Stela 1 (Epi-Olmec):** This monument, written in the Isthmian or Epi-Olmec script, contains two Long Count dates. The earlier one is **8.5.3.3.5**, which correlates to **May 21, 143 CE**. This is significantly earlier than the Tikal stela.\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette (Epi-Olmec):** This small greenstone figure also has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which correlates to **March 14, 162 CE**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Oldest Long Count Date:**\n    The earliest of all known Long Count dates is found on another monument from the Epi-Olmec (or transitional Olmec) culture.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec):** This stone monument was discovered in pieces. The back of the stela is inscribed with a Long Count date. After years of debate about the first number (the *baktun*), the consensus is that the date reads **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Correlation:** This Long Count date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n### Conclusion of Careful Points\n\n*   It is essential to distinguish between the earliest *evidence of a calendar* (which are repeating dates from the 260-day cycle found at sites like San José Mogote) and the earliest *recorded specific date* (which requires the non-repeating Long Count).\n*   The Long Count system was not invented by the Maya but likely by the Olmec or their successors, the Epi-Olmecs, who recorded the earliest known dates using it.\n*   The artifact holding the record is Tres Zapotes Stela C, and the culture is Epi-Olmec, located in the Veracruz region of Mexico.\n*   The date, 32 BCE, is the current scholarly consensus for the earliest unambiguous, absolute date recorded in a native American writing system.\n\n***\n\nThe earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is found on **Tres Zapotes Stela C**. The date is written in the Epi-Olmec script using the Long Count calendar system. The inscribed date is **7.16.6.16.18**, which correlates to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\n<<<September 3, 32 BCE>>>"
