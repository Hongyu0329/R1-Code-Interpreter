    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the equation and identify the genus.**\n\nThe given curve is $C: y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $d=5$. The genus $g$ of the curve is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\nTo analyze the reduction at $p=2$, we work over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The initial reduction of the equation modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is a non-reduced double line, indicating that the given model is not suitable for determining the stable reduction.\n\n**Step 2: Find a better model through a change of variables.**\n\nWe perform a change of variables to find a better model whose special fiber is easier to analyze. Let's make the transformation $x = X/2$ and $y=Y/4$. Note that this is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n$(Y/4)^2 = 8(X/2)^5 + 4(X/2)^4 + 4(X/2)^3 + (X/2)^2 + 8(X/2)$\n$Y^2/16 = 8X^5/32 + 4X^4/16 + 4X^3/8 + X^2/4 + 8X/2$\n$Y^2/16 = X^5/4 + X^4/4 + X^3/2 + X^2/4 + 4X$\nMultiplying by 16, we get an equation with integer coefficients:\n$Y^2 = 4X^5 + 4X^4 + 8X^3 + 4X^2 + 64X$.\nThis model is not minimal, as all coefficients are divisible by 4. Let's make a different change of variable. Let $Y' = Y/2$.\n$(Y')^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$.\nLet $F(X) = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$. The curve $C'$ given by $(Y')^2 = F(X)$ is isomorphic to the original curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ and thus has the same stable reduction. This equation for $C'$ gives a model over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.**\n\nWe reduce the equation $(Y')^2 = F(X)$ modulo 2.\n$(Y')^2 \\equiv X^5 + X^4 + X^2 \\pmod 2$\n$(Y')^2 \\equiv X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1) \\pmod 2$.\nLet's call the special fiber $C'_s$. The polynomial $k(X) = X^3 + X^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since it has no roots in $\\mathbb{F}_2}$ ($k(0)=1, k(1)=1$).\nThe special fiber $C'_s$ is a plane quartic curve. It is singular where its partial derivatives vanish.\nThe equation is $G(X, Y') = (Y')^2 - X^2(X^3+X^2+1)=0$.\n$\\partial G/\\partial Y' = 2Y' \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n$\\partial G/\\partial X = - (5X^4+4X^3+2X) \\equiv -X^4 \\pmod 2$.\nSingular points must have $X=0$. If $X=0$, then $(Y')^2=0$, so $Y'=0$. The only singular point on the affine curve is $(0,0)$.\nThe tangent cone at $(0,0)$ is given by the lowest degree terms of the equation, which are $(Y')^2 - X^2 = 0$. Over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $(Y'-X)^2=0$. This indicates that the singularity is a cusp.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the special fiber to the stable reduction.**\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a stable curve of the same genus as the original curve. A stable curve is a reduced, connected curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\nOur model has a special fiber with a cusp, so it is not the stable reduction. The stable reduction is obtained by resolving this singularity.\nThe structure of the stable reduction is determined by the branch points of the curve. The branch points of the map $(X,Y') \\to X$ are the roots of $F(X)$ and the point at infinity.\nLet's analyze the roots of $F(X)=X(X^4+X^3+2X^2+X+16)$.\nLet $h(X) = X^4+X^3+2X^2+X+16$. Modulo 2, $\\bar{h}(X) = X^4+X^3+X = X(X^3+X^2+1)$.\nThe roots of $\\bar{h}(X)$ are $0$ and the three distinct roots of the irreducible polynomial $X^3+X^2+1$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_8$.\nSo the roots of $\\bar{F}(X) = X^2(X^3+X^2+1)$ are $0$ (with multiplicity 2) and three other distinct simple roots.\nThe branch points of the map from the curve to the projective line consist of the 5 roots of $F(X)$ and the point at infinity.\nLet the roots of $F(X)$ be $R_1, \\dots, R_5$. From the reduction, we see that two of these roots reduce to $0 \\pmod 2$, while the other three reduce to three distinct non-zero values. Let's say $R_1, R_2$ reduce to 0.\n\nThe coalescence of branch points in the special fiber corresponds to the formation of nodes in the stable reduction. A general principle states that when a pair of branch points of a hyperelliptic cover come together, the stable model of the curve develops a \"handle\" in the form of a rational component attached at two points, creating two nodes.\nMore formally, the stable reduction consists of two components:\n1.  An elliptic curve $E$, which is the normalization of the main component $Y^2=k(X)$. This corresponds to the four branch points that remain distinct (the three simple roots of $\\bar{h}$ and $\\infty$).\n2.  A rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$), which arises from resolving the coalescence of the two branch points that reduce to 0.\n\nFor the final curve to be stable and have genus 2, these two components must intersect.\nLet the components be $C_1$ (elliptic, $g=1$) and $C_2$ (rational, $g=0$). The arithmetic genus of their union is $p_a(C_1 \\cup C_2) = g(C_1) + g(C_2) + (\\text{number of intersection points}) - 1$.\nTo match the genus of the generic fiber, we need $p_a = 2$.\n$2 = 1 + 0 + i - 1$, where $i$ is the number of intersection points.\nThis gives $i=2$.\nThe two components must intersect at two points. Each of these intersection points is an ordinary double point (a node) on the stable reduction.\nTherefore, the stable reduction has 2 double points.\n\nAnother way to see this is by analyzing the singularity of the special fiber $C'_s: (Y')^2 = X^2(X^3 + X^2 + 1)$.\nThe arithmetic genus of this plane quartic is $p_a(C'_s) = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$.\nThe normalization of $C'_s$ is the curve $v^2 = X^3+X^2+1$, where $v=Y'/X$. This is a smooth elliptic curve, so its genus is $p_g(C'_s) = 1$.\nThe sum of the delta invariants of the singularities is $\\delta_{sing} = p_a(C'_s) - p_g(C'_s) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nSince there is only one singular point (the cusp at $(0,0)$), its delta invariant is 2. The delta invariant of a singularity measures the number of nodes \"hidden\" within it. The resolution of this singularity will contribute 2 nodes to the stable model.\n\nFinal check: The fact that the reduction of the polynomial $F(X)$ has exactly one root of multiplicity 2 and all other roots are simple leads to a stable reduction with two nodes.\n\n<<<2>>>"
