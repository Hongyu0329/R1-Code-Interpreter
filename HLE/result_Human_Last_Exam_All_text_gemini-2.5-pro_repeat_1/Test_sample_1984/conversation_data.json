    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the differential equation and the objective.**\n    The given autonomous ordinary differential equation is:\n    $$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\n    We are asked to find the number of stable equilibrium points, denoted by $m$, and then compute the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n2.  **Find the equilibrium points.**\n    Equilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n    $$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\n    We can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n    $$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n    The quadratic term in the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    $$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\n    The solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n    $x_1 = 0$\n    $x_2 = 1$ (This is a root of multiplicity 2).\n\n3.  **Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n    The stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$ can be determined by examining the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$, at that point.\n    First, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n    $$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\n    *   **Stability of $x_1 = 0$:**\n        Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n        $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n        Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n    *   **Stability of $x_2 = 1$:**\n        Evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n        $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n        Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n        -   For a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(0.9) = -(0.9)(0.9-1)^2 = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves to the left, away from $x=1$.\n        -   For a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$), $x$ is positive and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(1.1) = -(1.1)(1.1-1)^2 = -(\\text{positive})(\\text{positive}) < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, the solution moves to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\n    A phase line diagram for $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ summarizes this:\n    -   For $x < 0$, $f(x) > 0$ (arrow points right $\\rightarrow$).\n    -   For $0 < x < 1$, $f(x) < 0$ (arrow points left $\\leftarrow$).\n    -   For $x > 1$, $f(x) < 0$ (arrow points left $\\leftarrow$).\n\n    Phase line: `---> (0) <--- (1) <---`\n\n    From the phase line, we can see that trajectories near $x=0$ move towards $x=0$, confirming it is a **stable** equilibrium. For $x=1$, trajectories from the right move towards it, but trajectories from the left move away from it. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable**. A semi-stable equilibrium is not considered stable.\n\n4.  **Count the number of stable equilibria.**\n    Based on the analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point: $x=0$.\n    Therefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final expression.**\n    The problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n    Substituting $m=1$:\n    $$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**List of careful points:**\n\n*   **Equilibrium Points:** Ensure all roots of $f(x)=0$ are found. Factoring is crucial here.\n*   **Stability Definition:** Understand that \"stable\" typically refers to asymptotically stable equilibrium points. An equilibrium is stable if trajectories starting from all nearby points converge to it.\n*   **Inconclusive Test:** Recognize that when $f'(x_0)=0$, the first-derivative test for stability is inconclusive. An alternative method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around $x_0$ (phase line analysis), is necessary.\n*   **Semi-stable Points:** Correctly classify points like $x=1$ as semi-stable and understand that they are not considered stable equilibria.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer:**\nThe analysis shows that there is only one stable equilibrium point at $x=0$. Thus, $m=1$. The required expression is $m - 2^{4048}$, which evaluates to $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
