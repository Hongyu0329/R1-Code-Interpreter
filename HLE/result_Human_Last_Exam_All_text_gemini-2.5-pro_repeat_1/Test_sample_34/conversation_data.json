    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most powerful pre-flop position because you are guaranteed to act last on all subsequent streets (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably.\n    *   **Action:** Opening to 2.5x. This is a standard raise size.\n    *   **Key Condition:** Rake-free. This is a critical detail. In a normal game, the house takes a percentage of the pot (the rake), meaning you have to win not only against your opponents but also enough to cover the rake. In a rake-free environment, any hand that is even marginally profitable (+0.01 BB) becomes a correct open. This dramatically widens opening ranges compared to a raked game.\n    *   **Hand in Question:** We need to find the \"worst suited jack\" (JXs) that is still a standard, profitable open-raise in this specific scenario.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Suited Jacks (JXs):**\n    *   A hand's pre-flop value comes from several factors: high-card strength, flush potential, and straight potential.\n    *   **High-Card Strength:** All suited jacks share the same high card, the Jack. This gives them the ability to make a strong top pair.\n    *   **Flush Potential:** All suited hands have significantly more equity (around 2-4% more) and playability than their offsuit counterparts because they can make flushes, which are very strong hands. All JXs hands share this benefit equally.\n    *   **Straight Potential (Connectivity):** This is the primary factor that differentiates the suited jacks from each other. The closer the second card is to the Jack, the more straight draws and made straights the hand can form.\n\n3.  **Ranking the Suited Jacks:**\n    *   **JTs:** The best suited jack. It's a strong connector that can make the nut straight (T-J-Q-K-A).\n    *   **J9s:** A one-gap connector. Still very strong with lots of straight possibilities.\n    *   **J8s, J7s, etc.:** As the gap between the Jack and the kicker widens, the straight potential decreases, making the hand weaker.\n    *   **J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited jacks. They have very poor connectivity to the Jack. For example, J2s can only make a straight using both cards if the board is A-3-4-5 (a wheel). Its straight potential is minimal.\n\n4.  **Determining the \"Worst\" Hand That Should Be Opened:**\n    *   Given the powerful combination of being on the button and in a rake-free game, the optimal opening range is extremely wide.\n    *   Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers for this scenario show that from the button, it is correct to raise *any two suited cards*. The combination of positional advantage and the potential to make a flush (a disguised, strong hand) makes even the weakest suited hands like 72s and 32s profitable opens.\n    *   Since it is correct to open *all* suited hands in this situation, we must find the weakest hand within the \"suited jack\" category.\n    *   Based on the ranking in the previous step, the hand with the least connectivity and therefore the lowest overall equity and playability among all suited jacks is **J2s**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   All suited jacks, from JTs down to J2s, are profitable open-raises from the button in a 100BB rake-free game.\n    *   The \"worst\" of these hands is the one with the least straight potential.\n    *   J2s is the least connected and therefore the weakest hand in the JXs family.\n    *   Therefore, J2s is the worst suited jack you should open from the button in this scenario.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
