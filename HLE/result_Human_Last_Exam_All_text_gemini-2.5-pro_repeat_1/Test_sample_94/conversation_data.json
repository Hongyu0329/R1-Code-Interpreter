    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the identity of a specific physicist. Let's break down the clues provided:\n    *   **Clue 1: Physicist's Field:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n    *   **Clue 2: Discovery:** They \"discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\"\n    *   **Clue 3: Origin Story:** The effect was first \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n\n    *   **Clue 3: The Custodial Worker and Concave Mirrors:** This is a very specific historical anecdote. Research into the history of optics reveals this story is most famously associated with the French physicist **Léon Foucault**. Around 1858, while polishing a concave glass mirror for a telescope, a worker's hand or cleaning cloth near the mirror's focus caused shadows that revealed subtle imperfections on the mirror's surface. This observation led Foucault to develop the \"Foucault knife-edge test,\" a highly sensitive method for detecting flaws in optical surfaces by analyzing the real image they produce.\n\n    *   **Clue 2: The Optical Effect:** The effect observed is the visualization of phase objects. These are transparent features (like imperfections in glass, or currents in the air) that do not absorb or scatter light, but instead slightly change its phase. The knife-edge test converts these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness (amplitude). This is an effect seen in a \"real image\" formed by the concave mirror.\n\n    *   **Clue 1: The Physicist's Field (Microscopy):** Now we must connect this to microscopy. Léon Foucault was a brilliant physicist, but he is primarily known for the Foucault pendulum (demonstrating the Earth's rotation), measuring the speed of light, and his work on large-scale optics like telescopes. He is *not* \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This suggests Foucault is not the final answer, but his discovery is a critical part of the puzzle.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Find the Connection:**\n\n    *   The principle Foucault used—visualizing transparent phase objects by manipulating the light path—is the key. We need to find a physicist who applied this same fundamental principle to the field of microscopy.\n    *   This leads us to the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**. In the 1930s, Zernike was working to improve microscopes. He realized that transparent biological specimens, like living cells, are phase objects. They are nearly invisible under a standard microscope because they don't absorb much light, but they do alter the phase of the light passing through them.\n    *   Zernike developed a method, called the **phase contrast method**, which uses a \"phase plate\" in the microscope to convert these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness, just as Foucault's knife-edge did on a larger scale. This invention revolutionized biology by allowing scientists to study living cells without staining (and thus killing) them.\n    *   For this breakthrough, Frits Zernike was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 and is celebrated as a pivotal figure in the history of microscopy.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n\n    The question cleverly links two historical events. The initial observation (custodian, concave mirror) is tied to **Léon Foucault**. However, the physicist who is \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" and who discovered a related optical effect for that field is **Frits Zernike**. Zernike's discovery of phase contrast microscopy built upon the same physical principles revealed by Foucault's earlier work. Therefore, Zernike is the physicist who fits all parts of the description.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The question is constructed to be a two-step problem. A direct search for a microscopy expert discovered something seen by a janitor might be confusing.\n*   One must first identify the story of the janitor (leading to Foucault) and then identify the microscopy expert whose work is based on the same principle (leading to Zernike).\n*   The phrase \"better known for work in the microscopy field\" is the primary filter that eliminates Foucault and points directly to Zernike.\n*   The phrase \"after it was accidentally observed\" correctly describes the timeline: Zernike's work in the 1930s came long after Foucault's work in the 1850s, which in turn came after the initial accidental observation.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
