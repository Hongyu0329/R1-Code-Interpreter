    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Material:** \"free-standing boron nanosheets\". This refers to single- or few-layer sheets of boron, also known as borophene. \"Free-standing\" implies the material is isolated and not influenced by a substrate, simplifying the analysis to its intrinsic properties.\n    *   **Excitation:** \"excited by incident light\". This is the energy input, typically from a laser pump beam.\n    *   **Phenomenon:** \"spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC)\". This is the core physical process we need to evaluate.\n\n2.  **Define Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC):**\n    *   SPDC is a quantum optical process that originates from a material's **second-order nonlinear optical response**.\n    *   In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, passing through a suitable nonlinear material, is spontaneously converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, called the \"signal\" and \"idler\".\n    *   The fundamental requirement for a material to facilitate SPDC is that it must possess a significant **second-order nonlinear susceptibility**, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Condition for a Non-Zero $\\chi^{(2)}$:**\n    *   The second-order susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ is a material property that is directly tied to its crystal symmetry.\n    *   A fundamental selection rule in nonlinear optics states that for a material to have a non-zero **bulk electric-dipole $\\chi^{(2)}$**, it must lack a center of inversion. In other words, the material's crystal structure must be **non-centrosymmetric**.\n    *   If a material is centrosymmetric (possesses a center of inversion), its bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, and thus it cannot support second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Crystal Structure and Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:**\n    *   Boron nanosheets (borophene) are known to be polymorphic, meaning they can form different stable crystal structures.\n    *   The most widely studied phases, which have also been synthesized on substrates, include the $\\beta_{12}$-sheet, the $\\chi_3$-sheet, and various \"striped\" phases.\n    *   The crucial step is to examine the symmetry of these ideal, 2D crystal lattices. All of these common phases of borophene ($\\beta_{12}$, $\\chi_3$, etc.) belong to space groups that **possess a center of inversion**. They are **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   For example, the ideal $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3}$ borophene sheets have an orthorhombic lattice with *Pmmn* space group symmetry, which is centrosymmetric.\n\n5.  **Draw the Primary Conclusion:**\n    *   Since the ideal crystal structures of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is, by symmetry, equal to zero.\n    *   Because a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ is a prerequisite for SPDC, ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets would **not be expected** to exhibit this phenomenon. This places borophene in the same category as graphene, another centrosymmetric 2D material that does not intrinsically exhibit SPDC.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\nWhile the conclusion based on the ideal structure is \"No\", it is important to consider factors in real-world samples that could alter this expectation:\n\n1.  **Symmetry Breaking:** The \"no SPDC\" rule relies on perfect inversion symmetry. In a real sample, this symmetry can be broken.\n    *   **Corrugation/Buckling:** To be stable in a free-standing form, 2D materials often exhibit out-of-plane buckling or wrinkling. If this buckling is asymmetric (i.e., the structure looks different from the top versus the bottom), it would break the inversion symmetry and could induce a small, non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n    *   **Defects and Edges:** Point defects, grain boundaries, and the edges of the nanosheet are all regions where the perfect crystal symmetry is broken. These could act as local sources for a weak nonlinear response.\n    *   **External Fields or Strain:** Applying a strong external DC electric field or asymmetric strain can artificially break the inversion symmetry of the lattice, inducing a $\\chi^{(2)}$ response. However, this is an *induced* effect, not an *intrinsic* property of the unperturbed material.\n\n2.  **Higher-Order Contributions:** In centrosymmetric materials, extremely weak second-order nonlinear effects can arise from electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole interactions. These are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole $\\chi^{(2)}$ in a non-centrosymmetric crystal and are generally considered negligible for practical applications like SPDC.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the intrinsic crystal symmetry of the material, the expectation is that SPDC will not occur.\n\n*   **Question:** When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\n*   **Analysis:** SPDC requires a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). This property is forbidden by symmetry in materials with a center of inversion. The ideal crystal structures of all common borophene phases are centrosymmetric.\n*   **Answer:** Therefore, based on their fundamental material properties, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. While real-world imperfections or external fields could potentially induce a very weak effect, it is not an intrinsic or expected characteristic of the material.\n\n<<<No>>>"
