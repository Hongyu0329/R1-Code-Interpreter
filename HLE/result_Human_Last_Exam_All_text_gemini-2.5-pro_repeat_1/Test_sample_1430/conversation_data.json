    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the geometric objects and their relationship.**\n*   C is a compact Riemann surface of genus $g=3$.\n*   X is the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as $X = C^{(15)}$. This is the variety parametrizing effective divisors of degree 15 on C.\n*   $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of C, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g=3$. It parametrizes line bundles of degree 0 on C.\n*   The Neron-Severi group, $NS(V)$, of a variety V is the group of divisor classes modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, $\\rho(V)$, is also known as the Picard number.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to the Neron-Severi group of J(C).**\nThere is a natural map, the Abel-Jacobi map, $u: X = C^{(15)} \\to \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$, which sends an effective divisor $D$ to its corresponding line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$. The variety $\\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ is a torsor for $J(C)$, and is isomorphic to $J(C)$ as a complex manifold.\n\nThe fiber of this map over a line bundle $L \\in \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ is the projective space of the global sections of L, i.e., $u^{-1}(L) = \\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$. We need to determine the dimension of this fiber.\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem for a curve C of genus $g$:\n$\\dim H^0(C, L) - \\dim H^1(C, L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1$.\nIn our case, $\\deg(L) = 15$ and $g=3$, so:\n$\\dim H^0(C, L) - \\dim H^1(C, L) = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\n\nBy Serre duality, $\\dim H^1(C, L) = \\dim H^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1})$, where $K_C$ is the canonical bundle of C. The degree of the canonical bundle is $\\deg(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\nThe degree of the bundle $K_C \\otimes L^{-1}$ is $\\deg(K_C) - \\deg(L) = 4 - 15 = -11$.\nSince the degree is negative, a generic line bundle of this degree has no global sections. In fact, for any effective divisor $L$, $K_C \\otimes L^{-1}$ cannot be effective, so $H^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1}) = \\{0\\}$.\nThus, $\\dim H^1(C, L) = 0$ for all $L \\in \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$.\n\nThis implies that $\\dim H^0(C, L) = 13$ for all line bundles L of degree 15. The dimension of the fiber $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$ is therefore constant and equal to $\\dim H^0(C, L) - 1 = 12$.\nThis means that the map $u: C^{(15)} \\to J(C)$ is a projective space bundle, specifically a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle.\n\nFor any projective space bundle $\\pi: P \\to B$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the total space P is related to that of the base B by the formula:\n$\\rho(P) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nApplying this to our situation ($P=X=C^{(15)}$, $B=J(C)$), we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the range of possible ranks for the Neron-Severi group of J(C).**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ as C ranges over all genus 3 curves.\nFor any abelian variety A of dimension g, the rank of its Neron-Severi group is bounded by:\n$1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$.\nFor $J(C)$, we have $g=3$, so the bounds are:\n$1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest possible rank of NS(X).**\nThe smallest possible rank, $\\rho(J(C))=1$, is achieved for a \"very general\" curve C. In this case, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has no complex multiplication, meaning its endomorphism ring is just $\\text{End}(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The Neron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\nSo, the minimum value for the rank is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the largest possible rank of NS(X).**\nThe largest possible rank, $\\rho(J(C))=9$, is achieved for a very special curve C, one whose Jacobian has the maximum possible number of endomorphisms (i.e., it is of CM type). This occurs when $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of three mutually isogenous elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\nAn example of such a curve is the Fermat quartic curve, $F: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a smooth plane quartic, so its genus is $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. Its Jacobian, $J(F)$, is isogenous to the product $E \\times E \\times E$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$ which has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nFor such a Jacobian $A \\sim E^3$, its Neron-Severi group corresponds to the space of symmetric endomorphisms with respect to the Rosati involution. The endomorphism algebra $\\text{End}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(A)$ is the matrix algebra $M_3(\\text{End}_{\\mathbb{Q}}(E)) = M_3(\\mathbb{Q}(i))$. The Rosati involution on this algebra is the conjugate transpose map. The rank of the Neron-Severi group is the dimension of the space of Hermitian matrices over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$, which is $g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\nSo, the maximum value for the rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\nTherefore, the largest possible rank of $NS(X)$ is:\n$\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
