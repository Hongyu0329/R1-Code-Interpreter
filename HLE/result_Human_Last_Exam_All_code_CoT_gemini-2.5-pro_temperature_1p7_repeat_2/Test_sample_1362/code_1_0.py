    A curve y^2 = f(x) has good reduction at an odd prime p if the polynomial
    f(x) when considered over the finite field F_p (by reducing its
    coefficients mod p) is separable, i.e., has no multiple roots.
    A polynomial g is separable if and only if gcd(g, g') = 1, where g' is the
    derivative of g.

    This script programmatically checks this condition for each curve.
