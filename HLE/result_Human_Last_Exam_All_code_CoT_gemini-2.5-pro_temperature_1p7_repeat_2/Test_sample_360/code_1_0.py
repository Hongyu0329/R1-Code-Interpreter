# Step 1: Define the problem and identify the resulting complex.
# The reaction between cis-[Ru(bpy)2(Cl)2] and dptt forms [Ru(bpy)(dptt)]2+.
# We need to find the number of isomers for this octahedral complex.

# Step 2: Analyze the possible geometric arrangements.
# A tetradentate (dptt) and a bidentate (bpy) ligand are coordinated.
# The bpy ligand must occupy two cis positions. This rules out a planar 'trans'
# coordination for the dptt ligand. Dptt must fold in a 'cis' conformation.

# Step 3: Count the number of sterically feasible geometric isomers.
# The dptt ligand is structurally rigid. Analysis of its potential binding modes
# (e.g., cis-alpha, cis-beta) and the distances between its donor atoms shows
# that only one geometric arrangement is sterically favorable.
num_geometric_isomers = 1
print(f"Number of stable geometric isomers found: {num_geometric_isomers}")

# Step 4: Analyze the symmetry of the resulting geometric isomer.
# The single stable geometric isomer of [Ru(bpy)(dptt)]2+ has no symmetry elements
# (point group C1), which means it is chiral.
# A chiral molecule exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
num_stereoisomers_per_geometric = 2  # (one pair of enantiomers, labeled delta and lambda)
print(f"Number of stereoisomers for each geometric isomer (due to chirality): {num_stereoisomers_per_geometric}")

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of isomers formed.
# Total Isomers = (Number of Geometric Isomers) * (Number of Stereoisomers per Geometric Isomer)
total_isomers = num_geometric_isomers * num_stereoisomers_per_geometric

# Final equation output
print("\nThe final calculation is:")
print(f"{num_geometric_isomers} (geometric isomer) * {num_stereoisomers_per_geometric} (enantiomers) = {total_isomers} (total isomers)")

print(f"\nThus, there are {total_isomers} isomers formed in total (one pair of enantiomers).")
