    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The central part of the molecule is a benzene ring substituted at all six positions. The naming `1,3,5-tri[...]` and `2,4,6-trimethyl` indicates a high degree of symmetry. Specifically, the molecule has a C3 rotational axis passing through the center of the benzene ring. This means the three large substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent to each other. Likewise, the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are also chemically equivalent. We only need to count the number of distinct proton signals in one of the three identical repeating units. The entire molecule belongs to the C3 point group, which is chiral.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:**\n    *   The three methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the benzene ring at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. These 9 protons will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Signals = 1**\n\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linker (-CH2-):**\n    *   There are three methylene (-CH2-) groups linking the central ring to the indazole units. These three CH2 groups are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   Let's consider one CH2 group. It is bonded to a chiral moiety (the camphor-indazole part). Protons on a CH2 group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts.\n    *   Therefore, the two protons on each linker CH2 group are distinct, giving rise to two separate signals.\n    *   **Signals = 2**\n\n4.  **Count Signals from the Camphor-Indazole Moiety:**\n    *   The three camphor-indazole units are equivalent. We need to analyze just one of them. This unit is formally named `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. It is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system.\n    *   **C3-H:** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring portion. This is a unique environment. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C4-H:** This is a bridgehead proton, part of a stereocenter (4S). It is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C5-H2:** These two protons are part of the bicyclic ring. They are diastereotopic (one is 'endo', one is 'exo') due to the rigid, asymmetric structure. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C6-H2:** Similar to the C5 protons, these two protons are also diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C7-CH3:** The methyl group is attached to the C7 bridgehead, which is a stereocenter (7R). This methyl group is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C8-(CH3)2:** This is a gem-dimethyl group. The two methyl groups are diastereotopic because they are attached to a carbon (C8) adjacent to a stereocenter (C7). They are in different environments relative to the rest of the chiral molecule. **(2 signals)**\n    *   Total signals from one camphor-indazole unit = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = **9 signals**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Number of Peaks:**\n    *   Summing the signals from all the unique parts gives the total number of expected peaks.\n    *   Total Peaks = (Core Methyls) + (Linker CH2) + (Camphor-Indazole unit)\n    *   Total Peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n    Analysis Steps:\n    1.  Symmetry: The molecule has C3 rotational symmetry. This means the 3 main substituent arms are equivalent,\n        and the 3 methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent. We analyze 1/3 of the molecule.\n    2.  Central Core (2,4,6-trimethylbenzene part): The three methyl groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n    3.  Linker (-CH2-): The three linker groups are equivalent. The two protons on each linker are diastereotopic\n        because they are adjacent to a chiral center, making them non-equivalent.\n    4.
