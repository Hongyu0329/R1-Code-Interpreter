    "An adjunction from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that satisfy the condition $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis relationship is equivalent to a more specific set of properties for the maps $L$ and $R$. An order-preserving map between two finite lattices, such as $[m]$ and $[n]$, has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema).\nFor a map $L: [m] \\to [n]$, preserving joins means:\n1.  For any non-empty set of elements in $[m]$, the image of their maximum is the maximum of their images. This is automatically satisfied by any order-preserving map on a linear order.\n2.  The map must preserve the join of the empty set. The join of the empty set is the bottom element. In $[k]$, the bottom element is $0$. Thus, we must have $L(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, an adjunction is uniquely determined by an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$. Any such map $L$ has a unique right adjoint $R$. Therefore, our task is to count the number of such maps $L$ for $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving sequences $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$, with the additional constraint that $L(0)=0$.\n\nThis simplifies to counting the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 values (for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set of $38$ possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, with replacement, and order does not matter (as they will be sorted into a non-decreasing sequence).\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $N$ items with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $N=38$ (the number of available options).\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAn alternative way to get to the formula is to let $m=23$ and $n=37$. We are counting non-decreasing sequences $y_1, \\dots, y_m$ where each $y_i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n\\}$. The general formula for this is $\\binom{n+m}{m}$. Plugging in our values gives $\\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category Delta\n    from [23] to [37].\n    \"\"\"\n    # The source object is [m]\n    m = 23\n    # The target object is [n]\n    n = 37\n\n    # The number of adjunctions from [m] to [n] is given by the number of\n    # order-preserving maps L: [m] -> [n] such that L(0) = 0.\n    # This is equivalent to choosing m numbers from {0, 1, ..., n} with replacement,\n    # which is a stars-and-bars problem.\n    # The formula is C(n + m, m).\n    \n    # Calculate the result using math.comb\n    result = math.comb(n + m, m)\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all its components\n    print(f\"The number of adjunctions from [{m}] to [{n}] is given by the binomial coefficient:\")\n    print(f\"C({n} + {m}, {m}) = C({n + m}, {m}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<46376342894541760>>>"
