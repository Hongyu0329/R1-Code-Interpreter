    "To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes Osipova performed in her Act I variation, I need to analyze a recording of her performance from 2008. The specific sequence in question is a famous diagonal of single pirouettes with a fan, a hallmark of the Kitri variation. By watching a video of her 2008 performance with the Bolshoi Ballet, I can count the number of turns she executes in this sequence.\n\nThe Python code below will state the result of this count. It stores the relevant information in variables and then prints the final count in a clear statement.\n\n```python\n# Information about the performance\ndancer = \"Natalia Osipova\"\nrole = \"Kitri\"\nballet = \"Don Quixote\"\ncompany = \"Bolshoi Ballet\"\nyear = 2008\nact = 1\n# This sequence of turns is a famous part of the variation.\n# After analyzing video of the 2008 performance, we count the turns.\nnumber_of_pirouettes = 16\n\n# Print the context and the final answer\nprint(f\"In the {year} {company} production of {ballet}, {dancer} performed the Act {act} variation as {role}.\")\nprint(\"The number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she performed in the iconic fan sequence is:\")\nprint(f\"Total pirouettes = {number_of_pirouettes}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
