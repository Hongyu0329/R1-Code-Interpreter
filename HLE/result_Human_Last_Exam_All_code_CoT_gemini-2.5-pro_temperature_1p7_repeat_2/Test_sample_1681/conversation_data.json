    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, players' strategies are not limited to 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D). They can use a richer set of strategies represented by unitary operators acting on qubits. By leveraging the quantum phenomenon of entanglement, it's possible to find a new equilibrium that resolves the classical dilemma.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Game in Quantum Terms:**\n    *   The classical strategies 'Cooperate' and 'Defect' are mapped to basis quantum states |C⟩ (same as |0⟩) and |D⟩ (same as |1⟩).\n    *   The game starts with an initial state |CC⟩.\n    *   An entangling operator `J` is applied to create a maximally entangled state between the two players' qubits. This operator is defined as `J = exp(i * (π/4) * σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n2.  **Define Player Strategies:**\n    *   Each player chooses a unitary operator to apply to their qubit. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' and 'Defect' correspond to specific operators, `I` (Identity) and `iσ_x` (Pauli-X) respectively.\n    *   A unique \"Quantum\" strategy `Q` exists, which corresponds to the operator `iσ_z` (Pauli-Z).\n\n3.  **Simulate the Game Play:**\n    *   The state evolves as players apply their chosen strategies (`U_A` and `U_B`) to the entangled state.\n    *   A disentangling operator `J†` (the conjugate transpose of `J`) is applied to the state before measurement.\n    *   The final state is a superposition of the four classical outcomes: |CC⟩, |CD⟩, |DC⟩, and |DD⟩.\n\n4.  **Calculate Payoffs and Find Equilibrium:**\n    *   The probabilities of each classical outcome are calculated from the amplitudes of the final state vector.\n    *   The expected payoff for each player is the sum of the payoffs for each outcome, weighted by their probabilities.\n    *   It has been shown that when both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`, it forms a Nash Equilibrium. At this equilibrium, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   I will use Python with the `numpy` library to perform the complex vector and matrix calculations required for the quantum simulation.\n    *   The script will calculate the probabilities of the four outcomes when both players adopt the quantum strategy `Q`.\n    *   Finally, it will use these probabilities and the given payoff matrix to calculate the equilibrium payoff and display the full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
