    # Step 2: Classify all connected 1-manifolds.

    # Step 3: Verify both candidates against the special property.
    # Property: For each pair of distinct points x, y in X, there exists a closed connected set K
    # such that x is in the interior of K (Int(K)) and Int(K) is a subset of X \ {y}.

    # For X = R: Given distinct x, y, we can always find a closed interval K satisfying the property.
    # For example, if x < y, K = [x - 1, (x+y)/2] works.

    # K can be chosen as a small closed arc around x that doesn't contain y.
    verification_S1 = f"4. Verification for {candidate_2}: This space also satisfies the property. For any x, y, a suitable closed arc K can be constructed."

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.
    # Since both candidates satisfy all conditions and they are topologically distinct, there are 2 classes.
