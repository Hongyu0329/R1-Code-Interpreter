# The goal is to determine if Neff increases or decreases in the given scenario.
# We will use variables to represent the energy densities and show the relationship.

# 1. Define the Standard Model (SM) baseline for Neff.
N_eff_SM = 3.045

# 2. In the SM, Neff corresponds to the energy density of the three neutrino species.
#    Let's represent the energy density of a single standard neutrino species as a
#    normalized unit, 'rho_nu_1_species'.
rho_nu_1_species = 1.0

#    The total neutrino energy density in the SM is then:
rho_nu_SM = N_eff_SM * rho_nu_1_species

print(f"Standard Model (SM) Parameters:")
print(f"  - N_eff_SM = {N_eff_SM}")
print(f"  - Corresponding neutrino energy density, rho_nu_SM = {N_eff_SM} * (energy of 1 nu species)\n")

# 3. Introduce the new physics. A new particle 'X' decays ONLY into neutrinos.
#    This decay adds energy to the neutrino population.
#    The problem states this particle has a 'non-negligible abundance', so its
#    energy contribution is positive. Let's represent this additional energy density.
#    We will assign it an arbitrary positive value for demonstration.
delta_rho_from_X = 0.5  # This represents a positive, non-zero energy injection.

print(f"New Physics Scenario:")
print(f"  - A new particle X decays, injecting additional energy density into neutrinos.")
print(f"  - Added energy density, delta_rho_from_X = {delta_rho_from_X} * (energy of 1 nu species)\n")


# 4. Calculate the new total energy density of neutrinos.
#    It's the original SM density plus the new contribution from X's decay.
rho_nu_new = rho_nu_SM + delta_rho_from_X

print(f"Calculating the New State:")
# Neff is defined as the total energy density of radiation (beyond photons) divided by the
# energy density of a single neutrino species. So, the new Neff is:
N_eff_new = rho_nu_new / rho_nu_1_species

# 5. Display the final comparison and conclusion.
print(f"  - The new total neutrino energy density is rho_nu_SM + delta_rho_from_X")
print(f"  - rho_nu_new = {rho_nu_SM:.3f} + {delta_rho_from_X:.3f} = {rho_nu_new:.3f} * (energy of 1 nu species)")
print(f"  - The new N_eff is calculated as rho_nu_new / rho_nu_1_species")
print(f"  - N_eff_new = {rho_nu_new:.3f} / {rho_nu_1_species:.3f} = {N_eff_new:.3f}\n")

print("Conclusion:")
print(f"The new value, N_eff_new ({N_eff_new:.3f}), is greater than the standard model value, N_eff_SM ({N_eff_SM}).")
print("This is because adding energy specifically to the neutrino population increases their total energy density, which by definition increases N_eff.")
