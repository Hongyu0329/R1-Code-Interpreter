    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first look at the given molecular formula, $C_7H_{14}$, to determine the degree of unsaturation. This will tell me if the compound contains rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal provided. The chemical shift (in ppm) indicates the electronic environment of the carbon, and the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) tells me how many hydrogen atoms are attached to it (s=0H, t=2H, d=1H, q=3H). The number of signals compared to the number of carbons in the formula will reveal any molecular symmetry.\n3.  **Deduce Structural Fragments**: Based on the NMR analysis, I will identify key structural fragments, such as alkene groups, methyl groups, etc.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: I will piece together the fragments in a way that is consistent with all the data to form a complete chemical structure.\n5.  **Name the Compound**: Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the deduced structure.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical structure puzzle based on the provided data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Formula\")\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    carbons = 7\n    hydrogens = 14\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    # Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - (H/2)\n    dou = carbons + 1 - (hydrogens / 2)\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation is {int(dou)}.\")\n    print(\"This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the 13C NMR Data\")\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data)\n    print(f\"The compound has {carbons} carbons but only {num_signals} NMR signals.\")\n    print(\"This implies that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"\\nInterpreting each signal:\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary carbon (s, 0H) in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).
