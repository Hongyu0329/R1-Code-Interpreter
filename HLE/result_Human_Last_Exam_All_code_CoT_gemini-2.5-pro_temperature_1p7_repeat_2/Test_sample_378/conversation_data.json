    "Based on my research, the premise of your question appears to be incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no public record of him ever identifying himself as or adding the name \"Azikiwe\". The prominent Nigerian political figure with that name was Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, since the event never occurred, there is no year to provide. I will write a simple Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_discrepancy():\n  \"\"\"\n  Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n  \"\"\"\n  name_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\"\n  correct_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  \n  explanation = (\n      f\"The query asks for the year Goodluck Jonathan identified as 'Azikiwe'.\\n\"\n      f\"However, based on public records, this event never occurred.\\n\"\n      f\"His recognized full name is {correct_name}.\\n\"\n      f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.\\n\"\n      f\"Therefore, a year cannot be provided for an event that did not happen.\"\n  )\n  \n  print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_discrepancy()\n```\n<<<The premise of the question is incorrect, as this event never occurred.>>>"
