    print("Reasoning: The text states they 'did well on' these diets, implying biological adaptation and preference.")

    print("\nC. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")

    print("Reasoning: This describes a plausible mechanism (catabolite repression). The outcome (decreased activity) is correct, but let's evaluate all options before concluding.")
    print("Conclusion: Plausible, but less direct than other statements.")

    print("\nE. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("Reasoning: The MA biotype is adapted to a raffinose-free (sucrose-only) environment. This adaptation likely means it has lost or has a deficient genetic pathway for metabolizing raffinose. Therefore, it is unlikely to be able to increase its galactosidase activity, even when raffinose is abundant.")
