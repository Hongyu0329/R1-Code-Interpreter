  This function identifies and prints the letter formed by the buildings of
  Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa.
  
  By observing the satellite view of the two adjacent schools, we can see:
  - The Galilei-Pacinotti building forms one vertical bar.
  - The Ulisse Dini building forms the second vertical bar.
  - A connecting structure forms the horizontal crossbar.
  
  This configuration clearly resembles a specific letter of the alphabet.
