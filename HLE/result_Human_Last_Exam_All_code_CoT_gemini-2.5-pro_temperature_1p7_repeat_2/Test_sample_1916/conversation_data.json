    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this using a Python script.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate to an Algebraic Structure:** A category with a single object is equivalent to an algebraic structure called a **monoid**.\n    *   The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid.\n    *   The composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation.\n    *   The identity morphism corresponds to the monoid's identity element.\n    *   The associativity of composition in the category is the associativity axiom of the monoid.\n    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Define the Monoid:** Let the three morphisms (monoid elements) be `e`, `a`, and `b`. One of them must be the identity element, so we'll call it `e`. The monoid set is `M = {e, a, b}`.\n\n3.  **Define the Operation (Composition):** The composition operation (`*`) is defined by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n    *   The rows and columns corresponding to the identity element `e` are already determined (e.g., `e * a = a`, `b * e = b`).\n    *   We only need to define the four products involving the non-identity elements: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`.\n\n4.  **Enumerate Possibilities:** Each of these four products can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives a total of `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n\n5.  **Check for Validity (Associativity):** For each of the 81 possibilities, we must check if the resulting operation is associative. That is, we must verify if `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` holds for all `x, y, z` in `M`. A table is a valid monoid structure only if it is associative.\n\n6.  **Handle Isomorphisms:** We need to count the categories \"up to isomorphism.\" For monoids, this means we should not double-count structures that are identical except for a relabeling of the elements. The only non-trivial relabeling for our monoid `M` is to swap `a` and `b`.\n    *   For each valid monoid we find, we will generate its \"swapped\" version.\n    *   We then define a \"canonical representation\" for each isomorphism class. A simple choice is the lexicographically smallest of the original table and its swapped version.\n    *   By counting the number of unique canonical representations, we get the number of non-isomorphic monoids.\n\n7.  **Implement in Python:** The script will:\n    *   Represent `e, a, b` as `0, 1, 2`.\n    *   Loop through all 81 possible tables.\n    *   Check each for associativity.\n    *   For valid monoids, compute the canonical representation.\n    *   Use a `set` to store and count the unique canonical representations.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# This script calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one\n# object and three morphisms by finding the number of non-isomorphic\n# monoids of order 3.\n\n# Step 1: Set up the problem\n# We represent the morphisms (monoid elements) as integers:\n# 0: identity element 'e'\n# 1: non-identity element 'a'\n# 2: non-identity element 'b'\nelements = (0, 1, 2)\n\n# This set will store the canonical representations of the valid,\n# non-isomorphic monoids we find.\ncanonical_monoids = set()\n\n# Step 2: Iterate through all possible multiplication tables.\n# A table is defined by the 4 products of non-identity elements.\n# table_spec will be a tuple like (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b).\nfor table_spec in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n    a_a, a_b, b_a, b_b = table_spec\n\n    # This dictionary represents the 2x2 sub-table for elements {1, 2}\n    table = {\n        (1, 1): a_a, (1, 2): a_b,\n        (2, 1): b_a, (2, 2): b_b,\n    }\n\n    # The full composition function, including the identity element '0'.\n    def compose(x, y):\n        if x == 0:\n            return y\n        if y == 0:\n            return x\n        return table[(x, y)]\n\n    # Step 3: Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n    is_associative = True\n    for x, y, z in itertools.product(elements, repeat=3):\n        if compose(compose(x, y), z) != compose(x, compose(y, z)):\n            is_associative = False\n            break\n    \n    # If not associative, this is not a valid monoid, so we skip it.\n    if not is_associative:\n        continue\n\n    # Step 4: Handle isomorphisms by finding a canonical representation.\n    # The only non-trivial isomorphism corresponds to swapping elements 1 ('a') and 2 ('b').\n    # We define a map for this swap.\n    swap_map = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n\n    # To find the table for the swapped monoid, we apply the swap to the\n    # elements and the results.
