# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# In it, a horse is shod with hooves that create cow tracks. The question is who the
# shoes "properly belonged to". The deception creates a "cow", so we can argue the
# shoes metaphorically belong to the faked entity. This makes the answer 6.
#
# Part B: The theme underscored by this faulty allusion. The allusion is a
# misremembered detail from a classic text, which is then wildly misinterpreted by
# the book's commentator. This directly relates to the theme of education versus
# mis-education, making the answer 3.
#
# Part C: Nabokov's most intense experience with "intricate back-referencing"
# was his massive scholarly translation and commentary on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin",
# a project that heavily influenced the structure of "Pale Fire". This is answer 7.
#
# Constraint Check: The sum of the numbers must be a multiple of 8.
# 6 + 3 + 7 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.

# Final Answer: The code will print the three numbers separated by spaces.
# The final equation is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16.
