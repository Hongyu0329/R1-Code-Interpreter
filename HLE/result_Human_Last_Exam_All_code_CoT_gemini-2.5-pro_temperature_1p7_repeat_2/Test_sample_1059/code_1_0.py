def find_closepact_sets():
    """
    This function identifies the sets that are necessarily 'closepact in themselves'.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A set is 'closepact in itself' if it is an H-closed space.
    2. All the given examples are metric spaces (subsets of R or C).
    3. For a metric space, being H-closed is equivalent to being compact.
    4. For a subset of R or C, being compact is equivalent to being closed and bounded.
    5. We select the choices that are necessarily closed and bounded.

    The correct choices are:
    - C: A finite set is always closed and bounded.
    - G: A bounded monotonic sequence along with its limit is a closed and bounded set.
    - H: A convergent sequence along with its limit is a closed and bounded set.
    - J: A closed interval is by definition closed and bounded.
    - M: The Cantor set is constructed as a closed and bounded set.
