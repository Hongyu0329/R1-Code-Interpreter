    "To find the thickness of the double point, we need to analyze the stable reduction of the curve. The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic distances between the branch points of the curve.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the branch points**: The branch points of the map $(x,z) \\mapsto x$ are the five roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$, let's call them $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5$, and the point at infinity.\n2.  **Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots**: We will use the Newton polygon of $f(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$ (normalized by $v(2)=1$) to determine the valuations of its roots. This will show how the roots cluster.\n3.  **Find the closest pair of roots**: The formation of a double point is due to a pair of branch points being \"closer\" to each other than to the others. We will see that two of the roots are units in the 2-adic integers and are both close to 1.\n4.  **Zoom in on the close roots**: We will perform a change of variables to zoom in on this pair of roots. The Newton polygon of the transformed polynomial reveals the structure of their proximity.\n5.  **Calculate the thickness**: The thickness of the double point is given by the slope of the segment of this new Newton polygon that corresponds to the pair of close roots.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Analyze the roots of f(x)**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\nThe coefficients are $c_5=2, c_3=2, c_0=1$.\nTheir 2-adic valuations are $v(c_5)=1, v(c_3)=1, v(c_0)=0$.\nThe points for the Newton polygon of $f(x)$ are $(5, v(c_5))=(5,1)$, $(3, v(c_3))=(3,1)$, and $(0, v(c_0))=(0,0)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments:\n*   A segment from (0,0) to (3,1) with slope $(1-0)/(3-0) = 1/3$. This corresponds to 3 roots with valuation $v(\\alpha) = -1/3$.\n*   A segment from (3,1) to (5,1) with slope $(1-1)/(5-3) = 0$. This corresponds to 2 roots with valuation $v(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Zoom in on the close roots**\n\nLet the two roots with valuation 0 be $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$. Since $v(\\alpha)=0$, they are units in the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of some extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\nFrom $2\\alpha^5 + 2\\alpha^3 + 1 = 0$, we can reduce modulo 2 (or the maximal ideal of $\\mathcal{O}_K$) to get $1 \\equiv 0$, unless the residues of these roots have a special property. In fact, for any root $\\alpha$ with $v(\\alpha)=0$, its residue must be 1. This means $\\alpha_4$ and $\\alpha_5$ are 2-adically close to 1.\n\nTo measure their proximity, we perform a change of variables that centers the view at 1. Let $x = 1+2u$. The factor of 2 is chosen to simplify the resulting polynomial's valuations.\nSubstituting $x=1+2u$ into $f(x)=0$:\n$f(1+2u) = 2(1+2u)^5 + 2(1+2u)^3 + 1 = 0$\nExpanding this gives a polynomial in $u$, let's call it $q(u)$:\n$q(u) = 64u^5 + 160u^4 + 176u^3 + 104u^2 + 32u + 5 = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Newton Polygon of the transformed polynomial and thickness**\n\nNow we construct the Newton polygon for $q(u)$. First, we find the 2-adic valuations of its coefficients:\n$v(c_5) = v(64) = v(2^6) = 6$\n$v(c_4) = v(160) = v(32 \\cdot 5) = v(2^5) = 5$\n$v(c_3) = v(176) = v(16 \\cdot 11) = v(2^4) = 4$\n$v(c_2) = v(104) = v(8 \\cdot 13) = v(2^3) = 3$\n$v(c_1) = v(32) = v(2^5) = 5$\n$v(c_0) = v(5) = 0$\n\nThe points for the Newton polygon of $q(u)$ are:\n(5, 6), (4, 5), (3, 4), (2, 3), (1, 5), (0, 0).\nThe lower convex hull of these points is formed by two segments:\n*   A segment from (0,0) to (2,3). The slope is $(3-0)/(2-0) = 3/2$. This corresponds to the two roots $u_4, u_5$ related to $\\alpha_4, \\alpha_5$.\n*   A segment from (2,3) to (5,6). The slope is $(6-3)/(5-2) = 1$. This corresponds to the other three roots.\n\nThe thickness of the double point created by the clustering of the roots $\\alpha_4$ and $\\alpha_5$ is given by the slope of the corresponding segment on this Newton polygon.\n\nThe final answer is the slope of the first segment.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef v(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the 2-adic valuation of an integer n.\n    Returns infinity for n=0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return 0\n    return (n & -n).bit_length() - 1\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point for the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The coefficients of the polynomial q(u) = 64u^5 + 160u^4 + 176u^3 + 104u^2 + 32u + 5\n    coeffs = [5, 32, 104, 176, 160, 64]\n    \n    # Calculate the 2-adic valuations of the coefficients\n    valuations = [v(c) for c in coeffs]\n    \n    # The points for the Newton polygon are (i, v(c_i))\n    points = list(enumerate(valuations))\n    \n    print(\"The polynomial in u is: q(u) = 64*u^5 + 160*u^4 + 176*u^3 + 104*u^2 + 32*u + 5\")\n    print(\"The points for the Newton polygon of q(u) are (i, v(c_i)):\")\n    for i, p in enumerate(points):\n        print(f\"  For u^{i}: point is {p}\")\n        \n    # The vertices of the lower convex hull are (0,0), (2,3), and (5,6).\n    # We are interested in the first segment, corresponding to the two close roots.\n    p1 = points[0]  # (0, 0)\n    p2 = points[2]  # (2, 3)\n    \n    # Calculate the slope of the first segment\n    slope_num = p2[1] - p1[1]\n    slope_den = p2[0] - p1[0]\n    \n    thickness = slope_num / slope_den\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe lower convex hull of these points has vertices at (0,0), (2,3), and (5,6).\")\n    print(\"The double point corresponds to the two roots that are close to each other.\")\n    print(\"The thickness of this double point is the slope of the first segment of the Newton polygon.\")\n    print(f\"Slope = (v(c_2) - v(c_0)) / (2 - 0) = ({p2[1]} - {p1[1]}) / ({p2[0]} - {p1[0]}) = {slope_num}/{slope_den}\")\n    print(f\"The thickness is: {thickness}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1.5>>>"
