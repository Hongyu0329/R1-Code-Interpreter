# The problem is to find the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity in the graph H_n U G(n, p),
# where H_n has a minimum degree d = n/2 - eta.
# The analysis of the worst-case structures for H_n (either being disconnected into two
# large components or containing a large independent set of size ~n/2) reveals
# that the threshold is driven by the probability p required to make a random graph
# on roughly n/2 vertices Hamiltonian.

# The threshold for Hamiltonicity in a random graph G(k, p) is p ~ log(k)/k.
# For our worst-case scenarios, k is approximately n/2.
# So, p ~ log(n/2) / (n/2)
# p ~ (log(n) - log(2)) / (n/2)
# p ~ 2 * (log(n) - log(2)) / n
# Asymptotically, for large n, the log(n) term dominates.
# The threshold is p(n) ~ (2 * log(n)) / n.

# The Python code below will print this resulting formula, including the numbers involved as requested.
