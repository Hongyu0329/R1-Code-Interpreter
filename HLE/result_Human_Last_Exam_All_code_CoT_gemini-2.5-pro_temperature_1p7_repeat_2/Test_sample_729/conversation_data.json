    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The problem asks about the \"generalized quaternion group of size 128\". This group is denoted as $Q_{128}$ or $Q_{2^7}$. In the general notation $Q_{2^n}$, this corresponds to $n=7$.\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** The term \"power subgroup\" refers to a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some integer $k$. Our task is to find how many *distinct* subgroups of this form exist for $G = Q_{128}$.\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Power Subgroups in $Q_{128}$:**\n    *   The group $Q_{128}$ has the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64}=1, x^{32}=y^2, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   The order of the element $x$ is 64.\n    *   Any power subgroup $G^k$ where $k$ is odd is equal to $G$ itself, because the map $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection when $\\gcd(k, |G|)=1$. Since $|G|=128$, any odd $k$ is coprime to it.\n    *   This means we only need to consider $k$ that are powers of 2, i.e., $k=2^j$ for $j \\ge 0$.\n4.  **Enumerate the Distinct Power Subgroups:**\n    *   For $j=0$, we have $k=2^0=1$. The subgroup is $G^1 = G = Q_{128}$.\n    *   For $j \\ge 1$, the power subgroup $G^{2^j}$ in $Q_{128}$ is known to be the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   We will list these subgroups for $j = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ and stop when we no longer get new subgroups.\n    *   The chain of subgroups will be $Q_{128} \\supset \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\supset \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\supset \\dots \\supset \\{1\\}$.\n5.  **Write the Python Code:** The code will implement this enumeration. It will print a description of each distinct power subgroup found, its order, and the corresponding value of $k$. Finally, it will print the \"final equation\" as a sum and the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and provide the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_q128_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \n    A power subgroup G^k is a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G.\n    The group in question is Q_128, which is the generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} with n=7.\n    \n    The presentation is Q_{2^n} = <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^(2^(n-2)) = y^2, yxy^-1 = x^-1>.\n    For n=7, the element x has order 2^(7-1) = 64.\n    \n    The distinct power subgroups of Q_{2^n} correspond to k being powers of 2.
