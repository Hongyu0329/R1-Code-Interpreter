    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.
    
    A power subgroup G^k is a subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G.
    The group in question is Q_128, which is the generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} with n=7.
    
    The presentation is Q_{2^n} = <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^(2^(n-2)) = y^2, yxy^-1 = x^-1>.
    For n=7, the element x has order 2^(7-1) = 64.
    
    The distinct power subgroups of Q_{2^n} correspond to k being powers of 2. They are:
    1. G^1 = Q_{2^n} itself.
    2. G^(2^j) = <x^(2^j)> for j = 1, 2, ..., n-1.
    
    We need to count how many such distinct subgroups exist for n=7.
