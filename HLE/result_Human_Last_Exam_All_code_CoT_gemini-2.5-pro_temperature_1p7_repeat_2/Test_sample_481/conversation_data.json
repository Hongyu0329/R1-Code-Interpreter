    "My plan is to first identify the numerical imprints on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. According to publicly available drug identification databases, the numerical imprint on the 10mg capsule is \"3105\" and the one on the 20mg capsule is \"3106\".\n\nNext, I will use a Python script to compare these two strings. The script will use set operations to programmatically find the digits that are unique to each imprint. Finally, it will print these differing numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the numerical imprints for each capsule\nimprint_10mg = \"3105\"\nimprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n# Use set operations to find the unique digits in each imprint string.\n# A set contains only unique elements.\nset_10mg = set(imprint_10mg)\nset_20mg = set(imprint_20mg)\n\n# The difference() method returns a set containing the difference between two sets.\n# We find the digit that is in the 10mg imprint but not in the 20mg one.\ndiff_1 = set_10mg.difference(set_20mg)\n\n# We do the same for the 20mg imprint.\ndiff_2 = set_20mg.difference(set_10mg)\n\n# The result of the difference operation is a set. Since we expect only one differing\n# number in each, we use pop() to get the single element out of the set.\ndiff_num_10mg = diff_1.pop()\ndiff_num_20mg = diff_2.pop()\n\nprint(\"The imprint on the 10mg capsule contains the number: \" + diff_num_10mg)\nprint(\"The imprint on the 20mg capsule contains the number: \" + diff_num_20mg)\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the different numbers are:\")\n# As requested, outputting each number that makes up the final difference 'equation' (5 vs 6)\nprint(diff_num_10mg)\nprint(diff_num_20mg)\n\n```\n<<<5 and 6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
