def solve_continuum_cardinality():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the continuum theory problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of
    regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    1.  A decomposable continuum X can be constructed with a known number of regular
        proper subcontinua. A key example is the wedge sum (gluing at a point) of
        two indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc), say X = P1 âˆ¨ P2.
    2.  For this continuum X, the only regular proper subcontinua are P1 and P2 themselves.
        Thus, a cardinality of 2 is achievable.
        Let N be the cardinality of the collection. For this X, N = 2.
    3.  A theorem in continuum theory states that any nondegenerate decomposable
        continuum must have at least two regular proper subcontinua.
        This means for any such continuum Y, N(Y) >= 2.
    4.  Combining these two facts, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
