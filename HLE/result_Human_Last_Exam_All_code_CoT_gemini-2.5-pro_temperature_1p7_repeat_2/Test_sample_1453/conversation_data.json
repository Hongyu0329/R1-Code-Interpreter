    "Based on the principles of coiled-coil structures, the oligomeric state of a protein sequence can be predicted by analyzing the pattern of amino acids, specifically within the hydrophobic core. My plan is to write a Python script that will:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Systematically test all possible alignments (frames) of the seven-amino-acid (`abcdefg`) repeat against the given sequence.\n2.  **Find the Optimal Frame:** The correct alignment is the one that places the most hydrophobic residues (like L, I, A, W) at the core `a` and `d` positions. The script will calculate a \"hydrophobicity score\" for each frame and select the best one.\n3.  **Analyze the Core Residues:** Once the optimal frame is found, the script will list the amino acids that occupy the `a` and `d` positions.\n4.  **Predict Oligomeric State:** Using well-established rules based on steric hindrance and packing efficiency (the \"knobs-into-holes\" model), the script will predict the oligomeric state. For example, specific combinations like Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' strongly favor tetramers, whereas the pattern found in this sequence favors a different state. The script will output this final prediction and reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a peptide sequence to predict its coiled-coil oligomeric state.\n    This is based on identifying the heptad repeat and analyzing the residues\n    at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n    \n    hydrophobic_residues = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W'}\n    register_template = \"abcdefg\"\n    best_frame_info = {'score': -1}\n\n    # 1.
