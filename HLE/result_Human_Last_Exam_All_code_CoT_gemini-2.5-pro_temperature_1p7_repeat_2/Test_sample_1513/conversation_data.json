    "This is a geographical riddle. My plan is to deduce the answer by breaking down the clues provided in the question.\n\n1.  **\"More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\"**: This points to one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, such as Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n2.  **\"Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera\"**: The island must be volcanic in origin and the main town must be located on a bay that is, or is part of, a volcanic caldera.\n3.  **\"that shares the town's name\"**: This is a key linguistic clue. The name of the town is the same as the name of the bay and/or the caldera.\n\nBased on these clues, the location is Hanga Roa.\n\n*   **Remoteness**: Hanga Roa is the main town on Easter Island (Rapa Nui), which is one of the most isolated islands in the world, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands and over 3,500 km from Chile. This fits the \"> 500 km\" clue.\n*   **Location and Name**: The town of Hanga Roa is situated on Hanga Roa Bay. The town and the bay share a name.\n*   **Volcanic Formation**: Easter Island is entirely volcanic. The bay itself lies at the foot of the volcano Rano Kau, which has a massive and famous caldera. The bay's geography was formed by the volcanic activity of the island.\n\nTherefore, Hanga Roa is the correct answer. I will now provide a python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by printing the name of the island town.\n    The town is Hanga Roa, which fits the following criteria:\n    1. It is the main town on Easter Island, one of the most remote islands in the world.\n    2. It sits on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    3. The bay was formed by the volcanic activity of the island, which includes the famous Rano Kau caldera.\n    4. The town and the bay share the name \"Hanga Roa\".\n    \"\"\"\n    answer = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
