    "The number of non-zero coefficients of a given order in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is equivalent to the dimension of the subspace of that degree in a free Lie algebra with two generators. This dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate this for order 10:\n1.  **Identify Parameters**: For the BCH formula `log(exp(X)exp(Y))`, we have two generators (X and Y), so `k=2`. We are interested in terms of order 10, so `n=10`.\n2.  **Recall Witt's Formula**: The formula is `d(n) = (1/n) * Σ [μ(d) * k^(n/d)]`, where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ` is the Möbius function.\n3.  **Find Divisors**: The positive divisors `d` of `n=10` are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n4.  **Calculate Möbius Function `μ(d)`**:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = 1` (10 has an even number of distinct prime factors)\n5.  **Apply the Formula**: Substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n    `d(10) = (1/10) * [μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10)]`\n    `d(10) = (1/10) * [1*2^10 + (-1)*2^5 + (-1)*2^2 + 1*2^1]`\n6.  **Compute the Result**: Calculate the final value from the expression.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to compute the final answer and displays the full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:  # n has a squared prime factor\n            return 0\n    if len(factors) % 2 != 0:  # n has an odd number of distinct prime factors\n        return -1\n    else:  # n has an even number of distinct prime factors\n        return 1\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients of order 10\n    using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    # Find all positive divisors of n\n    divisors = [d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0]\n\n    sum_terms_values = []\n    sum_terms_str_parts = []\n    \n    # Calculate each term of the sum in Witt's formula\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_val = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        \n        sum_terms_values.append(term_val)\n        sum_terms_str_parts.append(f\"({mu_d}) * {k}^{power}\")\n\n    # Calculate the final result\n    total_sum = sum(sum_terms_values)\n    result = total_sum / n\n    \n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"d(n) = (1/n) * sum_{{d|n}} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    print(\"\\nFor n=10, k=2:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with all numbers filled in\n    equation_str = f\"d(10) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(sum_terms_str_parts) + \" ]\"\n    print(equation_str)\n    \n    # Print the equation with evaluated terms\n    evaluated_terms = \" + \".join(map(str, sum_terms_values)).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    evaluated_str = f\"d(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {evaluated_terms} ]\"\n    print(evaluated_str)\n    \n    # Print the final calculation step and result\n    final_calc_str = f\"d(10) = (1/{n}) * {total_sum} = {int(result)}\"\n    print(final_calc_str)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: {int(result)}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
