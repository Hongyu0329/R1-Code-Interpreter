def find_tacitus_quote():
    """
    This function stores and prints the specific five-word Latin quote from Tacitus.
    The quote is from his father-in-law Agricola's speech before the Battle of Mons Graupius.
    It almost exactly resembles a phrase in Cornelius Nepos' "Life of Chabrias", chapter 4.

    The quote from Tacitus (Agricola, 33) is: "iniquissima haec bellorum condicio est"
    The similar quote from Nepos (Chabrias, 4) is: "iniqua haec bellorum condicio est"

    The function will print the quote from Tacitus in lowercase and without punctuation.
