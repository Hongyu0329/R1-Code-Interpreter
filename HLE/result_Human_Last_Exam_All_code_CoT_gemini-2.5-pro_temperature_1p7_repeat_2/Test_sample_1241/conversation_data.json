    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we first need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nWhen the probabilities are constant, their derivatives with respect to time are zero, i.e., $P_{i}'(t) = 0$. This simplifies the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Set all the derivatives $P_{i}'(t)$ to zero in the given system of equations.\n2.  This gives us a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$. Along with the normalization condition $\\sum \\pi_i = 1$, we have:\n    *   $-\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3} = 0$\n    *   $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n3.  One of the first four equations is redundant. We can use three of them along with the normalization condition to create a 4x4 system of linear equations in the form $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = [\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3]^T$.\n4.  I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to define the coefficient matrix `A` and the constant vector `b`, and then solve for the vector of probabilities $\\mathbf{x}$.\n5.  Finally, I will extract $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ from the solution and compute their sum. The script will print the final equation with the calculated values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the steady-state probabilities of the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system\n    and calculates the sum of P0 and P1 at infinity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given lambda parameters\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # Step 2: Set up the system of linear equations for the steady state (P_i'(t) = 0).\n    # Let pi_i = P_i(+inf).\n    # Equations used:\n    # 1) -lambda_01*pi_0 + lambda_10*pi_1 = 0\n    # 2)  lambda_12*pi_1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*pi_2 = 0\n    # 3)  lambda_23*pi_2 - lambda_31*pi_3 = 0\n    # 4)  pi_0 + pi_1 + pi_2 + pi_3 = 1\n    # We formulate this as a matrix equation Ax = b.\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the coefficient matrix A and the constant vector b.\n    A = np.array([\n        [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n        [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n        [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n        [1, 1, 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    b = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n    # Step 4: Solve the system Ax = b for x = [pi_0, pi_1, pi_2, pi_3].\n    try:\n        pi = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n        p0_inf = pi[0]\n        p1_inf = pi[1]\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the required sum P0(+inf) + P1(+inf).\n    result = p0_inf + p1_inf\n\n    # Step 6: Print the individual probabilities and the final equation as requested.\n    print(\"The steady-state probabilities are:\")\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) = {p0_inf:.8f}\")\n    print(f\"P1(+inf) = {p1_inf:.8f}\")\n    print(f\"P2(+inf) = {pi[2]:.8f}\")\n    print(f\"P3(+inf) = {pi[3]:.8f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {p0_inf:.8f} + {p1_inf:.8f} = {result:.8f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_steady_state_probabilities()\n\n```\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
