# The problem asks for the value of 'n' for which a tame functor
# f from an upper semilattice J to the category of K-vector spaces
# is n-resolvable.

# A functor is n-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most n.
# This property is determined by the global dimension of the category of functors,
# Fun(J, Vect_K).

# According to a theorem in the representation theory of posets, if J is an
# upper semilattice, the category Fun(J, Vect_K) has a global dimension of at most 1.

# This means that every functor in this category, regardless of its specific properties
# (like being tame), has a projective dimension of at most 1.
# In other words, every functor is 1-resolvable.

# Therefore, n must be 1.

n = 1

# The final equation is n = 1.
# We will print the value of n and the numbers in the equation.
