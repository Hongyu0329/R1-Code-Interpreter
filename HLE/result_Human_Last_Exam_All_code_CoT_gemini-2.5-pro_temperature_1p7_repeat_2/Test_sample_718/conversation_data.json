    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I need to understand the terms in the question: \"upper semilattice,\" \"tame functor,\" and \"n-resolvable.\"\n2.  An object in an abelian category (like a functor `f: J -> Vect_K`) is said to be \"n-resolvable\" if it has a projective resolution of length at most `n`. This means there exists an exact sequence `0 -> P_n -> ... -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0`, where all `P_i` are projective objects.\n3.  The properties of the category of functors `Fun(J, Vect_K)` are deeply connected to the combinatorial structure of the poset `J`.\n4.  A crucial theorem in the representation theory of posets relates the structure of `J` to the global dimension of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)`. The global dimension is the maximum projective dimension over all objects in the category.\n5.  Specifically, if `J` is an upper semilattice, it satisfies the property that for any two elements `x, y` in `J`, the set of their common upper bounds `{z | x <= z and y <= z}` has a unique minimal element (their join `x \\vee y`). This property implies that the global dimension of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is at most 1.\n6.  If the global dimension of the entire category is at most 1, it means that *every* functor in this category has a projective resolution of length at most 1. Therefore, every functor is 1-resolvable.\n7.  The condition that the functor is \"tame\" is actually a consequence of `J` being an upper semilattice. Such posets are known to be of tame representation type, meaning all their representations (functors) are tame. This information does not change the result about resolvability, which holds for all functors in the category.\n8.  Therefore, we can conclude that `n=1`. My Python code will simply define `n` to be 1 and print the resulting equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the value of 'n' for which a tame functor\n# f from an upper semilattice J to the category of K-vector spaces\n# is n-resolvable.\n\n# A functor is n-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most n.\n# This property is determined by the global dimension of the category of functors,\n# Fun(J, Vect_K).\n\n# According to a theorem in the representation theory of posets, if J is an\n# upper semilattice, the category Fun(J, Vect_K) has a global dimension of at most 1.\n\n# This means that every functor in this category, regardless of its specific properties\n# (like being tame), has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n# In other words, every functor is 1-resolvable.\n\n# Therefore, n must be 1.\n\nn = 1\n\n# The final equation is n = 1.\n# We will print the value of n and the numbers in the equation.\nprint(f\"For a tame functor f: J -> Vect_K where J is an upper semilattice, the functor is n-resolvable.\")\nprint(f\"The equation for n is: n = {n}\")\nprint(\"The numbers in this equation are:\")\nprint(n)\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
