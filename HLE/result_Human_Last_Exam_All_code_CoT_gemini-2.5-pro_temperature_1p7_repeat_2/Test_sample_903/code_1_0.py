# Step 1: Identify the donor atoms in the ligand.
# The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2â€™-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
# Each of the two coordinating arms contains a 2'-pyridyl group and a pyrazol-1-yl group.
# - The pyridine ring has one N donor atom.
# - The pyrazole ring (attached via N1) has a second N donor atom at the N2 position.
# Total nitrogen donor atoms = 2 * (1 from pyridine + 1 from pyrazole) = 4 nitrogen atoms.
# So, the ligand is a tetradentate N4 ligand.
num_N_donors = 4

# Step 2: Identify the components from the metal salt.
# The salt is ZnBr2.
# This provides one Zn^2+ ion and two Br^- ions.
num_Zn_ions = 1
num_Br_ions = 2

# Step 3: Determine the coordination sphere of the final product.
# Zn^2+ is a d10 ion and commonly forms 4- or 6-coordinate complexes.
# The N4 ligand will bind to the Zn^2+ ion.
# To satisfy zinc's preference for a higher coordination number (especially 6), the two bromide ions will also coordinate.
# This results in a stable, neutral 6-coordinate complex.
# The coordination sphere will contain all the donor atoms that are bound to the central zinc ion.
coordinated_atoms_from_ligand = ['N'] * num_N_donors
coordinated_atoms_from_salt = ['Br'] * num_Br_ions
total_coordinated_atoms = coordinated_atoms_from_ligand + coordinated_atoms_from_salt

# Step 4: Print the final set of coordinated atoms.
# The question asks for the atoms coordinated to the Zn center.
print("The coordination around the Zn center is composed of:")
# We list out each individual atom to be clear, as requested by the prompt ("output each number in the final equation").
final_coordination = ", ".join(sorted(total_coordinated_atoms))
print(final_coordination)
# This corresponds to answer choice B.
