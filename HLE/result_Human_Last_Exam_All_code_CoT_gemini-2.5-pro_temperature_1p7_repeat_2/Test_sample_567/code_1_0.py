# The problem asks for the threshold value of 'a' for the ellipsoid E(1,a)
# at which the only obstruction to symplectic embedding into a ball becomes
# the volume constraint.
# According to the work of McDuff and Schlenk, this value is tau^4, where
# tau is the golden ratio.

# The final equation for this threshold value 'a' is:
# a = (7 + 3 * sqrt(5)) / 2

# The numbers in the final equation
n1 = 7
n2 = 3
n3_sqrt = 5
d = 2

# Calculate the value of a
a_value = (n1 + n2 * math.sqrt(n3_sqrt)) / d

# Output the final equation, showing each number.
print("The final equation for the threshold value 'a' is:")
print(f"a = ({n1} + {n2} * sqrt({n3_sqrt})) / {d}")

# Output the calculated numerical value.
print(f"\nThe calculated value of a is:")
