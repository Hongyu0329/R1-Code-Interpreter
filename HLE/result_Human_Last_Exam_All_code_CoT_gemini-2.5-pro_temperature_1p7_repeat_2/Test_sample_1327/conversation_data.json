    "Here is a thinking process to solve the number sequence puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. Let's call the terms `x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5`. We need to find `x_6`.\n\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship:** Let's check for simple arithmetic or geometric progressions.\n    *   Differences: 11-2=9, 23-11=12, 51-23=28, 119-51=68. No simple pattern.\n    *   Ratios: 11/2=5.5, 23/11â‰ˆ2.09, etc. Not a simple pattern.\n\n3.  **Explore recursive relationships:** A common type of pattern is a recursive one, where a term is defined by the preceding terms. Let's test a relationship of the form `x_n = a * x_{n-1} + b`. The multiplication factor seems to be around 2 or 3.\n\n4.  **Test the `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k` hypothesis:**\n    *   For `x_3=23`: We have `x_2=11`. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - k_1`. This gives `23 = 33 - k_1`, so `k_1 = 10`.\n    *   For `x_4=51`: We have `x_3=23`. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - k_2`. This gives `51 = 69 - k_2`, so `k_2 = 18`.\n    *   For `x_5=119`: We have `x_4=51`. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - k_3`. This gives `119 = 153 - k_3`, so `k_3 = 34`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the new sequence:** We have found a new sequence of numbers that are being subtracted: `k = {10, 18, 34, ...}`. Let's find the pattern within this sequence `k`.\n    *   Calculate the differences between consecutive terms in `k`:\n        *   `18 - 10 = 8`\n        *   `34 - 18 = 16`\n    *   The differences are `8, 16`. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2. It can be represented as `2^3, 2^4`.\n\n6.  **Predict the next term:**\n    *   The next difference in the sequence of differences should be `16 * 2 = 32` (or `2^5`).\n    *   The next term in the sequence `k` (let's call it `k_4`) will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the final term of the original sequence:**\n    *   The rule for our original sequence is `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k_{n-2}`.\n    *   So, `x_6 = 3 * x_5 - k_4`.\n    *   `x_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`.\n    *   `x_6 = 357 - 66`.\n    *   `x_6 = 291`.\n\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The plan is to create a Python script that codifies this logic and prints the final calculation step by step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a recursive pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    x = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The given sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, x))}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Propose the rule x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - k\n    # and find the values for k.\n    k_1 = 3 * x[2-1] - x[3-1] # k for calculating x_3\n    k_2 = 3 * x[3-1] - x[4-1] # k for calculating x_4\n    k_3 = 3 * x[4-1] - x[5-1] # k for calculating x_5\n    \n    k_sequence = [k_1, k_2, k_3]\n    print(f\"The pattern can be described as x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) - k, where k changes.\")\n    print(f\"Let's find the values of k:\")\n    print(f\"For {x[2]}: {x[2]} = 3 * {x[1]} - {k_1}\")\n    print(f\"For {x[3]}: {x[3]} = 3 * {x[2]} - {k_2}\")\n    print(f\"For {x[4]}: {x[4]} = 3 * {x[3]} - {k_3}\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of subtracted numbers 'k' is: {k_sequence}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in the sequence 'k'\n    diff1 = k_sequence[1] - k_sequence[0]\n    diff2 = k_sequence[2] - k_sequence[1]\n    print(f\"\\nLet's analyze the sequence k = {k_sequence}.\")\n    print(f\"The differences are {diff1} and {diff2}.\")\n    print(\"This is a geometric progression (each difference is 2 times the previous one).\")\n\n    # Step 3: Predict the next k\n    next_diff = diff2 * 2\n    next_k = k_sequence[-1] + next_diff\n    print(f\"The next difference should be {diff2} * 2 = {next_diff}.\")\n    print(f\"So the next k is {k_sequence[-1]} + {next_diff} = {next_k}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the next term in the original sequence\n    next_x = 3 * x[-1] - next_k\n    print(f\"\\nFinally, we calculate the next term in the original sequence:\")\n    print(f\"Next Term = 3 * {x[-1]} - {next_k} = {3 * x[-1]} - {next_k} = {next_x}\")\n    print(f\"The complete sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, x))}, ({next_x})\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
