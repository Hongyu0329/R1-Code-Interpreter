    # (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # As explained in the derivation, the quasiprimitive action of G on the face set F
    # implies that any non-trivial normal subgroup, including the socle N, acts transitively on F.
    # Transitive action of N on F means there is only one N-orbit of faces.
    # The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are precisely these N-orbits.
    # Therefore, D_N has only one face, i.e., it is unicellular.
    # The condition that G/N is cyclic is not required for this conclusion.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D.
    # HA (Holomorph of an Abelian group), TW (Wreath product), and AS (Almost Simple)
    # are the main classes of quasiprimitive groups. All these types of groups are known
    # to occur as automorphism groups of regular dessins satisfying the given conditions.
    # The "smooth covering" condition adds arithmetic constraints but does not
    # eliminate any of these general types.
    answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"

    # (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    # The conditions together imply that G = T wr Z_l must be a quotient of a
    # triangle group Delta(p,q,l) where p and q divide l.
    # For l=2 and l=3, the corresponding triangle groups are either finite or virtually
    # abelian, which cannot have a non-abelian simple group T as a section.
    # For l=4 and l=5, while the triangle groups can be hyperbolic, more advanced
    # group-theoretic results show that these generation requirements cannot be met.
    # The condition l > 5 mentioned for type AS also hints that l <= 5 is special.
