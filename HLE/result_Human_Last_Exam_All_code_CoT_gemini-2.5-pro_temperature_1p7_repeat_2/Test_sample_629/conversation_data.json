    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalences.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent Grid Diagrams:** A grid diagram on an `n x n` grid can be represented by a pair of permutations, `(π_O, π_X)`, of `{1, ..., n}`. `π_O` defines the positions of the 'O' markers, and `π_X` defines the positions of the 'X' markers.\n2.  **Identify Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams:** The knot type is determined by the composite permutation `π = π_O⁻¹ ∘ π_X`. For a 3x3 grid (`n=3`), there are two permutations that result in a trefoil knot: one for the right-hand version, `π_R = (2, 3, 1)`, and one for the left-hand version, `π_L = (3, 1, 2)`. We will generate all possible `3! × 3! = 36` diagrams and filter for the ones corresponding to the left-hand trefoil (`π = π_L`).\n3.  **Define Equivalences:**\n    *   **Translation:** A translation is a cyclic shift of the rows or columns. We will define functions to apply these shifts to a diagram `(π_O, π_X)`.\n    *   **Rotation:** A rotation of the physical grid also transforms the diagram. However, it's a known property of grid diagrams that any rotation (90°, 180°, 270°) of a trefoil diagram transforms it into a diagram of its mirror image (the right-hand trefoil).\n4.  **Count Equivalence Classes:**\n    *   Since rotations transform a left-hand trefoil diagram into a right-hand one, two left-hand trefoil diagrams cannot be equivalent under rotation.\n    *   Therefore, the problem simplifies to counting the number of equivalence classes under translation only.\n    *   We will implement an algorithm to find the orbits of the set of left-hand trefoil diagrams under the action of translations (cyclic shifts). The number of orbits is the answer.\n\n### Python Implementation:\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will:\n1.  Define functions for permutation operations.\n2.  Generate all 36 diagrams on a 3x3 grid.\n3.  Identify the 6 diagrams representing the left-hand trefoil.\n4.  Partition these 6 diagrams into equivalence classes (orbits) based on translational equivalence.\n5.  Print the number of classes, which is the final answer.\n6.  For clarity, it also prints the diagrams found in each class.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef compose(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    # Permutations are 1-indexed, so we convert to 0-indexed for list access\n    # p = (p(1), p(2), p(3))\n    # p1 o p2 means first apply p2, then p1\n    res = [0, 0, 0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        res[i] = p1[p2[i] - 1]\n    return tuple(res)\n\ndef inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    res = [0, 0, 0]\n    for i in range(3):\n        res[p[i] - 1] = i + 1\n    return tuple(res)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot\n    up to translation and rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)))\n\n    # For n=3, the two 3-cycles correspond to the two trefoils.\n    # By convention, pi_L = (3, 1, 2) is the left-hand trefoil.\n    pi_L = (3, 1, 2)\n\n    # 1.
