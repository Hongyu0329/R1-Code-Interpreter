    "This is a fascinating linguistic challenge. My plan is to identify two languages from distinct Asian cultures with minimal historical interaction, and then compare their vocabulary for the words \"broom,\" \"mom,\" and \"dad.\"\n\nThe words \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across unrelated languages due to the nature of language acquisition in infants (babbling sounds like \"ma,\" \"pa,\" \"ba,\" \"da\" are easiest to produce). The real challenge is finding a matching word for a common object like \"broom,\" which makes this a search for a significant coincidence.\n\nAfter research, I've identified a compelling pair: **Korean** and **Persian (Farsi)**.\n\n*   **Cultures & Contact:** Korea (East Asia) and Iran (West Asia) have vastly different cultures. Their languages belong to unrelated families (Koreanic and Indo-European, respectively). While located on the same continent, they are geographically distant and have no history of significant direct contact that would lead to borrowing these specific basic words.\n*   **Word Analysis:**\n    *   **Mom/Dad:** The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" in both languages follow the universal \"nursery word\" pattern, using simple repetitive syllables.\n    *   **Broom:** This is the most striking similarity. The Korean word for broom, `bit-jaru`, is a compound of `bit` (comb) and `jaru` (handle/stick). The Persian word for broom is `jâru`. The Korean morpheme `jaru` and the complete Persian word `jâru` are nearly identical.\n\nThe following Python code will print the comparison.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_similar_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the findings for two Asian languages with similar words\n    for \"broom\", \"mom\", and \"dad\" despite having no direct contact.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    lang1 = \"Korean\"\n    lang2 = \"Persian (Farsi)\"\n\n    print(f\"The two languages are {lang1} and {lang2}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThese languages are from distinct cultures in East and West Asia and belong to different language families.\")\n    print(\"The similarities are considered coincidental or due to universal linguistic patterns (especially for 'mom' and 'dad').\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # --- Word Data ---\n    words = {\n        \"Broom\": {\n            \"lang1_word\": \"(bit)jaru\",\n            \"lang1_desc\": \"빗자루 (bit-jaru)\",\n            \"lang2_word\": \"jâru\",\n            \"lang2_desc\": \"جارو (jâru)\",\n            \"note\": \"The Korean word is a compound; the 'jaru' part, meaning 'handle', is nearly identical to the Persian word.\"\n        },\n        \"Mom\": {\n            \"lang1_word\": \"eomma\",\n            \"lang1_desc\": \"엄마 (eomma)\",\n            \"lang2_word\": \"māmān\",\n            \"lang2_desc\": \"مامان (māmān)\",\n            \"note\": \"Both are 'nursery words' based on the bilabial nasal sound 'm'.\"\n        },\n        \"Dad\": {\n            \"lang1_word\": \"appa\",\n            \"lang1_desc\": \"아빠 (appa)\",\n            \"lang2_word\": \"bābā\",\n            \"lang2_desc\": \"بابا (bābā)\",\n            \"note\": \"Both are 'nursery words' based on the repetitive bilabial plosive sound 'p' or 'b'.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Print the Comparisons ---\n    for i, (english_word, data) in enumerate(words.items(), 1):\n        print(f\"\\n{i}.
