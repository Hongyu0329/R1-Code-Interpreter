    "Of course. Here is a solution using the epsilon expansion to calculate the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The problem requires using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a core technique in the renormalization group theory for describing critical phenomena.\n2.  **Define Key Parameters:**\n    *   **Spatial dimension `d`:** Given as `d=3`.\n    *   **Upper critical dimension `d_c`:** For the wide universality classes including the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. Above this dimension, mean-field theory exponents are exact.\n    *   **Expansion parameter `ϵ`:** This small parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n    *   **Order parameter components `n`:** Since the model is not specified, I will use the most common and fundamental case: the Ising model. In the Ising model, the order parameter is a scalar (it can only be up or down), so it has `n=1` component.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order (one-loop approximation) is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that substitutes the parameters (`d=3`, `d_c=4`, `n=1`) into this formula.\n5.  **Output the Calculation:** The script will be designed to print each step of the calculation, showing how the values for `n`, `ϵ`, and other terms are plugged into the formula to arrive at the final result, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for the calculation\nd = 3      # Spatial dimension\nd_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the Ising universality class\nn = 1      # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for the Ising model)\n\n# Announce the task and the assumptions made\nprint(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent α for d=3 using the epsilon expansion.\")\nprint(f\"We assume the system belongs to the Ising universality class (n = {n}).\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate epsilon ---\n# Epsilon (ϵ) is the small parameter for the expansion, defined as d_c - d\nepsilon = d_c - d\nprint(f\"Step 1: Calculate the expansion parameter ϵ.\")\nprint(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Step 2: Apply the formula for alpha ---\n# The formula for α to first order in ϵ is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\nprint(\"Step 2: Use the first-order epsilon expansion formula for α.\")\nprint(\"The formula is: α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 3: Substitute values and calculate ---\n# Substitute the numerical values into the formula and show the calculation\nprint(\"Step 3: Substitute the values and compute the result.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting n = {n} and ϵ = {epsilon}:\")\n\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator_term_1 = 2\ndenominator_term_2 = n + 8\nfull_denominator = denominator_term_1 * denominator_term_2\n\n# Print the equation with all numbers filled in\nprint(f\"α ≈ ({4} - {n}) / ({denominator_term_1} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / ({denominator_term_1} * {denominator_term_2}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {numerator} / {full_denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n\n# Final calculation\nalpha = (numerator / full_denominator) * epsilon\n\n# Print the final result in fractional and decimal form\nprint(f\"\\nFinal result as a fraction: α ≈ {numerator}/{full_denominator} = 1/6\")\nprint(f\"Final result as a decimal: α ≈ {alpha:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
