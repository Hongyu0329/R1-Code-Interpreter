    "This is a mathematical question that can be answered through a logical proof by construction. The plan is to demonstrate that it's possible to construct a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which there are zero isometric embeddings. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, this will prove that 0 is the smallest possible number.\n\nI will write a Python script that explains this reasoning step-by-step.\n1.  Define a specific 3-point finite ultrametric space, $X$.\n2.  Choose a specific Banach space, $B$, in this case, the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  Set up the equations that an isometric embedding would require.\n4.  Show that these equations lead to a logical contradiction, proving that no such embedding can exist for this choice of $X$ and $B$.\n5.  Conclude that since it is possible for the number of embeddings to be 0, this is the smallest possible number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a\n    finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B by providing a\n    proof by construction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Problem ---\")\n    print(\"What is the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X in a Banach space B?\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Strategy ---\")\n    print(\"To find the smallest possible number, we will provide a concrete example of a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which no isometric embedding exists.\")\n    print(\"If we can show the number of embeddings is 0 for at least one case, then 0 must be the smallest possible number.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Define a Finite Ultrametric Space X ---\")\n    print(\"Let X be a space with three points {p1, p2, p3}.\")\n    print(\"Let the distances be defined as:\")\n    print(\"d(p1, p2) = 2\")\n    print(\"d(p1, p3) = 1\")\n    print(\"d(p2, p3) = 2\")\n    print(\"This space is ultrametric because the strongest triangle inequality holds, e.g., d(p1, p3) <= max(d(p1, p2), d(p2, p3)), which is 1 <= max(2, 2).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Define a Banach Space B ---\")\n    print(\"Let B be the Banach space of the real numbers, R, with the standard metric d_B(a, b) = |a - b|.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Analyze the Conditions for an Isometric Embedding ---\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> B that preserves distances.\")\n    print(\"If such a function f exists, let a = f(p1), b = f(p2), and c = f(p3).\")\n    print(\"These points a, b, c in R must satisfy:\")\n    print(\"  |a - b| = d(p1, p2) = 2\")\n    print(\"  |a - c| = d(p1, p3) = 1\")\n    print(\"  |b - c| = d(p2, p3) = 2\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 4: Show a Contradiction ---\")\n    print(\"For any three points on the real line R, one point must lie between the other two.\")\n    print(\"This implies that one of the three distances must be the exact sum of the other two.\")\n    print(\"Let's check all three possibilities:\")\n    \n    # Possibility 1: c is between a and b\n    dist_ac = 1\n    dist_cb = 2\n    dist_ab = 2\n    print(\"\\n1.
