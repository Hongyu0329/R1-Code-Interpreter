# Based on the logical deduction that the problem's conditions are best satisfied
# by a matrix M_n whose symmetric part is singular, which minimizes the target expression to 0.
# The simplest such matrix is the zero matrix, M_n = 0.

# For this M_n, any n >= 1 is a minimizer. We can choose any n_0 for the calculation.
# Let's pick n_0 = 2. The size of the matrix M_{n_0} is (2^(n_0+1) - 1).
n_0 = 2
size = 2**(n_0 + 1) - 1

# According to the logical analysis:
# 1. M_{n_0} is a size x size zero matrix.
# 2. The cofactor matrix of a zero matrix (size > 1) is a zero matrix.
# 3. The antisymmetric part of the zero cofactor matrix is a zero matrix.
# 4. The tridiagonal matrix T extracted from this is a size x size zero matrix.
T = np.zeros((size, size))

# 5. The square of T is also the zero matrix.
T_squared = np.dot(T, T)

# 6. The "largest Ky Fan norm" is the Ky Fan 1-norm (spectral norm), which is the
#    largest singular value of the matrix. For the zero matrix, all singular values are 0.

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The conceptual equation is: ||T^2|| = result
# Here, T^2 is a 7x7 zero matrix, and the result is 0.
