    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the correct ballet school, followed by a Python script that processes this information to find the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a data structure (a list of dictionaries) in Python to store information about the training methods of the ballet schools listed in the answer choices.\n2.  Each dictionary will represent a school and will contain its name and a key piece of information: whether its methodology is known for having female dancers train at the barre on pointe shoes.\n3.  The script will then iterate through this data to find the school that matches the specific training characteristic mentioned in the question.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the name of the correct school and an explanation for why it is the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes data on ballet school training methods to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data representing the general training practices of major ballet schools.\n    # This information is based on well-documented pedagogical styles.\n    schools_info = [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"A\",\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"barre_en_pointe\": False,\n            \"note\": \"Training at La Scala Theatre Ballet School is primarily based on the Italian Cecchetti method, where barre work is done in soft shoes to build foundational strength before pointe work, which is practiced separately.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"B\",\n            \"name\": \"Vaganova\",\n            \"barre_en_pointe\": False,\n            \"note\": \"The Vaganova method, taught at the Vaganova Academy, is highly structured.
