one option stands out as significantly less likely.

The least plausible explanation is H.

Reasoning: Option H is the most speculative and convoluted. It combines disparate and complex esoteric concepts (Kujiho hand seals, Taoist rituals, the body's 'nine holes,' and erotic energy) without strong historical evidence connecting them in this specific way. It also relies on a fundamental 'misinterpretation' by scribes, which is a less direct explanation than assuming the scribes accurately transcribed what they saw—whether that was empty space, placeholders for damaged text, or symbols for a mnemonic system. The other options provide much simpler, more direct, and historically sounder explanations.
