The laboratory made a mistake in believing their Quality Control (QC) evidence because the QC test was not a valid challenge for the media. They ignored the fundamental preparation error of adding the heat-labile antibiotic chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving, which destroyed it. The QC test, using sensitive vegetative cells of *Bacillus subtilis*, showed no growth, which the lab misinterpreted as a success. However, this result was misleading because the test organism was not robust enough to reveal the absence of active antibiotic. The true test came when the media was contaminated by highly resistant airborne bacterial spores, which were able to grow freely in Batch 3.
