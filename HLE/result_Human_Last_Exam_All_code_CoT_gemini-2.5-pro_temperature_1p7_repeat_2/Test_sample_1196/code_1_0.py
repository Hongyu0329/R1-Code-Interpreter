        'Introduction': "The question asks which scenario is most likely to provide a misleading association for a complex trait. A complex trait is influenced by many genes, often scattered across the genome. A 'misleading association' in this context means a result that misrepresents this complex reality, for instance, by making one gene locus seem overwhelmingly important.",
        
        'Analysis of Choices': {
            'A, B, D': "These options describe standard situations of SNPs within a single LD block. They will show an association if a causal gene is in that block. This is the basis of GWAS, not a special case for being misleading.",
            'C': "SNPs on different chromosomes are not in LD. Any association found would likely represent independent signals, which would accurately reflect the nature of a complex trait, making it the *least* misleading option.",
            'E': "This is the key. 'Tag SNPs predicting all alleles in an inherited haplotype' describe a scenario where researchers have very effectively captured the genetic signal from a single LD block (haplotype)."
        },

        'Conclusion': "A set of well-chosen Tag SNPs (Option E) will produce a very strong and clear statistical signal if that haplotype contains a causal variant. In a truly complex trait where the genetic basis is spread thin across many locations, this single, powerful signal is the most likely to be misleading. It can overshadow the weaker signals from other causal loci, leading researchers to overemphasize the importance of this one region and overlook the true polygenic nature of the trait.",
