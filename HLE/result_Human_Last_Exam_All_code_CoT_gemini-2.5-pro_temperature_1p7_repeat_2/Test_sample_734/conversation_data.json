    "This is a knowledge-based question that doesn't require coding. The answer is a specific individual from Christian history.\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed a systematic framework and specialized terminology (*rationes seminales*, or \"seminal reasons\") to account for how God could bring about new or miraculous things within the created order is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nHis theory proposed that God, at the initial moment of creation, embedded \"seeds\" or causal principles for everything that would ever come to be.\n1.  **Ordinary Natural Laws:** Most of these seeds unfold over time in a regular, predictable pattern, which we observe as the laws of nature.\n2.  **The Virgin Birth (Miracles):** A miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature, but God directly activating a seminal reason that was latent and would not have activated in the normal course of events. He is working with the nature He created, but in an extraordinary way.\n3.  **The Fall:** The changes to the world after the Fall (e.g., the ground producing thorns and thistles, pain in childbirth) can also be understood in this framework. The Fall triggered a change in which seminal reasons would become active, altering the state of the natural world from its original condition.\n\nThis single, coherent system provided the terminology to discuss both unique miracles and shifts in the general operation of the natural world.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
