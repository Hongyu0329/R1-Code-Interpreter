    This function explains the reasoning behind the lower bound on the number of queries

    # Step 1: Problem Definition
    # We are considering SQ algorithms for learning a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer
    # ReLU network under a Gaussian distribution N(0, Id_d).
    # A crucial constraint is that the query tolerance, tau, is "not negligible in d",
    # meaning tau >= 1/poly(d). This restricts the algorithm to low-precision statistical estimates.

    # Step 2: The Hardness of Parity in the SQ Model
    # A fundamental result in SQ learning theory is the hardness of the Parity problem.
    # The Parity function (calculating the XOR of input bits) on k bits is famously hard to learn.
    # Any SQ algorithm with a non-negligible tolerance (tau > 2^-k) requires at least
    # 2^Omega(k) queries to learn a function that is correlated with Parity.

    # Step 3: Embedding Parity into a Two-Layer Network
    # The expressiveness of two-hidden-layer networks allows them to "embed" a
    # Parity problem within their structure. A network with poly(d) neurons can be
    # constructed to compute a function that is highly correlated with the Parity
    # of a transformed version of its inputs.
    # - The first hidden layer can be used to discretize the continuous input space,
    #   effectively mapping the input vector x from R^d to a binary-like vector.
    # - The second hidden layer can then compute a function on these activations
    #   that correlates strongly with the Parity of the binary-like vector.
    # Therefore, any algorithm that can learn this class of networks must also be able to solve
    # the embedded Parity problem.

    # Step 4: Deriving the Lower Bound
    # Since the network embeds a Parity problem on k = Omega(d) effective dimensions,
    # the SQ lower bound for learning Parity applies.
    # The minimum number of queries (Q) is exponential in the dimension d.
    # The final equation for the lower bound is Q >= 2^Omega(d).
    
    # As requested, we output the components of this final equation.
    base = 2
    exponent_notation = "Omega(d)" # This notation means the exponent grows at least linearly with d.

    print("The final equation for the minimum number of queries (Q) is a lower bound of the form:")
    print("Q >= base ^ exponent")
    print("\nComponents of the final equation:")
    print(f"The base of the exponentiation is: {base}")
    print(f"The exponent is on the order of: {exponent_notation}")
    print("\nThis means the number of queries must be exponential in the dimension d.")
