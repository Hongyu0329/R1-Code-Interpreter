    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  State the key mathematical tool for this problem: the Fourier transform.\n2.  Explain the relationship between the moments of a function $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin ($\\xi=0$).\n3.  The relationship is $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx$.\n4.  I will write a Python script to numerically verify this relationship for a sample Schwartz function (the Gaussian function, $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$).\n5.  Using the fact that all moments are zero, we'll conclude that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin are zero.\n6.  Since the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is analytic (can be represented by its Taylor series), and its Taylor series at the origin is zero, the Fourier transform itself must be zero everywhere.\n7.  By the properties of the inverse Fourier transform, if $\\hat{f}=0$, then $f=0$.\n\nThe Python code below will demonstrate step 4, providing the numerical foundation for the argument. It calculates and compares the two sides of the identity for the first few values of $k$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nfrom scipy.misc import derivative\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the relationship between the moments of a Schwartz\n    function and the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script will demonstrate a key property used to solve the problem.\")\n    print(\"The property is: the k-th derivative of the Fourier Transform at the origin\")\n    print(\"is proportional to the k-th moment of the original function.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let's test this with a Schwartz function, f(x) = exp(-x^2).\\n\")\n\n    # Define the Schwartz function f(x) = exp(-x^2)\n    def f(x):\n        return np.exp(-x**2)\n\n    # The analytical Fourier transform of f(x) is hat{f}(xi) = sqrt(pi) * exp(-(pi*xi)^2)\n    # We define it to calculate its derivatives.
