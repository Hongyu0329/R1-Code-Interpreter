    "To solve this problem, we will compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology. For a direct product of two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, this formula relates the bounded cohomology of the product to the bounded cohomology of the individual groups. For the groups we are considering, the formula gives an isomorphism, leading to a simple relation for the dimensions.\n2.  The formula requires the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group $T$, i.e., $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for various degrees $k$. I will rely on well-established theorems from geometric group theory for these values.\n3.  Specifically, we need the following known results for Thompson's group $T$:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, which is true for any group.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, as $T$ is simple and contains no non-abelian free subgroups.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$. This is a major result from Burger and Monod, with the cohomology group being generated by the bounded Euler class.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\geq 3$. This is because the bounded cohomological dimension of $T$ is 2, a result by Monod.\n4.  Finally, I will substitute these dimension values into the Künneth formula for degree $n=4$ to compute the final answer. A Python script will perform this calculation and print the full equation as requested.\n\nThe Künneth formula for the dimension of the bounded cohomology of a product group is:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\nFor our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and $n=4$. Let $d_k = \\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$. The equation is:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = d_0 d_4 + d_1 d_3 + d_2 d_2 + d_3 d_1 + d_4 d_0 $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\n# This script computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group\n# of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, with trivial real coefficients.\n\n# The computation is based on the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology and\n# known results about the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.\n\n# Let d_k be the dimension of the k-th bounded cohomology group of T with real coefficients.\n# The known dimensions are:\n# d_0 = 1\n# d_1 = 0\n# d_2 = 1\n# d_k = 0 for k >= 3\ndims = {\n    0: 1,\n    1: 0,\n    2: 1,\n    3: 0,\n    4: 0,\n}\n\n# We want to compute the dimension for degree n=4.\nn = 4\n\n# According to the Künneth formula, the dimension is the sum of products:\n# dim H_b^4(T x T) = d_0*d_4 + d_1*d_3 + d_2*d_2 + d_3*d_1 + d_4*d_0\n\nterms = []\ntotal_dimension = 0\n\nfor p in range(n + 1):\n    q = n - p\n    dim_p = dims.get(p, 0)\n    dim_q = dims.get(q, 0)\n    \n    # Calculate the product for the current term in the sum\n    term_value = dim_p * dim_q\n    \n    # Add the value to the total dimension\n    total_dimension += term_value\n    \n    # Store the string representation of the term for the final equation\n    terms.append(f\"{dim_p} * {dim_q}\")\n\n# Construct the full equation string\nequation_string = \" + \".join(terms)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number and the result\nprint(f\"The dimension is computed by the following sum:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_string} = {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<1>>>"
