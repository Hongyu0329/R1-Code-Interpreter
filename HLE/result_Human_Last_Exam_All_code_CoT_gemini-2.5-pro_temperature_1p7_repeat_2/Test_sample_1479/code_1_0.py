# The problem is a multiple-choice question about the theoretical difference
# between type-2 and type-3 fuzzy membership functions.
# No code is needed to solve the problem itself, but the user requested a code block.
# This block will simply state the logic and print the chosen answer.

# Step 1: Analyze the structure of a Type-2 Membership Function (MF).
# A Type-2 MF, Î¼_A(x, u), models uncertainty in membership. It's a function
# of two variables:
# - x: the primary input variable from the universe of discourse.
# - u: the primary membership value for x.
# The function's domain is two-dimensional.

# Step 2: Analyze the structure of a Type-3 Membership Function (MF).
# A Type-3 MF adds another layer of uncertainty. It's a function
# of three variables:
# - x: the primary input variable.
# - u: the secondary variable (representing primary membership).
# - v: the tertiary variable (representing the secondary membership of u).
# The function's domain is three-dimensional.

# Step 3: Identify the fundamental difference in dimensional structure.
# The core change is the increase in the number of variables that define the
# membership function's domain, from two variables for Type-2 to three for Type-3.

# Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.
# A. Models deeper linguistic vagueness - This is a consequence, not the structure.
# B. Tertiary variable layer added - Correct, but less precise than describing the whole domain.
# C. Expanded to three-variable domain - This is the most accurate and fundamental description of the structural change.
# D. Tertiary MF supports higher complexity - A consequence, not the structure itself.
# E. Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling added - This describes the move from Type-1 to Type-2.
# F. Tertiary membership functions introduced - True, but a component of the new structure.
# G. Adds tertiary layer integration - Vague terminology.
# H. Introduces multi-level MF structure - Not specific enough; Type-2 is already multi-level vs. Type-1.
# I. Includes tertiary uncertainty variable - Correct, but "three-variable domain" is more complete.
# J. Adds tertiary MF for refinement - This describes a purpose, not the structure.

# Conclusion: Option C is the most precise answer.
