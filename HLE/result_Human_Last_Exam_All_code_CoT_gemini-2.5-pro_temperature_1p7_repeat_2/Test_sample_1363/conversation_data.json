    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the specific ballroom dance where overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible without breaking the fundamental rules of that dance. This requires knowledge of the technical characteristics of the five standard ballroom dances listed.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Dance:**\n    *   **Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep:** These are all \"swing\" dances. They are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, rise and fall, and body sway. In these dances, turns can often be overturned (rotated more than the standard amount) for choreographic effect, and while it might be advanced, it doesn't fundamentally violate the dance's core principles of CBM (Contra Body Movement) and swing.\n    *   **European Tango:** This dance is unique. It is a \"staccato\" dance, not a swing dance. Its technique explicitly forbids body sway and rise and fall. Turns in Tango are executed as sharp, progressive pivots or swivels. A standard Reverse Turn has a very precise, non-continuous structure. Attempting to add extra rotation (overturning) would invariably force the dancers to introduce swing and sway, which fundamentally disregards and violates the core technique of the Tango.\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to present this answer.\n    *   The script will map the letter choices to numerical values (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.).\n    *   I will create a simple \"equation\" to fulfill the user's prompt, which will be `Correct Answer = 3`, clearly identifying 'C' as the solution.\n    *   The script will print this \"equation\" and the final, reasoned answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a technical ballroom dance question and provides the correct answer with reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Viennese Waltz', 'number': 1},\n        'B': {'name': 'English Waltz', 'number': 2},\n        'C': {'name': 'European Tango', 'number': 3},\n        'D': {'name': 'Slow Foxtrott', 'number': 4},\n        'E': {'name': 'Quickstep', 'number': 5}\n    }\n\n    correct_choice_letter = 'C'\n    correct_choice_info = options[correct_choice_letter]\n\n    # Reasoning:\n    # The European Tango is fundamentally different from the other four standard dances.\n    # It is a staccato, non-swing dance with no rise & fall or body sway.\n    # Turns in Tango are sharp and precise. The Reverse Turn in Tango has a very\n    # specific structure. Attempting to \"overturn\" it (add more rotation) would\n    # require introducing continuous movement and sway, which is a direct violation of\n    # the core Tango technique. In contrast, the other four are swing dances where\n    # overturning figures is a common and accepted practice in advanced choreography.\n    \n    print(\"Let the multiple-choice options be represented by numbers:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key} = {value['number']} ({value['name']})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe solution can be found in the following equation, where the number represents the correct choice:\")\n    \n    # The final equation as requested, printing each number\n    print(f\"Correct Answer = {correct_choice_info['number']}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the answer is {correct_choice_letter}: {correct_choice_info['name']}.\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
