    This function explains the required parameter for the Maxwell's demon apparatus to work.

    The apparatus uses a one-way door (a Brownian ratchet) to separate two
    compartments of gas. For this door to function perfectly and collect all gas
    on one side, it must not be subject to the same random thermal motion as the
    gas itself. If the door and gas are at the same temperature, the door's own
    thermal jiggling will make it open randomly for molecules from both directions,
    resulting in no net change.

    To be a perfect one-way valve, the door mechanism must have zero thermal energy.
    This condition is met only at a specific temperature.
