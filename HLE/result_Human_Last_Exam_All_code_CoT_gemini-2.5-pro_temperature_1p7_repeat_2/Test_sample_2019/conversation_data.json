    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Toroidal Board:** A toroidal board wraps around both horizontally and vertically. This means that for a queen placed at `(r, c)`, the attacks are calculated using modulo arithmetic. On a 5x5 board, an attack occurs if two queens `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` satisfy any of the following conditions:\n    *   **Same Row:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Same Column:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Same Diagonal:** `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    *   **Same Anti-diagonal:** `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n\n2.  **Devise a Strategy:** A backtracking algorithm is a suitable method for this kind of combinatorial search problem. The algorithm will systematically explore all possible placements of the 4 queens.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Details:**\n    *   We will represent the 25 squares on the board with a linear index from 0 to 24 (where `index = row * 5 + col`).\n    *   We will place one queen at a time, making sure each new queen does not attack any previously placed ones.\n    *   To avoid counting permutations of the same set of squares as different solutions, we enforce an ordering. When placing the `k`-th queen, we only consider squares with an index greater than the index of the `(k-1)`-th queen.\n    *   A recursive function will handle the placement. The function will have parameters for the number of queens already placed (`k`) and the list of their positions.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when 4 queens have been successfully placed. When this happens, we increment a solution counter.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The plan will be implemented in a Python script. This script will define a function to check for safe placements and a recursive solver function to find all valid configurations. Finally, it will print the total count.\n\n```python\n# The size of the board\nN = 5\n# The number of queens to place\nQ = 4\n\n# A global variable to store the total count of solutions\nsolution_count = 0\n\ndef is_safe(r, c, placements):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe with respect to the queens\n    already in 'placements'.\n    On a toroidal board, attacks are checked using modulo arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n    for pr, pc in placements:\n        # Check for same row or same column (this check is sufficient for standard boards)\n        if r == pr or c == pc:\n            return False\n        # Check for same diagonal, which wraps around the board\n        if (r - c) % N == (pr - pc) % N:\n            return False\n        # Check for same anti-diagonal, which also wraps around\n        if (r + c) % N == (pr + pc) % N:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens(k, start_index, placements):\n    \"\"\"\n    A recursive function to find solutions using backtracking.\n    k: The number of queens already placed.\n    start_index: The linear index on the board to start searching from.
