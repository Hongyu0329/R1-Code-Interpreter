    # Analysis:
    # The question asks for a mechanism for both RETENTION and DIVERGENCE.
    # Options A, B, and E are unsuitable for the reasons listed above.
    # We are left with C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization).
    #
    # Subfunctionalization provides a compelling model for how a duplicate gene can be
    # preserved from being lost. By having each copy lose a different, non-essential
    # subfunction of the original gene, both copies become necessary for the organism.
    # This process relies on relatively common loss-of-function mutations.
    #
    # Neofunctionalization requires a rarer gain-of-function mutation to occur before
    # the redundant gene is silenced.
    #
    # Therefore, because it provides an easier evolutionary path for the initial PRESERVATION
    # of the duplicate gene, subfunctionalization is considered a very likely, and
    # arguably the most frequent, mechanism for retaining duplicates, which can then diverge further.
