    "Of the choices provided, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid and important mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. To determine which is \"most likely,\" we need to consider the evolutionary steps required for each.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A gene is duplicated. Initially, the second copy is redundant. Without positive selection, it's likely to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional pseudogene (pseudogenization), which is the most common fate.\n2.  **The Challenge:** For the duplicate gene to be retained, it must acquire a beneficial role before it's lost.\n3.  **Evaluating the Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Neofunctionalization (C):** One copy must acquire a *new, beneficial function* through mutation. While this is a major source of evolutionary novelty, it depends on the relatively rare occurrence of a gain-of-function mutation happening before the gene is silenced.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization (D):** This model proposes that the original ancestral gene had multiple functions (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy can lose a different subfunction through common, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations. The result is that both copies are now required to perform the complete original set of functions. This \"locks in\" both copies, ensuring their retention.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The subfunctionalization model provides a more probable pathway for the *initial retention* of duplicate genes because it relies on common, often neutral, loss-of-function mutations to make both copies indispensable. This overcomes the major hurdle of preserving the duplicate gene long enough for further evolution to occur. For this reason, it is often considered the most likely mechanism for widespread duplicate gene retention.\n\nI will now create a Python script to formalize this reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence\n    of duplicate genes and identifies the most likely one.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': \"Gene conversion: A process that homogenizes sequences, working against divergence.\",\n        'B': \"Pseudogenization: The process where a gene becomes non-functional.

This is a powerful retention mechanism relying on more common loss-of-function mutations.\",\n        'E': \"Adaptive radiation: A macro-evolutionary process, not a specific molecular mechanism for gene fates.\"\n    }\n\n    # Analysis:\n    # The question asks for a mechanism for both RETENTION and DIVERGENCE.\n    # Options A, B, and E are unsuitable for the reasons listed above.\n    # We are left with C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization).\n    #\n    # Subfunctionalization provides a compelling model for how a duplicate gene can be\n    # preserved from being lost.
