    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your question.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Complexity:** The \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio is not a single, universally fixed value. It depends on several factors, including the specific synthesis method, catalyst morphology, particle size, and the precise operating conditions (temperature, pressure) of the reaction.\n2.  **Explain the Principle:** The goal is to maximize the number of active sites at the interface between Nickel (Ni) and Ceria (CeOâ‚‚). Ni provides the primary catalytic activity, while Ceria acts as a support that provides oxygen vacancies, enhancing the reaction mechanism. Too little Ni results in too few active sites. Too much Ni leads to the formation of large Ni particles (agglomeration), which reduces the active surface area and the beneficial Ni-Ceria interface. Therefore, catalytic performance typically follows a \"volcano plot\" where there is an optimal loading range.\n3.  **Provide the Optimal Range:** Based on numerous scientific studies, the optimal performance for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions is typically found within a specific range of molar ratios.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that defines this optimal range and prints a clear explanation, including a structured output that presents the final values as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef find_optimal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the generally accepted optimal Ni/Ce ratio\n    for catalytic applications like Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The ideal ratio is a range, not a single number, due to variance in\n    # synthesis, conditions, and catalyst morphology. The goal is to maximize\n    # the Ni-Ceria interface without causing Ni particle agglomeration.\n\n    # Based on scientific literature, the optimal molar ratio of Ni to Ce\n    # is often found in the following range.\n    lower_bound_molar_ratio = 0.1\n    upper_bound_molar_ratio = 0.3\n\n    print(\"--- Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio for Catalysis ---\")\n    print(\"The catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles depends on maximizing the synergistic interface.\")\n    print(\"\\n- Too little Ni: Insufficient active sites.\")\n    print(\"- Too much Ni: Particle agglomeration, reducing active surface area.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBased on scientific literature, the optimal performance is typically achieved when the molar ratio of Ni/Ce is within a specific range.\")\n\n    # The final \"equation\" displaying each number in the optimal range.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation for Optimal Range:\")\n    print(f\"Optimal_Ni/Ce_Molar_Ratio = [{lower_bound_molar_ratio}, {upper_bound_molar_ratio}]\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis means for every 10 moles of Cerium (Ce), an ideal amount of Nickel (Ni) would be between 1 and 3 moles.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_optimal_ni_ce_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<A Ni/Ce molar ratio between 0.1 and 0.3 is generally considered ideal to maximize catalytic performance.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Ni-Ceria nanoparticles have shown promising catalytic properties for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS).
