# The diameter of the quarter-sphere package is given.
package_diameter = 250.0

# We use the derived formula to find the maximum diameter (d) of the sphere that can fit inside.
# The formula is: d = D / (sqrt(3) + 1), where D is the package diameter.

# Calculate the value of the denominator.
denominator = math.sqrt(3) + 1

# Calculate the maximum diameter of the inscribed sphere.
sphere_diameter = package_diameter / denominator

# Print the final equation with each number and the result.
