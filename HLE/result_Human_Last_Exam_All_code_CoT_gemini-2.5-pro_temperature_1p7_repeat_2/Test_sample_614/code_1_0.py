# The riddle describes the order of five numbers.
# Based on the analysis of the clues, the sequence has been determined.
# This script will print the final ordered sequence of numbers.

# The determined order is 2, followed by 4, then 1, then 3, and finally 0.
num1 = 2
num2 = 4
num3 = 1
num4 = 3
num5 = 0

# The prompt asks to output each number in the "final equation".
# We will display the sequence of numbers as the solution.
print(f"The numbers in the correct order are: {num1} {num2} {num3} {num4} {num5}")
