    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations that govern these diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** We'll assume the most common interacting scalar field theory, which is the $\\phi^4$ theory. In this theory, every interaction vertex connects four lines (propagators).\n2.  **Use Topological Formulas:** There are two key formulas that relate the number of loops (L), vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E) for any connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   The general formula for the number of loops: `L = I - V + 1`\n    *   A formula based on the vertex type. For a $\\phi^4$ theory (4 lines per vertex), the total count of line ends is `4 * V`. These ends form internal lines (connecting two vertices) or external lines (connecting to one vertex). This gives: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`\n3.  **Solve for V:** We will solve this system of two equations to express the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of loops (L) and external lines (E).\n    *   From the first formula, we can write `I = L + V - 1`.\n    *   Substitute this expression for `I` into the second formula:\n        `4 * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E`\n        `4 * V = 2*L + 2*V - 2 + E`\n        `2 * V = 2*L - 2 + E`\n        `V = L - 1 + E / 2`\n4.  **Find the Minimum:** The problem specifies `L=2`. To find the *minimum* number of vertices `V`, we must find the minimum possible value for the number of external lines, `E`. The smallest non-negative integer `E` can be is 0 (representing a vacuum diagram, with no incoming or outgoing particles).\n5.  **Calculate:** We will set `L=2` and `E=0` in our final formula and calculate the minimum `V`. The code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of loops in the diagram.\nL = 2\n\n# To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we must use the minimum\n# possible number of external lines (E). The absolute minimum is E=0, which\n# corresponds to a vacuum diagram.\nE = 0\n\n# The number of vertices (V) in a phi^4 theory is related to the number\n# of loops (L) and external lines (E) by the formula: V = L - 1 + E / 2.\n# We will now calculate the minimum number of vertices.\nmin_V = L - 1 + E / 2\n\nprint(\"For a Feynman diagram in an interacting scalar field theory (phi^4):\")\nprint(f\"The number of vertices (V) is given by the formula: V = L - 1 + E / 2\")\nprint(f\"Where L is the number of loops and E is the number of external lines.\\n\")\nprint(\"To find the minimum number of vertices for L=2 loops, we must use the minimum number of external lines, which is E=0.\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the minimum number of vertices:\")\nprint(f\"V_min = {L} - 1 + {E} / 2\")\nprint(f\"V_min = {int(min_V)}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimum number of vertices is {int(min_V)}.
