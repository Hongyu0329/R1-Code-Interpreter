1.  **Symptom Analysis:** The patient exhibits signs of a complete right Cranial Nerve III (Oculomotor) palsy.
    *   **Pupillary Reflex:** The absence of a pupillary light reflex indicates a lesion of the parasympathetic fibers carried by CN III.
    *   **Eye Movements:** The inability to adduct, depress, and elevate the eye corresponds to paralysis of the medial rectus, inferior rectus, superior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, all of which are innervated by CN III.

2.  **Anatomical Correlation:** The next step is to locate the origin of Cranial Nerve III among the choices.
    *   The nuclei for Cranial Nerve III (the oculomotor nucleus and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus) are located in the **midbrain**.
    *   A lesion in the midbrain, due to the described trauma (MVA with fracture) or stroke, would damage these nuclei or the nerve itself as it exits the brainstem.

3.  **Evaluating Other Options:**
    *   Cranial Nerve VI (Abducens) palsy affects abduction.
    *   Cranial Nerve VII (Facial) palsy affects facial muscles.
    *   The medulla oblongata and reticular formation do not contain the CN III nucleus.

4.  **Conclusion:** The patient's presentation is best explained by damage to the midbrain.
