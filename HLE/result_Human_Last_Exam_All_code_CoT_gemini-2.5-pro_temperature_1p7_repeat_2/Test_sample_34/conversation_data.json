    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis and the code to provide the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The question specifies a 100BB deep, 6-max, rake-free cash game. The action is an open-raise from the button (BTN). This position is the most profitable on the table, allowing for the widest opening range. The absence of rake further incentivizes opening a wider range of hands, as even marginally profitable hands don't have their winnings diminished.\n2.  **Consult GTO Strategy:** Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts provide a baseline for which hands are profitable to play. For a 100BB rake-free game, GTO strategy dictates that the button should open-raise an extremely wide range, often exceeding 45-50% of all possible hands.\n3.  **Identify Suited Jacks (JXs):** We need to look at the suited jack combinations: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n4.  **Determine the \"Worst\" Hand:** In this specific scenario (BTN open, no rake), GTO strategy considers *all* suited jacks to be profitable open-raises. The \"worst\" hand that you should still open is therefore the one with the lowest pre-flop equity and post-flop playability. This is determined by the kicker.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The hand J2s has the lowest kicker. It is dominated by all other Jx hands and has weaker straight potential compared to hands like J5s. While it is still a profitable open-raise from the button in this format, it is the weakest, or \"worst,\" among all the suited jacks you should be opening.\n\nBased on this, the following python code will print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_question():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the worst suited jack to open from the button\n  in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on GTO principles.\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # In poker, the strength of a suited jack hand (JXs) is primarily\n  # determined by its kicker (the 'X' card).\n  # A higher kicker means higher equity and better straight possibilities.\n  # The list of suited jacks from best to worst is:\n  # JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n\n  # In a 100BB rake-free game, opening from the button is extremely profitable,\n  # and a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) range includes all suited jacks.\n\n  # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest equity that is still\n  # considered a standard, profitable raise.\n  worst_suited_jack_to_open = \"J2s\"\n\n  print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack_to_open}\")\n\nsolve_poker_question()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
