    print("Step 1: The repair method is a 'build-up of layers of filler material' using TIG welding.")
    print("This means the process is additive, designed to replace material that has been removed from the blade.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the damage types.")
    print(" - Cracking (A, E) and Creep Deformation (D) are not fixed by adding layers of material.")
    print(" - Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is a primary mechanism of material loss at the blade tip.")
