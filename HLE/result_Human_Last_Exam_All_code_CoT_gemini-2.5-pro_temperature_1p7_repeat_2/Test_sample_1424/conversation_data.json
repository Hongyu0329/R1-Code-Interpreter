    "Of course. In the context of quantum many-body theory and the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the relationship:** First, I will state the well-known formula for the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, which shows its dependence on the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ and frequency $\\omega$.\n2.  **Explain the terms:** I will briefly explain each term in the formula ($\\hbar$, $\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, and the infinitesimal term $i\\delta$) to provide context.\n3.  **Provide a Python script for illustration:** I will write a Python script that defines the parameters ($\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$, $\\delta$) and calculates a specific value for $G_0$. The script will print out each step of the calculation to clearly demonstrate the formula and the inverse relationship.\n\nHere is the Python code to demonstrate the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the bare Green's function G_0 for a given set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # In quantum mechanics, energy and frequency are related by E = ħω.\n    # For simplicity in many theoretical calculations, it's common to use units where ħ=1.\n    hbar = 1.0\n\n    # Let's choose an example frequency and a single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n    # omega represents the frequency (related to the energy of the propagating particle).\n    omega = 2.5\n    # epsilon_k is the energy of a single-particle state with momentum 'k'.\n    epsilon_k = 2.0\n    # delta is a small positive infinitesimal.
