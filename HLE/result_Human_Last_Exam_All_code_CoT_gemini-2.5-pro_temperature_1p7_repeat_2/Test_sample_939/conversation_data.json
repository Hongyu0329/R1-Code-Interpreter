    "To solve this, we need to convert each ROMM RGB color to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting R, G, or B components are outside the valid range of [0.0, 1.0], the color cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code and is considered \"out-of-gamut\".\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space has a much wider gamut (range of representable colors) than sRGB, particularly in the greens and blues. Therefore, highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB often fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script with the `colour-science` library, which is the standard for accurate color space conversions. The script will:\n1.  Define each of the five ROMM RGB colors.\n2.  Convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space (which is technically named 'ProPhoto RGB') to the standard sRGB color space.\n3.  Check if the converted sRGB values are within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n4.  Identify which colors are out-of-gamut.\n5.  Print a summary of the check for each color.\n6.  Finally, output the list of numbers corresponding to the colors that cannot be represented.\n\nThis script requires the `colour-science` and `numpy` libraries. You can install them using pip:\n`pip install colour-science numpy`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB colors from a predefined list fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the input ROMM RGB colors\n    colors_to_check = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1.0]),     # Pure ROMM Blue\n        2: np.array([0, 1.0, 0]),     # Pure ROMM Green\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),   # A cyan color\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]), # A desaturated blue\n        5: np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])  # White point (D50)\n    }\n\n    # Define the source (ROMM RGB) and target (sRGB) color spaces\n    romm_rgb_cs = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_PROPHOTO_RGB\n    srgb_cs = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB\n\n    out_of_gamut_numbers = []\n\n    print(\"--- Checking ROMM RGB to sRGB Conversion ---\")\n\n    # Iterate through the colors, convert them, and check the gamut\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors_to_check.items()):\n        # Perform the color space conversion\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, romm_rgb_cs, srgb_cs)\n\n        # A color is out-of-gamut if any component is < 0 or > 1.\n        # A small tolerance is used for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any((srgb_color < -1e-5) | (srgb_color > 1 + 1e-5))\n\n        print(f\"\\nChecking Color #{number}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\" -> Converted to sRGB: ({srgb_color[0]:.4f}, {srgb_color[1]:.4f}, {srgb_color[2]:.4f})\")\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_numbers.append(number)\n            print(\" -> Result: CANNOT be represented in sRGB (Out of Gamut).\")\n        else:\n            print(\" -> Result: Can be represented in sRGB (In Gamut).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    if not out_of_gamut_numbers:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_numbers)))\n\n    print(f\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are: {final_answer}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    check_romm_to_srgb_gamut()\n<<<1, 2, 3, 5>>>\n```"
