# This program explains why the function `def_superfast` from the prompt is uncomputable.

print("The question is whether a program P can exist that computes `def_superfast(10000)`.")
print("The answer is NO.\n")

print("REASONING:")
print("1. To compute `def_superfast(10000)`, a program must first find `Huge_int`.")
print("2. `Huge_int` is defined as the largest integer returned by any valid Python program with a source code length of less than 10000 characters.")
print("3. To find `Huge_int`, the program must be able to identify all such programs. This involves testing every possible string of code under 10000 characters.")
print("4. For each candidate string, the program must determine if it represents a Python program that will *halt* (i.e., not run forever) and return an integer.")
print("5. The problem of determining whether an arbitrary program will halt is known as the Halting Problem.")
print("6. The Halting Problem is famously unsolvable. Alan Turing proved that no general algorithm can exist that solves the Halting Problem for all possible programs.")
print("7. Because computing `def_superfast(10000)` would require solving the Halting Problem, the function is uncomputable.\n")

print("Therefore, no program P can be written to compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")

# The problem refers to the value def_superfast(10000). Let's print the number from the problem.
print("\nThe number from the pseudo-code is: 10000")

# Final answer to the question "Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?"
print("<<<No>>>")
