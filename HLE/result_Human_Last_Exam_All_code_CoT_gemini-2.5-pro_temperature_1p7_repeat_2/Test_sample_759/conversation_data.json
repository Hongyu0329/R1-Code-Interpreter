    "The user is asking for the smallest number of edges, `e`, for a simple, connected graph `gamma` such that the size of its automorphism group, `|Aut(gamma)|`, is exactly 3.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the problem**: The automorphism group `Aut(gamma)` consists of all symmetry operations (permutations of vertices that preserve adjacency) on the graph. We are looking for the smallest graph `gamma` (in terms of number of edges `e`) for which this group has exactly 3 elements. Since 3 is a prime number, this group must be the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n2.  **Recall/Research Graph Theory Results**: This is a classic problem in algebraic graph theory. Frucht's theorem states that any finite group can be realized as the automorphism group of some graph. The search for the *smallest* such graph for a given group is a common topic.\n3.  **Identify the Smallest Graph**: According to the literature (e.g., C.Y. Chao, \"On the smallest graphs with prescribed odd order automorphism group\", 1965), the smallest simple, connected graph with automorphism group `Z_3` has 9 vertices and 9 edges.\n4.  **Describe the Graph's Structure**: I will describe the structure of this 9-vertex, 9-edge graph. It can be constructed from three \"orbits\" of 3 vertices each, let's call them `A = {a1, a2, a3}`, `B = {b1, b2, b3}`, and `C = {c1, c2, c3}`. The `Z_3` symmetry acts by cyclically permuting the indices within each orbit (e.g., `a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> a1`). The edges are defined in three sets, each with 3 edges, to respect this symmetry.\n    *   A cycle graph `C_3` is formed on the vertices of orbit `B`.\n    *   The vertices of orbit `A` are connected as \"spokes\" to orbit `B`.\n    *   The vertices of orbit `C` are also connected as \"spokes\" to `B`, but in a \"twisted\" manner to break reflectional symmetries that would otherwise exist.\n5.  **Write the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that builds this graph using the `networkx` library. The script will define the three sets of edges, add them to the graph, and then verify the total number of edges. Finally, it will print out the calculation, showing how the total of 9 edges is reached, as requested by the \"final equation\" part of the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# The problem asks for the smallest number of edges 'e' in a simple,\n# connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.\n# According to literature in algebraic graph theory, the smallest such graph\n# consists of 9 vertices and 9 edges.
