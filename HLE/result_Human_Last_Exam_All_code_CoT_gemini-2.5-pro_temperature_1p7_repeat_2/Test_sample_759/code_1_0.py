# The problem asks for the smallest number of edges 'e' in a simple,
# connected graph with an automorphism group of size 3.
# According to literature in algebraic graph theory, the smallest such graph
# consists of 9 vertices and 9 edges. We will construct this graph to demonstrate 'e'.

# The graph has 9 vertices, which we can partition into three sets (orbits)
# of 3 vertices each: A={a1,a2,a3}, B={b1,b2,b3}, C={c1,c2,c3}.
# We can represent these vertices with numbers 1 through 9.
# a1-a3 -> 1-3
# b1-b3 -> 4-6
# c1-c3 -> 7-9

# The 9 edges are composed of three sets, each of size 3.

# Edge Set 1: A 3-cycle on the vertices of orbit B.
# Edges: (b1,b2), (b2,b3), (b3,b1)

# Edges: (a1,b1), (a2,b2), (a3,b3)
edges_a_to_b = [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
G.add_edges_from(edges_a_to_b)
num_edges2 = len(edges_a_to_b)

# Edge Set 3: Edges connecting orbit C to orbit B "twisted".
# This specific connection pattern is crucial to break symmetries
# that would make the automorphism group larger than 3.
# Edges: (c1,b2), (c2,b3), (c3,b1)
edges_c_to_b = [(7, 5), (8, 6), (9, 4)]
