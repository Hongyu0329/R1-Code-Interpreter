    "Of course. Here is a Python script to solve this quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a certain interval is found by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval. The normalized wave function `ψ_n(x)` for a 1D box of length 'a' is `sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a)`. Therefore, the probability density is `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n2.  **Set up the integral:** We need to calculate the integral of `P(x)` from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a` for the quantum state `n = 2`. The integral is:\n    `Probability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx`\n3.  **Simplify and solve:** The result of this integral is independent of the box length 'a'. We can simplify the calculation by setting `a = 1`. This makes the interval `[0.495, 0.505]` and the integrand `2 * sin²(2*π*x)`.\n4.  **Use Python for numerical integration:** I will use the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library to perform a highly accurate numerical integration, which is the standard method for solving such definite integrals. The script will print the full equation being solved and then the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the constants for the problem.\n# We set the box length 'a' to 1 because the final probability is independent of it.\nn = 2\na = 1.0\nx1 = 0.495 * a\nx2 = 0.505 * a\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function to be integrated.\n# This is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction: |ψ_n(x)|²\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Probability density function for a particle in a 1D box.\n    P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a)\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the probability by integrating the density function over the interval [x1, x2].\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error, we only need the result.\nprobability, _ = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.\n# The equation is shown for a=1, as used in the calculation.\nprint(\"The probability is calculated by integrating the probability density function P(x) over the interval.\")\nprint(\"The final equation with the specified values (using a=1 for calculation) is:\")\nprint(f\"Probability = Integral from {x1} to {x2} of (2/{a}) * sin^2({n} * pi * x / {a}) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nResult:\")\nprint(f\"The probability that the particle is located in the interval from {x1}a to {x2}a for n={n} is: {probability}\")\nprint(f\"In scientific notation, the probability is approximately: {probability:.3e}\")\n\n```\n<<<6.579564032431787e-06>>>"
