def solve_integral():
    """
    This function explains the steps to solve the definite integral and calculates the final value.
    The integral is I = I1 + I2.
    I1 = integral from 0 to 2 of 2**(-1/16) * tan(asin(x**4 / (16 * sqrt(2)))) dx
    I2 = integral from 0 to 2 of 2**(1/16) * (sin(atan(x/2)))**(1/4) dx

    The solution involves substitutions that lead to cancellation.
    For I1, we use x**4 / (16 * sqrt(2)) = sin(phi). This gives I1 = 2**(-15/16) * J.
    For I2, we use x/2 = tan(theta). This gives I2 = 2**(17/16) * K.
    where J = integral from 0 to pi/4 of (sin(t))**(1/4) dt
    and K = integral from 0 to pi/4 of (sin(t))**(1/4) * sec(t)**2 dt.
    
    Using integration by parts, we can show that K = 2**(-1/8) - (1/4)*J.
    So, I2 = 2**(17/16) * (2**(-1/8) - (1/4)*J) = 2**(15/16) - 2**(-15/16)*J.
    The total integral I = I1 + I2, and the J terms cancel out.
