    A contract of adhesion is a 'take-it-or-leave-it' contract where one party has little power.
    Courts may invalidate terms that a user would not reasonably expect to be included.

    Clause G is the strongest example of this. It states that a user's simple action,
    like 'liking' content, grants the service permission to use the user's identity
    (username, profile picture) in advertisements connected to that content.

    A reasonable person would likely not expect this consequence. They are not explicitly
    agreeing to endorse a product in an ad; they are simply liking a post. This use of a
    user's likeness for commercial purposes, without compensation, is a material term
    that is often buried in the terms of service. It perfectly fits the description
    of a term that takes advantage of unequal bargaining power and violates the
    'doctrine of reasonable expectations'.
