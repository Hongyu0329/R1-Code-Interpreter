1.  **Problem Classification**: The problem is to minimize the loss $L(w) = E_{x}[\\log(1 + \\exp(x^\\top w))]$ subject to $\|w\| \\leq D$. This is a stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problem.
    *   **Convexity**: The loss function $\\log(1 + \\exp(z))$ is convex. Since $x^\\top w$ is linear in $w$, the instantaneous loss $l(w,x) = \\log(1 + \\exp(x^\\top w))$ is convex in $w$. The expectation of convex functions preserves convexity, so $L(w)$ is convex.
    *   **Bounded Stochastic Gradients**: The gradient of the instantaneous loss is $\\nabla_w l(w,x) = \\sigma(x^\\top w) x$, where $\\sigma(z) = 1/(1+e^{-z})$ is the sigmoid function. Given $\|x\| \\leq 1$ and $0 < \\sigma(z) < 1$, the norm of the stochastic gradient is bounded: $\|\\nabla_w l(w,x)\| = |\\sigma(x^\\top w)| \\|x\| \leq 1$. Let's denote this bound by $G=1$.
    *   **Bounded Domain**: The optimization variable $w$ is constrained to a ball of radius $D$.

2.  **Minimax Optimal Rate**: For the general class of stochastic convex optimization problems over a domain of radius $D$ with stochastic gradients bounded by $G$, the minimax optimal rate of convergence for any algorithm is known to be $\\Theta(DG/\\sqrt{T})$. Given $G=1$, the rate for this problem is:
    Rate$(T, D) = \\Theta(D / \\sqrt{T})$

3.  **Using the Specified Regime**: The problem states we are "in the regime $T = O(e^D)$". This mathematical statement means that $T$ is upper-bounded by a constant multiple of $e^D$, i.e., $T \leq C \\cdot e^D$. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives $\\log(T) \leq \\log(C) + D$. For large $T$ and $D$, this implies that $D$ must grow at least as fast as $\\log(T)$. We can write this relationship as $D = \\Omega(\\log T)$.

4.  **Deriving the Final Rate**: We substitute this relationship $D = \\Omega(\\log T)$ into the optimal rate expression:
    Rate$(T) = \\Theta(D / \\sqrt{T}) = \\Theta(\\Omega(\\log T) / \\sqrt{T}) = \\Omega((\\log T) / \\sqrt{T})$
    An upper bound of $O(D/\\sqrt{T})$ can be achieved by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. Thus, the rate is tightly characterized as $\\Theta((\\log T) / \\sqrt{T})$.

5.  **Conclusion**: Let's compare this derived rate with the given options.
    *   A. $\\Theta(1/T)$: Incorrect.
    *   B. $\\Theta(1/T^{2/3})$: Incorrect.
    *   C. $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{T})$: Incorrect. The rate $\\Theta((\\log T) / \\sqrt{T})$ is asymptotically slower than $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{T})$ due to the $\\log T$ factor.
    *   E. It depends on the dimension $d$: Incorrect. The rate for SCO over an L2 ball with an L2-norm constraint is generally independent of the ambient dimension $d$.

    Since none of the options A, B, C, or E match our derived rate, the correct choice is D.

The final equation for the optimal rate as a function of T can be written in the form: Rate(T) = C * (log T)^a * T^b
I will now print the numbers corresponding to the exponents in this equation.
