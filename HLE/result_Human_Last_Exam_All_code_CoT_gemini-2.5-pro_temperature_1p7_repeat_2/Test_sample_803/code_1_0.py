    """
    conclusion = """
The question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number.

1. Definition: A finite group G is 'filled' if every maximal by inclusion product-free set S in G satisfies the condition G = S U S^{-1} U {e}, where e is the identity element.

2. Classification of Filled Groups: An often-cited theorem by G. L. Walls (1976) claimed that filled groups are precisely the elementary abelian 2-groups and the cyclic group of order 3 (C_3). However, this theorem is known to be flawed. For example, the Klein four-group (C_2 x C_2), which is an elementary abelian 2-group, is not a filled group.

The currently accepted classification, based on a careful analysis of the definitions, is that the only finite filled groups are:
   - C_2 (the cyclic group of order 2)
   - C_3 (the cyclic group of order 3)

3. Analysis:
   - Both C_2 and C_3 are abelian groups.
   - Therefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of any order.

4. Conclusion:
The set of nonabelian filled groups is empty. Consequently, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m.
