    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I will find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu boss in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I'll identify the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players present in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Analyze the Formula's Behavior:** I will analyze this formula as the number of players approaches infinity. Mathematically, this will likely tend towards infinity.\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** The phrase \"According to the source code\" is a key hint. I will consider the technical limitations of the game engine. In Terraria, an NPC's health is stored in a specific data type (a 32-bit signed integer), which has a maximum value.\n5.  **Determine the Final Value:** The true \"theoretical maximum health\" is therefore not infinity, but the maximum value that the health variable can hold before it overflows.\n6.  **Code the Result:** I will write a Python script that states these facts and calculates the final maximum value based on the data type's limit, printing the components of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    \n    In Terraria's source code, the health for NPCs is stored as a 32-bit signed integer.\n    While the health scaling formula with infinite players would mathematically result in infinite health,\n    the actual health is capped by the maximum value this data type can hold.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n    health_increase_per_player = 0.35 # 35%\n    \n    print(f\"The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode is {base_health_expert}.\")\n    print(f\"Health increases by {health_increase_per_player * 100}% for each player after the first.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe health formula is: Health = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n    print(\"This formula increases linearly and has no mathematical maximum.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Consider the technical limitation from the game's source code.\n    # NPC health is stored in a 32-bit signed integer (int in C#).\n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2^31 - 1.\n    \n    base = 2\n    exponent = 31\n    subtrahend = 1\n    \n    max_health_value = (base ** exponent) - subtrahend\n    \n    print(\"\\nHowever, the game's code imposes a technical limit due to the 32-bit signed integer data type used for health.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for the maximum possible health is derived from this limit: {base} ^ {exponent} - {subtrahend}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe theoretical maximum health is: {max_health_value:,}\")\n\ncalculate_max_health()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
