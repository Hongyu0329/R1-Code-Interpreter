# The problem asks for the rate of photon production for a two-level atom in a cavity.
# Based on the derivation using Fermi's Golden Rule under standard assumptions in quantum optics,
# the correct formula corresponds to option B.

# The formula is: Rate = 8 * pi * g^2 / (h * gamma_c)
# We can represent the components of this formula symbolically.

# The numerical coefficient
coefficient = 8

# The symbolic parts are:
# g: coupling strength
# h: Planck's constant
# gamma_c: cavity decay rate
# pi: mathematical constant

# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The only explicit numerical coefficient in the symbolic formula is 8.
