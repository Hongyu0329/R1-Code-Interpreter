# Step 1 & 2: Analyze statements A-E in the context of SVMs
statement_truth_contextual = {}

# A: Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class
# Reasoning: True. A key Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) constraint for SVMs is `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`.
# If all support vectors (where alpha_i > 0) were from one class (e.g., y_i = 1 for all),
# the sum would be positive, violating the constraint.
statement_truth_contextual['A'] = True

# B: With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM
# Reasoning: True. Class-weighted SVMs assign different penalty costs (C) to different classes,
# which effectively shifts the decision boundary and creates unequal margins to improve
# performance on imbalanced datasets.
statement_truth_contextual['B'] = True

# C: Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels
# Reasoning: True. The 'kernel trick' allows this. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, for example,
# maps to an infinite-dimensional space, but its value is easily computed, making the overall SVM
# algorithm tractable.
statement_truth_contextual['C'] = True

# D: It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all,
# as long as they're interior points
# Reasoning: True. The decision boundary is defined only by support vectors. Interior points are
# correctly classified points outside the margin and have Lagrange multipliers of zero, so they
# don't influence the boundary.
statement_truth_contextual['D'] = True

# E: Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer
# Reasoning: As a general statement, this is false (e.g., f(x) = e^x). However, *regarding SVMs*,
# the optimization problem involves minimizing a strictly convex objective function over a convex set.
# This specific structure *does* guarantee a unique global minimum. So in this context, the statement's
# application to SVM is true.
statement_truth_contextual['E'] = True

# Step 3: Analyze meta-statements F and G
all_options_truth_values = {}
all_options_truth_values.update(statement_truth_contextual)

# F: More than one of the answers from A-E are false
num_false_in_A_E = sum(1 for option in "ABCDE" if not statement_truth_contextual[option])
all_options_truth_values['F'] = (num_false_in_A_E > 1)

# G: All of the options from A-E are true
all_options_truth_values['G'] = (num_false_in_A_E == 0)

# Step 4: Identify the final answer (the statement that is NOT TRUE)
final_answer = None

    if not is_true:
        final_answer = option
