    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau manifold, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Defining Parameters**: The Calabi-Yau manifold is defined as a hypersurface within the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4$ with weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree `d`**: For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, its degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights, $d = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} w_i$. The provided polynomial is $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$. Calculating the weighted degree for each monomial reveals that all terms have a degree of 225, which is the sum of the weights, except for the second term ($z_1^4z_2^3z_3$) which has a degree of 224. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. The topological invariants for a generic smooth hypersurface depend only on the weights and the degree, not the specific polynomial. Therefore, I will proceed with the degree $d = \\sum w_i = 225$.\n\n3.  **Apply the Correct Formula**: The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as $c(X) = \\frac{1}{2} c_2(X) \\cdot H$, where $c_2(X) \\cdot H$ is the second Chern number of the manifold. For a smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a (well-formed) weighted projective space, this is calculated with the formula:\n    $c_2(X) \\cdot H = \\left(\\sum_{i<j} w_i w_j\\right) \\frac{d}{\\prod_k w_k}$\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation**: I will use a Python script to compute the required values: the degree `d`, the product of the weights `P`, and the sum of the products of pairs of weights `S2`. The final result will be calculated using these values. To maintain precision, the `fractions` module will be used.\n\n5.  **Format the Output**: The script will display each component of the final calculation before printing the final invariant as an exact fraction, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# 1. Define the weights from the problem statement.\nweights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n# 2. Calculate the degree 'd' for the Calabi-Yau manifold. It is the sum of the weights.\n# We assume d = sum(weights) based on the Calabi-Yau condition, acknowledging the\n# likely typo in the provided polynomial.\nd = sum(weights)\n\n# 3.

Calculate the second Chern number c2.H using the formula S2 * (d / P).\n# We use Python's Fraction for exact arithmetic.\nc2_H = Fraction(S2 * d, P)\n\n# 5. Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant, which is (1/2) * c2.H.\nCN_invariant = Fraction(1, 2) * c2_H\n\n# 6.
