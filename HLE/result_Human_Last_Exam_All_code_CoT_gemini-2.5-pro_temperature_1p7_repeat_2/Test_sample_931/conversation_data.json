    "I will write a Python script to determine the correct answer. My plan is to:\n1.  Define the known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) based on entomological knowledge.\n2.  Review the provided answer choices (A, B, C, D, E).\n3.  Check which of the choices match the known food sources.\n4.  Combine the correct individual choices to find the most accurate composite answer (F or G).\n5.  Print the step-by-step reasoning and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Establish the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies).\")\n    # Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, but also supplement their diet.\n    primary_diet = \"Small, soft-bodied insects, such as aphids and insect eggs.\"\n    supplementary_diet = \"Pollen and nectar.\"\n\n    print(f\" - Known Primary Diet: {primary_diet}\")\n    print(f\" - Known Supplementary Diet: {supplementary_diet}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices against the known diet.\")\n    choice_A = \"Nectar\"\n    choice_B = \"Māhoe pollen\"\n    choice_C = \"Fungus\"\n    choice_D = \"Karamū leaf tissue\"\n    choice_E = \"Totara Aphids\"\n\n    is_A_correct = choice_A.lower() in supplementary_diet.lower()\n    is_E_correct = \"aphids\" in primary_diet.lower()\n\n    print(f\" - Is choice A ('{choice_A}') correct? {is_A_correct}.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
