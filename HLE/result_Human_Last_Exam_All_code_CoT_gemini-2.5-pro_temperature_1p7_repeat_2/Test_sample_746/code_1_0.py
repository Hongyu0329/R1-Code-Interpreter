        "The answer to this question is derived from a logical proof in point-set topology. The maximum number is 1. We establish this by showing that it's possible to have 1 dispersion point, but it's impossible to have 2 or more.",

        "Step 1: Establishing a lower bound (Is a count of 1 possible?)",
        "Yes. An example of a space with exactly one dispersion point is the Knaster-Kuratowski fan. It is a compact connected metric space with an 'apex' point. When this single point is removed, the space becomes totally disconnected. Thus, the maximum number of dispersion points is at least 1.",
        "",
        "Step 2: Proving an upper bound (Is a count of 2 or more possible?)",
        "We use a proof by contradiction. Let's assume a compact connected metric space X has at least two distinct dispersion points, let's call them p and q.",
        "    - Implication A: Let C be any connected subset of X with more than 1 point. If p was not in C, then C would be a subset of X \\ {p}. Since X \\ {p} is totally disconnected by definition, C could only be a single point, which is a contradiction. Therefore, p must be in C. The same logic applies to q. Conclusion: Any connected subset of X with more than 1 point must contain BOTH p and q.",
        "    - Implication B: Let's define a new set, I, as the intersection of ALL non-trivial connected subsets of X. Based on Implication A, this set I must contain both p and q. The intersection of compact, connected sets is also compact and connected, so I is a non-trivial connected subset.",
        "    - The Contradiction: Now, let K be any non-trivial connected subset of I. K is also a non-trivial connected subset of X. By the definition of I (as the intersection of all such sets), we must have I ⊆ K. Since we started with K ⊆ I, the only possibility is K = I. This means that I has no non-trivial proper connected subsets. A fundamental theorem in topology states that a continuum with this property must be a single point. But we know I contains at least two distinct points, p and q. This is a logical contradiction.",
        "",
        "Step 3: Conclusion",
        "The assumption that 2 or more dispersion points can exist leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the number of dispersion points must be less than 2.",
        "Since the number can be 1, and it cannot be 2, the maximum cardinality is 1.",
