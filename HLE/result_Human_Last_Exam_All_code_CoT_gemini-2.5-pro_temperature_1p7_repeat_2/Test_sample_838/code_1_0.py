Step-by-step explanation of the synthesis:

1.  **Starting Material to Product A:**
    *   Reaction: E2 elimination. [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base.
    *   Explanation: The bulky base favors the Hofmann elimination pathway, removing a proton from the more accessible terminal carbon (C4). This forms the less substituted alkene.
    *   Product A: 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The original chiral center is lost.

2.  **Product A to Product B:**
    *   Reaction: Hydroboration-oxidation. Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane (BH3) followed by hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide.
    *   Explanation: This is an anti-Markovnikov addition of H and OH across the double bond. The OH group adds to the less substituted terminal carbon.
    *   Product B: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol.

3.  **Product B to Product C:**
    *   Reaction: Bromination. Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).
    *   Explanation: PBr3 is a reagent that converts primary alcohols into primary alkyl bromides.
    *   Product C: The -OH group is replaced with a -Br atom.

Final Product Identity:
*   Product C is (4-bromobutyl)benzene.
*   The IUPAC name is: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.
*   Chirality: The final product is achiral. It contains no chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The chirality present in the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step.
