    Solves the problem by explaining the logic based on the u-invariant of the field K.

    # The problem asks for the smallest natural number N such that for every anisotropic
    # quadratic form Q in N variables over K, the map defined by Q is surjective.

    # This can be solved using the u-invariant of the field K, let's call it u_K.
    # The u-invariant is the maximum dimension of any anisotropic quadratic form over K.
    # The final answer N will be derived from the equation: N = u_K + 1.

    # Step 1: Determine the u-invariant of K.
    # The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2,
    # whose residue field is a local field of characteristic 2. This is known as a
    # 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.
    # For such fields, the u-invariant has been determined in the mathematical literature on quadratic forms.
    u_K = 8
    print(f"The u-invariant of the field K is u(K) = {u_K}.")

    # Step 2: Check if N = u_K works.
    # By definition of u(K), there exists an anisotropic quadratic form Q in u(K) = 8 variables.
    print(f"Consider N = {u_K}. An anisotropic quadratic form in {u_K} variables exists.")
    # For such forms (specifically, those known as 3-fold Pfister forms), the set of values
    # is known to be a proper subgroup of K, meaning it is not surjective.
    # Therefore, the property stated in the problem does not hold for N = 8.
    print(f"The condition fails for N = {u_K}, so the answer must be greater than {u_K}.")

    # Step 3: Check N = u_K + 1.
    # We will use our equation N = u_K + 1.
    # Let's print the numbers in this equation.
    one = 1
    N = u_K + one
    print(f"We test N = u(K) + 1, which is N = {u_K} + {one}.")

    # Step 4: Final calculation and conclusion.
    print(f"This gives the result N = {N}.")
    # For N = 9, any quadratic form is isotropic, because its dimension (9)
    # is greater than the u-invariant of the field (8).
    # This means the set of anisotropic quadratic forms in 9 variables is empty.
    # The condition "for every anisotropic quadratic form Q in 9 variables, Q is surjective"
    # is therefore vacuously true.

    # Since the property fails for N=8 and holds for N=9, the smallest such natural number is 9.
    print(f"The smallest natural number N is {N}.")
