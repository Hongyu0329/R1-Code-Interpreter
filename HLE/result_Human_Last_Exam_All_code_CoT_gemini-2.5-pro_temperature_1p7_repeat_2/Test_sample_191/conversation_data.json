    "The key protein that initiates this process is **Complement component 1q (C1q)**.\n\nWhen C1q binds to amyloid plaques, it activates the classical complement pathway. This activation leads to a cascade that involves the cleavage, or \"breakdown,\" of other complement proteins like C3 and C4. These fragments then coat the amyloid, which serves as an \"eat-me\" signal for immune cells like macrophages and microglia, thereby promoting the engulfment and clearance of the amyloid.\n\n<<<Complement component 1q (C1q)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
