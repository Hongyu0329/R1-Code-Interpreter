    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, then calculate the consumer and producer surpluses at that equilibrium point. The sum of these two surpluses gives the total welfare.\n\n### **Method:**\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):**\n    *   Market equilibrium occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Qe). This means we need to solve the equation where the supply price equals the demand price:\n        `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    *   This equation is complex and cannot be solved algebraically. We will use a numerical solver in Python to find the equilibrium quantity, `Qe`.\n    *   Once `Qe` is found, we can substitute it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price, `Pe`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):**\n    *   Consumer surplus is the area between the demand curve and the equilibrium price line, from Q=0 to Q=Qe. It's calculated by the definite integral:\n        `CS = ∫[0 to Qe] (Demand(Q) - Pe) dQ`\n    *   We will solve this integral numerically.\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):**\n    *   Producer surplus is the area between the equilibrium price line and the supply curve.\n    *   The supply function `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` is only defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > ∛2`. This is the minimum quantity at which the product can be supplied.\n    *   Therefore, PS is calculated by the definite integral from this minimum quantity (`∛2`) to `Qe`:\n        `PS = ∫[∛2 to Qe] (Pe - Supply(Q)) dQ`\n    *   This integral will also be solved numerically.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:**\n    *   Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus:\n        `Total Welfare = CS + PS`\n\nWe will now implement these steps in a Python script using the `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define supply and demand functions\ndef supply(Q_s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Supply function P = ln(Q_s^3 - 2).\n    Returns a very large number if Q_s is outside the domain to guide the solver.\n    \"\"\"\n    if np.any(Q_s**3 <= 2):\n        return np.inf\n    return np.log(Q_s**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand(Q_d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_d)).\n    \"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q_d))\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium point (Qe, Pe)\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    The equation to solve: Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    return demand(Q) - supply(Q)\n\n# Numerically solve for the equilibrium quantity (Qe)\n# An initial guess of 4.0 is based on preliminary analysis of the functions\ninitial_guess_Q = 4.0\nQ_e = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_Q)[0]\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium price (Pe) using the demand function\nP_e = demand(Q_e)\n\nprint(\"--- Market Equilibrium ---\")\nprint(f\"The equilibrium equation to solve is: 18 * exp(-arctan(Q)) = ln(Q^3 - 2)\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Qe): {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Price (Pe): {P_e:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 26)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)\n# CS is the integral of (Demand(Q) - Pe) from 0 to Qe\ncs_integrand = lambda Q: demand(Q) - P_e\nconsumer_surplus, _ = quad(cs_integrand, 0, Q_e)\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Consumer and Producer Surplus ---\")\nprint(f\"Consumer Surplus (CS) is the integral of (Demand(Q) - Pe) from Q=0 to Q={Q_e:.4f}.\")\nprint(f\"CS = ∫[0 to {Q_e:.4f}] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q)) - {P_e:.4f}) dQ = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\n\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)\n# The supply curve starts at Q = 2^(1/3)\nq_min_supply = 2**(1/3)\n# PS is the integral of (Pe - Supply(Q)) from q_min_supply to Qe\nps_integrand = lambda Q: P_e - supply(Q)\nproducer_surplus, _ = quad(ps_integrand, q_min_supply, Q_e)\n\nprint(f\"\\nProducer Surplus (PS) is the integral of (Pe - Supply(Q)) from Q={q_min_supply:.4f} to Q={Q_e:.4f}.\")\nprint(f\"PS = ∫[{q_min_supply:.4f} to {Q_e:.4f}] ({P_e:.4f} - ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ = {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 37)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Total Welfare\ntotal_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Total Welfare ---\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Final Total Welfare: {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n<<<11.5204>>>\n```"
