    "To solve this problem, we need to enumerate all possible category structures with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism, and then count them. This is a problem of combinatorial enumeration.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the basic constraints.** A category with 2 objects, say A and B, must have an identity morphism for each object. These are $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. So, 2 of the 4 morphisms are already determined. We are left with 2 additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$.\n\n2.  **Distribute the morphisms.** These two non-identity morphisms can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: $\\text{Hom}(A, A)$, $\\text{Hom}(A, B)$, $\\text{Hom}(B, A)$, and $\\text{Hom}(B, B)$. We will systematically list all possible distributions of $f$ and $g$.\n\n3.  **Group by isomorphism.** Some distributions are isomorphic to others simply by relabeling the objects A and B. We will identify the unique distributions up to this object isomorphism.\n\n4.  **Count structures for each distribution.** For each unique distribution, we will determine how many non-isomorphic categories can be formed by defining the composition rules for the morphisms, while satisfying the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n\n5.  **Sum the counts.** The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each unique distribution.\n\nThis process involves casework based on the distribution of morphisms. I will implement this logic in a Python script which calculates the final number by summing up the counts from each case, with detailed comments explaining the reasoning for each term in the sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    The problem is broken down into cases based on the distribution of the two non-identity\n    morphisms (f and g) among the four Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B).\n    The total number of morphisms is 4. Two must be identities id_A and id_B.\n    Let n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB be the sizes of these Hom-sets.\n    n_AA >= 1, n_BB >= 1. The sum is n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4.\n    Let k_XY be the number of non-identity morphisms in Hom(X,Y).\n    k_AA + k_AB + k_BA + k_BB = 2.\n\n    We find the non-isomorphic solutions for the distribution (k_AA, k_AB, k_BA, k_BB).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Case 1: Both non-identity morphisms are in Hom(A, A).\n    # Distribution of non-identity morphisms (k_AA, k_AB, k_BA, k_BB) = (2,0,0,0).\n    # This gives Hom-set sizes (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB) = (3,0,0,1).\n    # The category is a disjoint union of a category on A with 3 morphisms (a monoid of order 3)\n    # and a trivial category on B with 1 morphism (id_B).\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is a known result in algebra.
