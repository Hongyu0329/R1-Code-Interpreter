# Based on the analysis, the limit of the sequence is the greatest common divisor (GCD)
# of the polynomial's values over all integers.
# We found the prime factorization of this GCD to be 2^10 * 3^2 * 5^1.

# Calculate the components of the product
p2 = 2**10
p3 = 3**2
p5 = 5**1

# Calculate the final result
result = p2 * p3 * p5

# Print the final equation and the result, showing each number involved.
