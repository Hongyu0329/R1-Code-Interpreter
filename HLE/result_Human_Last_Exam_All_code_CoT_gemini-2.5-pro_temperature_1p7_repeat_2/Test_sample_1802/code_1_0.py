    Calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel

    The maximal rank of the complementary channel is d^2. This is because:

       complementary channel of a d-qudit Pauli channel, the input space has dimension d^2.
    2. This bound can be achieved, for example, by the completely depolarizing channel,
       for which the rank of the complementary channel can be shown to be exactly d^2.
