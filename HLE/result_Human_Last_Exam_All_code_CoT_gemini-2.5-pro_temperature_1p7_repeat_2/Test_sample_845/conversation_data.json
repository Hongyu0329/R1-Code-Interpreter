    "The value you are referring to is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This is the fundamental measurement used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nThis value is most technically called the **R-R interval**, named after the 'R' peaks in an ECG (Electrocardiogram) waveform. When using PPG (Photoplethysmography), as mentioned in your question, it is also commonly referred to as the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nThe Python code below will print this term.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the name of the value measured between\n    heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value is the time interval between successive heartbeats.\n    # The most common technical term is \"R-R interval\".\n    # Another widely used term, especially with PPG sensors, is \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\".\n    value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n    alternate_name = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n\n    print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to track HRV is called the '{value_name}' (or '{alternate_name}').\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nget_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
