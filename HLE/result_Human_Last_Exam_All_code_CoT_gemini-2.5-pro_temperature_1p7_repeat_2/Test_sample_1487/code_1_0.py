# The problem requires calculating the value of the expression:
# E = (2 * ||α||²_{l2}) / (π²/6 - 1) + 10¹⁵

# From the theoretical derivation based on the problem statement, we found that:
# ||α||²_{l2} = (1/2) * (π²/6 - 1)

# Now, we substitute this back into the expression for E.
# E = (2 * (1/2) * (π²/6 - 1)) / (π²/6 - 1) + 10¹⁵

# The term (π²/6 - 1) cancels out from the numerator and denominator.
# E = 1 + 10¹⁵

# Let's define the components of the final equation.
term1 = 1
term2 = 10**15

# Calculate the final result.
final_result = term1 + term2

# Print the components and the final result as requested.
