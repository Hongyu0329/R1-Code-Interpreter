    # --- Reasoning ---
    # 1. C16-dihydroceramide has two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains (one from the
    #    sphingoid base, one from the fatty acid). These chains are flexible and can
    #    align themselves in a straight, parallel fashion.
    #
    # 2. This parallel alignment allows for maximal van der Waals interactions between
    #    adjacent molecules, leading to very tight, efficient packing. This is
    #    consistent with it forming "highly ordered domains".
    #
    # 3. C16-ceramide has a trans double bond in its sphingoid base. While a trans
    #    double bond is less disruptive than a cis double bond, it still introduces
    #    a rigid segment into the chain. This rigidity prevents the molecule from
    #    achieving the same optimal, tight packing as the fully saturated
    #    dihydroceramide.
    #
    # 4. In a monolayer at an air-water interface, tighter molecular packing
    #    results in a smaller area occupied per molecule when the monolayer is
    #    compressed.
    #
    # 5. Therefore, the lipid that packs more efficiently will have a lower
    #    surface area.
