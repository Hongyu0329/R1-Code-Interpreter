    "This is an interesting question that touches on the fundamental principles of crystal physics. The ability of a crystal to exhibit optical activity (rotating the plane of polarized light) is directly tied to its symmetry. Specifically, a crystal must be **chiral** to be optically active. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image.\n\nThe term **achiral** is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class possesses symmetry operations that make it superimposable on its mirror image, such as a center of inversion or a mirror plane. By definition, an achiral crystal cannot be optically active.\n\nTherefore, your question \"What achiral and non polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity?\" contains a contradiction. There are no crystal classes that are both achiral and optically active.\n\nTo demonstrate this systematically, I will provide a Python script. This script defines all 32 crystal classes and their relevant properties (chirality and polarity). It will then search for classes that meet your criteria, showing that the result is an empty set.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find which ones are achiral, non-polar,\n    and optically active, based on fundamental crystallographic principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 32 point groups (crystal classes).\n    # Format: (Hermann-Mauguin symbol, is_chiral, is_polar)\n    # A crystal is optically active if and only if it is chiral.\n    crystal_classes = [\n        # Triclinic\n        (\"1\", True, True), (\"-1\", False, False),\n        # Monoclinic\n        (\"2\", True, True), (\"m\", False, True), (\"2/m\", False, False),\n        # Orthorhombic\n        (\"222\", True, False), (\"mm2\", False, True), (\"mmm\", False, False),\n        # Tetragonal\n        (\"4\", True, True), (\"-4\", False, False), (\"4/m\", False, False),\n        (\"422\", True, False), (\"4mm\", False, True), (\"-42m\", False, False),\n        (\"4/mmm\", False, False),\n        # Trigonal\n        (\"3\", True, True), (\"-3\", False, False), (\"32\", True, False),\n        (\"3m\", False, True), (\"-3m\", False, False),\n        # Hexagonal\n        (\"6\", True, True), (\"-6\", False, False), (\"6/m\", False, False),\n        (\"622\", True, False), (\"6mm\", False, True), (\"-6m2\", False, False),\n        (\"6/mmm\", False, False),\n        # Cubic\n        (\"23\", True, False), (\"m-3\", False, False), (\"432\", True, False),\n        (\"-43m\", False, False), (\"m-3m\", False, False),\n    ]\n\n    # The condition for optical activity is chirality.\n    # The user asks for classes that are:\n    # 1.
