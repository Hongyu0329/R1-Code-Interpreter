    "To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** First, I need to determine the specific colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In a subtractive color model (like paint pigments, which Newton's work relates to), yellow and blue combine to make green.\n    *   The second color is \"blue itself\".\n2.  **Understand Newton's Color Circle:** I'll use the mapping Isaac Newton created between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a Western musical scale (diatonic scale). The mapping is:\n    *   Red -> C\n    *   Orange -> D\n    *   Yellow -> E\n    *   Green -> F\n    *   Blue -> G\n    *   Indigo -> A\n    *   Violet -> B\n3.  **Determine the Range and Note:** The question asks for the note corresponding to the range *between* green and blue. On Newton's color circle, the colors are arranged sequentially. The segment representing the color \"Blue\" comes directly after the segment for \"Green\". Therefore, the note for this range is the one that corresponds to the color Blue.\n4.  **Code and Output:** I will write a Python script to define this mapping, identify the correct note based on the logic above, and print the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the puzzle by mapping Newton's color circle to musical notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping from Newton's colors to musical notes.\n    color_to_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors in the question.\n    # The color made by mixing yellow and blue is green.\n    first_color = \"Green\"\n    # The second color is blue.\n    second_color = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the note for the specified range.\n    # The question asks for the note in the range between green and blue. On Newton's circle,\n    # the color blue is the segment that directly follows green. Therefore, we need the note for blue.\n    corresponding_note = color_to_note_map[second_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(f\"The task is to find the musical note corresponding to the range between two colors on Newton's circle.\")\n    print(f\"First, we determine the starting color: combining yellow and blue produces '{first_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"The end of the range is the color '{second_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"According to Newton's mapping, '{first_color}' corresponds to the note '{color_to_note_map[first_color]}'.\")\n    print(f\"And '{second_color}' corresponds to the note '{color_to_note_map[second_color]}'.\")\n    print(f\"The range on the circle 'between' green and blue is the segment represented by the color blue itself.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Equation: Color({second_color}) = Note({corresponding_note})\")\n\n\nsolve_newton_music_puzzle()\n<<<G>>>\n```"
