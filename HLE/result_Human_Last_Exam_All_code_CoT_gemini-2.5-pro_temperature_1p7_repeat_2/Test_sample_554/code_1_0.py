# 1. Identify the number of hydrogen atoms in a reference nanocar.
# The chemical formula for a common nanocar is C94H82.
num_hydrogen_atoms = 82

# 2. Define the "perfluoro-" replacement.
# In a "perfluoro" compound, each hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms

# 3. Print the explanation and the final calculation.
print("A reference nanocar molecule (C94H82) contains 82 hydrogen atoms.")
print("The term 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"Number of Fluorine atoms = Number of Hydrogen atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}")
