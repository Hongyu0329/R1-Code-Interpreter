    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we can follow a logical plan:\n\n1.  **Identify a Reference Structure:** Since \"perfluoronanocar\" is a hypothetical molecule, we first need to choose a real nanocar structure as a reference. A common example is the nanocar with a phenylene-ethynylene chassis and four p-tolyl wheels, which has the chemical formula C94H82. This formula tells us it has 82 hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Define \"Perfluoro-\":** The chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms in a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms:** Based on the \"perfluoro-\" definition, for every hydrogen atom in the original nanocar, there will be one fluorine atom in the perfluoronanocar. Thus, the number of fluorine atoms will equal the number of hydrogen atoms in the reference structure.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a simple Python script to state this relationship and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# 1. Identify the number of hydrogen atoms in a reference nanocar.\n# The chemical formula for a common nanocar is C94H82.\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 82\n\n# 2. Define the \"perfluoro-\" replacement.\n# In a \"perfluoro\" compound, each hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\nnum_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms\n\n# 3. Print the explanation and the final calculation.\nprint(\"A reference nanocar molecule (C94H82) contains 82 hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(\"The term 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = Number of Hydrogen atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n\n```\n<<<82>>>"
