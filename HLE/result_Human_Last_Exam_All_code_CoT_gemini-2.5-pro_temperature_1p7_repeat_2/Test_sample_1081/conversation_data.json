    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I need to relate the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of the group $G$ to a more computable quantity. A central theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields states that for a split reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$, and the untwisted group of this type is split over any field, including $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Therefore, we can apply this theorem. The Weyl group corresponding to $E_8$ is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result from the classification of finite reflection groups. The number of conjugacy classes for $W(E_8)$ has been computed to be 112.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that outlines this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8.\n\n    The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a split reductive group G over F_q\n    is given by the number of conjugacy classes in its corresponding Weyl group W.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The group G is of type E_8.
