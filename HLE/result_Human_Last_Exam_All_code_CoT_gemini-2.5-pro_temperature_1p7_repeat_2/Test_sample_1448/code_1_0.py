    The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is a fundamental integral equation in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. It is used to describe two-particle systems and their interactions non-perturbatively.

    The equation can be written symbolically as:
    G_full = G_non-interacting + G_non-interacting * K * G_full

    This equation establishes a correspondence between the following fundamental constructs:

    1. The full two-particle Green's function (G_full), which directly determines the '{concept1}'. This term represents the result of all possible interactions between the two particles as they propagate.

    2. The Bethe-Salpeter kernel (K), which represents the sum of all two-particle-irreducible interaction diagrams. This term is effectively the fundamental '{concept2}'.

    Therefore, the Bethe-Salpeter equation facilitates a correspondence between the {concept1} and the {concept2}.
