    Step 1: The patient's initial symptoms (agitation, difficulty sleeping, increased sexual activity, careless spending) and family history of mood disorders strongly indicate a manic episode, likely part of Bipolar Disorder.
    
    Step 2: A medication was prescribed to treat these symptoms. The standard treatment for mania is a mood stabilizer, and based on the answer choices, Lithium is the most probable medication.

    Step 3: After starting the treatment, the patient developed a new symptom: decreased interest in having sex (sexual dysfunction).

    Step 4: The task is to find the root cause that links the initial condition, the treatment, and the final symptom. Lithium is well-known to cause hypothyroidism as a side effect. A classic symptom of hypothyroidism is decreased libido (sexual dysfunction).

    Step 5: This creates a clear and logical causal chain: Manic Episode -> Lithium Treatment -> Hypothyroidism -> Sexual Dysfunction. While heavy metal exposure from his job is a possibility, it does not explain the timing of the sexual dysfunction appearing *after* a new medication was started as clearly as a medication side effect does. Therefore, Lithium-induced hypothyroidism is the most complete explanation.
