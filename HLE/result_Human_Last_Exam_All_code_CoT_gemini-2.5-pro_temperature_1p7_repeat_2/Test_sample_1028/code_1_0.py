# This is a conceptual question, so no code is needed for calculation.
# The answer is derived from understanding the statistical principles of model identifiability in phylogenetics.

# Step 1: Define the core problem.
# A birth-death model on an extant-only phylogeny is unidentifiable because many pairs of speciation rates (lambda)
# and extinction rates (mu) can produce the same likelihood. The data lacks information on extinct lineages.

# Step 2: Evaluate the options.
# A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces: This discretizes the problem but doesn't solve the
#    identifiability within each piece. It doesn't add the missing information.
# B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework: Priors add external information, which can
#    constrain the model and help mitigate identifiability. This helps.
# C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5: This makes the model
#    extremely flexible without adding new information or constraints. Such flexibility in an unidentifiable
#    model exacerbates the problem, as it allows the model to explore a wider range of equivalent solutions. This does not help.
# D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors: Fossils provide direct evidence of extinction, which is the
#    key missing piece of information. This helps.
# E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate: This focuses the inference on a parameter
#    combination that is known to be identifiable from the data. This is a valid statistical strategy. This helps.
# F. Incorporating fossils tips: Same as D, adding fossil information helps resolve the issue.
# G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate: Same as E, this focuses on an identifiable
#    parameter. This helps.

# Step 3: Conclude.
# Strategies B, D, E, F, and G all represent valid methods to address the unidentifiability problem, either by
# adding new data (D, F), adding external constraints (B), or focusing on what is mathematically identifiable (E, G).
# Strategies A and C are merely different parameterizations of the unidentifiable rates. Of these, C introduces
# high complexity and flexibility, which does not mitigate the problem and can make practical inference even more difficult.
# Therefore, C is the correct answer.

print("Reasoning: Strategies B, D, E, F, and G all introduce new information or constraints (fossils, priors) or reframe the problem to focus on identifiable parameters, which are valid ways to mitigate unidentifiability.")
print("In contrast, strategy C involves making the unidentifiable model even more complex and flexible (piecewise high-degree polynomials) without adding any new information. This does not solve the underlying mathematical problem and can make inference more challenging by expanding the space of equally likely, but different, parameter combinations. Therefore, it does not help mitigate the issue.")
