    "To determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we need to understand its visible surface structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the geometric form of the outer hull:** The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. Its visible outer surface is a stellation of the regular icosahedron. This means it can be visualized as a central icosahedron with a sharp triangular pyramid built upon each of its faces.\n2.  **Count the base faces:** A regular icosahedron is composed of 20 triangular faces. Each of these faces serves as the base for one of the pyramids forming the \"spikes\" of the visible surface.\n3.  **Count the visible triangles per pyramid:** Each spike is a triangular pyramid. A triangular pyramid has a total of 4 faces. One face is the base, which is attached to the central icosahedron and thus not visible from the outside. The other 3 faces form the sides of the pyramid and are visible.\n4.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of visible triangles is the number of pyramids (which equals the number of faces on the icosahedron) multiplied by the number of visible faces on each pyramid.\n5.  **Finalize the triangulation:** Since the visible surface is already composed entirely of triangles, this count represents the minimal number of triangles required for its triangulation.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this logic to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_great_icosahedron_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the visible outer surface of the great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The visible surface of the great icosahedron is a stellation of the regular icosahedron.\n    # It is formed by placing a triangular pyramid on each face of a central icosahedron.\n    \n    # 1. A regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\n    # This is the number of pyramids that form the visible surface.\n    icosahedron_faces = 20\n    \n    # 2. Each spike is a triangular pyramid. One of its faces serves as the base,\n    # and the other three faces are the visible sides.\n    visible_faces_per_pyramid = 3\n    \n    # 3. The total number of visible triangles is the product of the number of \n    # icosahedron faces and the number of visible faces per pyramid.\n    # Since the surface is already made of triangles, this is the minimal number\n    # for its triangulation.\n    total_visible_triangles = icosahedron_faces * visible_faces_per_pyramid\n    \n    print(\"To find the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron:\")\n    print(f\"1.
