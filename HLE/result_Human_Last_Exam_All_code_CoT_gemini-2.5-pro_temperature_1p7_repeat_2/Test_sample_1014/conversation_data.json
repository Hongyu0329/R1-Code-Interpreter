    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881.\n\nFirst, I will write a Python script that implements a prime factorization algorithm. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  Handle the easiest prime factor, 2. I'll repeatedly divide the number by 2 until it's odd and add 2 to a list of factors for each division.\n3.  Proceed to check for odd prime factors. I'll loop through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining number.\n4.  For each odd number `i` that is a divisor, I'll add `i` to my list of factors and divide the number by `i` until it's no longer divisible. This ensures I find all occurrences of that prime factor.\n5.  After the loop finishes, if the remaining number is greater than 2, it must be a prime number itself and is the final prime factor.\n6.  Once I have the complete list of prime factors, I will construct and print an equation showing the factorization. The largest value in this list is the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the prime factorization of a given number n,\n    prints the factorization as an equation, and then prints the largest\n    prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2, if any\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n = n // 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors\n    # We iterate from 3 up to the square root of the remaining number n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n = n // i\n        i = i + 2\n\n    # This handles the case where the remaining n is a prime number greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the original number was prime, the factors list would be empty\n    if not factors:\n        factors.append(original_n)\n\n    # Output the factorization equation\n    equation_str = f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    # The largest prime divisor is the maximum value in the factors list\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}.\")\n\n\n# The number from the user's request\nnumber = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number)\n```\n<<<478817>>>"
