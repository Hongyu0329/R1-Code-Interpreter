    "To answer your question, I will look up the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery who served during the years 1730 and 1731.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a small dataset within a Python script containing the names of the archimandrites and their years of service around the specified period. This will simulate querying a historical database.\n2.  The script will define the target years: a start of 1730 and an end of 1731.\n3.  It will then search the dataset to find the name of the person whose term of service matches these exact years.\n4.  After finding the name, the script will identify the corresponding letter from the multiple-choice options.\n5.  Finally, it will print the details of the query, including the years, and the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_leader_for_period():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the historical leader for a specific period from a predefined dataset.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small dataset representing the archimandrites (abbots) of the Pskov-Caves Monastery\n    # and their terms of service.
