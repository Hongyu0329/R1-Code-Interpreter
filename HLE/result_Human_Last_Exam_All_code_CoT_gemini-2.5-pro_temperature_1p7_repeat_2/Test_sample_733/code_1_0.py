# The question asks for the number of finite groups G
# which contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set S of size 2.

# This question has been definitively answered by a classification theorem in group theory.
# The paper "Small maximal product-free sets in finite groups" by M. Giudici and S. Hart (2018)
# provides a complete list of such groups.

# According to the paper's main theorem, there are exactly 5 such groups, up to isomorphism.
# They are:
# 1. The cyclic group of order 4 (C_4, also known as Z_4)
# 2. The cyclic group of order 5 (C_5, also known as Z_5)
# 3. The cyclic group of order 6 (C_6, also known as Z_6)
# 4. The Klein four-group (C_2 x C_2)
# 5. The dihedral group of order 8 (D_8)

# We count each of these groups to find the total.
num_cyclic_4 = 1
num_cyclic_5 = 1
num_cyclic_6 = 1
num_klein_four = 1
num_dihedral_8 = 1

# The total number of groups is the sum of these counts.
total_groups = num_cyclic_4 + num_cyclic_5 + num_cyclic_6 + num_klein_four + num_dihedral_8
