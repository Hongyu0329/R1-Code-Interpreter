  # The problem states that P < ATC.
  # This implies that P * q1 < ATC * q1.
  # Therefore, S < H.
  # Since Total Revenue (S) is less than Total Cost (H), the firm is experiencing a loss.

  # An area is a positive quantity, representing the magnitude of the loss.
  # Magnitude of Loss = Total Cost - Total Revenue
  # Magnitude of Loss = TC - TR

  # Substituting the area variables:
  # Loss Area = H - S
