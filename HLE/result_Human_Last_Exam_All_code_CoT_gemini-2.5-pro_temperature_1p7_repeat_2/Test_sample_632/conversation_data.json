    "To answer your question, I will search my knowledge base for historical information regarding architectural or structural changes to Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" around the year 1950. My plan is to identify the specific feature that was present before this date and then removed. The final answer will be provided in a Python script using a print statement.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the answer to the historical question.\n# The unique architectural feature in the Piazza della Rotonda that was removed around the mid-20th century.\nfeature = \"A circular tram track\"\n\n# The tram track used to circle the central fountain in the square,\n# but it was removed as part of a city-wide effort to modernize transportation and clear historical centers.\nprint(feature)\n```\n<<<A circular tram track>>>"
