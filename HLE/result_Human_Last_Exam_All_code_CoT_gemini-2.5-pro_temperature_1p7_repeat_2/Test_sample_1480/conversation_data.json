    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to apply a fuzzy AND operator to the given membership values. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the given membership values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these values, which calculates the minimum of the two.\n3.  The result will be the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given membership values\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n# The t-norm operation is a generalization of the logical AND operator.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which we will use here.\n# Rule Activation Level = t_norm(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\n# Rule Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\nactivation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level using the minimum t-norm is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
