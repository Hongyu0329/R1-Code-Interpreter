def solve_bayesian_assumptions():
    """
    Determines the necessary assumption for a Bayesian agent's expected information gain
    to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The core reasoning is based on the information-theoretic properties of Bayesian updating:
    1.  The total expected information gain an agent can achieve is bounded by the
        entropy of its prior distribution over models: Sum(EIG_t) <= H(prior).
    2.  For an infinite sum of non-negative terms (the EIGs) to be finite,
        the terms themselves must approach zero.
    3.  Therefore, a sufficient (and the most fundamental among the choices) assumption
        to prove that EIG approaches zero is that the prior distribution has finite entropy.
        This corresponds to option (a).
    4.  The answer 'a' is then formatted into CNF as per the user's specification.
        A single literal 'a' in a clause is written as '(a)'. The entire
        conjunction is enclosed in square brackets.

    # The single necessary assumption identified is 'a'.
    necessary_assumptions = ['a']

    # Sort literals within each clause alphabetically (already done).
    # Create the clause string.
    clause = "(a)"

    # Create the final CNF string by joining all clauses with " AND ".
    # In this case, there is only one clause.
    # The whole conjunction is surrounded by square brackets.
