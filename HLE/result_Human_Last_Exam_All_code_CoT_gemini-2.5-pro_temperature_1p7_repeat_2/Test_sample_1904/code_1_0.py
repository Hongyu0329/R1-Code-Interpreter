# The problem reduces to finding the minimum possible number of 'u-components'
# for the given type of space X.
# Let k be the number of u-components.

# Based on the analysis of the topological properties of X:
# 1. X is infinite and totally-disconnected, which implies X is disconnected.
# 2. If a space is disconnected, it must have at least 2 u-components.
# Therefore, the minimum possible value for k is 2.
k = 2

# The number of connected components of CL(X) is given by the formula 2^k - 1.
num_components = 2**k - 1

print(f"The minimum number of u-components is k = {k}.")
print(f"The smallest possible number of connected components is 2^k - 1.")
print(f"So the final calculation is 2^{k} - 1 = {2**k} - 1 = {num_components}")
