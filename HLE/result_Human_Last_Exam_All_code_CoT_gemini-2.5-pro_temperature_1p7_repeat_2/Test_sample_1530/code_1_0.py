    "Phrase 1: 'Naked, cold'": "This immediately points to something related to low temperatures, a core characteristic of frost.",
    "Phrase 2: 'knits a veil from starwort, grass and meadowsweet'": "This describes a delicate layer being formed on top of plants. Both frost and a spiderweb could fit this, but it establishes a theme of intricate creation.",
    "Phrase 3: 'Sheâ€™s lace and glass'": "This is the most definitive clue. Frost creates intricate, delicate patterns like 'lace' and is composed of ice, which has a 'glass'-like appearance. A spiderweb is not glassy.",
    "Phrase 4: 'waits for pelted Autumn... to fray each feather stitch'": "This shows the creation is fragile and temporary, destined to be destroyed by the advance of the Autumn season (wind, rain, or warming temperatures). This describes the melting of frost.",
    "Conclusion": "The combination of coldness, a glass-like appearance, a lace-like pattern on plants, and its ephemeral nature in Autumn overwhelmingly points to frost."
