#
# Plan:
# 1. Initialize the bit state to the starting value of 0.
# 2. Simulate the process for three full "ABC" cycles.
# 3. For each cycle:
#    a. Gate A: Note that it creates a superposition. The key information is in rule R1, which dictates the outcome of the next step.
#    b. Gate B: Perform a measurement. According to rule R1, the measurement of the state from Gate A always results in a classical 1. Update the bit's state to 1.
#    c. Gate C: Apply the translation function to the classical bit from Gate B. For an input of 1, the quantum state is |1>, with an amplitude of 0 for |0> and 1 for |1>. We will explicitly calculate the output using the formula from R3.
# 4. Print the final result after all cycles are complete.
