# The problem is to find the value of x for the equivalent capacitance
# to be independent of the number of cells. This means x must be equal
# to the characteristic capacitance (C0) of the ladder network.

# We analyzed the circuit cell as a symmetric T-network and found its
# characteristic impedance Z0 in terms of the impedance z of a single capacitor c.
# The relationship derived is Z0 = 2 * sqrt(2) * z.

# Now, we convert this impedance relationship back to capacitance.
# Z0 = 1/(j*omega*C0)
# z  = 1/(j*omega*c)
# Substituting these into the equation gives:
# 1/(j*omega*C0) = 2 * sqrt(2) * (1/(j*omega*c))
# 1/C0 = (2 * sqrt(2)) / c
# C0 = c / (2 * sqrt(2))

# The required value for x is C0.
# The following code calculates the coefficient and prints the final equation.

# Define the components of the equation x = c / (2 * sqrt(2))
