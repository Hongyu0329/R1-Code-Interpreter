    "To find a(10), which is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice, we need to count all possible paths of 10 steps starting from the origin that do not visit the same point more than once.\n\nThere is no known simple formula for this. The most direct method for a small number of steps like 10 is to use a computer program to enumerate and count all valid walks.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  We will implement a recursive backtracking algorithm, which is a form of Depth-First Search (DFS), to explore all possible paths.\n2.  The walk starts at the origin `(0, 0)`. At each point, the walk can move one step in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right).\n3.  To ensure the walk is \"self-avoiding,\" we'll keep track of every point visited in the current path. A move is only valid if it goes to a point that has not been previously visited. A `set` is an efficient data structure for this check.\n4.  The recursion stops when a walk reaches a length of 10 steps, at which point we increment a counter for valid walks.\n5.  To optimize the calculation, we will leverage the symmetry of the square lattice. The number of walks starting with a move to the right is the same as starting up, down, or left. Therefore, we can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., right) and multiply the final count by 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate a(10).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    This script specifically solves for n=10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The desired number of steps in the walk.\n    n = 10\n    \n    # Increase recursion limit if needed, though default is usually fine for n=10.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(max(sys.getrecursionlimit(), n + 5))\n\n    # Using a mutable list to hold the counter so it can be modified\n    # within the recursive function's scope.\n    count = [0]\n\n    def find_walks(path, x, y, length):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds and counts self-avoiding walks.\n        \n        Args:\n            path (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            length (int): The current length of the walk (number of steps taken).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If the walk has reached the desired length, count it.\n        if length == n:\n            count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # The four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n        moves = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n\n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # Check if the next point is already in the path.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in path:\n                # If not, add it to the path and recurse.\n                path.add((next_x, next_y))\n                find_walks(path, next_x, next_y, length + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to explore other possibilities.\n                path.remove((next_x, next_y))\n\n    # The walk must have at least one step.\n    if n > 0:\n        # Optimization: Exploit the lattice symmetry.\n        # We calculate walks starting with a move to the right (1, 0)\n        # and multiply the result by 4.\n        # The path starts at (0,0) and takes one step to (1,0).\n        initial_path = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}\n        # Start the search from the end of the first step.\n        find_walks(initial_path, 1, 0, 1)\n        # The total number of walks is 4 times the count found for one direction.\n        total_walks = count[0] * 4\n    elif n == 0:\n        # A 0-step walk is a single point, so there is 1 such walk.\n        total_walks = 1\n    else:\n        total_walks = 0\n\n    # Print the final result in the format \"a(n) = result\".\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n<<<220924>>>"
