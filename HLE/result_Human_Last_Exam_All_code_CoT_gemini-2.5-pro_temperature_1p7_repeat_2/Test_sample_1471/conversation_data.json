    "My plan is to solve the user's equation, which uses Gwalior numerals.\nFirst, I will decode the Gwalior numerals into modern Arabic numerals.\n- ` ग्वालियर ` is the Gwalior numeral for 8.\n- `  ग्वालियर ` is the Gwalior numeral for 100.\n- `  ग्वालियर ` is a composite number formed by the numerals for 2, 3, and 1, which represents 231.\n\nSo the equation ` ग्वालियर /  ग्वालियर -  ग्वालियर ` translates to `8 / 100 - 231`.\n\nNext, I will solve this equation following the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means performing the division before the subtraction.\n1.  Calculate the division: 8 / 100 = 0.08\n2.  Calculate the subtraction: 0.08 - 231 = -230.92\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation with the solution.\n\n```python\n# The equation provided is in Gwalior numerals.\n# Let's first convert them to modern numbers.\n#  ग्वालियर = 8\n#  ग्वालियर = 100\n#  ग्वालियर = 231\n\nnum1 = 8\nnum2 = 100\nnum3 = 231\n\n# The equation is: num1 / num2 - num3\n# Following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation with the solution.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-230.92>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
