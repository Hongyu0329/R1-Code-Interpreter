    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, identify what is meant by \"the standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". In combinatorial topology, this typically refers to a minimal triangulation of the compact Möbius strip (the surface with its boundary). I will use a known minimal triangulation from the literature.\n2.  For this triangulation, I will determine the number of vertices ($f_0$), edges ($f_1$), and triangles ($f_2$). This can be done by processing the list of triangles (the facets of the simplicial complex).\n3.  With these numbers, I will compute the Euler characteristic of the complex using the formula $\\chi = f_0 - f_1 + f_2$.\n4.  The Euler characteristic will reveal the homotopy type of the complex. A compact Möbius strip is homotopy equivalent to a circle, but its triangulation as a simplicial complex (which includes the boundary) makes it topologically a disk, which is contractible. A contractible complex has an Euler characteristic of 1.\n5.  A fundamental result in PL topology states that any contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex is collapsible. Furthermore, any subcomplex of a collapsible complex is also collapsible.\n6.  A \"higher dimensional rooted forest\" $(F,R)$ on this triangulation consists of a subcomplex $F$ and a subcomplex $R$ of $F$. Since the whole triangulation is collapsible, any subcomplex $F$ is also collapsible.\n7.  A collapsible complex can be simplicially collapsed to any of its subcomplexes. Therefore, for any pair $(F, R)$, the forest $F$ will always simplicially collapse onto the root $R$.\n8.  This means that the number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ that *fail* to have $F$ simplicially collapse onto $R$ is zero.\n\nThe Python code below will implement steps 2 and 3 to verify the Euler characteristic. It will parse the list of triangles, count the unique vertices, edges, and triangles, and then print the calculation that leads to the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R) of the standard\n    triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest F simplicially collapse\n    onto the root R.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A standard minimal triangulation of the Möbius band (with boundary), M_1 from\n    # \"On the number of non-isomorphic minimal triangulations of the Möbius strip\"\n    # by Jean-Philippe Labbé.
