    "This puzzle requires identifying an underlying pattern in the sequence of numbers. The numbers are not part of a simple mathematical progression. Instead, they relate to the names of stations on the London Underground's Piccadilly Line.\n\nThe plan to find the next number is as follows:\n1.  Establish that the sequence corresponds to a journey along the Piccadilly Line, starting from the Heathrow branch. The given sequence has 33 numbers. We need to find the 34th.\n2.  The 33rd station on this journey is **Bounds Green**. The next (34th) station is **Arnos Grove**.\n3.  Determine the rule for converting a station name into a number. By analyzing the value for Bounds Green, we can deduce the rule.\n4.  Apply this rule to the name \"Arnos Grove\" to calculate the next number in the sequence.\n\nThe rule appears to be the sum of the alphabetical positions (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...) of all the letters in the station's name.\n\nLet's verify this rule with the 33rd station, **Bounds Green**, which corresponds to the last number in the sequence, **124**.\n\n-   **BOUNDS**: B(2) + O(15) + U(21) + N(14) + D(4) + S(19) = 75\n-   **GREEN**: G(7) + R(18) + E(5) + E(5) + N(14) = 49\n-   **Total Sum**: 75 + 49 = 124\nThis matches the sequence perfectly.\n\nNow, we will apply the same rule to the next station, **Arnos Grove**, to find the next number.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_station_value(station_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of a station name by summing the alphabetical\n    positions of its letters (A=1, B=2, ...).\n    \"\"\"\n    total_value = 0\n    # Remove spaces and convert to uppercase to handle names like \"Arnos Grove\"\n    cleaned_name = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, station_name)).upper()\n    \n    # We will print the equation for clarity\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    for char in cleaned_name:\n        value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1\n        total_value += value\n        equation_parts.append(str(value))\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating value for station: {station_name}\")\n    print(f\"Letters: {' '.join(list(cleaned_name))}\")\n    print(f\"Values:  {' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total_value}\")\n    return total_value\n\n# Last known station in the sequence to verify the rule\nlast_station = \"Bounds Green\"\nlast_value = calculate_station_value(last_station)\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# The next station in the sequence\nnext_station = \"Arnos Grove\"\nnext_value = calculate_station_value(next_station)\n\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_value}\")\n```\n<<<134>>>"
