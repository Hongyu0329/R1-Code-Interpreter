    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive. When two systems are combined, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems, assuming the gap separating the bands doesn't close in the process. In this case, two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 are connected with a negligible tunneling barrier, forming a combined system.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, C1.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, C2.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number, C_total, by summing C1 and C2.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The Chern number is an additive quantity for combined topological systems.\n# We are given two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n\n# Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n\n# Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is calculated by summing the individual Chern numbers:\")\nprint(f\"{c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
