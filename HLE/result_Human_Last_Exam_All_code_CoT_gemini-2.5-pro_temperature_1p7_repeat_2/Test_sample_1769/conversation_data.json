    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question of alternative linguistic history.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the word:\n1.  First, I'll identify the origin of the current Modern English word \"sister.\" This will confirm that it is indeed a loanword.\n2.  Next, I'll find the original, native Old English word for \"sister\" that was used before the Norse invasions.\n3.  Finally, I will trace the likely phonological (sound) evolution of that Old English word through Middle English and into Modern English, based on known sound changes that affected other native English words. This will give us the hypothetical word.\n\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers. It gradually replaced the native Old English word.\n\nThe original Old English word for \"sister\" was **sweoster**. Without the influence of Old Norse, \"sweoster\" would have undergone the natural sound changes that shaped the English language.\n\n*   **Old English to Middle English:** The initial \"sw\" sound before a back vowel was often simplified. The `eo` vowel sound also smoothed out. In Middle English, the word became **suster**. This form was common and can be found in texts like Chaucer.\n*   **Middle English to Modern English:** A major sound change called the \"FOOT-STRUT split\" occurred. In many words, the \"u\" sound (like in \"put\") shifted to an \"uh\" sound (like in \"cut\"). The word \"suster\" would have been affected by this change.\n\nTherefore, the vowel in \"suster\" would have changed, leading to the Modern English word **suster**, pronounced to rhyme with \"buster.\"\n\nHere is the python code to display the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines what the word \"sister\" would be in Modern English\n    if the Norse had never influenced the Anglo-Saxon language.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The native Old English word for \"sister\" was \"sweoster\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n    \n    # In Middle English, through natural evolution, this became \"suster\".\n    middle_english_word = \"suster\"\n    \n    # Applying standard Modern English sound changes (the FOOT-STRUT split),\n    # the /ʊ/ sound in \"suster\" would become the /ʌ/ sound.\n    # The spelling would likely remain the same.\n    hypothetical_modern_english_word = \"suster\"\n    \n    print(\"The original Old English word was: 'sweoster'\")\n    print(\"This would have evolved into the Middle English word: 'suster'\")\n    print(\"Without Norse influence, the Modern English word would be: 'suster'\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
