    1.  **Background on Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1):** DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. A key feature of the disease is 'somatic instability,' where the number of CTG repeats tends to increase in a person's body cells over time, correlating with worsening symptoms.

    2.  **Role of LIG1:** DNA Ligase I (LIG1) is a vital enzyme that seals breaks (nicks) in the DNA backbone. This is a critical final step in many DNA processes, including the joining of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA replication.

    3.  **Impact of LIG1 Deficiency on CTG Repeats:** Scientific studies using cellular models have demonstrated a clear link between LIG1 and CTG repeat stability. When LIG1 is absent or deficient, the nicks that form during the replication of the CTG repeat tract are not sealed efficiently. This leads to the persistence of DNA flaps and hairpins. These abnormal structures are then targeted by other repair pathways that, in an attempt to fix the problem, often remove the entire hairpin structure. This results in a large-scale deletion, or *contraction*, of the CTG repeat tract.

    4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, knocking out or reducing the function of LIG1 changes the dynamic of instability. Instead of the typical expansion bias seen in patients, it leads to a strong bias towards repeat length contraction.
