    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct power subgroups of the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure**: The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has order $2^n$. For size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$. The group $SD_{512}$ has a presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. The order of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is 256.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup $G^k$ is the subgroup generated by the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$, i.e., $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. We need to find how many unique subgroups we get as we vary the integer $k \\geq 1$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on $k$**: We consider two cases for the integer $k$.\n\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.**\n        When $k$ is odd, the set of $k$-th powers of the elements in $G$ will generate the entire group $G$. This is because the powers of $r$ will generate the full cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ (since $\\gcd(k, 256)=1$), and an element of the form $s$ will also be present in the generators. Thus, for any odd $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us **1** unique subgroup.\n\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.**\n        When $k$ is even, the $k$-th power of any element in $G$ is an element of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$. The resulting power subgroup is of the form $G^k = \\langle r^d \\rangle$, where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$. Since $k$ is even, the greatest common divisor $d$ must also be an even number. Therefore, the possible power subgroups are determined by the even divisors of 256.\n\n4.  **Count the Subgroups**:\n    *   The number of subgroups from odd $k$ is 1 (the group $G$ itself).\n    *   To find the number of subgroups from even $k$, we need to count the number of even divisors of 256. The divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$. The even divisors are $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$, which total to **8** distinct subgroups. Each of these subgroups is unique and different from $G$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total**: The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The size of the semidihedral group is 512.\ngroup_order = 512\n\n# For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n# So, 2^n = 512, which gives n=9.\nn = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n# The group presentation is <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, ...>\n# The order of the cyclic subgroup <r> is 2^(n-1).\nr_order = 2**(n - 1)\n\n# Case 1: k is an odd integer.\n# For any odd k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself.\n# This contributes 1 unique subgroup to our total count.\nnum_from_odd_k = 1\n\n# Case 2: k is an even integer.\n# For any even k, the power subgroup G^k is a cyclic subgroup <r^d>,\n# where d = gcd(k, r_order). Since k is even, d must also be an\n# even divisor of r_order. We count the number of such divisors.\nnum_from_even_k = 0\nfor i in range(1, r_order + 1):\n  # Check if i is a divisor of r_order\n  if r_order % i == 0:\n    # Check if the divisor is even\n    if i % 2 == 0:\n      num_from_even_k += 1\n\n# The total number of power subgroups is the sum from the two cases.\ntotal_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n\nprint(\"The semidihedral group of size 512 is SD_512.\")\nprint(\"The analysis of its power subgroups leads to two cases:\")\nprint(f\"1. For odd k: This yields {num_from_odd_k} unique subgroup (the group itself).\")\nprint(f\"2. For even k: This yields {num_from_even_k} unique subgroups (the even divisors of {r_order}).\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation for the total number of power subgroups is:\")\nprint(f\"{num_from_odd_k} + {num_from_even_k} = {total_subgroups}\")\n```\n<<<9>>>"
