# The puzzle is to find the next letter in the sequence: ZXXCVYBN_

# --- Thinking Steps ---
# Step 1: Define the sequence and the pattern source.
# The core pattern is derived from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.
qwerty_bottom_row = "ZXCVBNM"
sequence = "ZXXCVYBN"

# Step 2: Identify the last letter in the provided sequence that fits the primary pattern.
# The letters Z, X, C, V, B, N appear in order. The last one is 'N'.
last_pattern_letter = 'N'

# Step 3: Find the position (index) of this last letter within the keyboard row string.
last_letter_index = qwerty_bottom_row.find(last_pattern_letter)

# Step 4: The next letter in the sequence is the one at the next position in the keyboard row string.
next_letter_index = last_letter_index + 1
next_letter = qwerty_bottom_row[next_letter_index]

# --- Final Output Code ---
# Create a string buffer to capture the output
old_stdout = sys.stdout
sys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()
