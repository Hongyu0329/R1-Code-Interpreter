    "This is a sequence puzzle. I will solve it by identifying the underlying pattern.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the sequence of letters: `ZXXCVYBN`.\n2.  Recognize that the primary letters in the sequence (`Z`, `X`, `C`, `V`, `B`, `N`) correspond to the keys on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, read from left to right.\n3.  The extra letters (`X` and `Y`) are part of a secondary interleaved pattern, but the main sequence is the dominant pattern.\n4.  The last letter of the main pattern in the given sequence is `N`.\n5.  To find the next letter, I will determine what character comes after `N` on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard.\n6.  I will write a Python script to demonstrate this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# The puzzle is to find the next letter in the sequence: ZXXCVYBN_\n\n# --- Thinking Steps ---\n# Step 1: Define the sequence and the pattern source.\n# The core pattern is derived from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\nqwerty_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\nsequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the last letter in the provided sequence that fits the primary pattern.\n# The letters Z, X, C, V, B, N appear in order. The last one is 'N'.\nlast_pattern_letter = 'N'\n\n# Step 3: Find the position (index) of this last letter within the keyboard row string.\nlast_letter_index = qwerty_bottom_row.find(last_pattern_letter)\n\n# Step 4: The next letter in the sequence is the one at the next position in the keyboard row string.\nnext_letter_index = last_letter_index + 1\nnext_letter = qwerty_bottom_row[next_letter_index]\n\n# --- Final Output Code ---\n# Create a string buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\nprint(\"The sequence is ZXXCVYBN.\")\nprint(\"This pattern is based on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\")\nprint(f\"The keyboard row is: {qwerty_bottom_row}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 25)\nprint(f\"The last letter from the keyboard pattern found in the sequence is '{last_pattern_letter}'.\")\nprint(f\"To find the next letter, we determine the letter that follows '{last_pattern_letter}' on the keyboard row.\")\nprint(\"\\nSolving the sequence step-by-step:\")\nprint(f\"1. Find the index of '{last_pattern_letter}' in '{qwerty_bottom_row}': {last_letter_index}\")\nprint(f\"2. Add 1 to the index to get the position of the next letter: {last_letter_index} + 1 = {next_letter_index}\")\nprint(f\"3. Find the letter at the new index ({next_letter_index}) in '{qwerty_bottom_row}'.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe next letter is: '{next_letter}'\")\n\n# Restore stdout and print the captured output\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\nprint(captured_output.getvalue())\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(\"<<<M>>>\")\n```"
