    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll recall the general formula for calculating the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a surface code, which depends on the surface's topological properties: its genus (`g`) and number of boundaries (`b`). The formula is `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n2.  Next, I'll apply this formula to a single \"patch\" of surface code. A patch is a planar code, meaning it has a genus `g=0`. Its number of boundaries `b` is equal to the number of holes `h` it contains, plus one for the outer boundary (so, `b = h + 1`). Substituting these into the general formula simplifies it to `k = h` for a single patch. This reveals a simple rule: the number of logical qubits in a patch is equal to the number of its holes.\n3.  The problem states we have two patches and a total of two holes. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits in each patch.\n4.  If we let `h1` and `h2` be the number of holes in patch 1 and patch 2 respectively, then the total logical qubits `K = h1 + h2`.\n5.  Since we are given that the total number of holes is two (`h1 + h2 = 2`), the total number of logical qubits is fixed at 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed (e.g., one hole in each patch, or two holes in one patch and none in the other).\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains this derivation and prints the final calculation, showing the numbers in the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for the given surface code configuration.\n    \n    The problem specifies two patches of surface code with a total of two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the problem statement\n    num_patches = 2\n    total_holes = 2\n    \n    # The number of logical qubits 'k' in a surface code is given by the formula: k = 2g + b - 1,\n    # where 'g' is the genus and 'b' is the number of boundaries.\n    \n    # For a single planar \"patch\", the genus 'g' is 0.
