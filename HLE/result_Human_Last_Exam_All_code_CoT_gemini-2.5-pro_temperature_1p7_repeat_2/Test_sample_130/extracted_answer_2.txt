The iterative application of the local median filter on a binary image causes the edges to become progressively smoother over time. This process is a form of geometric smoothing, acting to minimize the total length of the boundary between black and white regions. Sharp corners are rounded, and intricate or noisy parts of the edge are simplified. As the number of iterations $t \rightarrow \infty$, any closed boundary will converge towards a circle (the shape with minimum perimeter for a given area), and any open edge that spans the image will converge towards a straight line. Small, isolated features smaller than the neighborhood size `Î´` are typically removed entirely in the early iterations.
