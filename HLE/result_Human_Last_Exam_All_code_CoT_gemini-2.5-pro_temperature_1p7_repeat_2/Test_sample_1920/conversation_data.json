    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor $d$**: First, we find the prime factorization of $d$. Since $d$ is a product of distinct primes, say $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ is primitive. For a prime modulus $p_i$, a character is primitive if and only if it's not the trivial character (i.e., its order is greater than 1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the order**: The order of the character $\\chi = (\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_r)$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We need this lcm to be 6.\n\n3.  **Set up the counting problem**: We need to count the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_r)$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. This can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, or equivalently, Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors of the order, which is 6.\n\n4.  **Use the Mobius Inversion Formula**: The number of characters with order exactly $k$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ N_k = \\sum_{n|k} \\mu\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right) g(n) $$\n    Here, $g(n)$ is the number of primitive characters whose order divides $n$. In our case, $g(n)$ is the number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_r)$ where for each component $i$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) > 1$ and $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)|n$. The number of characters modulo $p_i$ with order dividing $n$ (including the trivial one) is $\\gcd(n, p_i-1)$. Since we require primitive characters, we exclude the trivial character, so we have $\\gcd(n, p_i-1) - 1$ choices for each component.\n    Thus, $g(n) = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (\\gcd(n, p_i-1) - 1)$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary {prime: exponent}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    if any(exp > 1 for exp in factors.values()):\n        return 0\n    \n    return -1 if len(factors) % 2 != 0 else 1\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor d and order k.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor d.\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    prime_factors = sorted(d_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"\\nThe prime factorization of the conductor is d = {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))}.\")\n    \n    if any(exp > 1 for exp in d_factors.values()):\n        print(\"The conductor is not square-free.
