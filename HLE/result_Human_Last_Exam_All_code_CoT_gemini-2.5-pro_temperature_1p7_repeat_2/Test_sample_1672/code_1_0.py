    # Step 1: Explain the reward function
    print("\nStep 1: The reward at iteration k is defined as r_k(s) = -log(p_{π^{k-1}}(s)).")
    print("   - p_{π^{k-1}}(s) is the probability of visiting state 's' under the previous policy π^{k-1}.")
    print("   - The negative logarithm, -log(p), is large when p is small.")
    print("   - Therefore, the agent receives a high reward for visiting states that were rarely visited before.")

    # Step 2: Explain the policy's objective
    print("\nStep 2: The policy π^k is trained to maximize the total expected reward.")
    print("   - This means the agent learns to actively seek out states 's' that have a low p_{π^{k-1}}(s).")

    # Step 3: Explain the effect on the state distribution
    print("\nStep 3: This process makes the new state distribution p_{π^k}(s) more uniform.")
    print("   - The policy π^k will put more probability mass on exploring less-visited regions of the state space.")
    print("   - Consequently, the state distribution p_{π^k}(s) becomes more 'spread out' or uniform compared to p_{π^{k-1}}(s).")

    # Step 5: Conclude the trend
    print("\nStep 5: The entropy H(p_{π^k}) increases with each iteration k.")
    print("   - Since each step makes the distribution more uniform, we have H(p_{π^k}) >= H(p_{π^{k-1}}).")
    print("   - The process is designed to iteratively increase the entropy of the state distribution.")

    # Step 6: Identify the final answer
    print("\nStep 6: The maximum entropy is achieved at the limit of this process.")
    print("   - The policy that will induce the state distribution with the highest possible entropy is the one that this process converges to.")
