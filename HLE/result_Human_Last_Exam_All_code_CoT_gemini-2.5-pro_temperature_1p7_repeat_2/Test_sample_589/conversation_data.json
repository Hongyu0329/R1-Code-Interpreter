    "This is a film trivia question. The scene described is an iconic moment from a classic 1980s movie. My plan is to identify the movie and then present the answer within a Python script, as requested by the instructions.\n\n1.  **Analyze the scene:** A teenager on a pink bike purposefully rides toward an oncoming vehicle. This suggests a theme of rebellion or a daredevil act, likely from a teen-focused drama or romance film.\n2.  **Identify the film:** The most famous scene matching this description is from the 1984 movie *Footloose*. In the film, the rebellious character Ariel Moore (played by Lori Singer) rides her bike directly into the path of an oncoming truck to prove her fearlessness.\n3.  **Confirm details:** The film was produced by Paramount Pictures, a major Hollywood studio. The character is a teenager, and while the bike's exact shade is reddish-pink, it fits the description. The oncoming vehicle is a large truck, but this is a minor detail in the context of the overall scene.\n4.  **Create Python script:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this film.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the Hollywood film based on the described scene.\n# The scene features the character Ariel Moore riding her bike toward an oncoming truck.\n\nmovie_title = \"Footloose\"\nrelease_year = 1984\n\nprint(f\"The Hollywood feature film in question is '{movie_title}' from the year {release_year}.\")\n\n```\n<<<Footloose>>>"
