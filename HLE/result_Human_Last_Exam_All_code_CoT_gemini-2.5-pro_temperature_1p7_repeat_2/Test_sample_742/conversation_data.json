    "This is a fascinating question that bridges formal logic, philosophy, and theoretical physics. Let's break it down.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Explain the Core Concepts:** I will first briefly explain what Gödel's ontological proof is and what the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (QM) entails. This is crucial to understand why they are fundamentally different domains.\n2.  **Highlight the Mismatch:** I'll clarify that Gödel's proof operates within the realm of *modal logic*, a system of abstract axioms and formal deduction. In contrast, the mathematics of QM (linear algebra, Hilbert spaces, complex numbers) is designed to model and predict the behavior of the *physical, observable universe*.\n3.  **Create an Illustrative Python Program:** Since a direct proof is not possible, I will write a Python script to demonstrate this separation. The script will:\n    *   Symbolically represent the abstract concepts from Gödel's proof.\n    *   Create a simple representation of a quantum system (like a qubit's state vector) using `numpy`.\n    *   Show that these two systems exist independently in the code and cannot mathematically interact to produce a proof.\n4.  **Address the \"Final Equation\" Request:** The request to \"output each number in the final equation\" is interesting because no such meaningful equation exists. I will construct a *symbolic* representation that juxtaposes a quantum state with Gödel's conclusion, and I will print out the numbers from the quantum state vector to satisfy the prompt. This will visually emphasize their separation rather than their integration.\n\nHere is the explanation and the code.\n\nGödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic. It begins with a set of axioms and definitions (e.g., \"A property P is positive,\" \"A God-like being possesses all positive properties\") and, through logical deduction, arrives at the conclusion that such a being necessarily exists. This proof is entirely *a priori*; it exists in the abstract world of logic and does not depend on any evidence from the physical world.\n\nThe mathematics of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is a framework used to describe physical reality at the subatomic level. It uses concepts like Hilbert spaces, state vectors, and operators to model observable quantities like energy, position, and spin. Its purpose is to make predictions about the outcomes of physical experiments.\n\nTherefore, using the math of QM to prove Gödel's conclusion is a category error. It is like trying to use the rules of chess to bake a cake. The two operate in completely separate conceptual domains. The code below illustrates this separation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass GodelsOntologicalProof:\n    \"\"\"A symbolic representation of Gödel's Ontological Proof.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.axioms = {\n            \"A1\": \"A property is positive iff its negation is not positive.\",\n            \"A2\": \"Any property entailed by a positive property is positive.\",\n            \"A3\": \"The property of being God-like is positive.\",\n            \"A4\": \"If a property is positive, then it is necessarily positive.\",\n            \"A5\": \"Necessary existence is a positive property.\"\n        }\n        self.definition = \"G(x): x is a God-like being (possesses all positive properties).\"\n        # The final conclusion in modal logic notation (Box = 'Necessarily')\n        self.conclusion = \"□(∃x)G(x)\"\n        self.conclusion_value = 1 # Representing 'True'\n\n    def display(self):\n        print(\"--- Gödel's Ontological Proof (Symbolic) ---\")\n        print(f\"Definition: {self.definition}\")\n        print(f\"Conclusion: {self.conclusion} (A God-like entity necessarily exists)\")\n        print(\"This proof is a result of logical deduction within a formal system.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n\nclass SimpleQuantumSystem:\n    \"\"\"A simple representation of a quantum system (a qubit).\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        # A 2-level quantum system (qubit) state vector |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\n        # We generate random complex coefficients α and β\n        state = np.random.rand(2) + 1j * np.random.rand(2)\n        # Normalize the state vector, as required by quantum mechanics\n        self.state_vector = state / np.linalg.norm(state)\n\n    def display(self):\n        alpha = self.state_vector[0]\n        beta = self.state_vector[1]\n        print(\"--- Quantum Mechanics System (Qubit) ---\")\n        print(f\"State Vector |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩\")\n        print(f\"α = {alpha:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"β = {beta:.4f}\")\n        print(\"This vector describes the physical state of a quantum system.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Instantiate the logical proof\n    godel_proof = GodelsOntologicalProof()\n    godel_proof.display()\n\n    # Instantiate the physical system\n    quantum_system = SimpleQuantumSystem()\n    quantum_system.display()\n\n    print(\"\\n>>> Analysis <<<\")\n    print(\"The two systems operate in different domains:\")\n    print(\"1.
