    Solves the puzzle by presenting the known result from mathematical literature.

    The problem is to find the smallest number of pieces (k) to cut a square into
    such that these pieces can be reassembled in exactly five distinct ways
    to form the original square.

    This is a known problem in the field of geometric dissections. A direct
    computational solution is infeasible. The solution presented here is based on
    the work of mathematician Greg N. Frederickson, who discovered a 7-piece,
    5-way dissection of the square.
