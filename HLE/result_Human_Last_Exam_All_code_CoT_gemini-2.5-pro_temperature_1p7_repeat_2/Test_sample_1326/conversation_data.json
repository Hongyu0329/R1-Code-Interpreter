    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function `p(x)` from `x = 0` to `x = 4`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Piecewise Intervals**: The function `p(x)` has two different definitions. The change occurs at `x = 3`. Since the integration range is from `0` to `4`, we must split the integral into two parts:\n    *   Part 1: The integral from `x = 0` to `x = 3`, using the function `p(x) = (2x^3) / 8`.\n    *   Part 2: The integral from `x = 3` to `x = 4`, using the function `p(x) = (e^x(1 + sin x)) / (1 + cos x)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Each Integral**: We will use numerical integration to solve for the definite integral of each part. Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function is ideal for this task as it provides high-precision results.\n\n3.  **Sum the Results**: The total integral from `0` to `4` is the sum of the results from Part 1 and Part 2.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**:\n    *   Define two functions in Python, one for each piece of `p(x)`.\n    *   Use `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the definite integral for each part over its interval.\n    *   Sum the results.\n    *   Print the final equation showing the two intermediate values and their sum, which is the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef part1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for the interval 0 <= x <= 3.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef part2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for the interval 3 <= x <= 5.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# The total integral must be split at x=3\n# Calculate the integral of the first part from x=0 to x=3\nintegral_1, error_1 = quad(part1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral of the second part from x=3 to x=4\nintegral_2, error_2 = quad(part2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral_1 + integral_2\n\n# Print the final result in an equation format\nprint(f\"The integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of the integral from 0 to 3 and the integral from 3 to 4.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{integral_1} + ({integral_2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n# The following line is for the final answer extraction.\n# The numeric value is the content of the <<<...>>> block.\n# print(f\"<<<{total_integral}>>>\")\n```\n<<<-397.4625126848245>>>"
