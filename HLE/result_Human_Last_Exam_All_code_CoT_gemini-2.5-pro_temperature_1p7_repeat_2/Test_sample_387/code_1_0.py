    Calculates and explains the dimension of a specified log blowup.

    The problem asks for the dimension of the log blowup of a point P with log structure N^3,
    in the log ideal I generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0).
    """

    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the ambient space from the log structure.
    # The log point P with log structure from the monoid M = N^3 corresponds to the
    # origin of the affine toric variety X = Spec(k[M]) = Spec(k[x,y,z]), which is
    # the 3-dimensional affine space, A^3. The dimension is the rank of the monoid's
    # group completion (Z^3), which is 3.

    # Step 2: Understand the blowup operation.
    # The log blowup of P in the ideal I generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0)
    # is equivalent to the ordinary blowup of the ambient space A^3 along the
    # subvariety defined by the ideal generated by the corresponding monomials (x, y).

    # Step 3: Apply the property of blowups concerning dimension.
    # The blowup of an irreducible variety (like A^3) along a subvariety is
    # a birational transformation. Such transformations preserve the dimension of the variety.
    # Therefore, the dimension of the new variety (the blowup) is the same as the
    # dimension of the original variety.
