Given this safety concern and the patient's report that no meds are working, a supervised taper in a controlled setting like a hospital is a high-priority intervention to ensure safety and reset the treatment plan.",
        'III': "Include. A urine drug test is an essential, immediate diagnostic tool. It provides objective data, confirms self-report, and screens for other undeclared substances that could affect safety and treatment, especially given the patient's substance use history and request for stimulants.",
        'IV': "Exclude. Prescribing melatonin is a low-yield, purely symptomatic intervention that fails to address the root causes of the insomnia (cannabis use, PTSD, anxiety). The focus should be on these primary issues.",
        'V': "Exclude. The patient's Alcohol Use Disorder is in remission. There is no clinical indication to change a medication regimen that is currently successful for this condition.",
        'VI': "Exclude. This option is illogical as the patient is already on atomoxetine. Furthermore, treating 'questionable' ADHD is a lower priority than the immediate issues of substance use and medication safety."
