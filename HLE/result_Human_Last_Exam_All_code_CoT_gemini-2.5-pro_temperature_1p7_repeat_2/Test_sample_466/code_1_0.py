# The problem is equivalent to finding the number of invertible 3x3 matrices
# over the finite field F_11, which is the order of the general linear group GL(3, 11).
q = 11
n = 3

# The formula for the order of GL(n, q) is:
# |GL(n, q)| = (q^n - q^0) * (q^n - q^1) * ... * (q^n - q^(n-1))

# Calculate the terms of the product
q_n = q**n
term1 = q_n - q**0
term2 = q_n - q**1
term3 = q_n - q**2

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 * term2 * term3

# Print the full calculation step-by-step as requested
