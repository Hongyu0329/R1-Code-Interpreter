    "Based on the plot of the 1997 film \"Ovosodo,\" your question contains a false premise. The character Tommaso does not move to the United States. I will provide a Python script to clarify what happens to his character in the movie.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the user's question.\n2.  Explain that the character Tommaso does not move to a US city in the film's plot.\n3.  State the actual fate of the character.\n4.  Print this information clearly.\n\n```python\n# The user asks which US city the character Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n# However, this is based on a misunderstanding of the film's plot.\n\n# Define the character and his fate in the movie.\ncharacter_name = \"Tommaso\"\ncharacter_fate = \"commits suicide after a failed exam\"\n\n# Print a clear statement correcting the premise.\nprint(f\"In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character {character_name} does not move to the United States.\")\nprint(f\"Instead, he tragically {character_fate}.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, there is no US city to name for this character.\")\n```\n<<<In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character Tommaso does not move to the United States; he commits suicide.>>>"
