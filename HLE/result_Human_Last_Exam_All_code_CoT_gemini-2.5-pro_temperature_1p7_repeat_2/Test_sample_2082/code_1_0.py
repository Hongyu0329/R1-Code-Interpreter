        "Magnesium helps lower blood pressure primarily through direct vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels). "
        "It acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. The contraction of smooth muscle cells in artery walls, "
        "which causes blood pressure to rise, is dependent on calcium. Magnesium competes with calcium at these sites, "
        "preventing muscle contraction and instead promoting relaxation. This relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle "
        "leads to vasodilation, which reduces peripheral resistance and subsequently lowers blood pressure. "
        "Options D and E are incorrect as magnesium is anti-inflammatory and a calcium antagonist, respectively. "
        "Options B and C are not the primary, direct mechanisms for blood pressure reduction."
