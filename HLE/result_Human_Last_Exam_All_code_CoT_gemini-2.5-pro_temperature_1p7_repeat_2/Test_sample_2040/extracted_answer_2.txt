No. The primary mechanism for spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) requires a material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). This property is fundamentally forbidden in materials that possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Because they possess this inversion symmetry, their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is necessarily zero, and therefore they are not expected to exhibit SPDC. While effects like defects or strain could locally break this symmetry, an ideal, free-standing nanosheet would not be a candidate for SPDC.
