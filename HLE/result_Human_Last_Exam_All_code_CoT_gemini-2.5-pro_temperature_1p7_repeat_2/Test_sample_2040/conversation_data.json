    "To determine whether free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to analyze their optical and crystallographic properties.\n\nMy plan is to first explain the physical principle behind SPDC. The key requirement for this nonlinear optical effect is that the material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). Then, I will provide a Python script that programmatically checks the known crystal structures of common boron nanosheet phases for this essential property. The script will demonstrate why borophene is generally not expected to exhibit SPDC, and the printed output will form the reasoning for the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef check_borophene_for_spdc():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential of common boron nanosheet phases for exhibiting\n    Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) based on their crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing Boron Nanosheets for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\\n\")\n    print(\"Principle: SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process whose efficiency\")\n    print(\"is primarily determined by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\")\n    print(\"A material can only have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks a center\")\n    print(\"of inversion (i.e., it is non-centrosymmetric).\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    # Data on common borophene phases, sourced from materials science literature.\n    # The key property is 'is_centrosymmetric'.\n    borophene_phases = {\n        \"β₁₂ sheet\": {\n            \"space_group\": \"Pmmn\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": True,\n            \"comment\": \"A stable, buckled borophene structure.\"\n        },\n        \"χ₃ sheet\": {\n            \"space_group\": \"Pmmn\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": True,\n            \"comment\": \"Another stable phase, also observed experimentally on Ag(111).\"\n        },\n        \"α sheet (planar honeycomb)\": {\n            \"space_group\": \"P6/mmm\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": True,\n            \"comment\": \"A theoretical high-symmetry planar structure.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the phases and check their symmetry\n    can_exhibit_spdc = False\n    for phase, properties in borophene_phases.items():\n        print(f\"Checking phase: {phase}\")\n        print(f\"  - Space Group: {properties['space_group']}\")\n        if properties['is_centrosymmetric']:\n            print(\"  - Symmetry: Centrosymmetric (possesses a center of inversion)\")\n            print(\"  - Implication: Bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero.

This property is fundamentally forbidden in materials that possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are centrosymmetric). The most stable and commonly studied phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, have crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Because they possess this inversion symmetry, their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is necessarily zero, and therefore they are not expected to exhibit SPDC. While effects like defects or strain could locally break this symmetry, an ideal, free-standing nanosheet would not be a candidate for SPDC.>>>"
