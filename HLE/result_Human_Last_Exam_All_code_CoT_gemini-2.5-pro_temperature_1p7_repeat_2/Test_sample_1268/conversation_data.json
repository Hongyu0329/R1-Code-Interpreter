    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your request:\n\nFirst, I will explain the mathematical concepts involved. The \"maximum norm\" in this context refers to the Minkowski bound, which provides an upper bound on the norm of an ideal in any given ideal class of a number field. For the real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, this bound is directly related to the field's discriminant, which you are referring to as related to the \"covolume\".\n\nThe relationship is defined by the Minkowski bound formula for a real quadratic number field ($K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$):\n\n$M_K \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $M_K$ is the Minkowski bound (the upper bound on the norm).\n*   $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the number field $K$.\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta_K$ is calculated based on $N$:\n1.  If $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\Delta_K = N$.\n2.  If $N \\equiv 2 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod{4}$, then $\\Delta_K = 4N$.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for the norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$ or $M_K$) is always one-half of the square root of the absolute value of the discriminant. If we consider the \"covolume\" ($V$) to be $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, the relationship is $M_K \\le \\frac{1}{2}V$.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this calculation for a specific squarefree number, $N$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_minkowski_bound(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Minkowski bound for the real quadratic field Q(sqrt(N)).\n\n    Args:\n        N: A squarefree natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the field Q(sqrt(N)) for N = {N}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the discriminant of the field.\n    # The discriminant (Δ) depends on whether N is congruent to 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4.\n    if N % 4 == 1:\n        delta = N\n        case_explanation = f\"Since N = {N} is congruent to 1 (mod 4), the discriminant is Δ = N.\"\n    else:  # Covers cases where N % 4 is 2 or 3\n        delta = 4 * N\n        case_explanation = f\"Since N = {N} is congruent to 2 or 3 (mod 4), the discriminant is Δ = 4 * N.\"\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the discriminant (Δ).\")\n    print(case_explanation)\n    if N % 4 != 1:\n      print(f\"Δ = 4 * {N} = {delta}\")\n    else:\n      print(f\"Δ = {delta}\")\n\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Minkowski bound (M_K).\n    # For a real quadratic field, the formula is M_K = (1/2) * sqrt(|Δ|).\n    minkowski_bound = 0.5 * math.sqrt(abs(delta))\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the Minkowski bound (M_K).\")\n    print(\"The formula for the upper bound is: M_K = (1/2) * sqrt(|Δ|)\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the value for Δ:\")\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers, as requested.\n    print(f\"M_K = {0.5} * sqrt({delta})\")\n    print(f\"The resulting upper bound is: M_K = {minkowski_bound}\")\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# Let's use a squarefree number, for example, N = 105 (3 * 5 * 7).\n# 105 mod 4 = 1.\nsquarefree_N = 105\ncalculate_minkowski_bound(squarefree_N)\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n# Let's use another squarefree number, N = 30 (2 * 3 * 5).\n# 30 mod 4 = 2.\nsquarefree_N_2 = 30\ncalculate_minkowski_bound(squarefree_N_2)\n\n```\n<<<0.5>>>"
