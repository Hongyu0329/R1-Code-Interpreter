    "My plan is to solve this problem by first principles of probability theory as applied to graph algorithms.\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure:**\nA barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (K5) connected by a single edge.\n*   Let's call the two complete graphs `A` and `B`. Each has 5 nodes.\n*   The total number of nodes, `N`, is 10.\n*   The connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\". Let's say it connects node `u` from graph `A` to node `v` from graph `B`.\n\n**2. Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping:**\nThis process involves two steps:\n*   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n*   Second, one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random. If a node `x` has `deg(x)` neighbors, the probability of choosing any specific neighbor is `1/deg(x)`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\nThe bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two disjoint events happens:\n*   Event 1: We select node `u`, and then select its neighbor `v`.\n*   Event 2: We select node `v`, and then select its neighbor `u`.\n\nThe total probability is `P(Event 1) + P(Event 2)`.\n\n*   **P(Event 1) = P(select u) * P(select v | u was selected)**\n    *   `P(select u) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   To find `P(select v | u was selected)`, we need the degree of `u`, `deg(u)`. Node `u` is connected to 4 other nodes in its own K5 and to node `v` via the bottleneck. So, `deg(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   `P(select v | u was selected) = 1/deg(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 1) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **P(Event 2) = P(select v) * P(select u | v was selected)**\n    *   `P(select v) = 1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Similarly, `deg(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   `P(select u | v was selected) = 1/deg(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(Event 2) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Total Probability** = `P(Event 1) + P(Event 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossiping_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes during a randomized uniform gossiping process.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
