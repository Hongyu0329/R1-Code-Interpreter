    # 2. Define the nodes of the bottleneck edge and calculate their degrees.
    # Let the bottleneck edge be (u, v), where u is in the first K5 and v in the second.
    # The degree of node u is its connections within its K5 plus the one bottleneck connection.

    # 3. Calculate the probability.

    # two disjoint events:
    # a) Picking node u, then its neighbor v.
    # b) Picking node v, then its neighbor u.
