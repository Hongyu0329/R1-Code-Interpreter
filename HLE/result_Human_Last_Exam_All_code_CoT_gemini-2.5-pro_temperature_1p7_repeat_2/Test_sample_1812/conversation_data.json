    "The user wants to find the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. The context about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) does not change the composition of the matrix `A`, so we can proceed with the standard determinant calculation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` in Python using the `numpy` library, which is well-suited for matrix operations.\n2.  The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n    \\[\n    \\begin{vmatrix}\n    a & b & c \\\\\n    d & e & f \\\\\n    g & h & i\n    \\end{vmatrix}\n    = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    \\]\n3.  I will write a Python script that substitutes the values from matrix `A` into this formula.\n4.  The script will print out the equation with all the numbers filled in, showing the calculation explicitly as requested.\n5.  Finally, the script will compute and print the final result of the determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract the elements of the matrix for clarity in the formula\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the determinant using numpy for the final answer\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation as requested\nprint(\"To compute the determinant of the matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nWe use the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n# Perform the calculations within the parentheses\nei = e * i\nfh = f * h\ndi = d * i\nfg = f * g\ndh = d * h\neg = e * g\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({ei} - ({fh})) - ({b}) * ({di} - ({fg})) + ({c}) * ({dh} - ({eg}))\")\n# Perform the subtraction within the parentheses\nterm1_inner = ei - fh\nterm2_inner = di - fg\nterm3_inner = dh - eg\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({term1_inner}) - ({b}) * ({term2_inner}) + ({c}) * ({term3_inner})\")\n# Perform the final multiplications and additions/subtractions\nterm1 = a * term1_inner\nterm2 = -b * term2_inner\nterm3 = c * term3_inner\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1} + {term2} + {term3}\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1 + term2 + term3}\")\n\n# Print the final answer clearly\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix A is {determinant}.\")\n<<<0>>>\n```"
