    # The communication cost for a given run depends on the POVMs chosen by Alice
    # and Bob, represented by vectors 'a' and 'b' (with ||a|| <= 1, ||b|| <= 1).
    # The average communication cost is C_avg = (1 - ||a||)/2 + (1 - ||b||)/2.
    # To get a single value, we average this over all possible measurements, assuming
    # a uniform distribution of vectors 'a' and 'b' in the 3D unit ball.
    # This simplifies to C_avg = 1 - E_norm, where E_norm is the average norm
    # of a vector in the 3D unit ball.

    # The average norm E_norm for a 3D unit ball is calculated as:
    # (Integral[r * 4*pi*r^2 dr, {r,0,1}]) / (Integral[4*pi*r^2 dr, {r,0,1}])
