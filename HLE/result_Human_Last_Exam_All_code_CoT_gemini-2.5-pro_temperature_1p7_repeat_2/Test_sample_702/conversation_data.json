    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow a step-by-step analysis of the spaces and the map, calculating their properties and using key results from homotopy theory. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the spaces**: We identify the source and target spaces based on the given spheres $S^p$ and $S^q$ where $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n2.  **Calculate the connectivity of the spaces**: We determine how connected the source and target spaces are, i.e., up to which dimension their homotopy groups are trivial.\n3.  **Analyze low-dimensional homotopy groups**: We compute the first non-trivial homotopy groups for both the source and target spaces.\n4.  **Analyze the map on homotopy groups**: We use known results about the Whitehead product to determine how the map acts on these first few homotopy groups.\n5.  **Determine the connectivity of the map**: Based on the definition of a k-connected map (a map that induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups up to dimension $k-1$ and a surjection in dimension $k$), we conclude the final connectivity value.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_connectivity_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n    for p=4 and q=6.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    p = 4\n    q = 6\n\n    # The equation involves integer values p and q from the spheres S^p and S^q.\n    print(f\"The problem is about the map induced by spheres of dimension p={p} and q={q}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Analyzing the Source and Target Spaces ---\")\n\n    # Source space S = Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q)\n    # Target space T = Omega(S^p wedge S^q) = Omega(S^{p+q})\n    \n    # Connectivity of Omega S^n is (n-2).\n    conn_omega_sp = p - 2\n    conn_omega_sq = q - 2\n    \n    print(f\"The connectivity of Omega S^{p} is p-2 = {conn_omega_sp}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of Omega S^{q} is q-2 = {conn_omega_sq}.\")\n    \n    # Connectivity of a smash product A wedge B is conn(A) + conn(B) + 1.\n    conn_smash_of_omegas = conn_omega_sp + conn_omega_sq + 1\n    \n    # Python code outputting each number in the final equation:\n    print(f\"Connectivity of the smash product (Omega S^{p} wedge Omega S^{q}) is {conn_omega_sp} + {conn_omega_sq} + 1 = {conn_smash_of_omegas}.\")\n    \n    # Connectivity of a suspension Sigma A is conn(A) + 1.\n    conn_source = conn_smash_of_omegas + 1\n    print(f\"The source space Sigma(Omega S^{p} wedge Omega S^{q}) is therefore ({conn_smash_of_omegas})-connected, meaning its connectivity is {conn_source}.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of S^{p+q} is (p+q-1).\n    # Connectivity of Omega S^n is (n-2).\n    conn_target = (p + q) - 2\n    print(f\"The target space Omega(S^{p} wedge S^{q}) = Omega(S^{p+q}) = Omega(S^{p+q}) is ({p+q}-2)-connected, so its connectivity is {conn_target}.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion of Step 1: Both spaces are {conn_source}-connected.
