    # --- Biological Mechanism Explanation ---
    # Both compounds are electrophiles that activate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.
    # 1. Electrophiles modify cysteines on the sensor protein Keap1.
    # 2. Keap1 releases the transcription factor Nrf2.
    # 3. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and increases the expression of
    #    antioxidant genes, including Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH).
    # 4-OI is known to be a more potent Nrf2 activator than HNYA.
