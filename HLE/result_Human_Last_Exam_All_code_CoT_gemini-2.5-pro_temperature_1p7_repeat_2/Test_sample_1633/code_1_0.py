    This function analyzes the network transformation problem to determine the scaling of m(n).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The initial graph is a Watts-Strogatz small-world network with average path length L ~ log(n) and a degree distribution sharply peaked at k=6.
    2.  The target graph is an ultra-small-world network with L ~ log(log(n)). This property is characteristic of scale-free networks with a power-law degree distribution P(k) ~ k^-gamma (for 2 < gamma < 3).
    3.  Therefore, the transformation must change the degree distribution from a narrow peak to a broad power law.
    4.  In the initial graph, almost all 'n' nodes have a degree of 6. In the final power-law graph, degrees will be distributed over a wide range. A constant fraction of the 'n' nodes must change their degree.
    5.  Let's say c*n nodes (where c is a constant) need to change their degree.
    6.  A single rewiring operation (remove one edge, add one edge) affects the degrees of at most 4 nodes.
    7.  To change the degrees of c*n nodes, we need at least (c*n)/4 operations. This means the number of operations m(n) must be at least proportional to n, so m(n) is in Omega(n).
    8.  It is also known that O(n) rewirings are sufficient to construct such a network.
    9.  Combining the lower and upper bounds, the minimum number of operations m(n) must be in Theta(n).

    This corresponds to option B.

# The final answer is one of the options A-L. Based on the reasoning, B is the correct choice.
# Final Answer format: <<<B>>>

# Justification:
# A) m(n) ∈ Θ(n log log n) -> Incorrect, more than needed.
# B) m(n) ∈ Θ(n) -> Correct, as derived above.
# C) The rewired edges must form a tree-like structure... -> Incorrect, m(n) is much larger than the edges in a tree of hubs.
# D) At least n/4 vertices must reach degree ⌈log(n)⌉ -> Incorrect, not enough edges in the graph.
# E) The transformation requires creating at least log(n) hub vertices -> True but a weak lower bound. B is a more precise statement about m(n).
# F) The resulting graph must have power-law degree distribution -> True, but this is a premise to find m(n). B is the answer about the cost m(n).
# G) C(G) must drop below 0.4 during some intermediate state -> Not necessarily.
# H) The process requires at least n/6 edge removals from the original lattice structure -> Plausible but less certain than B.
# I) The transformation can maintain constant average path length throughout -> False by definition.
# J) The resulting graph must contain a densely connected core... -> Incorrect due to degree constraint.
# K) The original small-world property can be preserved at each step -> False.
# L) The process must create at least log log n vertices of degree Θ(log n) -> True but a very weak lower bound.
# B is the strongest and most direct answer to the question about m(n).
