    "To identify the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisks:** There are two prominent Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and its twin is at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. A film depicting either location could contain the answer.\n2.  **Create a Chronological List:** I will compile a list of Best Picture winning films, particularly those set in Paris or Egypt, where an obelisk might be shown.\n3.  **Research and Verify:** I will go through this list in chronological order. For each film, I will verify through film analysis and historical data whether a Luxor Obelisk is actually depicted on-screen. Not every film set in Paris will necessarily show the Place de la Concorde.\n4.  **Code the Logic:** I will write a Python script that encodes this research. The script will contain a list of relevant movie candidates, ordered by the year they won the award, along with a flag indicating if they verifiably depict the obelisk.\n5.  **Find the First Match:** The script will iterate through the list and stop at the first movie that is confirmed to show the obelisk, printing its title as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. A list of potential candidates (movies set in Paris, a city with a Luxor Obelisk)\n       is created, sorted chronologically by the year they won Best Picture.\n    2. Each movie is paired with a boolean based on film research, indicating whether\n       it verifiably depicts the obelisk in Place de la Concorde.\n    3. The script iterates through this list and identifies the first film\n       for which the depiction is confirmed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # MovieInfo named tuple for better readability.\n    MovieInfo = collections.namedtuple('MovieInfo', ['year', 'title', 'depicts_obelisk'])\n\n    # A list of Best Picture winners set in Paris, ordered chronologically.\n    # The 'depicts_obelisk' flag is based on established film knowledge.\n    # - The Life of Emile Zola (1937): Set in Paris, but shot on backlots. No confirmed obelisk scene.\n    # - An American in Paris (1951): Features a famous, stylized depiction of the Place de la Concorde\n    #   and its obelisk in the final ballet sequence.\n    # - Around the World in 80 Days (1956): Features the obelisk during Paris scenes.\n    # - Gigi (1958): Features the obelisk in on-location shots of Paris.\n    candidate_films = [\n        MovieInfo(year=1937, title=\"The Life of Emile Zola\", depicts_obelisk=False),\n        MovieInfo(year=1951, title=\"An American in Paris\", depicts_obelisk=True),\n        MovieInfo(year=1956, title=\"Around the World in 80 Days\", depicts_obelisk=True),\n        MovieInfo(year=1958, title=\"Gigi\", depicts_obelisk=True),\n    ]\n\n    # Find the first film in the chronological list where depiction is confirmed.\n    for film in candidate_films:\n        if film.depicts_obelisk:\n            print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk was: {film.title} ({film.year})\")\n            return\n\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
