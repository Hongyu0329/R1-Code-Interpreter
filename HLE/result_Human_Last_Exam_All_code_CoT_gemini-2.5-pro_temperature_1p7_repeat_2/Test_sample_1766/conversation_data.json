    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   Therefore, the possible values for `j` are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n3.  **Determine Z-Component of Total Angular Momentum (m_j):** For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n    *   For `j = 3/2`, `m_j` can be `-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2`.\n    *   For `j = 1/2`, `m_j` can be `-1/2, 1/2`.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues for the operators `J²` and `Jz` are given by:\n    *   `J²` eigenvalue: `j(j+1)ħ²`\n    *   `Jz` eigenvalue: `m_j ħ`\n5.  **Generate Code:** A Python script will be created to systematically calculate and print all possible common eigenvalues for each valid state `|j, m_j>`. The `fractions` module will be used to handle fractional quantum numbers accurately.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, the spin quantum number s=1/2.\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}:\\n\")\n\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number j ranges from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    # Generate the possible j values (with integer steps)\n    j_values = []\n    current_j = j_min\n    while current_j <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(current_j)\n        current_j += 1\n    \n    # For each state |j, m_j>, calculate the eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z.\n    for j in j_values:\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"--- For total angular momentum j = {j} ---\")\n        print(f\"The J^2 eigenvalue is j(j+1)ħ^2 = {j}({j}+1)ħ^2 = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ^2.\")\n        print(f\"The common eigenstates |j, m_j> and J_z eigenvalues are:\")\n\n        # The quantum number m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        current_mj = -j\n        while current_mj <= j:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is m_j * hbar\n            print(f\"  For state |j={j}, m_j={current_mj}>, the J_z eigenvalue is {current_mj}ħ.\")\n            current_mj += 1\n        print(\"\") # Add a blank line for readability\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n<<<The possible total angular momentum quantum numbers are j=3/2 and j=1/2.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
