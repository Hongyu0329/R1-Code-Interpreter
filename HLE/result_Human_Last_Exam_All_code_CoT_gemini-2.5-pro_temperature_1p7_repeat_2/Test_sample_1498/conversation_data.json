    "Of course. The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi is a foundational text that summarizes the essentials of Islamic belief in verse. A specific section is dedicated to listing the 25 prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will identify the specific verses (*abyat*) in the poem where the names of the prophets are listed.\n2.  I will then write a Python script that stores the starting and ending verse numbers in variables.\n3.  Finally, the script will print a clear statement that specifies the range of verses, ensuring each number from the range is explicitly outputted as requested.\n\n```python\n# The starting verse number where the names of the prophets are listed.\nstart_bayt = 18\n\n# The ending verse number of the list.\nend_bayt = 21\n\n# Name of the poem for context.\npoem_name = \"Aqeedat al-'Awaam\"\n\n# Print the final answer in a clear, readable format.\nprint(f\"In the poem '{poem_name}', the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n```\n<<<From bayt 18 to 21>>>"
