    This function solves a topological problem through reasoning.

    1.  The number of distinct compactifications for a given remainder X is
        equal to the number of orbits of non-empty closed subsets of X under
        the group of homeomorphisms of X. Our goal is to find an X that
        minimizes this number.

    2.  Let X be any valid space. It must have at least two points, say p1 and p2.
        The set C1 = {p1} is a non-empty closed subset.
        The set C2 = X is also a non-empty closed subset.
        Since a homeomorphism must preserve the number of points, there can be
        no homeomorphism mapping the single-point set C1 to the multi-point
        set C2. Therefore, C1 and C2 are in different orbits. This implies
        that for any valid X, there are at least 2 distinct compactifications.

    3.  We now check if the minimum of 2 can be achieved. Let's consider the
        space X = {0, 1} with the discrete topology.
        - It is nondegenerate, compact, metric, and locally connected.
        - Its non-empty closed subsets are {0}, {1}, and {0, 1}.
        - The homeomorphisms of X are the identity and the map that swaps 0 and 1.
        - The set {0} can be mapped to {1} by the swap homeomorphism.
          So, {{0}, {1}} forms one orbit.
        - The set {0, 1} can only be mapped to itself. So, {{0, 1}} forms
          a second orbit.
        - This gives a total of 2 orbits.

    4.  Since the number of compactifications is always >= 2, and we have found
        a case where it is exactly 2, the minimum number is 2.
