    This function identifies and prints the letters of San Francisco's
    November 2024 propositions that would be nullified if a competing
    proposition passes with more votes.

    Based on research of the ballot measures:
    - Proposition B (Police Officer Staffing Levels) and Proposition E (Police Department Policies and Procedures) are competing measures.
    - If both pass, the one with more 'yes' votes becomes law, and the other is nullified.
    - Therefore, both 'B' and 'E' are propositions that could be nullified.
