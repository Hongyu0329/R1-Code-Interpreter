    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will analyze the musical theory behind your question, which asks for a Beatles song starting with a specific chord progression: a jump from the tonic chord (I) to the minor fifth chord (v).\n2.  I will search for Beatles songs whose opening chords match this pattern. For example, in the key of F Major, the tonic chord is F Major, and the minor fifth chord is C minor.\n3.  The song \"Michelle\" famously begins with this progression. The intro is in F Major and moves from an F major chord (the tonic) to a C minor-based chord (the minor fifth).\n4.  I will then create a Python script to print the name of this song as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Beatles song\n    that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n\n    The song is \"Michelle\".\n    In the key of F Major, the progression is:\n    - Tonic (I): F Major\n    - Minor Fifth (v): C minor\n    The song's famous introduction follows this I -> v movement.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: {song_title}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
