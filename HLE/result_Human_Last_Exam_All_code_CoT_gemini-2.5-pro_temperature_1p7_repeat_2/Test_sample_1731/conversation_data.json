    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan followed by the Python code to present the results.\n\n### Plan:\n\nThe goal is to find the equilibrium values for the mean energy (`U`) and entropy (`S`) of a gas of light quanta (photons).\n\n1.  **Theoretical Foundation**: The core principle is that the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the one that maximizes its entropy (`S`), as stated by Boltzmann. Large Deviation Theory, specifically the **Boltzmann-Sanov theorem**, provides a formal justification for this. It states that the probability of a system spontaneously arranging into a macrostate significantly different from the maximum entropy state is exponentially small for a large number of particles. Thus, maximizing the system's entropy subject to its physical constraints will yield the equilibrium properties.\n2.  **System Definition**: We are considering a photon gas. Photons are bosons, so they follow Bose-Einstein statistics. A key property of photons is that their total number is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero (`μ=0`). The system is constrained by its total energy, `U`.\n3.  **Derivation Steps**:\n    *   First, we write down the statistical definition of entropy for bosons based on counting the number of possible microstates.\n    *   We then use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize this entropy `S` under the constraint of a fixed total energy `U = Σ nᵢεᵢ`. This process yields the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` at a given energy level `ε`. For photons (`μ=0`), this is specifically the Planck distribution.\n    *   Next, to find the total mean energy `U`, we integrate the energy `ε` multiplied by this distribution `<n(ε)>` over all possible energy states. This requires using the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume. The result is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy.\n    *   Finally, we derive the entropy `S`. A convenient thermodynamic relation is `S = (U - F) / T`, where `F` is the Helmholtz free energy. We find `F` from the partition function `Z` (`F = -kT log(Z)`) and discover a simple relationship between `U` and `F` for a photon gas, which leads directly to the equilibrium entropy `S`.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final, derived formulas for the equilibrium mean energy `U` and entropy `S`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy (U) and\n    entropy (S) for a photon gas based on Bose-Einstein statistics and\n    large deviation principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This script provides the equilibrium values for mean energy (U) and entropy (S) of a photon gas.\")\n    print(\"The derivation follows from maximizing the entropy for a system of bosons with zero chemical potential,\")\n    print(\"a principle justified by the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem of large deviation theory.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Bose-Einstein distribution for photons\")\n    print(\"Maximizing entropy under the constraint of constant energy leads to the Planck distribution\")\n    print(\"for the mean occupation number <n(ε)> of a state with energy ε at temperature T:\")\n    print(\"  <n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k*T)) - 1)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)\")\n    print(\"The total energy U is found by integrating ε*<n(ε)> over the density of states g(ε) = (8*π*V / (h^3*c^3)) * ε^2.\")\n    print(\"  U = Integral from 0 to infinity of [ ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) ] dε\")\n    print(\"Solving this integral leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy:\")\n    \n    # Equation for U\n    energy_numerator = \"8 * π^5 * V * k^4 * T^4\"\n    energy_denominator = \"15 * h^3 * c^3\"\n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (U) ---\")\n    print(f\"U = ({energy_numerator}) / ({energy_denominator})\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Equilibrium Entropy (S)\")\n    print(\"Using the thermodynamic relation S = (U - F)/T, where F is the Helmholtz free energy,\")\n    print(\"it can be shown for a photon gas that S = 4*U / (3*T).\")\n    print(\"Substituting the expression for U gives the equilibrium entropy:\")\n\n    # Equation for S\n    entropy_numerator = \"32 * π^5 * V * k^4 * T^3\"\n    entropy_denominator = \"45 * h^3 * c^3\"\n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\")\n    print(f\"S = ({entropy_numerator}) / ({entropy_denominator})\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where the constants are:\")\n    print(\"  V: Volume of the container\")\n    print(\"  T: Absolute temperature\")\n    print(\"  k: Boltzmann constant\")\n    print(\"  h: Planck constant\")\n    print(\"  c: Speed of light in a vacuum\")\n    print(\"  π: Mathematical constant Pi\")\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_equilibrium_values()\n\n```\n<<<U = (8 * π^5 * V * k^4 * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3), S = (32 * π^5 * V * k^4 * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)>>>"
