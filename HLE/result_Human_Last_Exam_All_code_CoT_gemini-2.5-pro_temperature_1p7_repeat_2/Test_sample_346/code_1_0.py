# Based on the analysis of the SKI combinator expression:
# A evaluates to the Church numeral for 2.
# B evaluates to the Church numeral for 6.
A = 2
B = 6

# The main expression n = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A))))(B) reduces to the nested
# application n = B(B(B(A))). In Church arithmetic, m(p) is p^m.
# This results in the calculation: n = (((A^B)^B)^B)
base = A
exp1 = B
exp2 = B
exp3 = B

# Using the laws of exponents, this simplifies to:
# n = A^(B * B * B) = A^(B^3)
final_exponent = exp1 * exp2 * exp3

# Calculate log_2(n)
# log_2(n) = log_2(A^(B^3)) = B^3 * log_2(A)
# Since A = 2, log_2(A) = 1.
# So, log_2(n) = B^3 = 6^3 = 216.
log_2_n = (B ** 3) * math.log2(A)
