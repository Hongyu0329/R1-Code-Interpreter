    "My approach to solving this problem involves analyzing the structure of the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The number of double points in this reduction can be determined using a well-established formula from the theory of arithmetic geometry.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the curve and its genus `g`**: The given equation is $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$. This is a hyperelliptic curve. The genus `g` is determined by the degree of the polynomial in `x`.\n2.  **Determine the number of branch point clusters `k`**: The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by how its branch points are \"clustered\" in the 2-adic metric. To find this, I will:\n    a. Identify all the branch points of the curve.\n    b. Calculate the 2-adic valuations of the differences between pairs of branch points.\n    c. Group the branch points into clusters. The number of clusters is `k`.\n3.  **Calculate the number of double points `Î´`**: The number of double points (also known as nodes) in the stable reduction is given by the formula $\\delta = g + k - 1$.\n\nI will now implement this plan in a Python script. The script will outline these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction\n# of the curve y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 over the prime p=2.\n#\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of a curve.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the coefficients of the polynomial f(x) in y^2 = f(x)\n    f_coeffs = {5: 8, 4: 4, 3: 4, 2: 1, 1: 8}\n\n    print(\"The curve is given by the equation: y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x\")\n    print(\"The number of double points in the stable reduction is determined by the formula: delta = g + k - 1\")\n    print(\"where g is the genus and k is the number of branch point clusters.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the genus (g) of the curve.\n    # The degree of f(x) is the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient.\n    degree = 5\n    # For a hyperelliptic curve y^2 = f(x) of degree d, the genus g = floor((d-1)/2).\n    g = (degree - 1) // 2\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculating the genus (g).\")\n    print(f\"The polynomial f(x) has degree d = {degree}.\")\n    print(f\"The genus g = floor(({degree} - 1) / 2) = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of branch point clusters (k).\n    # The branch points are the roots of f(x) and infinity (since degree is odd).\n    # We analyze the 2-adic valuations of these points to find the clusters.\n    #\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x * (8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8).\n    # One root is 0.
