    print("   - Septic Arthritis (C) is ruled out because there are no organisms or white blood cells.")
    print("   - Pseudogout (E) is ruled out because there are no crystals. Gout is also unlikely for this reason.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate diagnoses based on Response to Treatment
    print("2. Evaluating based on Response to Corticosteroids:")
    print(f"   Patient's response to steroids: {patient['response_to_steroids']}.")
    print("   - Most inflammatory conditions (like Gout, Pseudogout, Rheumatoid Arthritis) improve with steroids.")
    print("   - Worsening on steroids is a significant clue that points away from common inflammatory arthritis and suggests a different pathology.\n")

    # Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options
    print("3. Evaluating remaining possibilities:")
    print("   - Osteoarthritis (A) is a degenerative disease. While it causes pain, it doesn't typically cause the acute, severe inflammation (erythema, warmth) seen in this patient.")
    print("   - Chronic osteomyelitis (D) is a bone infection. While possible, the primary joint involvement and 'clean' synovial fluid make it less likely than an arthropathy.\n")

    print("     - Presents as an acute, inflamed joint after minor trauma.")
    print("     - Early X-rays are often normal.")
    print("     - The classic hallmark is a significant mismatch: the joint appears highly inflammatory, but the synovial fluid is bland and non-inflammatory.")
    print("     - The condition can be exacerbated by corticosteroids and continued weight-bearing.\n")
