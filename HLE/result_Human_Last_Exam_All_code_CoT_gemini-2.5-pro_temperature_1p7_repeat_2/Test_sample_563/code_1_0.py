    This function provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
    for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g=2, 3, and 4.

    The problem is a well-known classification problem in algebraic geometry. The
    solution is not computed here but is based on results from the mathematical
    literature, specifically the comprehensive 2021 paper by M. Conder,
    R. Kenda, and G. Martin, which provides the most current classifications.
