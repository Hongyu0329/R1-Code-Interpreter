    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System**: First, I will identify the equilibrium points of the system of differential equations by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n2.  **Determine Stability**: I will then analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by computing the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues at each point. This will help us identify any saddle points, which are crucial for finding separatrices.\n3.  **Find Invariant Curves**: A separatrix is an invariant curve, meaning a trajectory that starts on the curve stays on the curve. I will search for an analytical expression for such a curve, $d = f(u)$, by substituting this into the system's equations. The condition for an invariant curve is $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt}$.\n4.  **Hypothesize a Form**: I'll assume the separatrix can be described by a simple polynomial, specifically a quadratic of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\n5.  **Solve for Coefficients**: By plugging the polynomial into the invariant curve condition and equating the coefficients of the powers of $u$, I will solve for the constants $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n6.  **Identify the Separatrix**: The resulting polynomial equation(s) will represent the separatrices of the system. In this problem, two such curves exist. A particularly important separatrix is the one corresponding to the unstable manifold of the system's saddle point, which I will select as the final answer.\n7.  **Generate Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that explicitly defines the coefficients of the separatrix equation and prints the final equation, making sure to show all the numbers involved as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n2.  $u'(t) = u^2(u - 1)$\n\n**Equilibrium Points**:\nSetting $u'=0$ gives $u^2(u-1)=0$, so $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n-   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n-   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two more equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**Stability Analysis**:\nThe Jacobian matrix analysis shows that $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices.\n\n**Finding the Separatrix Equation**:\nWe seek an invariant curve $d=f(u)$ that satisfies $d' = f'(u) u'$.\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) = f'(u) (u^3 - u^2)$\nLet's assume a quadratic solution $f(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. Then $f'(u) = 2au + b$.\nSubstituting this into the equation and equating coefficients of powers of $u$, we get a system of equations for $a, b, c$.\n-   Comparing constant terms ($u^0$): $2c^2 = 0 \\implies c=0$.\n-   Comparing coefficients of $u^2$: $2b^2 - 3b = -b \\implies 2b^2 - 2b = 0 \\implies b=0$ or $b=1$.\n-   Comparing coefficients of $u^4$: $2a^2+5a+1 = 2a \\implies 2a^2+3a+1=0 \\implies a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n-   Comparing coefficients of $u^3$: $4ab+4b-a-1=0$.\n\nTesting the possible values:\n1.  If $b=0$, the $u^3$ equation becomes $-a-1=0 \\implies a=-1$. This is a consistent solution. So, $(a, b, c) = (-1, 0, 0)$, which gives the curve $d = -u^2$.\n2.  If $b=1$, the $u^3$ equation becomes $4a+4-a-1=0 \\implies 3a+3=0 \\implies a=-1$. This is also consistent. So, $(a, b, c) = (-1, 1, 0)$, which gives the curve $d = -u^2+u$.\n\nBoth $d = -u^2$ and $d = u - u^2$ are separatrices. The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and can be shown to be its unstable manifold. This is a fundamentally important separatrix that organizes the overall dynamics of the system. Therefore, I will provide this as the solution.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analytical derivation, a key separatrix of the system\n# is an invariant algebraic curve. Specifically, it corresponds to the\n# unstable manifold of the saddle point at (u,d)=(1,-1).\n\n# We found the equation of this curve has the polynomial form d = a*u**2 + b*u + c.\n# Our derivation provided the following coefficients:\na = -1\nb = 0\nc = 0\n\n# The relevant power of u in the equation.\npower = 2\n\n# We now print the final equation of the separatrix, showing each number involved\n# as requested in the problem description.\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is an algebraic curve relating d and u.\")\nprint(f\"The general form we searched for is d = a*u**2 + b*u + c.\")\nprint(f\"Our analysis yields the coefficients: a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThus, the final equation for the separatrix is:\")\nprint(f\"d = ({a}) * u**{power}\")\n```\n<<<$d = -u^2$>>>"
