# The user wants me to analyze a legal scenario and determine the correct attribution of liability.
# The scenario involves two separate incidents of property damage caused by two different employees
# of the same company, Evergreen Grass Care Ltd.
#
# Incident 1: Mark's negligence leads to a lawnmower damaging a pool.
#   - Mark is an employee of Evergreen.
#   - Mark was negligent. He is personally liable.
#   - Evergreen is vicariously liable for the torts of its employee acting within the scope of employment.
#   - Therefore, Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the pool damage.
#   - The neighbour's role is too remote to be a proximate cause, so they are not liable.
#
# Incident 2: Lincoln's negligence leads to a blower scratching a Ferrari.
#   - Lincoln is an employee of Evergreen.
#   - Lincoln was negligent (blowing rocks at a car). He is personally liable.
#   - Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's actions.
#   - Therefore, Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the car damage.
#
# Let's evaluate the choices based on this analysis:
# A. Evergreen, Mark, and neighbours are liable for Mark's actions. Only Lincoln is liable for his. -> Incorrect. Neighbours are not liable, and Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
# B. Evergreen, Mark, and Lincoln are all jointly liable for all damage. -> Incorrect. Mark and Lincoln are not liable for each other's actions.
# C. Evergreen and Mark are liable for Mark's actions. Only Lincoln is liable for his. -> Incorrect. Evergreen is also liable for Lincoln's actions.
# D. Evergreen and Mark are liable for Mark's actions. Lincoln is not liable because damage is minimal. -> Incorrect. Minimal damage is still damage.
# E. Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable for Mark's actions. Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for Lincoln's actions. -> Correct. This accurately reflects the legal principles of personal and vicarious liability for each separate incident.

final_answer = 'E'
