# The user wants to calculate the gate capacitance based on Quantum Hall measurements.
# The calculation will result in a formula involving the given variables and physical constants.

# Known numerical values from the problem description:
# g_spin is the spin degeneracy.
g_spin = 2
# g_valley is the two-fold valley degeneracy.
g_valley = 2
# The total degeneracy g is the product of the individual degeneracies.
g = g_spin * g_valley

# The problem states that Landau levels are observed at V_1, 3*V_1, and 5*V_1.
# The voltage difference (delta_V) between filling consecutive Landau levels is constant.
# delta_V = (3 * V_1) - (1 * V_1) = 2 * V_1
# So, the numerical coefficient for the voltage step is 2.
delta_v_coefficient = 2

# The gate capacitance C is defined by the relation C = ΔQ / ΔV, where:
# - ΔV is the voltage required to fill one Landau level.
# - ΔQ is the charge required to fill one Landau level.
#
# The formula for ΔQ is derived from the Landau level degeneracy:
# ΔQ = (g * e^2 * B * A) / h
# where e is elementary charge, B is magnetic field, A is device area, and h is Planck's constant.
#
# Combining these, we get:
# C = [ (g * e^2 * B * A) / h ] / (delta_v_coefficient * V_1)

# Now, we substitute the known numerical values for g and the delta_V coefficient.
# C = [ (4 * e^2 * B * A) / h ] / (2 * V_1)
# Simplifying this gives the final coefficient.
final_coefficient = g / delta_v_coefficient

# We will now print the final derived equation and its components.
