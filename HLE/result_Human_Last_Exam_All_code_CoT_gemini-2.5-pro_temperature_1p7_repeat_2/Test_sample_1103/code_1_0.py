    Solves the Gauss class number problem for h=48.

    The problem asks for the number of negative fundamental discriminants `d`
    for which the ideal class group of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(d))
    has order (class number) h = 48.

    This is a computationally difficult problem that has been solved by
    mathematicians using extensive computer searches. The results are well-established.
    Instead of re-computing, which would be very time-consuming, we rely on the
    known result from this research.
