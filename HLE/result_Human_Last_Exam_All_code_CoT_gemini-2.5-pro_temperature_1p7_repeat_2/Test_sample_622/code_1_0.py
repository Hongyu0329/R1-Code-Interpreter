    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("\n[A] Analyzing: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("   - 'She' is a pronoun. 'Mary' is an R-expression (a name).")
    print("   - The subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person.")
    print("   - In the sentence structure, the subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("   - Principle C states that an R-expression ('Mary') must be free. However, here it is bound by the c-commanding, co-indexed pronoun 'She'.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This is a clear violation of Principle C. Sentence A is ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("\n[B] Analyzing: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical. The grammatical form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - The error is moving 'Whose' away from 'glasses'. 'Whose glasses' is a single constituent (a Noun Phrase).")
    print("   - This violates a constraint on movement known as the 'Left Branch Condition'.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This ungrammaticality is due to a movement constraint, not a violation of Binding Principles A, B, or C.")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("\n[C] Analyzing: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("   - This question is based on a statement like 'John_i likes Mary and himself_i.'")
    print("   - The question attempts to extract one part ('himself') from a coordinate structure ('Mary and himself').")
    print("   - This violates a movement constraint called the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint'.")
    print("   - However, we can also view this through a binding lens. The element being questioned ('Who') is the anaphor 'himself'.")
    print("   - When 'himself' moves to the front of the sentence, it is no longer c-commanded by its antecedent, 'John'.")
    print("   - Principle A requires an anaphor ('himself') to be c-commanded by its antecedent ('John'). Moving it breaks this relationship.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This can be analyzed as a violation of Principle A. Sentence C is ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.")

    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Sentence A violates Principle C.")
    print("Sentence C violates Principle A.")
    print("Therefore, the sentences that are ungrammatical due to binding principle violations are A and C.")
    print("\nThe correct option is E, which includes both A and C.")
    print("\nUngrammatical sentences from the correct option:")
    print("A: She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.")
    print("C: Who does John like Mary and?")
