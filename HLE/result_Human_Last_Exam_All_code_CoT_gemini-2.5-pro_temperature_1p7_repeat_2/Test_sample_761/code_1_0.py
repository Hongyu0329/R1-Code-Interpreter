No, polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides. They are both large biological polymers (macromolecules), but their chemical composition and structure are fundamentally different.

Here is a breakdown of the key differences:

1. Monomers (Repeating Units):
   - Polysaccharides are polymers of simple sugars called monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose).
   - Polynucleotides are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is a more complex molecule made of three distinct components:
     a) A five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA).
     b) A phosphate group.
     c) A nitrogenous base (A, G, C, T, or U).

2. Backbone Structure:
   - The backbone of a polysaccharide is formed by linking monosaccharide units directly to each other via glycosidic bonds. It is a chain of sugars.
   - The backbone of a polynucleotide is a repeating sugar-phosphate chain. The phosphate group of one nucleotide links to the sugar of the next.

3. Chemical Bonds:
   - The monomers in a polysaccharide are joined by glycosidic bonds.
   - The nucleotides in a polynucleotide are joined by phosphodiester bonds.

In summary, while both structures contain sugar units, the presence of phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases in polynucleotides, along with the completely different type of backbone and chemical linkage, places them in a distinct chemical class from polysaccharides.
