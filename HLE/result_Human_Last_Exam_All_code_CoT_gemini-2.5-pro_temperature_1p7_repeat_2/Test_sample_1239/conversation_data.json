    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the physical system described, which is the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow in three spatial dimensions. The question asks for the dimension of the symmetry group of these equations.\n2.  The symmetries of a set of differential equations are continuous transformations of the independent and dependent variables that leave the equations unchanged. These symmetries form a mathematical structure called a Lie group, and its dimension is the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation in the group.\n3.  I will list the known symmetry transformations for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These are:\n    *   Time translation (the laws don't change over time).\n    *   Space translations (the laws are the same everywhere).\n    *   Spatial rotations (the laws are isotropic, i.e., they don't depend on direction).\n    *   Galilean boosts (the laws are the same in a frame moving at a constant velocity).\n    *   A specific scaling transformation of space, time, velocity, and pressure.\n    *   A shift in the base level of the pressure (since only the pressure gradient appears in the equations).\n4.  For each of these symmetry types, I will determine its dimension (i.e., the number of parameters it depends on in 3D space).\n    *   Time translation has 1 parameter.\n    *   Space translations have 3 parameters (one for each spatial dimension).\n    *   Rotations in 3D have 3 parameters (e.g., Euler angles).\n    *   Galilean boosts have 3 parameters (one for each velocity component).\n    *   The scaling transformation has 1 parameter.\n    *   The pressure shift has 1 parameter.\n5.  Finally, I will sum up the dimensions of all these symmetry types to get the total dimension of the Lie group. I will use a Python script to present this calculation clearly, showing how the total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the individual symmetry components and print out the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of a Lie group is the number of independent parameters that define its transformations.\n    # We find this by summing the dimensions of the independent symmetry transformations\n    # that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations invariant.\n\n    # Dictionary to store the dimension of each symmetry component.\n    symmetries = {\n        'Time translation': 1,        # t -> t + a\n        'Space translations': 3,      # x -> x + b (in R^3)\n        'Spatial rotations': 3,       # x -> Rx, R in SO(3)\n        'Galilean boosts': 3,         # x -> x + vt, u -> u + v (in R^3)\n        'Scaling': 1,                 # A specific scaling of t, x, u, and p\n        'Pressure shift': 1           # p -> p + c (as only grad(p) appears)\n    }\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 can be calculated by summing the dimensions of its independent symmetry components:\")\n    \n    total_dimension = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} dimension(s)\")\n        total_dimension += dim\n        equation_parts.append(str(dim))\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total dimension is the sum of these individual dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"Total dimension = {equation_str} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
