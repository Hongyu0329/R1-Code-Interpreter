    print("Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a four-wave mixing process.")
    print("It uses a pump beam (frequency ωp), a Stokes beam (frequency ωs), and a probe beam (frequency ωpr).")
    print("The signal is generated at the anti-Stokes frequency (ωas).")
    print("The final equation for this frequency is: ωas = ωp - ωs + ωpr")

    print("Step 2: Understanding Vibrational Resonance")
    print("The CARS signal is strongly enhanced when the beat frequency between the pump and Stokes beams (ωp - ωs) matches a natural vibrational frequency (Ω) of a molecule in the sample.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Step 3: Analyzing Broadband CARS")
    print("The goal of broadband CARS is to measure an entire vibrational spectrum at once, rather than scanning through frequencies.")
    print("This is achieved by making one of the input beams (typically the Stokes, but the pump works too) broadband, meaning it contains a wide range of frequencies.")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    print("Step 4: Scenario: Broadband Pump Beam")
    print("In this specific case, the pump beam (ωp) is broadband, and we'll assume the Stokes beam (ωs) is narrowband.")
    print("This broadband pump beam provides many different ωp frequencies simultaneously.")
    print("For every molecular vibration (Ω) in the sample, if there is a frequency component in the pump beam that satisfies the resonance condition (ωp - ωs = Ω), that vibration will be excited.")
    print("This means multiple different vibrations can be excited at the same time.")
    print("-" * 30)

    print("Step 5: Evaluating the Output Signal")
    print("Each excited vibration (Ω) will generate a corresponding signal at a unique anti-Stokes frequency (ωas).")
    print("This results in a broadband anti-Stokes beam where each frequency component maps directly to a specific molecular vibration.")
    print("Therefore, the anti-Stokes beam is not a single, blurry signal; it is a composite signal that contains a full spectrum of separate, distinguishable vibrational information.")
    print("-" * 30)
    
    print("Step 6: Conclusion")
    print("Based on the analysis, a broadband pump beam generates a broadband anti-Stokes beam that contains distinguishable vibrational information.")
    print("Evaluating the options:")
    print("A. You can only generate a Stokes beam -> Incorrect. A Stokes beam is an input.")
    print("B. You can generate an anti Stokes beam, but it doesn't contain separate vibrational information -> Incorrect. It does.")
    print("C. You can generate a anti Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information -> Correct.")
    print("D. None of the above -> Incorrect.")
    print("E. You cannot generate an anti Stokes beam -> Incorrect.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice is C.")
