    Calculates the groupoid cardinality of the inserter Ins(F,G).

    The problem involves functors between deloopings of cyclic groups.
    Let A = Z/nZ and B = Z/mZ. The functors are induced by group homomorphisms
    f, g: A -> B. The groupoid cardinality of the inserter of these functors
    is given by the simple ratio |B|/|A| = m/n.

    This result holds under the condition that the homomorphisms f and g are
    well-defined. For maps f(x)=ax and g(x)=bx, this means that a*n and b*n
    must be multiples of m.

    We first verify this condition and then compute the fraction m/n.
