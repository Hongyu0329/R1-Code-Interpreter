    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination strongly suggests an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **E2 Mechanism Requirements**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed from an adjacent carbon (β-proton) must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down), which is called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate Conformation**: The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromine and the methyl group are *cis* to each other. For a 1,2-cis disubstituted cyclohexane, one substituent must be axial and the other equatorial. The molecule exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformers:\n    *   **Conformer A**: Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    *   **Conformer B**: Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n\n    The E2 reaction can *only* proceed from **Conformer A**, because only in this conformation is the leaving group (Br) in the required axial position.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Products (Regioselectivity)**: With the bromine atom axial in Conformer A, we look for available *axial* β-protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Path 1 (Zaitsev)**: The β-proton on C2 is axial. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C2, yielding **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (thermodynamically more stable) alkene, known as the Zaitsev product.\n    *   **Path 2 (Hofmann)**: The β-proton on C6 is also axial. Removing this proton would form a double bond between C1 and C6, yielding **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene, known as the Hofmann product.\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products is determined by the base. Because potassium tert-butoxide is a large, **bulky base**, it has difficulty accessing the more sterically hindered β-proton on C2 (which is close to the equatorial methyl group). It will preferentially attack the more sterically accessible β-proton on C6. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the less substituted Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    and prints the name of the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the key chemical names involved in the reaction\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    product_zaitsev = \"1-methylcyclohexene\"\n    product_hofmann = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    final_product = product_hofmann\n\n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to identify the reaction product:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(f\"1.
