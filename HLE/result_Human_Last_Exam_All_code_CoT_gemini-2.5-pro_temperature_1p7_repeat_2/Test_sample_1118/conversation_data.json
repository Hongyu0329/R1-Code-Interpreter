    "My plan is to first identify the specific self-portrait Curt Querner painted in 1933 after his escape from the Gestapo. Then, I will determine the object he is holding in that portrait and its symbolic meaning in that historical context. Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out the year and the name of the object to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbolic_object():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The year the self-portrait was painted\n    year = 1933\n    \n    # The object Querner held as a symbol of resistance\n    symbol_of_resistance = \"a red poppy\"\n    \n    # The name of the painting is \"Selbstbildnis mit Mohnblume\" (Self-Portrait with Poppy)\n    \n    print(f\"The year of the self-portrait is: {year}\")\n    print(f\"The object held as a symbol of resistance is: {symbol_of_resistance}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nfind_symbolic_object()\n```\n<<<a red poppy>>>"
