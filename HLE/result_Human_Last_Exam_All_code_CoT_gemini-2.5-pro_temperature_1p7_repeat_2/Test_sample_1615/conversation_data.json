    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph. This number is the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n2.  **Recall Graph Theory Principles:**\n    *   For any graph with $n$ vertices, we can always color it with $n$ colors by assigning a unique color to each vertex. This gives a simple upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   A well-known theorem in graph theory states that the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of a graph with $n$ vertices is equal to $n$ if and only if the graph is a complete graph ($G=K_n$).\n3.  **Apply the Principles:**\n    *   We are given that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   We are also explicitly told that $G$ is *not* the complete graph.\n    *   Based on the theorem above, since $G \\neq K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. So, for our case, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n4.  **Verify the Upper Bound:** To confirm that $12344$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one non-complete graph on $12345$ vertices that requires $12344$ colors.\n    *   Consider a graph $G'$ constructed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. This graph is no longer complete.\n    *   This graph $G'$ contains a subgraph that is a clique of size $12344$ (for example, if we remove the edge between vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$, the set of vertices $\\{v_1, v_3, v_4, \\dots, v_{12345}\\}$ forms a $K_{12344}$ clique).\n    *   A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors. Therefore, $\\chi(G') \\ge 12344$.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$ for any such graph and that there exists a graph for which $\\chi(G) = 12344$, the maximum number of colors required is $12344$.\n\nThe calculation is a simple subtraction. The Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of a\n    graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # According to graph theory, a graph G with n vertices has a chromatic number\n    # chi(G) = n if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the problem states G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number\n    # must be less than n.
