    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and their counts:** Toluene's formula is C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (a second-row element):** The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set.\n        *   The core (1s) orbital is described by 1 contracted function.\n        *   The valence (2s, 2p) orbitals are split into an inner and outer set. Each set contains one s-type and three p-type functions (1s + 3p = 4).\n        *   Total per Carbon = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom:** The basis set splits its single valence (1s) orbital into two functions (an inner and an outer part).\n        *   Total per Hydrogen = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2** functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** We multiply the count of each atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n    *   Total = (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# The molecule is toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# For the 6-31G basis set:\n# Each Carbon atom contributes 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n# (1 for core 1s, and 2*4=8 for the split valence 2s and 2p orbitals)\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n\n# Each Hydrogen atom contributes 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n# (The 1s orbital is split into two functions)\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from carbon atoms\ntotal_carbon_funcs = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from hydrogen atoms\ntotal_hydrogen_funcs = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_carbon_funcs + total_hydrogen_funcs\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer\nprint(f\"To find the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we calculate:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} * {funcs_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {funcs_per_hydrogen}) = {total_funcs}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
