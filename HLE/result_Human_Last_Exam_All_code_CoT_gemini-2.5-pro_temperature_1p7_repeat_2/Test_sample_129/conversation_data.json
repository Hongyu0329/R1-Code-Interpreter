    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. We can count the number of valid expressions of a certain length by categorizing them based on their structure. This avoids the complexities of handling operator precedence rules manually for every case.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, we need a grammar that produces all valid boolean expressions unambiguously, respecting the operator precedence (`!` > `&` > `|`). A suitable grammar is:\n    *   `Expr -> AndExpr | Expr '|' AndExpr` (Or-expressions, left-associative)\n    *   `AndExpr -> NotExpr | AndExpr '&' NotExpr` (And-expressions, left-associative)\n    *   `NotExpr -> Primary | '!' NotExpr` (Not-expressions)\n    *   `Primary -> 'T' | 'F' | '(' Expr ')'` (Primary expressions, i.e., atoms)\n\n2.  Let `c(n)`, `a(n)`, `m(n)`, and `p(n)` be the number of valid expressions of length `n` that are of type `Expr`, `AndExpr`, `NotExpr`, and `Primary`, respectively.\n\n3.  We can set up recurrence relations based on the grammar rules:\n    *   `p(n)`: A primary expression of length `n` is either a terminal (`T` or `F`, if `n=1`) or a parenthesized expression `(E)` where `E` is an `Expr` of length `n-2`.\n        `p(n) = (2 if n == 1 else 0) + c(n-2)`\n    *   `m(n)`: A \"not\" expression of length `n` is either a `Primary` of length `n` or `!` followed by a \"not\" expression of length `n-1`.\n        `m(n) = p(n) + m(n-1)`\n    *   `a(n)`: An \"and\" expression of length `n` is either a `NotExpr` of length `n`, or an `AndExpr` of length `i` combined with a `NotExpr` of length `j` via `&`, where `i+j = n-1`.\n        `a(n) = m(n) + sum(a(i) * m(j) for i+j=n-1)`\n    *   `c(n)`: A total expression of length `n` is either an `AndExpr` of length `n`, or an `Expr` of length `i` combined with an `AndExpr` of length `j` via `|`, where `i+j=n-1`.\n        `c(n) = a(n) + sum(c(i) * a(j) for i+j=n-1)`\n\n4.  We can compute these values iteratively from `n=1` up to `n=5`. The final answer will be `c(5)`. The Python code below implements this dynamic programming approach and shows the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of valid boolean expressions of length 5\n    using dynamic programming based on an unambiguous grammar.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_len = 5\n    # c: total expressions (Expr)\n    # a: and-expressions (AndExpr)\n    # m: not-expressions (NotExpr)\n    # p: primary expressions (Primary)\n    c = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    a = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    m = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    p = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    for n in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        # Calculate p(n)\n        p[n] = (2 if n == 1 else 0) + c.get(n - 2, 0)\n        \n        # Calculate m(n)\n        m[n] = p[n] + m.get(n - 1, 0)\n        \n        # Calculate a(n)\n        a_sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            j = n - 1 - i\n            if j > 0:\n                a_sum += a[i] * m[j]\n        a[n] = m[n] + a_sum\n        \n        # Calculate c(n)\n        c_sum = 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            j = n - 1 - i\n            if j > 0:\n                c_sum += c[i] * a[j]\n        c[n] = a[n] + c_sum\n\n    print(f\"Calculation for the number of expressions of length 5, c(5):\")\n    \n    # Building the equation string for c(5)\n    c1_a_val = c[1] * a[max_len - 1 - 1]\n    c2_a_val = c[2] * a[max_len - 1 - 2]\n    c3_a_val = c[3] * a[max_len - 1 - 3]\n    # In general this would be a loop, but for n=5 we can be explicit\n    # The sum part is for i from 1 to 3. i=4 gives j=0, which is excluded.\n    # c(5) = a(5) + c(1)a(3) + c(2)a(2) + c(3)a(1)\n    \n    # Python code requires explicit access for values used in print statements.\n    c1, c2, c3 = c[1], c[2], c[3]\n    a1, a2, a3 = a[1], a[2], a[3]\n    a5 = a[5]\n\n    c1a3 = c1 * a3\n    c2a2 = c2 * a2\n    c3a1 = c3 * a1\n    \n    print(f\"c(5) = a(5) + c(1)*a(3) + c(2)*a(2) + c(3)*a(1)\")\n    print(f\"c(5) = {a5} + {c1}*{a3} + {c2}*{a2} + {c3}*{a1}\")\n    print(f\"c(5) = {a5} + {c1a3} + {c2a2} + {c3a1}\")\n    \n    final_result = a5 + c1a3 + c2a2 + c3a1\n    print(f\"c(5) = {final_result}\")\n    \n    # To conform with the final output format.\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of true boolean expressions is {final_result}.\")\n\n\nsolve_boolean_expressions()\n<<<90>>>\n```"
