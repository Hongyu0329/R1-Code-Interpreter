    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to be evaluated is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard integral form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, which evaluates to `ln|u|` or `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is given by `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1. This results in `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. Since `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive for real x, we can drop the absolute value signs. The value of the integral, `V`, is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** I will write a Python script to calculate the numerical values for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`, then compute `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, and finally find the closest integer to `10000 * V`. The script will also print the full equation with the calculated values.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the functions as per the problem description\ndef F0(x):\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# The integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n# Let's calculate the values for F₃(1) and F₃(0).\n\n# Calculate F₃(1)\nf3_1 = F3(1)\n\n# Calculate F₃(0)\nf3_0 = F3(0) # This is math.log(2)\n\n# Calculate the value of the integral, V\nV = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n# Calculate the final result: the closest integer to 10000 * V\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\n\n# Print the step-by-step evaluation of the final equation\nprint(f\"The integral V is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_0}\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe value of 10000 * V is {10000 * V}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {final_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5487>>>"
