    "This is a fascinating problem in point-set topology. To solve it, I will lay out a logical argument. The argument relies on deducing the properties of the space $X$ from the given information. The key steps are to first establish that $X$ must be a separable space, and then use that fact to place a bound on its cardinality.\n\nI will provide a Python script that formalizes this step-by-step deduction.
