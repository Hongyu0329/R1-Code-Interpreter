    # A. Ectropion
    print("Choice A: Ectropion")
    print("Analysis: Ectropion is the turning outward of an eyelid. While it can be caused by scarring, it is a localized condition and does not account for systemic symptoms like spasticity.")
    print("Conclusion: Unlikely to be the primary diagnosis.\n")

    # B. McArdle disease
    print("Choice B: McArdle disease")
    print("Analysis: This is a glycogen storage disease affecting muscles. It typically presents later in life with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps. It does not cause spasticity or the described skin signs.")
    print("Conclusion: Inconsistent with the clinical picture.\n")

    # C. Dermatomyositis
    print("Choice C: Dermatomyositis")
    print("Analysis: This is an inflammatory disease affecting muscle and skin. In a 1-year-old, this would be Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM).")
    print(" - Erythema (redness/rash) is a classic feature.")
    print(" - Severe skin involvement in JDM can lead to ulcerations that heal with hypertrophic scarring.")
    print(" - Spasticity is not a typical muscle symptom (weakness is), but it can occur due to central nervous system calcinosis, a rare but known complication of JDM.")
    print(f" - The lab result, '{lab_results}', is actually consistent with JDM, as anti-Mi-2 antibodies are more common in adult forms and are often negative in juvenile cases.")
    print("Conclusion: JDM provides a plausible explanation for the entire clinical picture.\n")

    # D. McCune Albright syndrome
    print("Choice D: McCune Albright syndrome")
    print("Analysis: This syndrome involves fibrous dysplasia of bone, skin spots (café-au-lait), and endocrine problems. While severe fibrous dysplasia of the skull/spine could compress the nervous system and cause spasticity, hypertrophic scarring and erythema are not characteristic features.")
    print("Conclusion: Less likely than Dermatomyositis.\n")
    
    # E. Cataracts
    print("Choice E: Cataracts")
    print("Analysis: This is a clouding of the lens in the eye. It is an isolated ophthalmologic condition and does not explain any of the other systemic findings.")
    print("Conclusion: Incorrect.\n")
