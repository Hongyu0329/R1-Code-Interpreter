    print("--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---\n")

    print("A. Quantum Encryption:")
    print("   - This method uses quantum properties for encryption. However, like any system, it relies on a key (qubit keys).")
    print("   - If the adversary knows these keys, they can decrypt the information. This option fails.\n")

    print("B. Fast Key Rotation:")
    print("   - This is a strategy to limit the damage of a compromised key by changing it frequently.")
    print("   - However, it does not provide security *at the moment* a key is compromised. If the adversary knows the current key, the system is insecure during that key's lifespan. This option fails.\n")

    print("C. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):")
    print("   - PFS protects past communications if a long-term key is compromised. It does so by using temporary (ephemeral) session keys.")
    print("   - The premise states the adversary knows the 'encryption keys', which would include these ephemeral keys. Therefore, the current session would be compromised. This option fails.\n")

    print("D. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):")
    print("   - QKD is a method for securely *sharing* a key. It is designed to prevent an adversary from learning the key in the first place.")
    print("   - The question's premise assumes the adversary *already has* the key, so the method of distribution is irrelevant. This option fails.\n")

    print("E. Quantum Random One-Time-Pad (OTP):")
    print("   - An OTP offers perfect secrecy *only if* the key (the pad) is kept secret.")
    print("   - Under the premise that the adversary knows the key, the OTP provides no security. This option fails.\n")

    print("--- Final Conclusion ---\n")
    print("F. None of the above:")
    print("   - This option states that security is theoretically impossible if the encryption keys are known to the adversary.")
    print("   - This aligns perfectly with Kerckhoffs's Principle. The entire foundation of modern cryptography rests on the secrecy of the key. If the key is not secret, there is no security.")
    print("   - Therefore, this is the only correct conclusion.\n")
