    "To determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently, we need to examine the standard synthesis methods for this compound.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical reaction:** The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride is achieved through the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\n    Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\n2.  **Research synthesis conditions:** The outcome of the reaction between xenon and fluorine is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, specifically temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n    *   To produce XeF₄ efficiently, a specific set of conditions is required to favor its formation over other xenon fluorides like XeF₂ or XeF₆.\n    *   The most common and efficient laboratory synthesis involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio in a sealed nickel vessel.\n\n3.  **Determine the optimal temperature:** According to established chemical literature, the reaction to produce Xenon tetrafluoride is typically carried out at a temperature of **400 °C**.\n    *   At significantly lower temperatures, the reaction rate is too slow to be considered efficient.\n    *   At significantly higher temperatures (e.g., above 500-600 °C) and with a higher excess of fluorine, the reaction favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n\n4.  **Compare with answer choices:**\n    *   A. 600 C: Too high, favors XeF₆.\n    *   B. 400 C: The ideal temperature for efficient XeF₄ synthesis.\n    *   C. 200 C: Too low for an efficient reaction rate.\n    *   D. 78 C: Much too low.\n    *   E. 0 C: Much too low.\n    *   F. -78 C: Much too low.\n\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that encapsulates this information. The script will define the synthesis conditions and identify the correct temperature from the provided options, printing the final equation and reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes synthesis methods for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    to find the optimal temperature for efficient production.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data on the synthesis of various xenon fluorides.\n    # The conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratio) determine the product.\n    synthesis_data = {\n        \"XeF2\": {\n            \"temperature_C\": 400,\n            \"conditions\": \"Slow heating of Xe and F2 in a 2:1 ratio.\"\n        },\n        \"XeF4\": {\n            \"temperature_C\": 400,\n            \"conditions\": \"Heating Xe and F2 in a 1:5 ratio.
