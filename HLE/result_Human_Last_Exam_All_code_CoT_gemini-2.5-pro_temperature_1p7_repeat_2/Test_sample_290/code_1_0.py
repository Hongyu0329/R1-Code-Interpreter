    # T = S U {O}, total of n+1 points.
    # We have 9 straight lines.
    # Connectivity Rule: Any two points in T can be connected by a path along at most 2 lines.

    # For a path to exist from any point, that point must lie on at least one line.
    # The n points of S all lie on a single circle.
    # A straight line can intersect a circle at most twice.
    # Therefore, each of our 9 lines can contain at most 2 of the points from S.

    print(" - A circle is drawn centered at O.")
    print(" - The n points {P1, ..., Pn} are the intersection points of the 9 lines with the circle.")
    print("   This gives n = 9 lines * 2 intersection points/line = 18 points.")

    print(" 1. Path between O and any point P_i:")
    print("    P_i lies on a line that, by definition, also passes through O. So they are on the same line.")
