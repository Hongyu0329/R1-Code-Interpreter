    "Answering this question requires understanding how the ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the surface it is defined on.\n\n### My Step-by-Step Derivations\n\n1.  **GSD and Logical Qubits**: The GSD is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits the code can support. A logical qubit is a two-level quantum system, encoded non-locally in the physical qubits, and is defined by a pair of logical operators (`X_L`, `Z_L`) that act on it, similar to how Pauli-X and Pauli-Z act on a single qubit.\n\n2.  **Logical Operators and Topology**: Logical operators are strings or loops of Pauli operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are \"non-trivial\" (i.e., not a product of the local stabilizers of the code). The number of such independent operators is determined by the topology of the surface. For a 2D surface, this relates to its genus `g` (number of handles) and the number of boundaries `b` (holes).\n\n3.  **Holes and Boundary Conditions**: The problem specifies two types of holes, \"smooth\" and \"rough\". These correspond to different boundary conditions for the Hamiltonian at the edge of the hole.\n    *   **Smooth Boundary**: `X`-type string operators can terminate on this boundary.\n    *   **Rough Boundary**: `Z`-type string operators can terminate on this boundary.\n\n4.  **Case 1: Code on a Sphere (Closed Surface with Holes)**\n    *   For a surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries, the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g + b - 1` (for `b > 0`).\n    *   A sphere has `g=0`. With `n` smooth and `m` rough holes, the total number of boundaries is `b = n + m`.\n    *   Plugging this into the formula gives `k = 2*0 + (n+m) - 1 = n+m-1`.\n    *   This would lead to a GSD of `2^(n+m-1)`. However, this is not among the answer choices, suggesting this interpretation might not be the one intended by the problem.\n\n5.  **Case 2: Code on a Plane/Disk (Finite Surface with Holes)**\n    *   A common alternative is to consider the code on a finite area of a plane, which is topologically a disk. A disk has an outer boundary.\n    *   If we have `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes *inside* this disk, we can think of the outer edge of the disk as another boundary. Let's assume it's a smooth boundary for instance. The total number of smooth boundaries would be `n+1` and rough boundaries would be `m`.\n    *   The total number of boundaries is `b = (n+1) + m`. Using the formula from Case 1 (`k = b - 1` for `g=0`):\n        `k = (n + m + 1) - 1 = n + m`.\n    *   This implies there are `n+m` logical qubits. Each interior hole can be associated with a logical qubit whose string operator connects the hole to the outer boundary.\n    *   This gives a GSD of `2^(n+m)`. This matches option A and is a very standard result for surface codes implemented on a finite chip (a disk topology).\n\nBased on this analysis, the most plausible answer is derived from the \"code on a disk\" model. I will provide Python code to calculate this value for sample `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with\n    n smooth holes and m rough holes on a planar surface.\n\n    The formula for the number of logical qubits, k, is k = n + m.\n    The GSD is 2^k.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(m, int) or n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Error: The number of holes (n and m) must be non-negative integers.\")\n        return\n\n    # For a toric code on a planar surface (a disk) with n smooth and m rough\n    # internal holes, the number of logical qubits is k = n + m.\n    num_logical_qubits = n + m\n\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits.\n    gsd = int(math.pow(2, num_logical_qubits))\n\n    print(f\"For a toric code with n={n} smooth holes and m={m} rough holes on a planar surface:\")\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits is k = n + m.\")\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^k, which is calculated as:\")\n    # The final print statement shows each number in the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"2^({n} + {m}) = {gsd}\")\n\n\n# Example usage with n=2 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\n# You can change these values to see other results.\nn_smooth_holes = 2\nm_rough_holes = 3\n\ncalculate_gsd(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
