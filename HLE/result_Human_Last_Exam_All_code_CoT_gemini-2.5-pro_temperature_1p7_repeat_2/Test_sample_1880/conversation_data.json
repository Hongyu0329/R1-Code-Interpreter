    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we'll check if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial's Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: The reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides more information to narrow down the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Final Check (if needed)**: If the group is narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$, a final condition based on the discriminant and the rational root of the resolvent cubic is used to distinguish between them.\n5.  **Determine the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and prints the results of each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\n    Returns a tuple (is_square: bool, root: int or None).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        return False, None\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    x = math.isqrt(n)\n    return x * x == n, x\n\n# --- Analysis of the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14 ---\n\n# The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n# This is of the form x^4 + dx + e.\nd = 8\ne = 14\n\nprint(\"To find the order of the Galois group for P(x) = x^4 + 8*x + 14, we follow these steps:\")\n\n# Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers Q.\")\nprint(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = 2.\")\nprint(f\"The coefficients are 1, 0, 0, 8, 14.\")\nprint(f\"p=2 divides the non-leading coefficients 0, 0, 8, and the constant term 14.\")\nprint(f\"p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\nprint(f\"p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\nprint(\"The Galois group is a transitive subgroup of S_4.\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the discriminant Delta.\")\n# For x^4 + dx + e, the discriminant is Delta = 256*e^3 - 27*d^4.\ndelta = 256 * (e**3) - 27 * (d**4)\nprint(f\"The formula for the discriminant is Delta = 256 * e^3 - 27 * d^4.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting e={e} and d={d}:\")\nprint(f\"Delta = 256 * ({e}^3) - 27 * ({d}^4)\")\nprint(f\"Delta = 256 * {e**3} - 27 * {d**4}\")\nprint(f\"Delta = {256 * e**3} - {27 * d**4}\")\nprint(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n\nis_sq, _ = is_perfect_square(delta)\nif is_sq:\n    print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square in Q.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.
