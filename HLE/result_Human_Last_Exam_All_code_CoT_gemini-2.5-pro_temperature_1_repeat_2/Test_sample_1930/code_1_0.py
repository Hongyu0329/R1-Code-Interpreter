# The problem asks for the dimension of a vector space of functions.
# Based on mathematical analysis, the dimension is a specific natural number.
# Let's outline the reasoning that leads to the number 4.
# The basis functions for the space of digitary functions are:
# 1. f(x) = 1 (constant function)
# 2. f(x) = x (identity function)
# 3. f(x) = floor(x) (the floor function, with floor(10)=10)
# 4. f(x) = 1 if x=10, and 0 otherwise.

# We need to verify these functions are linearly independent.
# Suppose a linear combination is the zero function for all x in [0, 10]:
# a*1 + b*x + c*floor(x) + d*delta(x, 10) = 0
# where delta(x, 10) is 1 if x=10 and 0 otherwise.

# Let's check some values of x.
# x = 0.5: a + 0.5*b + c*0 + d*0 = 0  => a + 0.5*b = 0
# x = 1.5: a + 1.5*b + c*1 + d*0 = 0  => a + 1.5*b + c = 0
# x = 2.5: a + 2.5*b + c*2 + d*0 = 0  => a + 2.5*b + 2c = 0

# From the last two equations:
# (a + 2.5*b + 2c) - (a + 1.5*b + c) = 0
# b + c = 0 => c = -b

# Substitute c = -b into a + 1.5*b + c = 0:
# a + 1.5*b - b = 0 => a + 0.5*b = 0
# This is the same as the equation from x = 0.5, so it's consistent.

# Now substitute a = -0.5*b into the equations.
# a + 0.5*b = 0 holds.
# a + 1.5*b + c = -0.5*b + 1.5*b - b = b - b = 0 holds.
# a + 2.5*b + 2c = -0.5*b + 2.5*b - 2b = 2b - 2b = 0 holds.

# Now let's check an integer value, e.g., x = 9 (where floor(x)=9, delta(x,10)=0)
# a + 9b + 9c = 0
# Substitute a=-0.5b and c=-b:
# -0.5b + 9b - 9b = -0.5b = 0 => b = 0.

# If b = 0, then:
# c = -b => c = 0
# a = -0.5*b => a = 0

# So far, a=b=c=0. The equation becomes:
# d*delta(x, 10) = 0 for all x in [0, 10].
# Let's test at x = 10:
# d * 1 = 0 => d = 0.

# Since a=b=c=d=0 is the only solution, the functions are linearly independent.
# The dimension of the vector space is the number of basis functions.

dimension = 4

# The problem asks for a natural number as the answer.
# The final result of the reasoning is that the dimension is 4.
# The code should output this number.
# Final result must be in the format of "N=..."
