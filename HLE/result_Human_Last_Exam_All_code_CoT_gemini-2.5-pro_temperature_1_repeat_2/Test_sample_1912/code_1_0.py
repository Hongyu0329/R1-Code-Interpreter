# Define the numbers for the final equation
a = 6
b = 12

# The discovered pattern is a * b + (a - b/a)
# We will calculate the result based on this pattern.

# Calculate the multiplication part
term1 = a * b

# Calculate the adjustment part
# Note: The examples use integer division.
adjustment = a - (b // a)

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 + adjustment

# Print the discovered pattern and the final calculation
print("The pattern discovered from the sequence is: result = a * b + (a - b/a)")
print("\nApplying this pattern to the equation 6 + 12:")
print(f"The equation is: {a} * {b} + ({a} - {b} / {a})")
print(f"This simplifies to: {term1} + ({a} - {b // a})")
print(f"Which further simplifies to: {term1} + {adjustment}")
