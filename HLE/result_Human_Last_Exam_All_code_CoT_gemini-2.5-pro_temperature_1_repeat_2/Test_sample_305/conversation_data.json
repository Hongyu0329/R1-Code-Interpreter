    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we need to systematically check all possible operations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Set**: We'll use the set S = {0, 1, 2}.\n2.  **Represent the Operation**: A binary operation can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table (Cayley table).\n3.  **Handle Commutativity**: A commutative operation means `x * y = y * x`. This results in a symmetric Cayley table. So, we only need to define the values for the main diagonal and the upper triangle. For a set of 3 elements, there are `3*(3+1)/2 = 6` such values to determine.\n4.  **Iterate All Commutative Operations**: Since each of these 6 key values can be any of the 3 elements in S, there are `3^6 = 729` possible commutative operations. We will generate each of these 729 possibilities.\n5.  **Check for Associativity**: For each of the 729 commutative operations, we will check if it is also associative. An operation is associative if `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)` for all x, y, z in the set. We'll check this condition for all `3*3*3 = 27` possible combinations of x, y, and z.\n6.  **Count and Report**: We'll count how many of the 729 operations satisfy the associativity test and print the final number.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of a given size by brute-force checking.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n    count = 0\n\n    # The number of independent entries in a symmetric n x n table is n*(n+1)/2.\n    num_independent_entries = n * (n + 1) // 2\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^6 = 729 possible commutative operations.\n    # Each 'op_values' tuple defines one unique commutative operation.\n    # op_values = (op(0,0), op(0,1), op(0,2), op(1,1), op(1,2), op(2,2))\n    for op_values in itertools.product(elements, repeat=num_independent_entries):\n        \n        # Reconstruct the full 3x3 Cayley table from the 6 key values.\n        table = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        k = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i, n):\n                table[i][j] = op_values[k]\n                table[j][i] = op_values[k]  # Ensure commutativity\n                k += 1\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z) for all x, y, z.\n        is_associative = True\n        # Break out of loops as soon as a counterexample is found.\n        for x in elements:\n            if not is_associative: break\n            for y in elements:\n                if not is_associative: break\n                for z in elements:\n                    left_side = table[table[x][y]][z]\n                    right_side = table[x][table[y][z]]\n                    if left_side != right_side:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n        \n        # If the operation is associative, increment the counter.\n        if is_associative:\n            count += 1\n            \n    # The final equation is the count of operations for a set of size 3.\n    print(f\"Number of elements in set = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Number of associative and commutative binary operations = {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_associative_commutative_operations()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
