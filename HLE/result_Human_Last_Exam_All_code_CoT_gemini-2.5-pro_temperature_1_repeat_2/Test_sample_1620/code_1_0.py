    Step 1: Identify the core ethical conflict. The conflict is between the lawyer's duty of confidentiality to his client, Eric, and the potential for serious harm to Eric and his ex-wife.

    Step 2: State the general rule. A lawyer has a strict professional duty to keep all information received from a client confidential. James initially correctly stated this rule.

    Step 3: Identify the relevant exception. The Rules of Professional Conduct in Ontario (and similar rules in other jurisdictions) provide a "public safety exception." A lawyer MAY disclose confidential information if they have a reasonable belief that there is an IMMINENT risk of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure is necessary to prevent it.

    Step 4: Apply the facts to the exception.
    - Threat: Eric made a specific threat: "I bought a gun... going to my wife's apartment tonight to end things for both of us."
    - Imminence: The threat was for "tonight," making it imminent.
    - Harm: The threatened harm was a murder-suicide, which is clearly "death or serious bodily harm."
    - Belief: Given the specificity of the threat and Eric's deteriorating mental state, James's belief in the risk was reasonable.
    - Necessity: Disclosing the information to the police was necessary to allow them to intervene and prevent the tragedy.

    Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.
    - A is incorrect because the threat was imminent.
    - B is incorrect because the duty of confidentiality is not absolute.
    - C is debatable on the scope of information, but the fundamental decision to disclose was correct. In an emergency, providing all locational information is justifiable to prevent the harm. The overall action was therefore appropriate.
    - D is incorrect because the lawyer's option to disclose is discretionary ("may"), not mandatory ("must"), and is triggered by the threat, not a police request.
    - E correctly summarizes the public safety exception and its application to the facts. James acted because he reasonably believed in an imminent threat, and disclosure was necessary to prevent it. This is the most accurate description of his professional obligations.
