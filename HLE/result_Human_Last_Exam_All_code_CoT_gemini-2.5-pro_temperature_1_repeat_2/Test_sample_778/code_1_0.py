# As derived, the groupoid cardinality of the inserter Ins(F,G) is given
# by the simple formula m/n.
# We will calculate this value and present it as a simplified fraction.

# The greatest common divisor can be used to simplify the fraction,
# but since m divides n, the simplified fraction will be 1 / (n/m).
denominator = n // m
