    This function solves the historical riddle based on the provided text.
    
    Clues analyzed:
    1. "Alexei's tragedy": This points to the play "Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich" by author Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy.
    2. "minister, seeking to restore order": This is a classic description of Konstantin Pobedonostsev, a powerful conservative figure and censor in late 19th-century Russia.
    3. The Banning: Historical records confirm Pobedonostsev was instrumental in banning Aleksey Tolstoy's play from being staged for over 30 years.
    
    The minister's last name is therefore identified.
