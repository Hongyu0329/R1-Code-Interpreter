    "The user wants to find the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a system of photons (the Bose case of light quanta) using the principles of large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Connect Large Deviations to Statistical Mechanics:** Explain that the equilibrium state in statistical mechanics (the state of maximum entropy) is a direct consequence of large deviation principles. According to theorems like Sanov's theorem, the probability of a system being observed in a macroscopic state other than the one with maximum entropy is exponentially small. Therefore, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the most probable state, which is achieved by maximizing the system's entropy subject to physical constraints.\n2.  **Identify the System and Constraints:** The system is a photon gas (bosons). The key constraints are:\n    *   The total mean energy `E` is constant.\n    *   The total number of photons `N` is *not* conserved, meaning the chemical potential is zero.\n3.  **Define Mean Energy:** The mean energy `E` is simply the sum of the energies of all photons. If `n_i` is the average number of photons in the energy state `ε_i`, the total mean energy is `E = Σ_i n_i ε_i`.\n4.  **Derive Entropy:** The entropy `S` for a system of non-interacting bosons can be derived from the combinatorial formula for the number of microstates `W` (where `S = k_B ln(W)`). For a set of modes, each with an average occupation number `n_i`, the entropy is the sum of the entropies of each mode. The entropy for a single mode can be calculated using the Shannon entropy formula for the geometric distribution of photons in that mode. This leads to the well-known formula for the entropy of a Bose gas.\n5.  **Present the Results using Python:** Write a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically represent and print the final equations for the equilibrium mean energy `E` and entropy `S` in terms of the average occupation numbers `n_i` and the energy levels `ε_i`. The script will also print the explanatory text to guide the user through the logic.\n\nThe final result will be the mathematical formulas for `E` and `S`, which represent their equilibrium values.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy\n    for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) based on statistical mechanics,\n    which is underpinned by large deviation principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction and Connection to Large Deviation Theory ---\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Properties of a Photon Gas (Bose Case) ---\")\n    print(\"\\nPrinciple: The equilibrium state of a physical system corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum entropy (S)\")\n    print(\"for a given set of constraints, such as a fixed mean energy (E).
