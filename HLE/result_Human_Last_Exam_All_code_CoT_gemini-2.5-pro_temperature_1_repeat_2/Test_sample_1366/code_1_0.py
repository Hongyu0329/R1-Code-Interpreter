    # Part (a): Theoretical analysis
    # The level k = -2 + 1/p is an admissible level for the affine Lie algebra sl_2.
    # The category of representations of the corresponding VOA, L_k(sl_2), is not semisimple.
    # The triplet algebra V(p) (or W(p)), which is the standard VOA in this context,
    # is known to be logarithmic (non-rational) for p > 1, meaning its modules do not
    # decompose into a direct sum of irreducibles.
    # Therefore, the decomposition V(p) =bigoplus_{n=0}^{infty} rho_n otimes L(p)_n is not possible.
    # Furthermore, V(p) does not possess a commuting sl_2 symmetry that would allow for
    # a decomposition as an sl_2 otimes L_k(sl_2)-module.
    answer_a = "No; No"

    # Part (b): Based on definitions
    # The problem defines L(p)_n as the simple highest-weight module of L_k(sl_2)
    # with top-level rho_n. It also defines rho_n as the (n+1)-dimensional
    # irreducible sl_2-module. The question asks for the top-level dimension of L(p)_n.
    # By definition, this is the dimension of rho_n.
    answer_b = "n+1"

    # Part (c): Calculation of minimal conformal weight
    # The question asks for the minimal conformal weight in "the decomposition" for p=2.
    # Although the decomposition does not exist, we interpret this as asking for the minimal
    # non-zero conformal weight among the modules L(p)_n.
    # The conformal weight of the highest-weight vector of L(p)_n is given by h_j = j(j+1)/(k+2),
    # where j is the sl_2-spin. For the (n+1)-dimensional representation rho_n, the spin is j = n/2.
    # So, h_n = (n/2)(n/2 + 1) / (k+2).
    # Given k = -2 + 1/p, we have k+2 = 1/p.
    # h_n = (n/2)(n/2 + 1) / (1/p) = p * (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = p * n(n+2) / 4.
    # We need the minimal non-zero weight, which occurs at the smallest positive integer n, i.e., n=1.
    p = 2
    n = 1
