# calculation based on the theoretical argument, it's good practice to define it.

# Step 2: Characterize the set S.
# S is the set of starting points x_0 for which the sequence {f^n(x_0)}
# has exactly 7 distinct values.
# This implies that any x_0 in S must be an "eventually periodic point"
# (its orbit eventually lands on a repeating cycle).

# Step 3: Apply the relevant theorem from dynamical systems.
# The function f(x) is a smooth function. Its derivative f'(x) is zero only at a finite
# number of points, so the set of its critical points has measure zero.
# For such maps, the set of all eventually periodic points has a Lebesgue measure of zero.
# Since S is a subset of the set of eventually periodic points, the measure of S is also zero.

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
