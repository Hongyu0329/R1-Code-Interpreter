# Step 1: Decipher the characters X1 through X10 based on the clues.
# The solution is the "CUT-UP TECHNIQUE".

# Step 2: Assign the deciphered characters to variables.
X1 = 'C'
X2 = 'U'
X3 = 'T'
X4 = '-'
X5 = 'P'
X6 = 'E'
X7 = 'H'
X8 = 'N'
X9 = 'I'
X10 = 'Q'

# Step 3: Construct the words Y and Z using the given formulas.
Y = f"{X1}{X2}{X3}{X4}{X2}{X5}"
Z = f"{X3}{X6}{X1}{X7}{X8}{X9}{X10}{X2}{X6}"

# Step 4: Print the final deciphered phrase "Y Z".
# The output shows the two words that solve the puzzle.
print(f"{Y} {Z}")
