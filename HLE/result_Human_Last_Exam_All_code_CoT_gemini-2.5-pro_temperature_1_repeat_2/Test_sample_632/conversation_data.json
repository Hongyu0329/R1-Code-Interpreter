    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question. I will use a Python script to present the answer to this historical question. The script will hold the information regarding the location, the specific feature, and the year it was removed. It will then use the `print()` function to display a clear and complete answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the answer to the historical question\n    about the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Information about the historical feature\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n    removed_feature = \"the tram tracks\"\n    year_removed = 1950\n\n    # Printing the answer in a descriptive sentence\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature in the '{location}' that was removed around the year {year_removed} was {removed_feature}.\")\n    print(\"\\nA tram line ran directly through the historic square, which was considered disruptive to the site's ambiance and was ultimately dismantled.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer\nsolve_historical_riddle()\n```\n<<<The tram tracks>>>"
