    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I need to identify the specific 1905 paper the user is referring to. This is \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\".\nSecond, I will research the citations and influences for this particular paper. While Einstein's 1905 papers were noted for having few citations, his work on Brownian motion was heavily based on the principles of statistical mechanics.\nThird, I will pinpoint the specific scientist whose published lectures on this topic were a key source for Einstein's understanding.\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a sentence that directly answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lecturer():\n    # This script identifies the scientist whose lectures Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper relied on.\n    # The work was not a direct citation of lectures Einstein attended, but rather of published lectures he studied.\n    \n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    work_title = \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"\n    year = 1905\n    paper_topic = \"Brownian motion\"\n\n    # Construct and print the answer\n    print(f\"In his {year} paper on {paper_topic}, Albert Einstein's work was fundamentally based on the principles from the published lectures of {scientist_name}, specifically his work titled '{work_title}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_cited_lecturer()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
