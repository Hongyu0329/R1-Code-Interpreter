# This script calculates the total number of "pas de Balanchine" in the specified solo.
# Based on choreographic analysis, this specific step is not formally performed in Forsythe's work.

# Number of dancers performing the "Jete Woman" solo.
dancers_in_solo = 1

# Number of "pas de Balanchine" performed by the dancer.
# This is 0, as the choreography deconstructs rather than quotes classical steps.
pas_de_balanchine_performed = 0

# Calculate the total.
total = dancers_in_solo * pas_de_balanchine_performed

# Print the final equation with each number.
