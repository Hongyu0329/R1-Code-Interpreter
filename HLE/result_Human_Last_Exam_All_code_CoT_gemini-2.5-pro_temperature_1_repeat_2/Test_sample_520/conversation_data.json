    "Of course. I will provide a Python script to answer your question. The script will store the relevant information in variables and then print the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a variable to store the name of the individual, Andre Vernault.\n2.  Define another variable to hold his true profession.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to construct a sentence that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reveals the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The individual in question\n    person_name = \"Andre Vernault\"\n    \n    # The true profession he concealed\n    his_true_profession = \"pigeon fancier\"\n    \n    # Print the answer\n    print(f\"The true profession Andre Vernault concealed from interrogators during World War II was: {his_true_profession}.\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<pigeon fancier>>>"
