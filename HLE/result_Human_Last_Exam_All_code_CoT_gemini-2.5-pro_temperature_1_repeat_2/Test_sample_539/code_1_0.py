    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("The equality hom(F, G^l) = hom(F, H^l) holds for all graphs F with treewidth at most k.")
    print("Using the theorem from Step 1 again, this is the condition for k-WL indistinguishability.")

    print("### Final Answer ###")
    print("This chain of logic holds for any positive integer l. There is no 'maximum l' because")
    print("the property of being k-WL indistinguishable is preserved for any number of tensor products.")
    print("The correct answer is that the statement holds for all l.")
