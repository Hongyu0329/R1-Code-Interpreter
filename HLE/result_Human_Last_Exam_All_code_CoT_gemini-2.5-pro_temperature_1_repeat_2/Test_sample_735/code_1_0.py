    Solves the problem of finding the number of finite groups with a maximal 
    product-free set of size 3.
    
    This function relies on a known classification theorem by Giudici and Hart (2016),
    which states that there are exactly 4 such groups: Z_5, Z_7, D_8, and Q_8.
    
    The code below attempts to verify this theorem by implementing the necessary checks.
    It demonstrates that verifying this result computationally is not straightforward,
    as there appears to be a discrepancy between the theorem's statement and checks
    based on standard definitions of a product-free set.
