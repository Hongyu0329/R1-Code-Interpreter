    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the question to determine what \"smallest possible number\" implies. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer, so it could potentially be zero.\n2.  I will construct a case for a finite ultrametric space `X` and a Banach space `B` where the number of isometric embeddings is indeed 0. This establishes 0 as a possible value.\n3.  Often, questions of this nature implicitly ask for the smallest *non-zero* number, assuming a non-degenerate case where embeddings exist. I will proceed with this interpretation, as it leads to a more insightful answer.\n4.  I will establish a lower bound for the number of non-zero embeddings. By considering the translational symmetry of a Banach space, I'll show that if at least one embedding exists, there must be at least `K` embeddings, where `K` is the cardinality of the Banach space `B`.\n5.  To find the smallest positive number of embeddings, I will try to minimize this lower bound `K`. The smallest possible cardinality for a Banach space is `K=1`, which corresponds to the zero space `B = {0}`.\n6.  Finally, I will construct a specific pair `(X, B)` that achieves this minimum. I will choose `B = {0}` and find a suitable finite ultrametric space `X` for which there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n7.  This will demonstrate that 1 is the smallest possible positive number of embeddings. The Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_embedding_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest possible number\n    of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the question\")\n    print(\"Let N be the number of isometric embeddings.
