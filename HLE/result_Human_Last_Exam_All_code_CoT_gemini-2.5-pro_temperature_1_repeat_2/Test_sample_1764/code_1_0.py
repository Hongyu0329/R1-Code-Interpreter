    print("Step 1: Analyzing the question")
    print("Let N be the number of isometric embeddings. N must be a non-negative integer.")
    print("We are looking for the minimum possible value of N by choosing X and B freely.\n")

    print("Step 2: Checking if N can be 0")
    print("Yes, N can be 0. An isometric embedding f: X -> B must satisfy ||f(x) - f(y)||_B = d(x, y).")
    print("Let's choose the Banach space B = {0}. Its cardinality K is 1.")
    print("For an embedding into B={0} to exist, we must have d(x,y) = ||f(x)-f(y)||_B = ||0-0|| = 0 for all x,y in X.")
    print("If we choose a space X with at least two points with non-zero distance, like X={a, b} with d(a,b)=1, this condition fails.")
    print("For X={a,b} with d(a,b)=1 and B={0}, N = 0.")
    print("Therefore, the absolute smallest possible number is 0.\n")

    print("Step 3: Interpreting the question as finding the smallest *positive* number")
    print("Often, such questions implicitly ask for the smallest non-zero result, assuming a non-trivial case where embeddings exist.")
    print("We will now find the minimum N such that N > 0.\n")

    print("Step 4: Finding a lower bound for positive N")
    print("If an isometric embedding f: X -> B exists, we can generate other embeddings.")
    print("A Banach space B has translational symmetry. For any vector v in B, the map T_v(z) = z + v is an isometry of B.")
    print("Therefore, f_v(x) = f(x) + v is also an isometric embedding for any v in B.")
    print("These embeddings are distinct for each unique v. Since there are K vectors in B, there are at least K distinct embeddings.")
    print("So, if N > 0, then N >= K.\n")

    print("Step 5: Minimizing the lower bound K")
    print("To find the smallest possible N > 0, we should choose a B with the smallest possible K.")
    print("A Banach space is a vector space over R or C. The smallest such space is the zero space, B = {0}, for which K = 1.")
    print("This implies the smallest possible positive N is at least 1.\n")

    print("Step 6: Constructing a case where N = 1")
    print("Let's choose B = {0} (so K=1).")
    print("We need to find a finite ultrametric space X that can be embedded in B={0}.")
    print("As shown in Step 2, this requires d(x, y) = 0 for all x, y in X.")
    print("This condition is satisfied by a single-point space, X = {p}.")
    print("Let's verify this case:")
    print("  - X = {p} is a finite ultrametric space.")
    print("  - B = {0} is a Banach space.")
    print("  - There is only one possible map f: {p} -> {0}, which sends p to 0.")
    print("  - Checking the isometry condition: ||f(p) - f(p)||_B = ||0-0|| = 0. And d(p,p) = 0. The condition holds.")
    print("So, for this choice of X and B, there is exactly one isometric embedding.\n")

    print("Step 7: Final Conclusion")
    print("We have shown that if the number of embeddings is positive, it must be at least 1.")
    print("We have found a valid case where the number of embeddings is exactly 1.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest possible positive number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n")

    # Our final equation is "Smallest possible positive number = 1".
