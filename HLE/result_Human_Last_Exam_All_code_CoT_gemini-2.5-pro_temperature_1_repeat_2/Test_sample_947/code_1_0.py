    # for an infinite stack of superconducting strips in an applied field Ha.
    # The conditions are:
    # 1. Ha > H0, where H0 = Jc * d / pi is the full penetration field.
    #    This means the strips are fully penetrated by the magnetic flux.
    # 2. |x| >> w (since a=w at full penetration), where 2w is the strip width.
    #    This allows us to model each strip as a line of magnetic dipoles.

    # The magnetic moment per unit length of a fully penetrated strip is:
    # m = - (pi / 2) * H0 * w^2
    # The field from the stack is found by summing the fields of an infinite
    # array of these dipoles spaced by D along the z-axis. The final result
    # from this summation is presented below.
