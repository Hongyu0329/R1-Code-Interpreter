    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all knots with four or fewer crossings, determine which integral surgeries on them produce homology 3-spheres, and then count how many distinct elements these spheres represent in the homology cobordism group (Θ³_H).\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **List Knots:** Identify all distinct knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. These are:\n    *   The unknot (0₁)\n    *   The trefoil knot (3₁). It is chiral, so its mirror image (-3₁) is a distinct knot.\n    *   The figure-eight knot (4₁). It is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n2.  **Identify Valid Surgeries:** An integral p-surgery on a knot K produces a homology 3-sphere if and only if the absolute value of the surgery coefficient `p` is 1. Therefore, we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Surgery:** For each knot and each valid surgery (+1 or -1), we determine the resulting element in the homology cobordism group using known theorems from low-dimensional topology.\n    *   **Unknot (0₁):** Any surgery on the unknot produces the standard 3-sphere S³, which is the trivial element in Θ³_H.\n    *   **Figure-eight knot (4₁):** This knot is a \"slice knot\". A key theorem states that ±1 surgery on any slice knot results in a manifold that is homology cobordant to S³, representing the trivial element.\n    *   **Trefoil knot (3₁ and -3₁):** This knot is not slice.\n        *   Surgery on the right-handed trefoil (3₁) yields two distinct, non-trivial elements: the Poincaré homology sphere (from -1 surgery) and the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) (from +1 surgery).\n        *   The Poincaré sphere is known to have order 2 in Θ³_H, meaning it is its own inverse.\n        *   The Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7) has infinite order, so it and its inverse are distinct elements.\n        *   Surgeries on the left-handed trefoil (-3₁) produce the inverse elements of those from the right-handed trefoil.\n\n4.  **Count Unique Elements:** We will collect all the resulting elements and count the number of unique ones. The elements are:\n    *   The trivial element (from the unknot and the figure-eight knot).\n    *   The element for the Poincaré sphere (from -1 surgery on 3₁ and +1 surgery on -3₁).\n    *   The element for Σ(2,3,7) (from +1 surgery on 3₁).\n    *   The inverse of Σ(2,3,7) (from -1 surgery on -3₁).\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan, explain each step, and calculate the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define knots with <= 4 crossings.
