    "In fuzzy logic, the rule activation or firing strength is determined by applying an operator, typically a t-norm, to the membership values of the rule's antecedents. The result of this operation is then used to infer the output fuzzy set, often by applying it to the consequent's membership function using another t-norm (like the minimum or product), a process known as clipping or scaling.\n\nThe user has provided two values:\n1.  `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the rule.\n2.  `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This represents the membership grade of a specific point in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule *before* activation.\n\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" by combining these two with a t-norm. This can be interpreted as finding the membership value of the point in the *final inferred* (or activated) consequent fuzzy set.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the two given values, `Phi_k(x')` and `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n2.  Select a t-norm operator. The most common t-norm is the **minimum** operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm to the two values to find the resulting activation level.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values.\n# Firing strength of the rule's antecedent part.\nphi_k = 0.7\n# Membership grade of a point in the original consequent set.\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# Step 2: Explain the method.\n# A t-norm is used to combine these values. The minimum t-norm is a common choice.\n# This calculates the membership grade in the final inferred fuzzy set (clipping method).\nprint(f\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm.\")\nprint(f\"The inputs are the antecedent firing strength Phi_k(x′) = {phi_k} and the consequent membership grade μG_k_j(y_j) = {mu_G}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Apply the minimum t-norm.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation is: activation_level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G})\")\nprint(f\"The resulting rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\n# The following line is for the platform to extract the final answer.\n# It should not be part of the user's script.\nsys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{activation_level}>>>\")\n```"
