    This script calculates the ground state energy shift for two interacting
    1D quantum harmonic oscillators using second-order perturbation theory.

    Assumptions:
    1. The system consists of two 1D harmonic oscillators.
    2. The oscillation coordinate 'x' represents the charge separation (dipole).
    3. The oscillators are in a collinear configuration (aligned with the separation vector).
    4. The Coulomb constant k_e is set to 1/(4*pi) as per the problem description.
