    "This is a knowledge-based question. The creature that went extinct approximately 65 million years ago is the dinosaur. There is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) whose shape is said to resemble a dinosaur, leading to its nickname. I will write a Python script to print the name of this molecule and its nickname.\n\n```python\ndef find_dinosaur_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of years mentioned in the prompt\n    years_extinct = 65\n\n    # The formal name of the polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    formal_name = \"Dibenzo[fg,op]naphthacene\"\n\n    # The creature it is named after\n    creature_nickname = \"dinosauroid\"\n\n    # Print the answer, including the number from the prompt.\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon is named {formal_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It is nicknamed '{creature_nickname}' because its shape resembles a dinosaur.\")\n    print(f\"Dinosaurs went extinct over {years_extinct} million years ago.\")\n\nfind_dinosaur_molecule()\n```\n<<<Dibenzo[fg,op]naphthacene>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
