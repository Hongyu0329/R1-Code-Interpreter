    print("A functor f is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of length at most n.")
    print("This is equivalent to its projective dimension, pd(f), being at most n.")
    print("The question is asking for the maximum possible projective dimension of a tame functor on an upper semilattice J.")

    print("\nStep 2: Connecting to Global Dimension")
    print("The category of functors Rep_K(J) is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra K[J].")
    print("The global dimension of this category is the maximum projective dimension over all functors.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Key Homological Theorem")
    print("A crucial theorem states that the global dimension of the functor category Rep_K(J) is at most 1 if and only if the poset J is an upper semilattice.")

    print("\nStep 4: Implication of the Theorem")
    print("Since J is an upper semilattice, the global dimension of Rep_K(J) is at most 1.")
    print("This means EVERY functor f in this category has a projective dimension of at most 1.")
    print("So, for any such f, there is a projective resolution of the form: 0 -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0.")
    print("This resolution has length 1.")

    print("\nStep 5: The 'Tame' Condition")
    print("Algebras with global dimension at most 1 are called hereditary. It is a known result that hereditary algebras are always of tame or finite representation type; they cannot be wild.")
    print("Therefore, the fact that the functor is 'tame' is a consequence of J being an upper semilattice, not an additional constraint.")

    print("\nStep 6: Conclusion")
    print("Every functor on J has a projective dimension of at most 1. While some functors may be projective (dimension 0), not all are.")
    print("Therefore, the value n that works for any given functor is 1.")
