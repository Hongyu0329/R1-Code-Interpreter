    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understanding Involutions in PSU(n, q):**\n    An involution in a group is an element of order 2. For the group G = PSU(n, q), an element `x` is an involution if `x^2 = 1` and `x != 1`. The group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as `SU(n, q) / Z`, where `Z` is the center of the special unitary group `SU(n, q)`. An element `gZ` in `PSU(n, q)` (where `g` is in `SU(n, q)`) is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element `Z`, and `gZ` is not `Z` itself. This means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`, and `g` must not be in `Z`.\n\n2.  **Determining the Center Z(SU(4, 997)):**\n    The center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^{q+1} = 1`. The order of the center is `gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`. The order is `gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    Thus, the center `Z` has two elements: `I` (the identity matrix) and `-I`.\n\n3.  **Counting Pre-images in SU(4, 997):**\n    We need to count the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`.\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**\n        An eigenvalue `λ` of such a `g` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. Also, for any element of a unitary group `U(n, q)`, its eigenvalues must satisfy `λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n        Here, `q+1 = 998`. We need `λ^2 = -1` and `λ^998 = 1`.\n        From `λ^2 = -1`, we get `λ^4 = 1`.\n        From `λ^4 = 1` and `λ^998 = 1`, we must have `λ^{gcd(4, 998)} = λ^2 = 1`.\n        This leads to a contradiction: `λ^2` must be both `1` and `-1`. This is impossible as the characteristic of the field is not 2. Therefore, there are no elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = I`**\n        These are the involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. Their eigenvalues are `+1` or `-1`. Since `g` is in `SU(4,q)`, its determinant is 1, which means the number of `-1` eigenvalues must be even. For `n=4`, the number of `-1` eigenvalues can be 0, 2, or 4.\n        -   0 eigenvalues of -1: This corresponds to the identity element `I`.\n        -   4 eigenvalues of -1: This corresponds to the element `-I`.\n        -   2 eigenvalues of -1: These are the non-central involutions. They form a single conjugacy class. The size of this class is given by the formula for the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in a 4-dimensional unitary space, which is `|U(4,q)| / |U(2,q)|^2`.\n        This evaluates to `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n4.  **Mapping to PSU(4, 997):**\n    The elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` that can form involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` are those where `g^2 ∈ Z` and `g ∉ Z`. From our analysis, these are precisely the non-central involutions of `SU(4, 997)` (the case with 2 eigenvalues of -1).\n    The number of these non-central involutions is `q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    These involutions `t` in `SU` are mapped to involutions `tZ` in `PSU`. For each such `t`, the element `-t` is also a non-central involution. The pair `{t, -t}` maps to the same single element `tZ` in `PSU`.\n    Therefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is half the number of non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The number of involutions is `(1/2) * q^4 * (q^2+1) * (q^2-q+1)`. We can now compute this value with `q = 997`.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the value of q.\n# 2. Calculate the components of the formula: q^4, (q^2+1), and (q^2-q+1).\n# 3. Multiply these components together.\n# 4. Divide by 2 to get the final count.\n# 5. Print the result in a formatted equation.\n\n# Set the value for q\nq = 997\n\n# Calculate the terms of the formula\n# Note: Python's integers handle arbitrarily large numbers, so overflow is not an issue.\nterm1 = q**4\nterm2 = q**2 + 1\nterm3 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n# Calculate the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, q)\nnumerator = term1 * term2 * term3\n\n# The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is half of this value.\n# The result is guaranteed to be an integer because q is odd, making q^2+1 even.\nnum_involutions = numerator // 2\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(f\"({q}**4 * ({q}**2 + 1) * ({q}**2 - {q} + 1)) / 2 =\")\nprint(f\"({term1} * {term2} * {term3}) / 2 =\")\nprint(f\"{numerator} / 2 =\")\nprint(num_involutions)\n\n```\n<<<487095629473215160865>>>"
