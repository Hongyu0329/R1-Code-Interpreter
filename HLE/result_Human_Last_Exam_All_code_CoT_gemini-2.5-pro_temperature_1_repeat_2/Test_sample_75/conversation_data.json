    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Start and End Dates:** First, I will establish the start and end years of the Second Great War from StarCraft lore. The war begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* in the year 2504 and concludes with the events of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* in the year 2506.\n2.  **Calculate Duration:** A simple subtraction (`2506 - 2504`) gives a result of 2 years. However, the war spanned *across* three calendar years (2504, 2505, and 2506). This means the actual duration was more than two full years.\n3.  **Round Up:** As requested, the duration must be rounded up. Since the actual time elapsed is greater than 2 years, rounding it up to the nearest whole year results in 3.\n4.  **Construct Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the start and end years, calculates the rounded-up duration, and prints an explanation along with the final equation showing all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_war_duration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began in 2504\n    # with the events of 'Wings of Liberty'.\n    start_year = 2504\n\n    # The war concluded in 2506 with the end of the 'Legacy of the Void' campaign.\n    end_year = 2506\n\n    # The war was active across the years 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    # While a direct subtraction (end_year - start_year) equals 2, the conflict\n    # spanned parts of three calendar years, making its true duration greater than 2.\n    # To find the duration in years rounded up, we can count the number of\n    # calendar years the war was active in.\n    duration_rounded_up = (end_year - start_year) + 1\n\n    print(f\"The Second Great War started in the year {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\n    print(\"Since the conflict spanned across three calendar years, the duration rounded up is 3 years.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} + 1 = {duration_rounded_up}\")\n\n\ncalculate_war_duration()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
