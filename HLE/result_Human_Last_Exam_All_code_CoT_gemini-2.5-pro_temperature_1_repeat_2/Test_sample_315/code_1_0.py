    print("   The color that appears brightest at any point depends on which color's polarization plane is optimally oriented to scatter light towards the observer.")
    print("\n5. Conclusion on Appearance:")
    print("   - As you look down the tube, the color that is most intensely scattered changes continuously.")
    print("   - This creates a gradient of colors, a rainbow, along the length of the tube.")
    print("   - Due to the rotational nature of the effect and the cylindrical shape of the tube, this rainbow gradient appears as a spiral.")
