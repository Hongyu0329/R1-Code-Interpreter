    "The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage and microglia engulfment of amyloid is **Complement component C3**.\n\nThe breakdown of C3 into its active fragment, C3b, is a key step in the complement cascade. This C3b fragment coats the amyloid plaques (a process called opsonization), which essentially tags them as foreign or as debris to be cleared. Macrophages and microglia have complement receptors on their cell surfaces that recognize and bind to the C3b-coated amyloid, triggering phagocytosis (engulfment) and subsequent degradation of the amyloid.\n\n<<<Complement component C3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
