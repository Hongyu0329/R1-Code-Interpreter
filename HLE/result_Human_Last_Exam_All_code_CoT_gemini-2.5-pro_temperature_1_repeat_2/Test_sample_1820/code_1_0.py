# Define the parameters for Ontology O‚ÇÅ as given in the problem.
b = 3  # Branching factor
d = 4  # Depth

# Statement D suggests that the theoretical completeness is bounded by the formula ln(b)/d.
# This formula is derived from an information-theoretic view of the ontology's structure.
# - ln(b) represents the information content or complexity at each branching point.
# - The depth 'd' acts as a normalizing factor, as information loss can compound at each level.
# This provides a reasonable upper bound on how much structural detail can be preserved
# when mapping from an ontology with mergeable classes to one with a strict structure.

# Calculate the value of this theoretical bound.
completeness_bound = math.log(b) / d

# Print the explanation and the result, showing each number in the equation.
