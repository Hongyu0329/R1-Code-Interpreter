import sympy as sp

# Define the symbols
V, epsilon, pi, L, a, b = sp.symbols('V epsilon pi L a b', real=True, positive=True)

# Based on the provided solution B, here are the formulas
# Note: As derived in the text, these formulas are not self-consistent and do not all follow from first principles.
# The derivation shows q_s(a) should have a coefficient of 4, not 2, and q_v should not have the denominator term.

# Total volume charge from option B
q_v = -4 * V * epsilon * pi * L / (1 - a**2/b**2)

# Total surface charge on the inner electrode from option B
q_s_a = 2 * pi * L * V * epsilon / (1 - a**2/b**2)

# Total surface charge on the outer electrode from option B
q_s_b = -4 * pi * L * V * epsilon * a**2 / (b**2 * (1 - a**2/b**2))

# Print the results in a formatted way
