    # 1. Calculate b1 of the graph Gamma = L(Petersen).
    # 2. Calculate the sum of the first l2-betti numbers of the vertex groups.
    # 3. Calculate the sum of the zeroth l2-betti numbers of the edge groups.
    # 4. Combine the results using the formula for the l2-betti number of a graph of groups.

    # Step 1: Calculate the first Betti number, b1(Gamma), of the underlying graph.
    # The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges.
    # Its line graph, Gamma, has vertices corresponding to the edges of the Petersen graph.
    num_vertices_gamma = 15
    # The Petersen graph is 3-regular. The degree of a vertex in the line graph L(P)
    # corresponding to an edge (u,v) in P is deg(u) + deg(v) - 2.
    # So, Gamma is (3 + 3 - 2) = 4-regular.
    # The number of edges in Gamma is (num_vertices * degree) / 2.
    num_edges_gamma = (num_vertices_gamma * 4) // 2
    # The graph is connected, so the first Betti number is |E| - |V| + 1.
    b1_gamma = num_edges_gamma - num_vertices_gamma + 1

    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the first l2-Betti numbers of the vertex groups.
    # The vertex groups are G_v1 = N_100 and G_vi = *_{g=2 to i} N_g for i=2,...,15.
    # For any g, N_g is the fundamental group of a 3-manifold, so beta_1^(2)(N_g) = 0.
    # Also, N_g is infinite, so beta_0^(2)(N_g) = 0.
    # For a free product of k groups A_1, ..., A_k with beta_1=0 and beta_0=0,
    # the first l2-Betti number is k-1.
    # G_v1 = N_100 (k=1 factor), so beta_1^(2)(G_v1) = 1-1 = 0.
    # G_vi = *_{g=2 to i} N_g (k=i-1 factors), so beta_1^(2)(G_vi) = (i-1)-1 = i-2.

    # For vertices v_2 to v_15:
    for i in range(2, 16):
        num_factors = i - 1
        if num_factors > 0:
          sum_beta1_gv += (num_factors - 1)

    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of the zeroth l2-Betti numbers of the edge groups.
    # The edge groups G_e are of the form N_g for some g.
    # Since N_g are infinite groups, beta_0^(2)(N_g) = 0.
    # There are num_edges_gamma = 30 edges.
    sum_beta0_ge = 0

    # Step 4: Final calculation using the formula:
