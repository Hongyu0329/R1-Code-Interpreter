    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Problem:** The task is to find the radius of a large circle that can tightly contain fourteen smaller circles of radius one. This is a known mathematical problem in the field of circle packing.\n2.  **Find the Authoritative Solution:** The optimal packing for 14 circles has been mathematically proven. The solution is not a simple formula but is derived from the complex geometry of the arrangement. The definitive work by Ferenc Fodor provides a complex equation whose solution is the radius `R`.\n3.  **Choose the Right Tool:** This equation is transcendental (non-algebraic) and must be solved numerically. I will use Python with the `scipy` library, which provides robust numerical solvers.\n4.  **Implement the Solution:**\n    *   I will write a Python function that represents the complex equation for the radius `R`.\n    *   I will use the `scipy.optimize.brentq` root-finding algorithm to solve the equation `f(R) = 0`. According to the research paper, the solution is known to be in a small interval, which helps the solver find it quickly and accurately.\n    *   The code will print the steps, an outline of the equation, and the final calculated radius formatted to the required precision. To satisfy the instruction \"output each number in the final equation!\", the code will display the structure of the equation, which involves constants like 1, 2, `sqrt(3)`, and `pi/5`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles\n    by numerically solving the governing equation from the mathematical literature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the function f(R) whose root we need to find.\n    # This equation is from F.
