# The problem is to find sum(a_k^2) for the polynomial P(x) = sum(a_k * x^k),
# where P(x) is the product from i=0 to 19 of (1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i)).
# The sum of squares of coefficients, sum(a_k^2), is the constant term of P(x) * P(1/x).
#
# Let P(x) = product_{i=0..19} P_i(x), where P_i(x) = 1 + x^(3^i) + x^(2*3^i) + x^(3*3^i).
# P_i(x) can be factored as (1 + x^(3^i)) * (1 + x^(2*3^i)).
# So, P(x) = A(x) * B(x), where:
# A(x) = product_{i=0..19} (1 + x^(3^i))
# B(x) = product_{i=0..19} (1 + x^(2*3^i))
#
# The value we seek is the constant term of P(x)P(1/x) = A(x)A(1/x) * B(x)B(1/x).
#
# The exponents in A(x)A(1/x) are of the form sum(e_i * 3^i) where e_i is in {-1, 0, 1}.
# The exponents in B(x)B(1/x) are of the form sum(d_i * 2*3^i) where d_i is in {-1, 0, 1}.
#
# For a non-constant term from A(x)A(1/x) to cancel with a non-constant term
# from B(x)B(1/x), their exponents must sum to zero.
# sum(e_i * 3^i) + sum(d_j * 2*3^j) = 0
# sum((e_i + 2*d_i) * 3^i) = 0
# Due to the properties of base-3 representation, the only integer solution for this equation
# with coefficients e_i, d_i in {-1, 0, 1} is the trivial solution where all e_i and d_i are 0.
#
# Therefore, the constant term of the product is the product of the constant terms.
#
# Constant term of A(x)A(1/x):
# A(x)A(1/x) = product_{i=0..19} (1 + x^(3^i))(1 + x^(-3^i)) = product_{i=0..19} (2 + x^(3^i) + x^(-3^i)).
# The constant term is the product of the constant terms of each factor, which is 2*2*...*2 (20 times) = 2^20.
#
# Constant term of B(x)B(1/x):
# B(x)B(1/x) = product_{i=0..19} (1 + x^(2*3^i))(1 + x^(-2*3^i)) = product_{i=0..19} (2 + x^(2*3^i) + x^(-2*3^i)).
# The constant term is similarly 2^20.
#
# The final result is the product of these two constant terms: 2^20 * 2^20 = 2^40.
# 2^40 can be written as (2^2)^20 = 4^20.
