    """
    Finds the smallest N for a 4x4 multiplicative magic square.

    The method is based on constructing the numbers from the prime factor exponents.
    We use a pandiagonal magic square M with entries 0-15.
    A pandiagonal magic square has the property that if you write its entries in binary,
    the matrices formed by each of the 4 bits are themselves magic squares.

    Let M be such a square. For each cell (i, j), let m = M[i, j].
    Let the 4-bit binary representation of m be (b3, b2, b1, b0).
    We can define the number in our multiplicative magic square as:
    a[i, j] = 2**b0 * 3**b1 * 5**b2 * 7**b3

    The matrix of exponents for each prime will be a magic square, so the product
    of each row/column will be constant. Since all entries of M are unique (0-15),
    the binary representations are unique, and thus the numbers a[i, j] are all distinct.

    We then find the maximum value among these 16 numbers to find N.
