    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user wants to find the maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The mention of maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is likely contextual information rather than a specific constraint needed for the solution.\n\n2.  **Recall Graph Coloring Fundamentals:**\n    *   A proper vertex coloring assigns a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n    *   The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of graph $G$.\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   A graph requires exactly $n$ colors if and only if it is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. This establishes an upper bound for the maximum number of colors.\n\n4.  **Verify if the Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   To determine if $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to check if there exists a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n    *   Let's construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G'$ which is composed of two disconnected parts:\n        1.  A complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, known as $K_{n-1}$.\n        2.  A single isolated vertex, $v$.\n    *   The total number of vertices in $G'$ is $(n-1) + 1 = n$.\n    *   Is $G'$ a complete graph? No, because the isolated vertex $v$ is not connected to any of the other vertices.\n    *   What is the chromatic number of $G'$? The $K_{n-1}$ part requires $n-1$ distinct colors since all its vertices are mutually adjacent. The isolated vertex $v$ is not adjacent to any other vertex, so it can be colored with any of the $n-1$ colors already used. Thus, the minimum number of colors needed for $G'$ is $n-1$. So, $\\chi(G') = n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors.\n    *   We have also constructed a specific non-complete graph with $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Given $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis reasoning leads to the following Python code, which performs the simple calculation and presents the result.\n\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G.\nn = 12345\n\n# The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex\n# coloring of a graph with n vertices, given that the graph is not a complete graph.\n\n# Based on graph theory, the chromatic number of any graph with n vertices\n# is at most n. The equality holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n).\n# Since our graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be at most n - 1.\n\n# To show that n - 1 is the highest possible value, we can construct a graph that\n# requires n - 1 colors. A simple example is a graph consisting of a complete\n# subgraph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1}) and one additional isolated vertex. This graph\n# has n vertices, is not complete, and requires n-1 colors.\n\n# Thus, the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\nmax_colors = n - 1\n\nprint(f\"Let n be the number of vertices, where n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"The maximum number of colors needed to properly color a non-complete graph with n vertices is given by the equation: n - 1.\")\nprint(\"The result is:\")\nprint(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
