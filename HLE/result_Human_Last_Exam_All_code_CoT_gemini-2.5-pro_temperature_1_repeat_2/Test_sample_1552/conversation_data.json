    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the second non-trivial Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, `a_2`, for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Operator**: The relevant operator is the square of the gauged Dirac operator, `D^2`. This operator can be expressed in the standard Laplace form `D^2 = \\Delta + E`, where `\\Delta` is the connection Laplacian and `E` is an endomorphism.\n2.  **Use the Heat Kernel Formula**: The local density `b_2` of the `a_2` coefficient for an operator `P = \\Delta + E` on a 4-dimensional manifold is given by the well-known Seeley-DeWitt formula:\n    `b_2 = tr( (1/360) * (2 R_μνρσ² - 2 R_μν² + 5 R²)I + (1/6)RE + (1/2)E² + (1/12)F_μν² )`\n    where `tr` is the trace over the fiber space (spinor and gauge indices), `R`, `R_μν`, `R_μνρσ` are the scalar, Ricci, and Riemann curvatures, `E` is the endomorphism part of the operator, and `F_μν` is the total curvature of the connection.\n3.  **Determine E and F_μν**: For the gauged Dirac operator `D`, the operator `D^2` has an endomorphism part `E = (1/4)R + (i/2)σ^μν F_μν` and the total curvature is `F_μν = (1/2)R_μνρσ σ^ρσ ⊗ I_F + I_S ⊗ iF_μν`.\n4.  **Calculate Traces**: Compute the trace of each term in the `b_2` formula. This involves taking traces over the 4-dimensional spinor space (`dim_S = 4`) and the `N_F`-dimensional gauge representation space.\n5.  **Combine Terms**: Sum up all contributions to find the final expression for the integrand of `a_2`. The result will be an equation involving geometric invariants (`R²`, `R_μν²`, `R_μνρσ²`) and the gauge field strength squared (`tr(F_μν F^μν)`).\n6.  **Code the Calculation**: Implement the calculation in Python using the `fractions` module to handle rational numbers precisely. The script will compute the coefficients and print the final formula for the `a_2` integrand.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these steps and provides the result.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_heat_kernel_coefficient():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficients of the a_2 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient\n    for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in 4 dimensions.\n\n    The a_2 coefficient is the third term in the heat kernel expansion\n    Tr(exp(-t*P)) ~ (4*pi*t)^(-d/2) * sum_{n=0 to inf} a_n(P) * t^n,\n    and the second non-trivial coefficient in the spectral action expansion.\n\n    The local density of a_2 for a Laplace-type operator P = Delta + E is given by:\n    b_2 = tr( (1/360)*(2*Riem^2 - 2*Ric^2 + 5*R^2)*I + (1/6)*R*E + (1/2)*E^2 + (1/12)*F^2 )\n\n    For the squared Dirac operator D^2:\n    - The trace is over the spinor bundle (dim_S=4) and the gauge bundle (dim_F=N_F).\n    - Endomorphism E = (1/4)*R + (i/2)*sigma^{mu,nu}*F_{mu,nu}.\n    - Total curvature F_{mu,nu} = Omega^S_{mu,nu} + i*F_{mu,nu}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use Fraction for exact rational arithmetic\n    F = fractions.Fraction\n\n    # Dimension of Dirac spinor representation in 4D\n    dim_S = 4\n\n    # The coefficients will be functions of N_F, the dimension of the gauge representation.\n    # We calculate the numerical part of the coefficients.\n\n    # 1.
