# The final expression derived from solving the differential equation and 
# simplifying the target expression is:
# (3/2) * 10^(10/3) + 37/4
# This script calculates its numerical value.

# Define the numbers in the final equation
c1_num = 3
c1_den = 2
base = 10
exp_num = 10
exp_den = 3
c2_num = 37
c2_den = 4

# Calculate the numerical result
term1 = (c1_num / c1_den) * (base ** (exp_num / exp_den))
term2 = c2_num / c2_den
result = term1 + term2

# Print the final equation structure with its numbers
print(f"The final expression is: ({c1_num}/{c1_den}) * {base}**({exp_num}/{exp_den}) + ({c2_num}/{c2_den})")

# Print the final calculated value
print(f"The result is: {result}")
