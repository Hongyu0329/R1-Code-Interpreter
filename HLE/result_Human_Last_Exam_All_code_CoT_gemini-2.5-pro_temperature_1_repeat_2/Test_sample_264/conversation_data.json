    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will model the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. I'll place the first unit cube, Cube 1, with one corner at the origin (0,0,0), so it occupies the space where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n2.  The problem states the second cube is \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The main diagonal of the first cube runs from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a shift of 1/2 along each of the x, y, and z axes. Therefore, the second cube, Cube 2, will occupy the space where `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`, `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`, and `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`.\n3.  The intersection of these two cubes is the region that satisfies the conditions for *both* cubes.\n4.  For each axis (x, y, and z), the intersection will span from the maximum of the two cubes' lower bounds to the minimum of their upper bounds. This will define a smaller cube.\n5.  I will calculate the side length of this intersection cube.\n6.  Finally, the Python code will calculate the volume of this intersection cube and print out the steps of the calculation, including the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_intersection_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two shifted unit cubes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of the original cubes\n    side_length = 1.0\n\n    # The shift along each axis\n    shift = 0.5\n\n    # Define the boundaries of the first cube (C1)\n    c1_min = 0.0\n    c1_max = side_length\n\n    # Define the boundaries of the second, shifted cube (C2)\n    c2_min = shift\n    c2_max = side_length + shift\n\n    # The intersection is a region where a point is in both cubes.\n    # We find the boundaries of this intersection for one dimension (e.g., x-axis).\n    # The logic is the same for the y and z axes.\n    intersect_min = max(c1_min, c2_min)\n    intersect_max = min(c1_max, c2_max)\n\n    # Calculate the side length of the resulting intersection cube\n    intersect_side_length = intersect_max - intersect_min\n\n    # Calculate the volume of the intersection\n    volume = intersect_side_length ** 3\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result\n    print(\"The first cube occupies the space from 0 to 1 on each axis.\")\n    print(f\"The second cube is shifted by {shift} and occupies the space from {shift} to {side_length + shift} on each axis.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe intersection of these two cubes is a smaller cube.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of this intersection cube is the overlap on any axis, which is {intersect_max} - {intersect_min} = {intersect_side_length}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe volume is calculated by cubing this side length.\")\n    \n    # Using fractions for a clear representation of the equation\n    s_frac = fractions.Fraction(intersect_side_length)\n    v_frac = fractions.Fraction(volume)\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: ({s_frac.numerator}/{s_frac.denominator}) * ({s_frac.numerator}/{s_frac.denominator}) * ({s_frac.numerator}/{s_frac.denominator}) = {v_frac.numerator}/{v_frac.denominator}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe volume of the intersection is {float(volume)}.\")\n\nsolve_intersection_volume()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
