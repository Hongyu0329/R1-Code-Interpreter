    # Case 1: n is not equal to 2^2024
    # For these components, alpha_n = 0 and f_n(t) = 0.
    # The given condition x(0) = 1/2 * alpha implies x_n(0) = 0.
    # The solution to the IVP x_n'(t) = (2^n) * x_n(t) with x_n(0) = 0 is x_n(t) = 0 for all t.
    # Therefore, x_n(1) = 0 for all n != 2^2024.
    
    # Case 2: n = k = 2^2024
    # The squared norm ||x(1)||^2 will be equal to |x_k(1)|^2.
    # We find x_k(1) using the boundary conditions.
    
    # The conditions for the k-th component are:
    # (1) m_k * x_k(0) - n_k * x_k(1) = alpha_k
    # (2) x_k(0) = 1/2 * alpha_k
    
    # Let's define the parameters for k = 2^2024:
    k_exponent = 2024
    # k = 2**k_exponent is an even number.
    
    # From the problem description:
    alpha_k = 1
    # For even indices, the k-th diagonal element of M is 1.
    m_k = 1
    # The k-th diagonal element of N is e^(-2^k).
    # Let's denote k = 2**2024, so n_k = e^(-k).
    
    # Substitute (2) into (1) to solve for x_k(1):
    # m_k * (1/2 * alpha_k) - n_k * x_k(1) = alpha_k
    # Rearranging for x_k(1):
    # n_k * x_k(1) = (m_k/2 - 1) * alpha_k
    # x_k(1) = (m_k/2 - 1) * alpha_k / n_k
    
    # Plugging in the values:
    # x_k(1) = (1/2 - 1) * 1 / e^(-k)
    # x_k(1) = -1/2 * e^k
    
    # Now, we compute the squared norm ||x(1)||^2 = |x_k(1)|^2
    # ||x(1)||^2 = (-1/2 * e^k)^2 = (1/4) * (e^k)^2 = (1/4) * e^(2*k)
    
    # Since k = 2^2024, we have 2*k = 2 * 2^2024 = 2^(1 + 2024) = 2^2025.
    
    # The final expression is (1/4) * e^(2^2025).
    # We will now print the numbers in this final equation.
