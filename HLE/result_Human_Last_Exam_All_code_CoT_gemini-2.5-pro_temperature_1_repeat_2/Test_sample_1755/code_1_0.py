        "1. The code uses a `while(1)` loop combined with an `if (feof(stdin))` check at the end to read input.",
        "2. This structure is flawed. After all numbers from the input are read successfully, the loop runs one more time.",
        "3. In this final iteration, the `scanf` call fails because it's at the end-of-file (EOF).",
        "4. Crucially, when `scanf` fails, it leaves the variable `c` unchanged. It still contains the value from the last successful read, which is -3 for the given test case.",
        "5. The program then proceeds to execute `x+=c; y+=c; z+=c;`, incorrectly adding -3 to each of the sums, which were all correctly calculated as 0 in the previous iteration.",
        "6. The sums become (-3, -3, -3) instead of (0, 0, 0), causing the program to output 'NO' instead of the correct 'YES'.",
        "The fix is to insert `c = 0;` at the beginning of the loop body (as a new line 8). This resets `c` in each iteration, so if `scanf` fails, the harmless value 0 is added to the sums.",
