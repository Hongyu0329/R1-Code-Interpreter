The iterative application of the local median filter causes the edges in the image to move in a way that minimizes their total length and curvature. This process is known as motion by mean curvature. Specifically, convex boundaries of a shape shrink inwards, while concave parts of a boundary expand outwards, smoothing out sharp corners and irregularities. As time `t` approaches infinity, any isolated shape will shrink and eventually disappear entirely. Consequently, the image converges to a uniform state, becoming either all black (all pixel values are 0) or all white (all pixel values are 1).
