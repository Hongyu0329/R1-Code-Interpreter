    Explains the effect of reacting Ce2@C80 with a disilirane.
    """
    explanation = """
Step 1: The reaction is between an endohedral fullerene (Ce2@C80) and an external reagent (disilirane). The cerium atoms are inside the C80 cage.

Step 2: The disilirane reacts with the *outer surface* of the C80 cage. It cannot penetrate the cage to interact directly with the cerium atoms. This is called an exohedral functionalization.

Step 3: Before the reaction, the symmetrical C80 cage allows the two cerium atoms to move relatively freely inside.

Step 4: The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the outside breaks the cage's symmetry. This creates a unique point on the fullerene and changes the electrostatic potential inside the cage.

Step 5: The internal cerium atoms are attracted to the new potential energy minimum created by the external adduct. This causes them to stop their free motion and become localized at a fixed position.

Step 6: This fixed position is directly under the point of the external addition. If we define this point as a "pole" of the molecule, the cerium atoms are now positioned at that pole.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene.
