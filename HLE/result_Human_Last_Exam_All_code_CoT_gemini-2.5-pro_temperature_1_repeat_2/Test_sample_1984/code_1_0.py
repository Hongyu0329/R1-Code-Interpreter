# Step 1: Define m, the number of stable equilibrium points.
# From the analysis, we found m = 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the other numbers in the equation.
base = 2
exponent = 4048

# Step 3: Calculate the final expression.
# Python's built-in integers can handle arbitrarily large numbers.
result = m - (base**exponent)

# Step 4: Output the numbers from the equation and the final result.
