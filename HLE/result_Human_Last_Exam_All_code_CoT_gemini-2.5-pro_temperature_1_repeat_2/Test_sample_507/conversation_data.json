    "This is a fascinating linguistic puzzle. The words for \"mom\" and \"dad\" are often similar across unrelated languages (known as nursery words), but finding a match for a cultural item like \"broom\" is much harder.\n\nMy plan is to select two languages from distinct language families in Asia that have no history of direct cultural contact, yet exhibit surprising similarities in the requested words. The best candidates are Korean and Tamil (a Dravidian language from Southern India and Sri Lanka). Their relationship is a topic of linguistic debate, making them a perfect fit for this kind of question.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1.  Define a dictionary to hold the data for Korean and Tamil.\n2.  Store the words for \"mom\", \"dad\", and \"broom\" for each language, including their native script for authenticity.\n3.  Print an explanation of the choice of languages.\n4.  Iterate through the words and print a formatted comparison for each, clearly showing the similarities (and differences).\n\n```python\ndef find_similar_words():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints a comparison of words from two\n    languages in Asia that have no direct contact but share similar words\n    for \"mom\" and \"dad\".\n    \"\"\"\n    languages = {\n        \"Korean\": {\n            \"culture\": \"East Asian\",\n            \"mom\": \"eomma (엄마)\",\n            \"dad\": \"appa (아빠)\",\n            \"broom\": \"bitjaru (빗자루)\"\n        },\n        \"Tamil\": {\n            \"culture\": \"South Asian (Dravidian)\",\n            \"mom\": \"amma (அம்மா)\",\n            \"dad\": \"appa (அப்பா)\",\n            \"broom\": \"vilakkumāṟu (விளக்குமாறு)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    lang1_name = \"Korean\"\n    lang2_name = \"Tamil\"\n    lang1 = languages[lang1_name]\n    lang2 = languages[lang2_name]\n\n    print(f\"The two languages are {lang1_name} and {lang2_name}.\")\n    print(f\"These languages are from two different cultures ({lang1['culture']} and {lang2['culture']})\")\n    print(\"and have no significant history of direct contact.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a comparison of the words:\\n\")\n\n    words_to_compare = [\"mom\", \"dad\", \"broom\"]\n    for word in words_to_compare:\n        print(f\"Word: '{word.capitalize()}'\")\n        print(f\"  - {lang1_name}: {lang1[word]}\")\n        print(f\"  - {lang2_name}: {lang2[word]}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"\\nNote: The words for 'mom' and 'dad' are nearly identical.\")\n    print(\"The word for 'broom' is not similar, but the striking similarity\")\n    print(\"of the other two words in these historically non-contacted cultures is a well-known linguistic curiosity.\")\n\nfind_similar_words()\n```\n<<<Korean and Tamil>>>"
