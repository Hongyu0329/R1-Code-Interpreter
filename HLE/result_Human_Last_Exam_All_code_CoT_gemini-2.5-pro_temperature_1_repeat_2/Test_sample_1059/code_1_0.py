    print("   With the subspace topology from R, Z is a discrete space (every point is an open set). It is infinite and unbounded, so not compact. In a discrete space, the closure of any open set U is U itself. The cover by singletons {{n} | n in Z} is a cover by closures of open sets with no finite subcover. So, B is NOT necessarily closepact.\n")

    print("   A finite set is always bounded. In a Hausdorff space like C, any finite set is also closed. Being closed and bounded, it is compact. Therefore, it is necessarily closepact. So, C is a correct choice.\n")

    print("   Let Y = {1/n | n in Z, n != 0}. This is an infinite set. Its only limit point is 0, which is not in Y, so the set is not closed and not compact. It is also a discrete space, and like Z, it is not closepact. So, D is NOT necessarily closepact.\n")

    print("   Let Y be the set of points in the sequence. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence converges to a limit L. If L is not in Y, Y is not closed and thus not compact.
