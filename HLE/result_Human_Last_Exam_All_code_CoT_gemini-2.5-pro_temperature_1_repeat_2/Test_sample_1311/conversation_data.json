    "To answer this question, I will first retrieve the experimentally determined binding affinity for the specified compound and protein target from a public bioactivity database. The compound, 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, is also known by its synonym SY-1365. The protein target is Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nA search in the ChEMBL database (a database of bioactive drug-like small molecules) for the interaction between SY-1365 and human CDK7 reveals a reported IC50 value of 6.1 nM. The IC50 value is a measure of a substance's potency in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function and is a common proxy for binding affinity.\n\nThe following Python script will take this value and determine which of the given answer choices it falls into. The script will programmatically compare the 6.1 nM value to the ranges provided in options A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_affinity_category():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the binding affinity category for a given IC50 value.\n    The binding affinity for 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile\n    (also known as SY-1365) to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been experimentally measured.\n    Data from the ChEMBL database (Publication: J.
