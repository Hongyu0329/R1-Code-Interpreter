# The haiku provides the components for a mathematical equation.
# "Twice fifteen" gives the first number.
number1 = 2 * 15

# The phrase "brings winds of change" implies that the number 30 is the agent of change.
# In riddle logic, it acts upon itself. Division is the operation that results in 1.
# Therefore, the second number is the same as the first.
number2 = number1

# "A divine one yields" gives the result of the equation.
result = 1

# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The derived equation is number1 / number2 = result.
print(f"{number1} / {number2} = {result}")
