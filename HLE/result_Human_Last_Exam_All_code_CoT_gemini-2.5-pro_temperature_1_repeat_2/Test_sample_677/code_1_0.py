def find_supremum_nm():
    """
    This function finds the supremum of nm for which the super-knight graph on an
    n x m board (n, m >= 4) can be planar.

    The planarity condition for this triangle-free graph, E <= 2V - 4,
    simplifies to (n-5)(m-5) <= 11. Any (n, m) pair for a planar graph
    must satisfy this condition. Therefore, the supremum of nm for planar graphs
    is at most the maximum of nm for graphs satisfying this inequality.

    This code finds the maximum integer product n*m for n, m >= 4
    satisfying (n-5)(m-5) <= 11.

    We assume that for n=4 and n=5, where the inequality does not bound m,
    the graph eventually becomes non-planar for a large enough m, and the
    resulting nm product is smaller than the maximum found for n >= 6.
