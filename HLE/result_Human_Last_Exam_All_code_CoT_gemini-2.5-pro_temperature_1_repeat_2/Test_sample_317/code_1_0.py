    Analyzes Kenneth Burke's concept of the "Tribal No"
    in relation to his action/motion dichotomy.

    print("Step 1: Define Kenneth Burke's core concepts.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("Motion: The realm of the purely physical and non-symbolic. It is what happens in nature without choice or meaning (e.g., a falling rock, a growing plant). It is sensory and pre-linguistic.")
    print("Action: The realm of the symbolic, unique to humans as 'symbol-using animals.' It involves choice, purpose, motive, and morality. Action is impossible without language.")
    print("The Negative: A key component of action. The concept of 'not' or 'no' does not exist in the realm of motion (nature). It is a purely symbolic, linguistic creation. The negative makes rules, laws, and commandments ('Thou shalt not...') possible.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the 'Tribal No'.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("The 'Tribal No' refers to the foundational prohibitions, taboos, and commandments that structure a society (e.g., 'Thou shalt not kill').")
    print("These are not physical objects or sensory phenomena; they are rules based on the concept of the negative ('not').")
    print("Because the 'Tribal No' is fundamentally based on the negative, which is a product of language, it must exist in the symbolic realm.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Connect the 'Tribal No' to either Action or Motion.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("Since the 'Tribal No' is symbolic and rooted in the negative, it cannot be part of Motion.")
    print("It is a quintessential example of Action because it involves creating rules that guide human choice and define moral behavior.")
    print("These rules exist in the collective consciousness or 'imagination' of the tribe, shaping their world through symbols. Therefore, describing it as 'imaginal' is fitting in Burke's framework.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("A. Action; it is imaginal. - This aligns perfectly. The 'Tribal No' is symbolic (Action) and exists as a concept in the collective imagination.")
    print("B. Motion; it is abstract. - Contradictory. Motion is physical, not abstract.")
    print("C. Neither... - Incorrect. For Burke, this falls squarely within his definition of Action.")
    print("D. Motion; it is sensory. - Incorrect. A prohibition is a concept, not a sensory object.")
    print("E. Action; it is rational. - Less precise. While it can be rational, its origins can also be mythic or dogmatic. 'Imaginal' is a better fit for its conceptual nature.")
    print("\n")

    print("Conclusion: The 'Tribal No' is in the realm of Action because it is a symbolic construct based on the negative, existing in the collective imagination of the group.")
