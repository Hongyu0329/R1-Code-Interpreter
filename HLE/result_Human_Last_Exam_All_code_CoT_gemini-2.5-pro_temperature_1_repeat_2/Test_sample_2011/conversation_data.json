    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the problem to understand what is being asked. The goal is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n2.  I will establish a theoretical upper bound for this number. Since a clique is a subset of the graph's vertices, its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices.\n3.  Next, I will try to achieve this upper bound by proposing a specific graph construction. The simplest candidate for having many different clique sizes is the complete graph, `K_n`.\n4.  I will demonstrate that the complete graph `K_128` indeed contains cliques of every possible size from 1 to 128.\n5.  Since the constructed graph achieves the theoretical upper bound, this confirms that the maximum possible number is indeed 128.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning, explaining the steps and printing the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    in a graph on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    # Step 1: Understand the problem and establish an upper bound.\n    # A \"clique\" in a graph is a subset of its vertices where every two distinct\n    # vertices are adjacent. A clique of size k is equivalent to an induced\n    # subgraph isomorphic to the complete graph K_k.\n    # The question asks for the maximum number of different values of k\n    # for which a K_k can be found as an induced subgraph in a single graph G\n    # with n=128 vertices.\n\n    # The size of any clique, k, must be a positive integer.\n    # Also, a clique is a subset of the graph's vertices, so its size cannot\n    # be larger than the total number of vertices, n.\n    # Therefore, any possible clique size k must satisfy 1 <= k <= n.\n    # This means the set of all possible clique sizes is a subset of {1, 2, ..., n}.\n    # Consequently, the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed n.\n    upper_bound = n\n\n    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    # To do this, we need to construct a graph on n vertices that contains\n    # cliques of all sizes from 1 to n.\n    # Consider the complete graph on n vertices, K_n. In this graph, every\n    # pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n    # Let's verify the clique sizes in K_n.\n    # For any integer k where 1 <= k <= n, we can choose any subset of k vertices\n    # from the n vertices of K_n.\n    # The subgraph induced by this subset of k vertices will include all edges\n    # between them, because all possible edges exist in K_n.\n    # Thus, this induced subgraph is a complete graph of size k, or K_k.\n\n    # This proves that the graph K_n contains cliques of all sizes k = 1, 2, ..., n.\n    # The number of different clique sizes in K_n is therefore n.\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude the result.\n    # Since the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed n, and we have\n    # found a graph (K_n) that achieves exactly n different clique sizes, the\n    # maximum possible number is n.\n\n    # The final \"equation\" is simply that the maximum number of sizes is equal\n    # to the number of vertices.\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum possible number of different clique sizes in a graph on n vertices is n.\")\n    print(\"This is because the complete graph K_n contains induced subgraphs of every size from 1 to n.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"max_possible_sizes = n\")\n    print(f\"max_possible_sizes = {max_sizes}\")\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
