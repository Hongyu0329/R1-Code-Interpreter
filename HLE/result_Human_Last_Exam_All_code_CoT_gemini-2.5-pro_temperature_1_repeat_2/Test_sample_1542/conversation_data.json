    "To find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, we can use a computational approach. This method will systematically explore all possible quadratic forms and group them into equivalence classes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A quadratic form in two variables over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ can be written as $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n2.  Two forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. Such a transformation can be represented by a 2x2 matrix $P$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e., one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$). The set of all such matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  The core idea is to find a unique \"canonical\" representative for each equivalence class. We can define the canonical representative of a class as the form $(a, b, c)$ that is lexicographically smallest within that class.\n4.  The overall algorithm will be:\n    a. Generate all $8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512$ possible forms $(a,b,c)$.\n    b. Generate all invertible matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    c. For each of the 512 forms, calculate all equivalent forms by applying every invertible matrix transformation.\n    d. From this set of equivalent forms (the orbit), identify the lexicographically smallest one as the canonical representative.\n    e. Store these unique canonical representatives in a set.\n5.  The final answer is the number of elements in the set of canonical representatives.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will compute the canonical form for each of the 512 initial forms and count how many unique canonical forms exist.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
