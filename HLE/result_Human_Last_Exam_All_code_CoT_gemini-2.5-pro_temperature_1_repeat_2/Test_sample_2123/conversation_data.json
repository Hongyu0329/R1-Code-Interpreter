    "This is a classic Russian literary puzzle. The solution relies not on a direct quote from a single essay, but on a phonic and semantic pun popular in Russian intellectual circles, which combines a description of a \"wide\" street with the name of an English poet.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this puzzle:\n1.  **Identify the Key Phrase:** The core of the puzzle is the Russian description of \"wide boulevards\". The Russian word for \"wide\" is \"широкий\" (shirokiy).\n2.  **Uncover the Pun:** The solution hinges on a pun made famous by the writer Yury Olesha. He remarked on the beautiful sound of the Russian phrase for \"wide street\" (\"широкая улица\" - shirokaya ulitsa).\n3.  **Connect the Pun to the Poet:** Olesha connected the pleasing sound of the word \"широкая\" (shirokaya) to the English poet's surname **Wordsworth**.\n4.  **Explain the Pun:** The name \"Wordsworth\" can be humorously translated or \"calqued\" into Russian as \"слов стоит\" (slov stoit), which means \"[it is] worth the words\". Olesha's idea was that the very sound of the word for \"wide\" was so pleasant and evocative that it was \"worth the words\" to describe it, thus creating a link to \"Wordsworth\".\n5.  **Assemble the Answer:** The puzzle uses Vienna's boulevards as an example of something \"wide,\" which triggers this specific Russian literary association. The poet is Wordsworth.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_literary_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves a Russian literary puzzle to identify an English poet's surname.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. The puzzle's clue is \"wide boulevards\".\n    # The Russian word for \"wide\" (feminine form, as in \"wide street\") is \"широкая\" (shirokaya).\n    key_russian_word = \"широкая\"\n\n    # 2. The pun connects the English poet's name to the Russian word.\n    # The surname can be broken into two parts.\n    part1 = \"Words\"\n    part2 = \"worth\"\n\n    # In Russian, this can be humorously translated as \"слов стоит\" (slov stoit),\n    # meaning \"[it is] worth the words\".\n    pun_meaning = \"It is 'worth the words'.\"\n\n    # 3. The writer Yury Olesha connected the sound of the word \"широкая\"\n    # to this pun, considering it beautifully evocative.\n    literary_connection = \"Yury Olesha's observation\"\n\n    # 4. The final answer is the combination of the two parts.\n    final_surname = part1 + part2\n\n    print(\"Solving the puzzle step-by-step:\")\n    print(f\"1. The key clue is the description 'wide'. The Russian word for this is '{key_russian_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"2.
