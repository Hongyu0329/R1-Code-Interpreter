    # Step 1: Properties of an OAM Laser Beam
    print("Step 1: Analyze the properties of the incoming laser beam.")
    print(" - A laser imbued with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) is often called a 'vortex beam' or 'twisted light'.")
    print(" - Unlike a standard Gaussian beam with peak intensity at the center, an OAM beam has a doughnut-shaped intensity profile.")
    print(" - The intensity is zero at the center and maximal in a ring around the center.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Consequence for Proton Energy
    print("Step 2: Determine the effect on proton energy.")
    print(" - Laser-proton acceleration mechanisms (like Target Normal Sheath Acceleration) are driven by the laser's ponderomotive force, which scales with laser intensity.")
    print(" - A higher peak intensity creates a stronger electrostatic field that accelerates the protons to higher energies.")
    print(" - Since the OAM beam's energy is spread out in a ring, its peak intensity is lower than a standard beam of the same total power.")
    print(" - Final Equation Part 1: (Lower Peak Intensity) -> (Weaker Accelerating Field) -> (Proton Energy Decreases)")
    print("\n")

    # Step 3: Consequence for Proton Beam Shape/Trajectory
    print("Step 3: Determine the effect on the proton beam's trajectory.")
    print(" - The orbital angular momentum of the photons can be transferred, first to the electrons in the plasma, and then to the accelerating protons.")
    print(" - Protons that acquire this angular momentum will move in helical (corkscrew) trajectories, not straight lines.")
    print(" - A beam composed of such protons will naturally spread out or form a hollow ring structure downstream.")
    print(" - This spreading and hollowing effect is a form of Dispersion, the opposite of Collimation.")
    print(" - Final Equation Part 2: (Transfer of OAM) -> (Helical Proton Trajectory) -> (Dispersion)")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    print("="*60)
    print("Conclusion: Combining the two effects.")
    print("The proton beam experiences Dispersion and the maximum Proton Energy Decreases.")
    print("\nThis corresponds to Answer Choice C.")
