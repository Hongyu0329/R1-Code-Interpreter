    "This is a film trivia question. My plan is to identify the movie based on the specific scene described and then present that answer in the requested Python code format.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clue:** The key elements are an \"Oscar-nominated film,\" a character boarding a \"bus,\" saying \"Thank you,\" and this action \"sealing his fate.\"\n2.  **Identify the film:** This iconic scene occurs in the 1995 film *Se7en*. The antagonist, John Doe, turns himself in. When he gets on the police transport, Detective Somerset recognizes his voice from a previous phone call when he says \"Thank you,\" confirming he is the killer they've been hunting.\n3.  **Confirm Oscar nomination:** *Se7en* was nominated for one Academy Award, for Best Film Editing.\n4.  **Format the answer:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the film and a brief explanation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_film():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film based on the provided trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Se7en\"\n    character_name = \"John Doe\"\n    line_of_dialogue = \"Thank you\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"The Oscar-nominated film is '{film_title}'.\\n\"\n        f\"In the film, the antagonist, {character_name}, turns himself in to the police. \"\n        f\"As he boards the transport vehicle, he says '{line_of_dialogue}' to a police officer. \"\n        f\"Detective Somerset overhears this and recognizes the voice from a prior phone call, \"\n        f\"which seals the character's fate and sets up the film's climax.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_film()\n```\n<<<Se7en>>>"
