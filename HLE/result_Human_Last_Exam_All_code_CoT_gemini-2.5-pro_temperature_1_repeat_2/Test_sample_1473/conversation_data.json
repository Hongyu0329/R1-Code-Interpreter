    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the integral:\n\nFirst, the integrand, $(\\csc x)(\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x})$, looks quite complicated. My strategy will be to simplify this expression first. I will use trigonometric identities to show that $\\mathrm{arccsc}\\sqrt{1+\\csc^2 x}$ simplifies to a much more manageable term, $\\arctan(\\sin x)$, for the given interval of integration.\n\nAfter simplifying, the integral becomes $\\int_0^{\\pi}{\\frac{\\arctan(\\sin x)}{\\sin x}}dx$. This form is symmetric around $x=\\pi/2$, which allows me to change the integration interval to $[0, \\pi/2]$ and multiply the result by 2.\n\nThe resulting integral is still not elementary. To solve it, I will use a powerful technique called differentiation under the integral sign, also known as Feynman's trick. This involves introducing a parameter into the integral, differentiating with respect to it to get a simpler integral, solving this new integral, and then integrating the result with respect to the parameter to find the value of the original integral.\n\nFinally, I will present a Python script that walks through these mathematical steps and calculates the final numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step derivation of the value of the integral\n    I = ∫[0, π] (csc(x) * arccsc(√(1 + csc²(x)))) dx\n    and calculates its numerical value.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"We are asked to determine the value of the integral:\")\n    print(\"I = ∫[0, π] (csc(x) * arccsc(√(1 + csc²(x)))) dx\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Simplification of the integrand\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Simplify the integrand ---\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the term arccsc(√(1 + csc²(x))).\")\n    print(\"We will show that this is equal to arctan(|sin(x)|).\")\n    print(\"Let y = arctan(|sin(x)|).
