    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in Vergil's Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List the Rivers:** I will compile a list of rivers that are mentioned in the Aeneid.\n2.  **Find Their Lengths:** For each river, I will find its approximate modern length in kilometers.\n3.  **Rank the Rivers:** I will sort the rivers based on their length, from longest to shortest.\n4.  **Select the Top Three:** I will then select the top three rivers from the sorted list.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information, performs the sorting, and prints the result in a clear format, showing the name and length of each of the three longest rivers.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_longest_rivers_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    It stores a list of rivers mentioned in the text and their approximate lengths,\n    sorts them, and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # Sources for mentions: Vergil's Aeneid.\n    # Sources for length: Geographical atlases and encyclopedias.\n    river_data = {\n        'River': ['Nile', 'Danube', 'Euphrates', 'Ganges', 'Tigris', 'Rhine', 'Araxes', 'Po', 'Tiber'],\n        'Latin Name': ['Nilus', 'Ister', 'Euphrates', 'Ganges', 'Tigris', 'Rhenus', 'Araxes', 'Eridanus', 'Tiberis'],\n        'Approx. Length (km)': [6650, 2850, 2800, 2525, 1900, 1230, 1072, 652, 406]\n    }\n\n    # Create a DataFrame and sort it by length in descending order\n    df = pd.DataFrame(river_data)\n    df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='Approx.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
