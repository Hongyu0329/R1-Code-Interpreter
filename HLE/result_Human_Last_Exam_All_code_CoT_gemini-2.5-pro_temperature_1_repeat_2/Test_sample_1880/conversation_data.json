    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for analyzing quartic polynomials over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further narrows down the possible Galois groups.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots. This tells us if the Galois group is $S_4$ or a smaller group.\n5.  **Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$:** Based on the previous steps, we will be left with a choice between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). A final criterion involving the discriminant and the rational root of the resolvent cubic will distinguish between them.\n6.  **State the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these calculations step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\"1.
