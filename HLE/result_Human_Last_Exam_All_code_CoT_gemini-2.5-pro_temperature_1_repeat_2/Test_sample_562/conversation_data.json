    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the character provided by the user, which is 謄.\n2.  Next, I will look up this character in a reliable Kanji dictionary to determine its radical, or \"bushu\" (部首).\n3.  The radical for 謄 is 言.\n4.  When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it has a specific name. I will find this common name. The name is \"ごんべん\" (gonben).\n5.  Finally, I will convert the Japanese name \"ごんべん\" into its Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gonben\".\n6.  I will then write a Python script to present this answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the radical (bushu) name for the Kanji '謄'.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_character = '謄'\n    # The radical of 謄 is 言. When it is on the left side of a character (a position known as 'hen'),\n    # its common name is ごんべん (gonben).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n\n    print(f\"The bushu / radical in the Japanese character '{kanji_character}' is '{radical_name_hepburn}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
