    Analyzes the provided statements about aphid biotypes to find the incorrect one.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  From the text, we infer:
        - CA biotype is adapted to high raffinose (RFOs).
        - MA biotype is adapted to high sucrose, low raffinose.
        - Watermelon is high in raffinose.
        - Cotton is low in raffinose.
        - Galactosidase is the enzyme needed to metabolize raffinose.

    2.  Evaluating the choices:
        - A: CA is better at metabolizing RFOs than MA. This is supported by their dietary success. TRUE.
        - B: CA prefers raffinose-rich diets, MA prefers sucrose-rich diets. This is a direct conclusion from the text. TRUE.
        - C: When CA moves to cotton (low raffinose), there is less substrate for galactosidase, so enzyme activity decreases. This is a sound biological principle (substrate availability). TRUE.
        - D: When CA moves to cotton, galactosidase activity decreases. This part is correct. However, the reason given is 'higher glucose levels'. The text provides no information about glucose levels in cotton. The direct cause is the lack of raffinose (as in statement C), not a speculative claim about glucose. Therefore, the causal link in this statement is unsubstantiated. NOT TRUE.
        - E: When MA moves to watermelon (high raffinose), the presence of the substrate induces the production of the enzyme galactosidase. This is a sound biological principle (enzyme induction). TRUE.

    3.  Conclusion: Statement D is not true because the reason it provides for the effect is not supported by the given text.
