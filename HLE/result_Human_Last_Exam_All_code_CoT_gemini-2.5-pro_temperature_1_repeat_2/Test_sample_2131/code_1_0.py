# The problem asks for the value of y(0) for a membrane whose deflection y(x) is described by:
# Differential Equation: (dy/dx)⁴ + x(dy/dx) - 3y(x) = 0
# Boundary Condition: y(-1) = 0

# Step 1: Propose and test a simple solution.
# Let's test if the trivial solution, y(x) = 0, is valid.
# If y(x) = 0, then its derivative dy/dx must also be 0 for all x.

# Step 2: Verify the solution against the differential equation.
# Substitute y = 0 and dy/dx = 0 into the equation:
# (0)⁴ + x*(0) - 3*(0) = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0.
# The equation holds true for all x, so y(x) = 0 is a correct solution to the ODE.

# Step 3: Verify the solution against the boundary condition.
# The condition is y(-1) = 0.
# For our proposed solution y(x) = 0, we have y(-1) = 0, which satisfies the condition.

# Step 4: Determine y(0) from the valid solution.
# Since y(x) = 0 is a valid solution for the problem, we can use it
# to find the deflection at x = 0. For this solution, y(0) = 0.

# Step 5: Display the final calculation.
# We show the substitution into the original equation at the point of interest x=0.
x = 0
y_at_0 = 0
dy_dx_at_0 = 0

# These are the individual terms of the equation evaluated at x=0.
term1 = dy_dx_at_0 ** 4
term2 = x * dy_dx_at_0
term3 = 3 * y_at_0
result = term1 + term2 - term3
