# The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of h_k as k -> infinity.
# The value we are looking for is the limit of (ln h_k) / (ln k).
# Based on potential theory analysis of the random walk on a 2D lattice,
# the quantity h_k has the following asymptotic behavior:
# h_k is proportional to k^(-2).

# Let's represent this relationship.
# h_k = C * k^(-2) for some constant C.
# Then ln(h_k) = ln(C) - 2 * ln(k).
# We want to compute the limit of (ln h_k) / (ln k) as k -> infinity.
# lim (ln(C) - 2 * ln(k)) / ln(k)
# = lim (ln(C)/ln(k) - 2 * ln(k)/ln(k))
# = lim (ln(C)/ln(k)) - lim(2)
# As k -> infinity, ln(k) -> infinity, so ln(C)/ln(k) -> 0.
# The limit is 0 - 2 = -2.
