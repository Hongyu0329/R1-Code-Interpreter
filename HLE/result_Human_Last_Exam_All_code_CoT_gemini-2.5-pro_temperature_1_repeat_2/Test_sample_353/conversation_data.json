    "To find the stability angle $\\alpha$ for the BDF4 method, we need to analyze its stability region.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Stability Function:** The stability of a linear multistep method applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is determined by the roots of its stability polynomial. The boundary of the stability region is found by setting the roots to lie on the unit circle, $z = e^{i\\theta}$. For BDF4, the stability region is the set of $\\mu = h\\lambda$ such that the roots of $\\rho(z) - \\mu \\sigma(z) = 0$ satisfy $|z| \\leq 1$. The boundary of this region is given by the function:\n    $\\mu(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$\n    For BDF4, this simplifies to:\n    $\\mu(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$\n    Let's denote the real and imaginary parts as $x(\\theta)$ and $y(\\theta)$.\n\n2.  **Find the A($\\alpha$)-stability Angle:** The method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the wedge $S_\\alpha = \\{ \\mu \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-\\mu)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. For BDF methods, the stability region is the exterior of a lobe in the right half-plane. The largest angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangents to this lobe from the origin.\n\n3.  **Condition for Tangency:** The tangent lines from the origin to the curve $\\mu(\\theta)$ occur when the argument of $\\mu(\\theta)$ is at a maximum or minimum. This happens when the position vector $\\vec{\\mu}(\\theta) = (x(\\theta), y(\\theta))$ is parallel to its velocity vector $\\vec{\\mu}'(\\theta) = (x'(\\theta), y'(\\theta))$, which is equivalent to the condition $x(\\theta)y'(\\theta) - y(\\theta)x'(\\theta) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solve for $\\theta$:** This condition simplifies to a polynomial equation in $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. We will use Python with the `sympy` library to derive and solve this polynomial equation.\n\n5.  **Calculate $\\alpha$:**\n    *   Find the roots of the polynomial for $c$.\n    *   For each valid root $c \\in [-1, 1]$, calculate $\\theta = \\arccos(c)$.\n    *   Evaluate $\\mu(\\theta) = x(\\theta) + iy(\\theta)$ for each valid $\\theta$.\n    *   Calculate the argument $\\phi = \\arctan(y/x)$.\n    *   The maximum of these angles, $\\phi_{max}$, corresponds to the tangent line in the upper half-plane.\n    *   The stability angle is then given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{max}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the exact value of $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    It derives the polynomial equation for the tangent condition, solves it,\n    and computes the angle alpha.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
