    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that walks through the reasoning.\n\nMy plan is to use code to structure the philosophical argument.\n1.  First, I will establish the premises given in your question as initial conditions.\n2.  Next, I will provide a brief explanation of Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, which is the core principle for solving this problem.\n3.  Then, I will break down what understanding `Fa` and `∀x Fx` entails, according to this principle.\n4.  Finally, I will use a conditional check to apply the Generality Constraint to the premises and print a step-by-step logical derivation, with each step numbered, to reach the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_generality_constraint():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a philosophical question using the structure of a Python script.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

It argues that if someone can think a thought (e.g., 'a is F'), they must grasp the constituent concepts ('a', 'F') and be able to recombine them.
