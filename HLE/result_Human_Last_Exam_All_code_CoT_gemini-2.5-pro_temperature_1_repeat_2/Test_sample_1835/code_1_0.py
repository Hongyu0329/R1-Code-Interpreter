    Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint posits that thought is systematic and structured. It argues that if someone can think a thought (e.g., 'a is F'), they must grasp the constituent concepts ('a', 'F') and be able to recombine them. This means they should also be able to understand other propositions that can be formed from those constituents and other structures they understand.
