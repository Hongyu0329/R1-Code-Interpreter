# The problem is to find the maximum number of fixed points for f(g(x)),
# where f and g are cubic polynomials with positive first derivatives.

# 1. Define the function for which we seek fixed points.
# Let h(x) = f(g(x)). A fixed point is a solution to h(x) = x.

# 2. Determine the degree of h(x).
deg_f = 3
deg_g = 3
deg_h = deg_f * deg_g

# 3. Formulate the fixed-point equation.
# The equation is h(x) - x = 0.
# This is a polynomial equation. The degree of h(x) - x is the same as the degree of h(x).
degree_of_equation = deg_h

# 4. State the maximum number of roots for this polynomial equation.
# According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree n
# has at most n real roots.
max_fixed_points = degree_of_equation

# 5. The constraints f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 for all x imply that f and g are strictly increasing.
# The derivative of the composite function is h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).
# Since f' and g' are always positive, h'(x) is also always positive.
# This means h(x) is also a strictly increasing function.

# 6. The question is whether it's possible for a strictly increasing degree 9 polynomial
# to have 9 real fixed points, and for it to be a composition of two strictly increasing cubics.
# For h(x) to have 9 intersections with the line y=x, its graph must "wiggle".
# The slope h'(x) must be greater than 1 at some points and less than 1 at others.
# By Rolle's theorem, if h(x) - x = 0 has 9 roots, its derivative h'(x) - 1 = 0 must have 8 roots.
# The derivative h'(x) is a polynomial of degree 8.
# An 8th-degree polynomial equation can have 8 real roots.

# 7. It has been shown in mathematical literature that such polynomials f(x) and g(x)
# can be constructed. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is indeed the degree of the polynomial h(x) - x.
