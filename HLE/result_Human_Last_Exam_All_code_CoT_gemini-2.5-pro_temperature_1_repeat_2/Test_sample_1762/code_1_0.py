    This function determines the number of homeomorphism classes for a space X
    with the given properties.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The space X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R.
        This implies there is a continuous bijection f: R -> X.
    2.  X is given as locally compact and a metric space (which implies it is Hausdorff).
        The real line R is also locally compact and Hausdorff.
    3.  A key theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection between two
        locally compact Hausdorff spaces is a homeomorphism.
    4.  Applying this theorem, we conclude that X must be homeomorphic to R.
    5.  This means that any space X satisfying the given properties must belong to the
        same homeomorphism class as R.
    6.  We must confirm that R itself satisfies all the properties. It is a locally
        compact metric space and a continuous bijective image of itself. The separation
        property also holds for R: for any x != y, we can choose a closed interval
        K = [x - 1, (x + y) / 2] (assuming x < y) which is closed, connected,
        contains x in its interior, and does not contain y.
    7.  Therefore, since all such spaces must be homeomorphic to R, and R itself is
        such a space, there is exactly one homeomorphism class.
