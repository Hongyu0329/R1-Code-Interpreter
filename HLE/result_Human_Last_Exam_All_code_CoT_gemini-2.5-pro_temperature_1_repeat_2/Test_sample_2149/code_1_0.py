# Step 1: Assign the value for Y1 based on Clue 1.
# The clue points to Abraham Gesner's 1846 demonstration of kerosene.
Y1 = 1846

# Step 2: Assign the values for Y2, Y3, and Y4 based on Clue 2.
# The clue refers to the aphorism "A la guerre comme Ã  la guerre,"
# which corresponds to the coded phone number 1-50-50.
Y2 = 1
Y3 = 50
Y4 = 50

# Step 3: Print the final result as requested.
# The phrase "Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state indices" indicates the
# output order should be Y4, Y3, Y2, Y1.
print("The Y4 to the Y1-Hall topological state indices for the reactants in the original Heck reaction are:")
print(f"{Y4} / {Y3} / {Y2} / {Y1}")

# Final answer in the specified format.
final_answer = f"{Y4} / {Y3} / {Y2} / {Y1}"
