    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the properties of the space $X$, which is a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. It is a 2-dimensional complex manifold (a complex surface).\n2.  I will compute the Betti numbers of $X$. This can be done by first calculating its Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ using a standard formula for hypersurfaces in complex projective space. Then, using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and Poincaré duality, I can determine all the Betti numbers $b_k(X) = \\text{rank}(H_k(X, \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n3.  The rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the rational vector space $G \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is the dimension of $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\n4.  I will use results from rational homotopy theory. Smooth projective varieties are known to be \"formal\" spaces. For a simply-connected formal space, its rational homotopy groups are determined by its rational cohomology algebra.\n5.  By examining the Betti numbers of $X$ and applying the Hard Lefschetz theorem, I will deduce that the rational cohomology algebra $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by elements in degree 2.\n6.  A key result in rational homotopy theory states that if the rational cohomology of a simply-connected space is generated in degree 2, then its rational homotopy groups are concentrated in degree 2, i.e., $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$ for $k>2$.\n7.  Applying this for $k=3$, I will find that $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = 0$. This means $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group.\n8.  The rank of a torsion group is 0. This will be the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will perform the necessary calculations for the Betti numbers and then print out the reasoning to reach the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    d = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface (quintic)\n    n = 3  # Dimension of the ambient complex projective space (CP^3)\n\n    # The hypersurface X is a complex manifold of dimension n-1.\n    dim_X_complex = n - 1\n    dim_X_real = 2 * dim_X_complex\n\n    print(f\"The smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^{n} is a complex manifold of dimension {dim_X_complex}.\")\n    print(f\"Its real dimension is {dim_X_real}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X).\n    # The formula for a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n is:\n    # chi(X) = (1/d) * ((1-d)^(n+1) - 1) + (n+1)\n    term1_num = (1 - d)**(n + 1) - 1\n    term1 = term1_num / d\n    chi_X = int(term1 + (n + 1))\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: chi(X) = ( (1-d)^(n+1) - 1 ) / d + (n+1)\")\n    print(f\"Substituting d={d} and n={n}:\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = ( (1 - {d})^({n} + 1) - 1) / {d} + ({n} + 1)\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = ( ({-d+1})^{n+1} - 1) / {d} + {n+1}\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = ( {(-d+1)**(n+1)} - 1 ) / {d} + {n+1}\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = {term1_num} / {d} + {n+1}\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = {int(term1)} + {n+1} = {chi_X}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the Betti numbers b_k(X).\n    # b_k is the rank of the k-th homology group H_k(X).\n    # For a manifold of real dimension 4, chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4.\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Betti numbers b_k(X).\")\n    # b0: X is a smooth hypersurface, so it is connected.\n    b0 = 1\n    print(f\"Since X is a connected space, its 0-th Betti number is b0 = {b0}.\")\n\n    # b1: By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, pi_1(X) is isomorphic to pi_1(CP^3).\n    # Since CP^3 is simply connected, pi_1(X) = 0.\n    # The first Betti number b1 is the rank of H_1(X), which is 0.\n    b1 = 0\n    print(f\"By the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, pi_1(X) is trivial, so b1 = {b1}.\")\n\n    # b4 and b3: By Poincaré duality for a compact orientable 4-manifold, b_k = b_{4-k}.\n    b4 = b0\n    b3 = b1\n    print(f\"By Poincaré duality, b4 = b0 = {b4} and b3 = b1 = {b3}.\")\n\n    # Now we can find b2 from the Euler characteristic.\n    # chi_X = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4\n    # b2 = chi_X - b0 + b1 + b3 - b4\n    b2 = chi_X - b0 + b1 + b3 - b4\n    print(\"\\nThe Betti numbers are related by the Euler characteristic equation:\")\n    print(\"chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4\")\n    print(\"We can solve for b2:\")\n    print(\"b2 = chi(X) - b0 + b1 + b3 - b4\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {chi_X} - {b0} + {b1} + {b3} - {b4}\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {b2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Use rational homotopy theory to find the rank of pi_3(X).\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the rank of pi_3(X) using rational homotopy theory.\")\n    print(\"The rank of an abelian group G is the dimension of the rational vector space G \\u2297 Q.\")\n    print(\"Thus, rank(pi_3(X)) = dim(pi_3(X) \\u2297 Q).\")\n    print(\"\\nKey results:\")\n    print(\"1.
