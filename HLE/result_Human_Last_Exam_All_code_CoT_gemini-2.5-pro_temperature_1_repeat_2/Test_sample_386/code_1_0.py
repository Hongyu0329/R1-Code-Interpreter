The most accurate statement is C. Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Cell Source and Isolation:** To create a fibroblast cell line, one must isolate cells from the corneal stroma. This is correctly achieved by removing the outer layers (epithelium) and inner layer (endothelium), as stated in option C.

2.  **Cell Proliferation and Differentiation:** In culture, especially in the presence of serum, corneal stromal cells (keratocytes) proliferate and differentiate into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. This is a standard observation in vitro and is relevant to wound healing studies.

3.  **Culture Conditions:** A culture medium containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic is a standard and effective formulation for initiating and maintaining primary fibroblast cultures. FBS provides essential growth factors, and antibiotics prevent contamination.

4.  **Cell Adherence:** Fibroblasts are an adherent cell type, meaning they must attach to the surface of the culture flask to survive and grow. Option C correctly mentions that they adhered to the flask.

The final equation representing the key supplements in the culture medium is:
