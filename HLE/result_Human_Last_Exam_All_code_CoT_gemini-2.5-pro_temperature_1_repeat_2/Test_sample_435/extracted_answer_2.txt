Based on its role in promoting the survival and development of a potent, less-differentiated memory T cell phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to significantly increase the release of key effector cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without it.
