# plan:
# 1. Define variables for the museum, the painting, the artist, and the years.
# 2. Construct a sentence using these variables to answer the question.
# 3. Print the final sentence.

museum = "Galerie Neue Meister (part of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden)"
painting_title = "The Radionist"
artist = "Kurt GÃ¼nther"
year_created = 1927
year_acquired = 1967

# The final output sentence will combine all the information.
# I will make sure to include the numbers 1927 and 1967 in the output.
print(f"The {museum} acquired the {year_created} tempera painting \"{painting_title}\" by {artist} in {year_acquired}.")
