# The sequence of commands to construct the inscribed square.
# L: Draw a Line connecting two points.
# C: Draw a Circle with an intersection point as the center and another point defining the radius.

# Step 1: Draw a line through the initial point (A) and the center (O) to find the opposite vertex (C).
step1 = "L"

# Step 2: Draw a circle centered at A with radius AC.
step2 = "C"

# Step 3: Draw a circle centered at C with radius CA. These two circles intersect at two new points (P, Q).
step3 = "C"

# Step 4: Draw a line through P and Q. This line intersects the original circle at the two remaining vertices (B, D).
step4 = "L"

# The complete, shortest sequence of commands.
construction_sequence = step1 + step2 + step3 + step4
