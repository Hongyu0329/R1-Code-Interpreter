# Step 1: Define example values that satisfy the condition P < AVC < ATC.
# Let's assume the firm is producing 20 units.
q1 = 20

# Let's set the prices/costs per unit.
# P is the market price.
P = 10
# AVC is the average variable cost.
AVC = 15
# ATC is the average total cost.
ATC = 20

# These values satisfy the condition P < AVC < ATC (10 < 15 < 20).

# Step 2: Calculate the areas S, T, and H based on their definitions.
# S = P * q1 (Represents Total Revenue)
S = P * q1

# T = AVC * q1 (Represents Total Variable Cost)
T = AVC * q1

# H = ATC * q1 (Represents Total Cost)
H = ATC * q1

# Step 3: Calculate the firm's profit or loss.
# Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
# Total Revenue is represented by area S.
# Total Cost is represented by area H.
profit_or_loss = S - H

# Step 4: Print the result and the formula.
# The question asks for the area that represents the firm's profit or loss.
# The formula is S - H.
print("Economic Definitions:")
print(f"Total Revenue (TR) = Price * Quantity = {P} * {q1} = {S}")
print(f"Total Cost (TC) = Average Total Cost * Quantity = {ATC} * {q1} = {H}")
print("\nThe area representing the firm's profit is calculated as Total Revenue - Total Cost.")
print("In terms of the defined areas, this is S - H.")
print("\nFinal Calculation:")
# We output the final equation showing the formula and the numbers.
print(f"Profit = S - H = {S} - {H} = {profit_or_loss}")

# Since the result is negative, this represents a loss of {-profit_or_loss}.
# The area representing the magnitude of the loss is H - S.
loss_magnitude = H - S
print(f"The magnitude of the loss is H - S = {H} - {S} = {loss_magnitude}")
