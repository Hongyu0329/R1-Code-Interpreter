    """
    This function calculates the exponent alpha based on the properties of the group SO_3(R).

    The problem is to find the real number alpha such that n(N) is closest to N^alpha, where n(N)
    is the smallest integer n for which X^n = G for any compact set X in G = SO_3(R)
    with Haar measure mu(X) = 1/N.

    The solution relies on a key result from geometric group theory: for a compact, connected,
    simple Lie group G of dimension d, the number of products n required for a set of measure epsilon
    to cover the group scales as n ~ epsilon^(-1/d).

    In our case:
    - The group G is SO_3(R).
    - The measure of the set is epsilon = 1/N.

    # Step 1: Determine the dimension 'd' of the group G = SO_3(R).
    # SO_3(R) is the group of rotations in 3-dimensional space.
    # A rotation can be uniquely specified by 3 parameters (e.g., Euler angles, or an axis-angle representation).
    # Therefore, the dimension of SO_3(R) is 3.

    # Step 2: The exponent alpha is the reciprocal of the dimension of the group.
    # The relation is n(N) ~ (mu(X))^(-1/d) = (1/N)^(-1/d) = N^(1/d).
