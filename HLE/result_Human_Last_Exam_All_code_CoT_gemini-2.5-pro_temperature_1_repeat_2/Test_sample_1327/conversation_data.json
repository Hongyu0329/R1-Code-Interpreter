    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence**: The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Find the relationship between consecutive terms**: Let's denote the terms as `x_1, x_2, x_3, ...`.\n    *   `x_1 = 2`\n    *   `x_2 = 11`\n    *   `x_3 = 23`\n    *   `x_4 = 51`\n    *   `x_5 = 119`\n3.  **Test for simple patterns**:\n    *   Arithmetic difference: 11-2=9, 23-11=12, 51-23=28. No simple pattern.\n    *   Multiplication: 11/2=5.5, 23/11â‰ˆ2.09. No simple pattern.\n4.  **Test for a combined pattern**: Let's try a pattern of the form `x_n = a * x_{n-1} + b`. A common choice is `a=2` or `a=3`.\n    *   Let's try `x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - S_n` (where `S_n` is some number to be subtracted).\n    *   For `x_3 = 23`: `3 * x_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we subtract 10. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`.\n    *   For `x_4 = 51`: `3 * x_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we subtract 18. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`.\n    *   For `x_5 = 119`: `3 * x_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we subtract 34. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`.\n5.  **Analyze the subtraction sequence**: The numbers we subtract are 10, 18, 34. Let's call this sequence `S`.\n    *   Find the differences within the sequence `S`:\n    *   `18 - 10 = 8`\n    *   `34 - 18 = 16`\n6.  **Identify the pattern in the differences**: The differences are 8 and 16. This is a geometric progression where each term is twice the previous one (8, 16, 32, ...).\n7.  **Predict the next term**:\n    *   The next difference in sequence `S` will be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   The next number to be subtracted (`S_next`) will be `34 + 32 = 66`.\n8.  **Calculate the next term in the original sequence**:\n    *   The rule is `x_6 = 3 * x_5 - S_next`.\n    *   `x_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`\n    *   `x_6 = 357 - 66`\n    *   `x_6 = 291`\n\nThe next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-level pattern.\n    1. It establishes a primary relationship: x_n = 3 * x_{n-1} - S_n.\n    2. It finds the sequence of subtractions, S_n = [10, 18, 34, ...].\n    3. It identifies that the differences in S_n are a geometric progression (8, 16, ...).\n    4. It predicts the next subtraction term and calculates the final term in the original sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # The last known term\n    last_term = sequence[-1]\n\n    # Calculate the sequence of subtracted numbers (S_n)\n    # S_3 = 3 * 11 - 23 = 10\n    # S_4 = 3 * 23 - 51 = 18\n    # S_5 = 3 * 51 - 119 = 34\n    subtractions = [3 * sequence[i-1] - sequence[i] for i in range(2, len(sequence))]\n\n    # The last calculated subtraction\n    last_subtraction = subtractions[-1]\n\n    # Calculate the differences in the subtraction sequence\n    # diff_1 = 18 - 10 = 8\n    # diff_2 = 34 - 18 = 16\n    differences = [subtractions[i] - subtractions[i-1] for i in range(1, len(subtractions))]\n    \n    # The last calculated difference\n    last_difference = differences[-1]\n\n    # The pattern in the differences is that they double each time.\n    # So the next difference is 16 * 2 = 32.\n    next_difference = last_difference * 2\n\n    # The next subtraction number is the last one plus the next difference.\n    # 34 + 32 = 66\n    next_subtraction = last_subtraction + next_difference\n\n    # The next term in the main sequence is 3 * the last term - the next subtraction number.\n    # 3 * 119 - 66\n    next_term = 3 * last_term - next_subtraction\n\n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"The pattern is x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) - S_n, where the differences in S_n double.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of subtractions is {subtractions}, and the next subtraction is {next_subtraction}.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"3 * {last_term} - {next_subtraction} = {next_term}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
