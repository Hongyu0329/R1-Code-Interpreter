    "To find the shortest mating sequence for Black, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Set up the board**: I will use the `python-chess` library to parse the given PGN (Portable Game Notation) and recreate the exact board state at the end of the 34th move.\n2.  **Analyze the position**: It is Black's turn to move. The White King is on g5, which is a very exposed and unusual position, suggesting a tactical sequence is likely.\n3.  **Implement a search algorithm**: I will implement a recursive, depth-first search algorithm that looks for a forced checkmate. This algorithm works as follows:\n    *   It starts by looking for a mate in 1 move for Black.\n    *   If none is found, it searches for a mate in 2 moves. This means finding a move for Black such that for *all* possible replies by White, Black can deliver checkmate on the next move.\n    *   This process continues, increasing the search depth, until the shortest possible forced mate is found.\n4.  **Format the output**: Once the sequence of moves is found by the algorithm, I will convert the moves into Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) and print them in the requested format (a comma-separated list of moves for both players).\n\nThis systematic search guarantees that the first solution found will be the shortest one possible.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport chess.pgn\nimport io\n\ndef find_mating_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the shortest mating sequence from a given chess position.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The PGN string of the game leading to the position.\n    pgn_string = \"\"\"\n    1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
