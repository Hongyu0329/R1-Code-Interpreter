    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a common chemical brain teaser. The name suggests a molecule that combines the shape of the Mercedes-Benz logo (a three-pointed star) with the structure of benzene.\n\nThe most common interpretation is 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene. This molecule has a central benzene ring with three other benzene rings (as phenyl groups) attached to it, resembling the logo.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the number of carbon atoms:\n1.  A benzene ring contains 6 carbon atoms.\n2.  The central ring contributes 6 carbons.\n3.  There are 3 substituent phenyl groups (which are also derived from benzene), each contributing 6 carbons.\n4.  The total number of carbons is the sum of the carbons in the central ring and the three substituent rings.\n\nThis can be calculated as: `1 * 6 + 3 * 6`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.\n# This molecule consists of a central benzene ring and three substituent phenyl groups.\n\n# Number of carbons in a single benzene ring or phenyl group\ncarbons_per_ring = 6\n\n# Number of central benzene rings\nnum_central_rings = 1\n\n# Number of substituent phenyl groups (resembling the 3-pointed star)\nnum_substituent_rings = 3\n\n# Calculate the total number of carbon atoms\ntotal_carbons = (num_central_rings * carbons_per_ring) + (num_substituent_rings * carbons_per_ring)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The molecule 'mercedesbenzene' is interpreted as a central benzene ring with 3 attached phenyl groups.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: ({num_central_rings} central ring * {carbons_per_ring} carbons) + ({num_substituent_rings} substituent rings * {carbons_per_ring} carbons)\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {num_central_rings} * {carbons_per_ring} + {num_substituent_rings} * {carbons_per_ring} = {total_carbons}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of carbons: {total_carbons}\")\n\n```\n<<<24>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
