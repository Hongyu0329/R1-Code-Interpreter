# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" is interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.
# This molecule consists of a central benzene ring and three substituent phenyl groups.

# Number of carbons in a single benzene ring or phenyl group
carbons_per_ring = 6

# Number of central benzene rings
num_central_rings = 1

# Number of substituent phenyl groups (resembling the 3-pointed star)
num_substituent_rings = 3

# Calculate the total number of carbon atoms
total_carbons = (num_central_rings * carbons_per_ring) + (num_substituent_rings * carbons_per_ring)

# Print the explanation and the final equation
