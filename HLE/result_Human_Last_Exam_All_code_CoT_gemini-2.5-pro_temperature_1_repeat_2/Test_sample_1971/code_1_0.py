# This script provides the solution for the parameters alpha^2 and beta
# based on the principles of local supersymmetry in SUGRA as described in the problem.

# Part 1: Determination of beta
# The parameter beta is found by requiring that all terms linear in the auxiliary field S
# in the supersymmetry variation of the super-cosmological constant Lagrangian (L_cos) cancel out.
# Based on the provided transformation rules, this cancellation condition leads to the
# following algebraic equation for beta:
# 1/4 + 1 * beta = 0
# This equation arises from summing the S-linear terms from the variation of S and the variation of the gravitino fields.

beta_numerator = -1
beta_denominator = 4
beta = beta_numerator / beta_denominator

print("The equation for beta, derived from the cancellation of S-linear terms in delta L_cos, is:")
print("1/4 + beta = 0")
print("The numbers in this equation are 1 and 4 for the fraction, and 1 for the coefficient of beta.")
print(f"Solving for beta yields: beta = {beta_numerator}/{beta_denominator}")
print(f"So, the value of beta is: {beta}")

# Part 2: Determination of alpha^2
# The expression for alpha^2 is found by analyzing the bosonic sector of the theory in the vacuum.
# The bosonic part of the Lagrangian is L_bosonic = -e/(2*kappa^2)*R - e/3*S^2 + alpha*e*S.
# The equation of motion for S gives its vacuum expectation value: S_0 = (3 * alpha) / 2.
# Substituting S_0 back into the Lagrangian results in an effective cosmological constant, which corresponds
# to an Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. For such a spacetime, the Ricci scalar R is related to alpha by the
# Einstein field equations.

# The resulting relation is:
# -R = 3 * kappa^2 * alpha^2
