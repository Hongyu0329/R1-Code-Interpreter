    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.
    
    A mutualist is an organism in a relationship where both species benefit.
    In this context, mutualists are the adult insects that act as pollinators or defenders.
    
    - Adults 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 are pollinators (bees, wasps, butterflies).
    - Adult 3 (ant) is a defender that feeds on nectar.
    - All larvae are either herbivores (antagonists) or do not interact with the plant.
