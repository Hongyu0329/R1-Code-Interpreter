    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this geographical riddle, followed by the code to reveal the answer.\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle:** I'll break down the user's question into a set of distinct clues:\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Isolation:** More than 500 kilometers from the next inhabited island. This points to extreme remoteness.\n    *   **Geography:** The town is situated on a bay which was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   **Nomenclature:** The town, the bay, and the caldera all share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:** I will assess famous remote islands against these clues.\n    *   **Easter Island:** The main town is Hanga Roa, on Hanga Roa bay. While extremely isolated, the bay itself is not a volcanic caldera. The island's main caldera, Rano Kau, is elsewhere. This doesn't fit.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** This is the most remote inhabited archipelago. The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. The names of the town and key geographical features do not match up as required by the riddle. This doesn't fit.\n\n3.  **Identify the Best Fit:** I will search for a location that matches the very specific geographical and naming requirements.\n    *   The town of **Taioha'e**, on the island of Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), is a near-perfect match for the geography.\n    *   The town is named **Taioha'e**.\n    *   It sits on **Taioha'e Bay**.\n    *   Geologists confirm that Taioha'e Bay is a flooded **volcanic caldera**.\n    *   This perfectly matches clues #1, #3, and #4.\n\n4.  **Address the Ambiguity:** The isolation clue (#2) is the only point of contention. The Marquesas archipelago as a whole is incredibly remote (over 1,300 km from Tahiti). However, Nuku Hiva is relatively close (approx. 50 km) to another inhabited island *within* the Marquesas, Ua Pou. Given that no other place on Earth fits the unique geographical and naming clues so perfectly, it's highly probable that **Taioha'e** is the intended answer, with the riddle's author considering the isolation of the entire archipelago.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script that outlines these clues and prints the final answer, fulfilling the request to solve the task using code.\n\n```python\ndef solve_geographical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves a geographical riddle based on a set of clues.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Clues from the riddle ---\n    # 1. An island town.\n    # 2. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    # 3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    # 4. The town, bay, and caldera share the same name.\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    # The town of Taioha'e, on Nuku Hiva in French Polynesia, fits the clues best.\n    # - Town: Taioha'e\n    # - Bay: Taioha'e Bay\n    # - Bay Type: Flooded volcanic caldera\n    # This matches the geographical and naming clues perfectly.\n    # The isolation clue is ambiguous. While the Marquesas archipelago is extremely\n    # remote, Nuku Hiva is near other inhabited islands within its group.\n    # However, no other location on Earth matches the other specific clues.\n\n    the_answer = \"Taioha'e\"\n\n    print(f\"The island town that sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing its name is: {the_answer}\")\n\nsolve_geographical_riddle()\n```\n<<<Taioha'e>>>"
