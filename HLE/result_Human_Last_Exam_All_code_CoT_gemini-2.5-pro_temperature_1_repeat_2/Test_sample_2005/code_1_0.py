print("Step 1: Analyze the move")
print("A single move changes two coordinates by +/- 1. This means every move consists of exactly two elementary changes (+1 or -1).")
print("Therefore, if 'k' is the total number of moves, the total number of elementary changes is 2*k.\n")

print("Step 2: Analyze the required change per coordinate")
print(f"Each of the {D} coordinates must change from 0 to 2. This is a net change of +2 (mod 3).")
print("The most efficient ways to achieve this are:")
print("  - Strategy 1: One '-1' change (0 - 1 = 2 mod 3). This costs 1 elementary change.")
print("  - Strategy 2: Two '+1' changes (0 + 1 + 1 = 2 mod 3). This costs 2 elementary changes.\n")

print("Step 3: Formulate the minimization problem")
print("To minimize moves 'k', we must minimize the total elementary changes '2*k'.")
print("Let 'm' be the number of coordinates changed using the efficient 1-step strategy.")

print(f"The total number of elementary changes ({2*D} - m) must equal 2*k, which is an even number.")
print(f"Since {2*D} is even, 'm' must also be an even number.\n")

print("Step 5: Solve for the minimum moves")
print("The number of moves is k = (Total elementary changes) / 2.")
print(f"So, k = ({2*D} - m) / 2.")
print("To minimize 'k', we must maximize 'm'.")

print("The minimum number of moves 'k' is calculated as follows:")
