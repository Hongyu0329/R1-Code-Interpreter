    "The problem asks for the Hopf charge of a given 3D vector field. The Hopf charge, an integer topological invariant, can be understood as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points in the target space of the field. For the given field `n=(nx,ny,nz)`, which maps from `R^3` to the unit sphere `S^2`, we can calculate the Hopf charge by finding the preimages of two such points and determining their linking number.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Choose two points**: We will select two convenient points on the sphere `S^2`, for example, the South Pole `p1 = (0, 0, -1)` and a point on the equator `p2 = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  **Find the preimage of p1**: We will solve the equations `(nx, ny, nz) = p1` to find the set of points in `R^3` that map to the South Pole. This set forms a curve, let's call it `C1`.\n3.  **Find the preimage of p2**: Similarly, we will solve `(nx, ny, nz) = p2` to find the curve `C2`.\n4.  **Determine the linking number**: The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C1, C2)`. We can determine this by analyzing how the two curves are situated relative to each other in 3D space. For this specific field, it can be shown that `C1` is a circle in the `xy`-plane and `C2` is a closed loop in the `xz`-plane that passes through the disk bounded by `C1` exactly once. This indicates a linking number of 1.\n\nThe following Python code implements this reasoning, calculating the parameters of the curves `C1` and `C2` and concluding that their linking number, and thus the Hopf charge, is 1.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by analyzing\n    the linking number of the preimages of two points on the sphere S^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The Hopf charge H is the linking number Lk(C1, C2) of the preimages\")\n    print(\"of two distinct points on the target sphere S^2.\\n\")\n\n    # We choose two points on S^2:\n    # p1 = (0, 0, -1) (South Pole)\n    # p2 = (1, 0, 0)  (A point on the equator)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the preimage C1 of the South Pole p1 ---\n    # The condition n_z = cos(G) = -1 implies G = PI.\n    # The field G is defined as G = PI * exp(-10 * r2).\n    # Setting G = PI gives exp(-10 * r2) = 1, which means r2 = 0.\n    # The term r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)^2 + z*z).\n    # For r2 to be 0, both terms under the square root must be zero:\n    # z = 0 and x*x+y*y-0.5 = 0.\n    # This defines the curve C1.\n    c1_radius_sq = 0.5\n    c1_z = 0.0\n    print(\"Curve C1 (preimage of the South Pole):\")\n    print(f\"  Equation: x^2 + y^2 = {c1_radius_sq}, z = {c1_z}\")\n    print(f\"  This is a circle in the xy-plane with radius {math.sqrt(c1_radius_sq):.4f}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Find the preimage C2 of the equatorial point p2 ---\n    # The condition for p2 = (1,0,0) is:\n    # n_z = cos(G) = 0  => G = PI/2\n    # n_x = sin(G)*cos(f) = 1*cos(f) = 1 => f = 0\n    # n_y = sin(G)*sin(f) = 1*sin(f) = 0 => f = 0\n    # The condition f = atan2(y,x) = 0 implies y=0 and x>0.\n    # The condition G = PI/2 implies PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI/2.\n    # This simplifies to exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5, or r2 = ln(2) / 10.\n    C = math.log(2) / 10.0\n    # The equation for C2 is r2^2 = C^2, with y=0 and x>0:\n    # (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = C^2\n    print(\"Curve C2 (preimage of the point (1,0,0)):\")\n    print(f\"  Equation: (x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = {C**2:.6f}, with y=0 and x>0\")\n    print(\"  This is a closed loop in the xz-plane.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Determine the linking number of C1 and C2 ---\n    # C1 is a circle in the xy-plane.
