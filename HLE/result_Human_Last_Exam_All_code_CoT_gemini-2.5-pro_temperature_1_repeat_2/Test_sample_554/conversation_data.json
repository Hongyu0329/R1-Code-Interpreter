    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we can follow a logical chemical substitution process.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Molecule:** We'll start with a representative \"nanocar\" molecule. A well-known, albeit simplified, model for a nanocar has the chemical formula C38H44.\n2.  **Understand the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:** In chemical nomenclature, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all the hydrogen (H) atoms attached to the carbon skeleton of the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Apply the Substitution:** We will replace every hydrogen atom in the C38H44 formula with a fluorine atom. This means the 44 hydrogen atoms will be replaced by 44 fluorine atoms.\n4.  **State the Final Count:** The resulting formula will be C38F44, and the script will simply output the number of fluorine atoms.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this logic.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoro_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the original nanocar molecule.\n    original_formula = \"C38H44\"\n    carbon_atoms = 38\n    hydrogen_atoms = 44\n\n    print(f\"The chemical formula for a representative nanocar is {original_formula}.\")\n    print(f\"This molecule has {hydrogen_atoms} hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the 'perfluoro-' substitution.\n    print(\"The prefix 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms will equal the original number of hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform the substitution and state the new formula.\n    fluorine_atoms = hydrogen_atoms\n    new_formula = f\"C{carbon_atoms}F{fluorine_atoms}\"\n\n    # Step 4: Output the final equation and count.\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = Number of Hydrogen atoms\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = {hydrogen_atoms}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The resulting chemical formula for a perfluoronanocar is {new_formula}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of fluorine atoms it would contain is {fluorine_atoms}.\")\n\ncalculate_perfluoro_atoms()\n```\n<<<44>>>"
