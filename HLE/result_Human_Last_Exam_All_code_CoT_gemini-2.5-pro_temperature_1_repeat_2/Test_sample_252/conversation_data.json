    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This technique aims to reconstruct a three-dimensional data cube (two spatial dimensions x, y, and one spectral dimension λ) from a single two-dimensional image captured by a sensor.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **The Goal:** The objective is to capture a full \"spectral volume\" from a single image. A spectral volume, in this context, is a 3D data cube represented as `f(x, y, λ)`, where (x, y) are spatial coordinates and λ is the wavelength.\n2.  **The Tool:** The measurement is made on a 2D sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera). To get spectral information, we use diffraction gratings, which disperse light according to its wavelength.\n3.  **Case 1: One Diffraction Grating.** If we place a single one-dimensional (1D) diffraction grating in the optical path, it will disperse the light along one axis. For instance, a horizontally oriented grating will smear each point of the image `(x, y)` into a horizontal line, where the position along that line depends on the wavelength `λ`. The 2D sensor records an image `I(x', y)`, where the `x'` coordinate is a mixture of the original spatial coordinate `x` and the wavelength `λ`. This creates a fundamental ambiguity; you cannot tell if a feature in the recorded image is due to a spatial feature or a spectral feature. This is an underdetermined problem, and you cannot uniquely reconstruct the `(x, y, λ)` cube from this single multiplexed image. It's like having only one projection in a CT scan; you can't reconstruct the 3D object.\n4.  **Case 2: Two Diffraction Gratings.** Now, consider using two 1D gratings, oriented orthogonally (at 90 degrees to each other). This is often fabricated as a single optical element known as a 2D cross-grating. This element creates a 2D pattern of diffraction orders on the sensor. For example, it produces a central, undispersed 0th-order image, along with multiple dispersed images (1st order, 2nd order, etc.) in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. Each of these dispersed images can be treated as a different \"projection\" of the original `(x, y, λ)` data cube, viewed from a different angle in a conceptual \"spectral-spatial space\".\n5.  **Computed Tomography Analogy:** Having multiple, distinct projections is the key requirement for any computed tomography algorithm. With the set of projections generated by the two orthogonal gratings, it becomes possible to solve the inverse problem and computationally reconstruct the original `(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n6.  **Conclusion:** While one grating is insufficient, two orthogonal gratings are sufficient to provide the minimum necessary information (multiple projections) for tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, the minimum number of gratings required is 2.\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings\n    needed for computed tomography imaging spectrometry from a single image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is to reconstruct a 3D data cube (x, y, lambda)\n    # from a single 2D image.
