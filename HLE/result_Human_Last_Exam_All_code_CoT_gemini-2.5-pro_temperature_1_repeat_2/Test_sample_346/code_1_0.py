# The SKI combinator expression represents a Church integer 'n'.
# Our step-by-step analysis shows that the expression boils down to a series
# of nested exponentiations.

# 1. The base of the exponentiation comes from the innermost part of the expression:
#    K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))) -> K(succ(1)) -> K(2)
#    The application `K(2)(3)` reduces to `2`. This is our base number.
base_number = 2

# 2. The exponent is the Church numeral that gets applied repeatedly.
#    S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))) -> succ(2) -> 3
#    So, the exponent is 3.
exponent = 3

# 3. The number of exponentiation operations is determined by the number of S(I)
#    wrappers plus the final application.
#    The expression is of the form B(A(B)), where A contains three S(I) applications.
#    This leads to four nested applications of the number 3.
num_applications = 4

    # In Church arithmetic, m(n) is n^m.
    n = n ** exponent
    print(f"Step {i+1}: ({n_before})^{exponent} = {n}")

# 5. The final value n is 2^(3*4) = 2^81.
#    log_2(n) = log_2(2^81) = 81.
