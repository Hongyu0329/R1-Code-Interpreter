    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached as time $t$ approaches infinity, at which point the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. We denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nWhen the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This simplifies the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  Set the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero to obtain the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_i$.\n2.  Solve these equations to express $p_0, p_2, \\text{and } p_3$ as multiples of $p_1$.\n3.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization condition $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$ to determine the value of $p_1$.\n4.  Once $p_1$ is known, calculate $p_0$.\n5.  Finally, compute the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps and display the final calculation, including the numerical values used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the steady-state probabilities and calculates P0 + P1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Set up the steady-state equations by setting derivatives to zero.\")\n    print(\"The system of linear equations is:\")\n    print(f\"0 = -{lambda_01}*p0 + {lambda_10}*p1  (1)\")\n    print(f\"0 = {lambda_12}*p1 - ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})*p2  (2)\")\n    print(f\"0 = {lambda_23}*p2 - {lambda_31}*p3  (3)\")\n    print(\"p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1  (4)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Solve for p0, p2, p3 in terms of p1.\")\n    # From equation (2)\n    l21_plus_l23 = lambda_21 + lambda_23\n    print(f\"From (2): {lambda_12}*p1 = ({lambda_21} + {lambda_23})*p2 = {l21_plus_l23}*p2\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to {lambda_12}*p1 = {l21_plus_l23}*p2, which means p2 = ({lambda_12}/{l21_plus_l23}) * p1 = {lambda_12/l21_plus_l23} * p1.\")\n    print(\"So, p2 = p1.\")\n    \n    # From equation (3)\n    print(f\"From (3): {lambda_23}*p2 = {lambda_31}*p3\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to p3 = ({lambda_23}/{lambda_31}) * p2 = {lambda_23/lambda_31} * p2.\")\n    print(\"Since p2 = p1, we have p3 = p1.\")\n\n    # From equation (1)\n    print(f\"From (1): {lambda_01}*p0 = {lambda_10}*p1\")\n    coeff_p0_p1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n    print(f\"This means p0 = ({lambda_10}/{lambda_01}) * p1 = {coeff_p0_p1:.4f} * p1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Substitute these into the normalization equation (4).\")\n    print(\"p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\")\n    print(f\"({lambda_10}/{lambda_01})*p1 + p1 + p1 + p1 = 1\")\n    print(f\"(({lambda_10}/{lambda_01}) + 3) * p1 = 1\")\n    \n    denominator_p1 = coeff_p0_p1 + 3\n    p1 = 1 / denominator_p1\n    print(f\"p1 = 1 / ({coeff_p0_p1:.4f} + 3) = {p1:.4f}\")\n    \n    p0 = coeff_p0_p1 * p1\n    print(f\"p0 = {coeff_p0_p1:.4f} * {p1:.4f} = {p0:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the final sum p0 + p1.\")\n    result = p0 + p1\n    \n    # Final equation using the numbers\n    num = lambda_10 + lambda_01\n    den = lambda_10 + 3 * lambda_01\n    print(\"The final calculation is expressed as:\")\n    print(f\"p0 + p1 = ({lambda_10} + {lambda_01}) / ({lambda_10} + 3 * {lambda_01})\")\n    print(f\"p0 + p1 = {num} / {den}\")\n    print(f\"p0 + p1 = {result}\")\n\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_answer = solve_steady_state_probabilities()\n    # The final answer is directly printed in the function.\n    # The submission format requires <<<answer>>> at the end.\n    # print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_steady_state_probabilities()\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
