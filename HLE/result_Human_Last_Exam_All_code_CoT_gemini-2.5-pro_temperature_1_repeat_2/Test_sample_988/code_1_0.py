    # Step 1: Understand the stressor. High temperature (29ºC) induces oxidative stress,
    # leading to an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).
    stressor = "High temperature (29ºC)"
    effect = "Increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)"

    # Step 2: Consider the timing. The question asks for the *initial* response.
    # An initial response needs to be rapid.
    timing = "Initial / Rapid"

    # Step 3: Evaluate the mechanism. The term "activated" suggests an increase in
    # functional activity. In biology, enzyme activity is rapidly regulated to
    # respond to changing conditions.
    action = "Activation"

    # Step 4: Analyze the options.
    # A. Liposoluble antioxidants (e.g., Vitamin E) - A pool of molecules, not typically "activated".
    # B. Hydrosoluble antioxidants (e.g., Vitamin C) - A pool of molecules, consumed during reaction.
    # C. Enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., SOD, CAT) - Enzymes whose catalytic activity is quickly increased. This fits "activation".
    # D. Photosynthetic pigments - Primary role is photosynthesis; can be damaged by stress.
    # E. UV-protective compounds - Specialized for UV stress, not thermal stress.

    # Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis. The first line of defense against a surge in ROS
    # is the rapid increase in the activity of detoxifying enzymes.
    conclusion = "Enzymatic antioxidants (like SOD and CAT) are the first line of defense to be 'activated' to neutralize the sudden increase in ROS."
