    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given parametric curve, we first need to determine the maximum extent of the curve in the x and y directions. This will give us the dimensions of the smallest bounding rectangle for the figure. The side length of the smallest enclosing square will then be the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the curve:** For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. We will find the minimum and maximum values of x and y in this interval. This corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle.\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the curve:** For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. We will find the minimum and maximum values of x and y in this interval. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse.\n3.  **Determine the overall bounding box:** By combining the ranges from both parts, we'll find the overall $x_{min}, x_{max}, y_{min}, y_{max}$ for the entire figure.\n4.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:** The width will be $x_{max} - x_{min}$ and the height will be $y_{max} - y_{min}$.\n5.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** This will be the maximum of the width and height of the bounding box.\n6.  **Calculate the area of the square:** The area is the square of its side length.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the ranges for x and y for both parts of the curve.\n    # For t in [0, pi]: x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\n    # Range of cos(t) for t in [0, pi] is [-1, 1]\n    x_min_1 = -1\n    x_max_1 = 1\n    # Range of sin(t) for t in [0, pi] is [0, 1]\n    y_min_1 = 0\n    y_max_1 = 1\n\n    # For t in (pi, 2*pi): x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\n    # Range of cos(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi) is [-1, 1]\n    x_min_2 = -1\n    x_max_2 = 1\n    # Range of 5*sin(t) for t in (pi, 2*pi) is [-5, 0]\n    y_min_2 = -5\n    y_max_2 = 0\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the curve in two parts:\")\n    print(f\"Part 1 (t in [0, pi]): x range is [{x_min_1}, {x_max_1}], y range is [{y_min_1}, {y_max_1}]\")\n    print(f\"Part 2 (t in (pi, 2*pi)): x range is [{x_min_2}, {x_max_2}], y range is [{y_min_2}, {y_max_2}]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the overall bounding box for the entire figure.\n    x_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\n    x_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\n    y_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\n    y_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n\n    print(\"Overall bounding box of the figure:\")\n    print(f\"Overall x range: [{x_min}, {x_max}]\")\n    print(f\"Overall y range: [{y_min}, {y_max}]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n\n    print(\"Dimensions of the bounding box:\")\n    print(f\"Width = {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\n    print(f\"Height = {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    print(\"Determining the side length of the smallest enclosing square:\")\n    print(f\"Side length = max(Width, Height) = max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the area of the square.\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    print(\"Calculating the final area:\")\n    print(f\"Area = Side Length * Side Length = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_area()\n```\n<<<36>>>"
