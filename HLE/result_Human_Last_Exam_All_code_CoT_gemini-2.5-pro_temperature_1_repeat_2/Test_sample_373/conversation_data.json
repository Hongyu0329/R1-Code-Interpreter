    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the specified barbell graph and the mechanics of the uniform gossiping algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (`K_5`), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:** We need to find the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Let's call the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge `u` and `v`.\n    *   Node `u` is part of one `K_5` clique. Within this clique, it is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   Additionally, node `u` is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of node `u` is `4 (from clique) + 1 (from bottleneck) = 5`.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of node `v` is also 5.\n3.  **Understand Uniform Gossiping:** In randomized uniform gossiping, an edge is sampled by first selecting a node `i` uniformly at random from the `N` total nodes (with probability `1/N`), and then selecting one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random (with probability `1/degree(i)`).\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   By first picking node `u` and then its neighbor `v`.\n    *   By first picking node `v` and then its neighbor `u`.\n    *   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events: `P(sample (u,v)) = P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)`.\n    *   This translates to the formula: `P(u, v) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(v))`.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Determine the degree of the nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    # A node in a K_m clique is connected to (m-1) other nodes in the clique.\n    # The bottleneck edge adds 1 more connection to these specific nodes.\n    # So, degree = (m - 1) + 1 = m.\n    degree_bottleneck_node = m\n\n    # 3. Calculate the probability using the uniform gossiping formula.\n    # P(u, v) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(v))\n    # where N is the total number of nodes, and u and v are the bottleneck nodes.\n    prob = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node) + \\\n           (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n    # 4.
