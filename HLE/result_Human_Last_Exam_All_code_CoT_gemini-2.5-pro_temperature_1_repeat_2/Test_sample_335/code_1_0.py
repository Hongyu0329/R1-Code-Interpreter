# Step 1: Define the simplicial volumes of the components based on known topological results.

# V1 is the simplicial volume of the complement of K1 = C_{4,3}(Conway).
# V1 = ||S^3 \ Conway|| + ||Complement of T_{4,3} in solid torus||
# The Conway knot is slice, so its simplicial volume is 0.
v_conway_complement = 0
# The complement of a torus knot in a solid torus is a Seifert-fibered space, so its simplicial volume is 0.
v_torus_pattern_complement = 0
V1 = v_conway_complement + v_torus_pattern_complement

# V2 is the simplicial volume of the complement of K2 = Wh_-^2(Eight).
# V2 = ||S^3 \ Eight|| + ||Complement of the Whitehead link with -2 twists||
# The simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement is exactly 2.
v_eight_complement = 2
# The simplicial volume of the complement of the Whitehead link with -2 twists is also 2.
v_whitehead_link_complement = 2
V2 = v_eight_complement + v_whitehead_link_complement

# Step 2: Calculate the total simplicial volume V.
V = V1 + V2

# Step 3: Compute the final requested value, floor(10^6 * V).
factor = 10**6
final_value = int(factor * V)

# Step 4: Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.
