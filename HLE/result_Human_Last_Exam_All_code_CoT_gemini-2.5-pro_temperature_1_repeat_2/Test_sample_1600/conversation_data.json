    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). These numbers are well-known in the field of physics and represent a specific combinatorial sequence.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific sequence for `a(n)`. The first few terms of this sequence are established and tabulated in physics literature.\n2.  Store the first few known values of this sequence in the Python code. The sequence begins with `a(1) = 1`, `a(2) = 2`, `a(3) = 10`, and so on.\n3.  Write a Python script to look up the value for `n=3`.\n4.  Print the result in the format `a(3) = value`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the value of `a(3)`.\n\n```python\ndef get_feynman_diagram_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for QED propagators.\n    This function stores the known values for the first few terms of the sequence a(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence a(n) for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\n    # a(1) corresponds to order 2, a(2) to order 4, a(3) to order 6, etc.\n    known_values = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 10,\n        4: 74,\n        5: 706\n    }\n    \n    if n in known_values:\n        return known_values[n]\n    else:\n        return \"The value for the given n is not available in the pre-computed list.\"\n\n# The problem asks for a(3), which corresponds to Feynman diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\nn_value = 3\nresult = get_feynman_diagram_count(n_value)\n\n# Print the final equation showing each number.\nprint(f\"a({n_value}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<10>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, what is a(3)?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
