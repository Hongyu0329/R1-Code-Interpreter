    print("1. The code defines various structs and methods for a neural network, such as Matrix, Tokenizer, and various network layers.")
    print("2. Most of the methods correctly follow Rust's borrowing rules, for example, using `&mut self` for modification and `&self` for reading.")
    print("3. A potential for warnings is identified. The standalone functions `exp` and `ln` are defined but not used anywhere in the provided code. The Rust compiler's `dead_code` lint, which is on by default, will likely generate warnings for these unused functions.")
    print("4. A fatal compilation error is located in the `FeedForward::backward` method.")
    print("5. The lines intended to update the weights, such as `self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);`, violate the borrow checker rules.")
    print("6. The violation occurs because `self.w2.set(...)` requires a mutable borrow of `self.w2`, while `self.w2.get(...)` within the same expression requires an immutable borrow. Rust's safety rules prohibit having a mutable and an immutable borrow of the same data at the same time.")

    print("The code will not compile because of the borrow checker error in `FeedForward::backward`. Additionally, it is expected to produce warnings for the unused `exp` and `ln` functions.")
