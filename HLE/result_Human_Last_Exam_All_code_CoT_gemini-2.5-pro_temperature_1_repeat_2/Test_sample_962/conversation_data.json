    "Of course. I will provide a Python script that demonstrates the high-level mathematical structure of a tightly secure, two-round, t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Scheme Selection:** I will model the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** scheme. FROST is a state-of-the-art choice that perfectly matches your requirements: it's a t-out-of-n scheme, has a two-round signing variant, and is proven to be tightly secure.\n2.  **Simulation Setup:** Instead of implementing complex elliptic curve cryptography, I will simulate the scheme using modular arithmetic. This keeps the code simple and focuses on the protocol's structure.\n3.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** I'll simulate the outcome of a DKG. A secret polynomial will be created, and from it, `n` secret shares will be distributed to `n` participants. We will also derive the group's public key. In a real scenario, the main secret is never in one place; here, we calculate it only to prove the concept and for final verification.\n4.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds):**\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** A threshold `t` of participants will generate secret nonces and broadcast public commitments.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signature Share Generation):** After receiving all commitments, participants will compute a group commitment, a challenge hash, and then their individual signature shares.\n5.  **Aggregation and Verification:** A signature aggregator (this can be one of the participants) will combine the shares into a final signature `(R, z)`. I will then verify this signature against the group's public key and print out the final verification equation with all its numerical components, as requested.\n\nThis demonstration will show you the core logic and flow of a secure, two-round threshold signature protocol.\n\n```python\nimport secrets\nimport hashlib\n\n# A simple class to simulate a finite field for demonstration\nclass FiniteField:\n    def __init__(self, p):\n        self.p = p\n\n    def add(self, a, b):\n        return (a + b) % self.p\n\n    def mul(self, a, b):\n        return (a * b) % self.p\n\n    def inv(self, a):\n        return pow(a, -1, self.p)\n\n    def sub(self, a, b):\n        return (a - b) % self.p\n\ndef shamir_share(secret, t, n, field):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates n shares of a secret, where t are required to reconstruct.\n    Returns the polynomial coefficients and the shares.\n    \"\"\"\n    if t > n:\n        raise ValueError(\"Threshold t cannot be greater than the number of shares n.\")\n    \n    # a_0 is the secret\n    coeffs = [secret] + [secrets.randbelow(field.p) for _ in range(t - 1)]\n    \n    # f(x) = a_0 + a_1*x + a_2*x^2 + ...\n    def poly(x):\n        y = 0\n        for i, coeff in enumerate(coeffs):\n            y = field.add(y, field.mul(coeff, pow(x, i, field.p)))\n        return y\n        \n    shares = [(i, poly(i)) for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n    return coeffs, shares\n\ndef lagrange_coeff(x_i, participants, field):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Lagrange coefficient for participant x_i.\n    participants is a list of x-coordinates of the signing parties.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 1\n    den = 1\n    for x_j in participants:\n        if x_j != x_i:\n            num = field.mul(num, x_j)\n            den = field.mul(den, field.sub(x_j, x_i))\n    return field.mul(num, field.inv(den))\n\ndef design_frost_scheme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the FROST threshold signature scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
