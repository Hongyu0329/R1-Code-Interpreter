    "My plan is to first identify the specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made the distinction you're asking about. This is a knowledge-based question, not a computational one. After researching and confirming the correct individual, I will create a simple Python script as requested. This script will store the philosopher's name and the concepts in variables and then use the `print()` function to display the answer in a clear, formatted way.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher who decomposed the notion of a sign or hallmark.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    general_concept = \"hallmark (or more generally, a sign)\"\n    component_1 = \"symptoms\"\n    component_2 = \"signals\"\n\n    print(f\"The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a '{general_concept}' is {philosopher}.\")\n    print(f\"He distinguished between:\")\n    print(f\"1. {component_1}: Natural signs that are causally connected to what they signify (e.g., smoke is a symptom of fire).\")\n    print(f\"2. {component_2}: Conventional signs established by rules or agreement (e.g., a traffic light is a signal to stop).\")\n\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
