    "In the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, the rational choice for both players is to defect, leading to a suboptimal outcome of (1, 1) for both. This is the famous Nash Equilibrium. However, by introducing quantum mechanics, we can escape this dilemma.\n\nHere is the plan to find the equilibrium in the quantum version of the game:\n1.  **Set up the Quantum Game**: We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. The game starts not with a simple classical state but with a quantum entangled state. An entangling operator, `J`, is applied to the initial state |Cooperate, Cooperate⟩. The degree of entanglement is controlled by a parameter `γ`.\n2.  **Define Quantum Strategies**: Players' strategies are no longer just \"Cooperate\" or \"Defect\", but unitary operations on their respective qubits.\n3.  **Optimize for the Best Outcome**: The user prompt asks us to \"design the initial states for an optimal\" outcome. This is achieved by setting the entanglement to its maximum value (`γ = π/2`). At this level of entanglement, the classical Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) is no longer stable.\n4.  **Identify the Quantum Equilibrium**: A new, Pareto-optimal Nash Equilibrium emerges. In this equilibrium, both players apply a specific quantum strategy, denoted as `Q`.\n5.  **Calculate the Payoff**: The Python code below will simulate this quantum game. It will:\n    *   Define the payoff matrix and the quantum operators.\n    *   Set the entanglement to its maximum (`γ = π/2`).\n    *   Simulate the game with both players choosing the quantum strategy `Q`.\n    *   Calculate the final probabilities of each classical outcome (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n    *   Use these probabilities to compute the final payoff for each player, printing the full equation as requested.\n\nThe resulting payoff at this new equilibrium point resolves the dilemma, giving both players the reward for mutual cooperation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    under maximal entanglement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
