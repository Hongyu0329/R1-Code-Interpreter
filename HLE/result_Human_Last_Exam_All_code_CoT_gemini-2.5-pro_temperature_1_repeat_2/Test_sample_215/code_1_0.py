def analyze_chemotypes():
    """
    Analyzes the provided R script to determine the expected number of chemotypes.

    The R script `generate_chemistry` is called separately for the 'control' and 'water_stress' groups.
    Let's analyze the call for one group, for example, the control group:
    `controls = generate_chemistry(360, 340, 'control')`

    1.  Inside the function, the `treatment` parameter is a single value: 'control'.
    2.  The line `treatment = sample(treatment, n_specimens, replace = T)` therefore assigns the label 'control' to all 360 specimens.
    3.  A single `baseline` vector is generated using `runif(n_peaks, 0, 1)`.
    4.  The script then iterates through unique treatments. Since there is only one ('control'), the loop runs once.
    5.  The line `peaks[t==treatment,] = apply(peaks[t==treatment,], 1, \(x)x-baseline)` subtracts the *exact same* baseline from every single specimen in the group.
    
    Conclusion for the Control Group:
    Since all 360 control specimens are generated from the same initial random distribution (`rnorm`) and have the same baseline subtracted, they are all statistical replicates of each other. They belong to a single underlying data distribution. Therefore, when visualized (e.g., with PCA), they should form a single cluster. This corresponds to one chemotype.

    Conclusion for the Water Stress Group:
    The exact same logic applies to the `water_stress` group, which is generated by a separate call: `generate_chemistry(510, 340, 'water_stress')`. All 510 specimens in this group are also statistical replicates of each other (though they will be different from the control group because a new, different baseline is generated). This also corresponds to one chemotype.
