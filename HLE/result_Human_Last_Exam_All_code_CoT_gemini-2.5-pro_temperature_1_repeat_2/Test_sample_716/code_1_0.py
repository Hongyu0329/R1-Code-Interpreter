def solve_hausdorff_dimension():
    """
    Determines the Hausdorff dimension of the given curve by analyzing its mathematical properties.

    The curve is defined by:
    x(t) = sin(pi*t)
    y(t) = sin(t)
    z(t) = cos(2t)

    The solution follows these steps:
    1. Acknowledge that the Hausdorff dimension of a regular C^1 curve (a smooth curve
       without cusps or points where it stops) is equal to its topological dimension, which is 1.
    2. Verify that the given curve is C^1. This is true because sin(t) and cos(t) are
       infinitely differentiable (C^infinity).
    3. Verify that the curve is regular. A curve is regular if its tangent vector is never
       the zero vector for any value of t.
    4. The tangent vector r'(t) is the vector of the derivatives of the components:
       r'(t) = (dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt).
    5. We will show that there is no t for which all three components of r'(t) are zero.
