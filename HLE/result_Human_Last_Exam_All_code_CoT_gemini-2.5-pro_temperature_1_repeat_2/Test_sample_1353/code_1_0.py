    # Part a)
    # A string starter P(a,b) is a lowest weight vector. The string is P, EP, ..., E^k P.
    # The terminal polynomial Q = E^k P is the highest weight vector.
    # The sl(2) theory implies k = a - b.
    # Start P has bi-degree (a, b) = (4, 3).
    # k = 4 - 3 = 1.
    # The string is P, EP. The terminal polynomial is EP.
    # E changes bi-degree (a, b) to (a-1, b+1).
    # Bi-degree of EP is (4-1, 3+1) = (3, 4).

    # Part b)
    # Let's assume the construction implies a polynomial of bi-degree (a, b)
    # where a = sum(r_1, ..., r_b).
    # A starter P of bi-degree (a,b) corresponds to a highest weight vector Q
    # of bi-degree (b,a).
    # A known condition for highest weight vectors in DH_n is that their total degree
    # must be less than or equal to n-1.
    # So, b + a <= n-1.
    # Substituting a = sum(r_i), we get: sum(r_i) + b <= n-1.
    # We will represent the sum notation for clarity.

    # Part c)
    # The question asks if a polynomial P of bi-degree (5,2) can be constructed
    # using operators E_{r,0} for r=1,2.
    # This means P must be in the joint kernel of F_1 = sum(x_i * d/dy_i)
    # and F_2 = sum(x_i^2 * d/dy_i).
    # Being a starter means F_1 * P = 0.
    # The additional constraint is F_2 * P = 0.
    # Analysis shows that for n>=2, the only polynomial solution to both
    # F_1*P=0 and F_2*P=0 is P=0.
    # A zero polynomial does not have a defined bi-degree, so it cannot have bi-degree (5,2).
