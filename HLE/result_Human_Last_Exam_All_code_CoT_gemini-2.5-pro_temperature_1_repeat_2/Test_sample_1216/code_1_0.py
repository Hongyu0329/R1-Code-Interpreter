    """
    Solves the Augustus records problem based on the provided text and constraints.
    
    The solution is based on the following interpretations and assumptions due to
    contradictions in the problem statement:
    1. The explicit constraints override the initial fractional descriptions.
    2. A typo exists in the second constraint ("divided by 4" is corrected to 
       "divided by 10") to make the problem solvable within the given totals.
    3. The number of distinct naming patterns is 7.
    4. Ambiguity in the value of 'b' is resolved by selecting the option that best
       aligns with the ratios suggested by the descriptive text.
    5. The denominator for the final calculation is the sum of records in categories
       naming Augustus (b, c, and d).
