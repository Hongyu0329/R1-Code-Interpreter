    # In a universe with quantum logic, a proposition P can be in a superposition.
    # We represent P by its probability, 'p', of being measured as True.
    # The probability of ¬P is (1-p).

    # A proposition P is a QTFP if the result of P ⊙ P is the same for forward and backward time-flows.

    # Backward: sqrt((P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P))
