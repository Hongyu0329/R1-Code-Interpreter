    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nA \"power subgroup\" is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. The problem asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$.\n\nThe structure of the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is given by the presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\nFor size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which means $n=9$.\n\nMy plan is to count the cyclic subgroups by considering the two types of elements in the group:\n1.  Elements within the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1} = 256$. The number of subgroups here is simply the number of divisors of 256.\n2.  Elements in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$, which are of the form $sr^i$. I will determine the orders of these elements and count how many distinct cyclic subgroups they generate. This count will be split into two cases: when the exponent $i$ is even and when it is odd.\n3.  Finally, I will sum the counts from all cases to get the total number of power subgroups.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan and calculates the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group SD_{2^n} has order 2^n.\n    # For a group of size 512, we find n such that 2^n = 512.\n    # n = log2(512)\n    n = group_order.bit_length() - 1\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order} is SD_{{{2**n}}}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to n = {n} in the general formula for SD_{{2^n}}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Count cyclic subgroups from the cyclic part <r>\n    # The subgroup <r> is cyclic of order 2^(n-1).\n    # A cyclic group of order m has one subgroup for each divisor of m.\n    # The number of divisors of 2^(k) is k+1.
