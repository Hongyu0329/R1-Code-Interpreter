    This function calculates the total mass based on the derived formula.

    The problem asks for the total mass of the measure (q_v * (q - 1)) / (q_v - 1) * mu.
    Our step-by-step derivation shows that the mass mu is 1 / (q - 1).
    Therefore, the total mass is:
    (q_v * (q - 1)) / (q_v - 1) * (1 / (q - 1)) = q_v / (q_v - 1).

    The final result depends only on q_v, the order of the residual field.
    The problem does not specify a numerical value for q_v. We can represent it
    symbolically or use a placeholder value for a concrete calculation.

    Let's demonstrate with a symbolic variable and a numerical example.
