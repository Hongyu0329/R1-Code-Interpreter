    "Of course. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a 1D box. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction:** The state of the particle is described by its wavefunction, ψn(x). For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy level is:\n    ψn(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a specific position 'x' is given by the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψn(x)|². This is called the probability density function, P(x).\n    P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\n3.  **Calculate the Probability over an Interval:** To find the probability that the particle is located in an interval from x₁ to x₂, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n    Probability = ∫ [from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We are given n=2, x₁=0.495a, and x₂=0.505a. The integral to solve is:\n    Probability = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n    Since this integral can be complex to solve by hand, I will use Python with the SciPy library, which provides a highly accurate numerical integration function (`quad`). This is the most efficient and reliable method for this task. The code will define the parameters, set up the integral, calculate the result, and print it.\n\nNote: For n=2, the wavefunction has a node (a point of zero probability) at the center of the box (x = 0.5a). Since the requested interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is centered on this node, we expect the probability to be very small, but not exactly zero.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval for a specific energy state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # The quantum number for the energy state\n    n = 2\n    \n    # For calculation purposes, we can set the box length 'a' to 1.0.\n    # The probability is a dimensionless quantity, and the 'a' dependency\n    # cancels out when the interval is defined as a fraction of 'a'.\n    a = 1.0\n    \n    # The interval factors are given in the problem\n    x1_factor = 0.495\n    x2_factor = 0.505\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute bounds of the integration\n    x1 = x1_factor * a\n    x2 = x2_factor * a\n\n    # --- Probability Density Function ---\n    # The probability density P(x) for a particle in a 1D box is |ψ(x)|²,\n    # where ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n*π*x/a).\n    # So, P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a).\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # To find the probability, we integrate the probability density function\n    # over the interval [x1, x2] using scipy's quad function.\n    probability, _ = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    # The prompt requires printing the numbers used in the final equation.\n    print(\"The probability (P) of finding the particle in an interval is given by the integral of the probability density function:\")\n    print(f\"P = Integral from x1 to x2 of (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the specific problem, the values in the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Quantum number n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Lower bound x1 = {x1_factor}a\")\n    print(f\"Upper bound x2 = {x2_factor}a\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n```\n<<<6.579736592231226e-06>>>"
