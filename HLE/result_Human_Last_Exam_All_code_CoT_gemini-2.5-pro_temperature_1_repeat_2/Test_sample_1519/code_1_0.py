# Define the given constants
rho = 1000  # Density of water in kg/m^3
g = 10      # Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
H = 10      # Depth of the river in meters

# The condition is that the hydrostatic pressure at the bottom is completely
# counteracted by the dynamic pressure component, reducing the total pressure to zero.
# The equation is: P_static = (1/2) * ρ * v^2
# Where P_static = ρ * g * H

# We can write the full equation to solve for v:
# ρ * g * H = 0.5 * ρ * v^2

# We can simplify this to v^2 = 2 * g * H
v_squared = 2 * g * H
v = math.sqrt(v_squared)

# Print the equation with all the numbers
