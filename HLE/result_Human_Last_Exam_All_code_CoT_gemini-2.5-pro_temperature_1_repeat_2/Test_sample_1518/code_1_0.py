    explanation = """
The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a powerful, non-perturbative principle in quantum field theory. Here's a breakdown of its core physical implication:

1.  **The Principle:** It states that the anomaly associated with a global symmetry must be identical in the high-energy (UV) theory and the low-energy (IR) effective theory. An anomaly is a situation where a symmetry that exists at the classical level is broken by quantum effects.

2.  **The Problem it Solves:** In theories like QCD, the fundamental particles at high energy (quarks) are not the same as the observed particles at low energy (hadrons, like pions). The anomaly matching condition provides a rigorous link between these two descriptions.

3.  **The Physical Implication:** The anomaly calculated from the UV theory (e.g., from quarks) sets a target value. Any valid low-energy theory must contain particles (degrees of freedom) that reproduce this exact anomaly value. This has a profound consequence: it dictates how the global symmetry must be realized in the low-energy world. For the anomaly to match, the IR theory must either:
    a) Contain massless composite fermions.
    b) Feature spontaneous symmetry breaking, which gives rise to massless Goldstone bosons (like the pions in QCD) whose interactions correctly reproduce the anomaly.

Therefore, the most precise physical implication is that the existence of a UV anomaly dictates the fate of the corresponding symmetry at low energies. It constrains the low-energy particle spectrum and forces a specific symmetry realization (e.g., spontaneous breaking).
