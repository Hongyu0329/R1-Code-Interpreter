    Solves the 2D chemistry problem by determining electron configurations and bonding.
    
    This function implements the logic based on the problem's premises:
    1.  A 2D world with spin-1/2 fermions.
    2.  Aufbau ordering (n+l, n rule) holds.
    3.  Covalent bonding is predicted by the completion of subshells.
    4.  No electron promotion occurs.
    
    The key assumption is how orbital capacities change in 2D. We assume that only orbitals
    that can exist "in-plane" are present, leading to the following capacities:
    - s-subshell: 2 electrons
    - p-subshell: 4 electrons
    - d-subshell: 4 electrons
