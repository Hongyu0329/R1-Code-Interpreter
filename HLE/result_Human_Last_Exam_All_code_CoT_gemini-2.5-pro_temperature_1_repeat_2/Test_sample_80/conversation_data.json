    "This is a classic chess puzzle that can be solved with logical steps. Here is my plan to find the solution:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Edge Squares:** First, I'll determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  **Separate by Color:** Bishops only attack along diagonals of the same color. Therefore, we can treat the problem of placing bishops on light squares and dark squares independently. I'll calculate how many light and dark squares are on the edge.\n3.  **Analyze Attacks:** For each color, I will determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed. On the edge squares, it turns out that every square is on a diagonal with exactly one other edge square of the same color. This creates pairs of mutually attacking squares.\n4.  **Maximize Placements:** To place the maximum number of bishops, we can only place one bishop from each attacking pair. I'll calculate this maximum number for both light and dark squares and then sum them up.\n5.  **Calculate Empty Squares:** Finally, I'll subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many squares remain empty.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define board properties and calculate total edge squares.\nboard_size = 8\n# The number of edge squares on an N x N board is 4 * (N - 1)\ntotal_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\nprint(f\"An 8x8 chessboard has {total_edge_squares} edge squares.\")\n\n# Step 2: Divide the edge squares by color.\n# On an 8x8 board, the edge squares are evenly split between light and dark.\nlight_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\ndark_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\nprint(f\"These are divided into {light_edge_squares} light squares and {dark_edge_squares} dark squares.\")\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the placement strategy.\n# Bishops only attack on the same color. We can place the maximum number of bishops\n# by considering the light and dark squares separately.\n# On the edge, every square shares a diagonal with exactly one other edge square of the same color\n# (e.g., light squares a1 and h8 attack each other; dark squares h1 and a8 attack each other).\n# This creates attacking pairs. To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops,\n# we can place exactly one bishop from each pair.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of bishops that can be placed.\nmax_bishops_on_light = light_edge_squares // 2\nmax_bishops_on_dark = dark_edge_squares // 2\ntotal_bishops_placed = max_bishops_on_light + max_bishops_on_dark\nprint(f\"\\nFor the {light_edge_squares} light squares, we can place a maximum of {max_bishops_on_light} bishops.\")\nprint(f\"For the {dark_edge_squares} dark squares, we can place a maximum of {max_bishops_on_dark} bishops.\")\nprint(f\"Total maximum bishops that can be placed on the edge: {max_bishops_on_light} + {max_bishops_on_dark} = {total_bishops_placed}.\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\nempty_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of edge squares lacking bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the total bishops placed.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {total_edge_squares} - {total_bishops_placed} = {empty_squares}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, {empty_squares} edge squares would lack bishops.\")\n<<<14>>>"
