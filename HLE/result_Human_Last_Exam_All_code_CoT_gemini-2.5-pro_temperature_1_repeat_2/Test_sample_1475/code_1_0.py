    Solves the problem by analyzing the topological properties of the space P(X).

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably many
    open dense subsets of a space P(X). P(X) is the space of all convergent sequences
    (including their limit points) in a compact connected metric space X.

    1. The space P(X) can be shown to be a "Baire space". This is because it is a G-delta
       subset of the hyperspace 2^X, which is a complete metric space. A G-delta subset of
       a complete metric space is topologically complete and thus a Baire space.

    2. The Baire Category Theorem states that for any Baire space, the intersection of a
       countable collection of open dense subsets is itself a dense set, and therefore non-empty.

    3. Furthermore, the space P(X) can be shown to be "perfect", meaning it has no isolated points.
       This is because any convergent sequence in P(X) can be slightly perturbed to create a new,
       distinct convergent sequence that is arbitrarily close in the Hausdorff metric.

    4. For a non-empty, perfect, and topologically complete metric space (like P(X)), a stronger
       result holds: any countable intersection of open dense subsets has the cardinality
       of the continuum, which is denoted 2^{\aleph_0} (2 to the power of aleph-null).

    5. This result holds for any space X that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the set
       of possible cardinalities for the intersection has only one element: 2^{\aleph_0}.
       The smallest possible cardinality is thus 2^{\aleph_0}.

    The final answer is represented by the equation: Cardinality = 2^{\aleph_0}.
