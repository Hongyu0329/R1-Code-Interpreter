    "Of all the sequences, this one is particularly tricky. A simple arithmetic or geometric progression doesn't fit. After analyzing various possibilities, a plausible (though not perfectly consistent) pattern emerges. The rule to generate the next number in the sequence appears to be adding the sum of the digits and the product of the digits to the current number.\n\nLet's test this rule on the first term:\n- **Current Number**: 1014\n- **Sum of digits**: 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6\n- **Product of digits**: 1 * 0 * 1 * 4 = 0\n- **Next Number**: 1014 + 6 + 0 = 1020\nThis matches the second term in the sequence. While this rule doesn't hold for all subsequent terms (suggesting a more complex underlying pattern or potential errors in the sequence), it's a strong starting point. Applying this discovered rule to the last number of the sequence will give us the next term.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1. Take the last number of the sequence, which is 2352.\n2. Calculate the sum of its digits.\n3. Calculate the product of its digits.\n4. Add the sum and the product to the number to find the next term.\n5. Print the full equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in a sequence based on a derived rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 2352\n    \n    # Convert the number to a list of its digits\n    digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the digits\n    sum_of_digits = sum(digits)\n    \n    # Calculate the product of the digits\n    product_of_digits = 1\n    for digit in digits:\n        product_of_digits *= digit\n        \n    # Calculate the next number in the sequence\n    next_num = num + sum_of_digits + product_of_digits\n    \n    # Create string representations for printing the equation\n    s_o_d_str = \" + \".join(map(str, digits))\n    p_o_d_str = \" * \".join(map(str, digits))\n    \n    print(f\"To find the next number, we apply the rule: number + sum_of_digits + product_of_digits\")\n    print(f\"Last Number: {num}\")\n    print(f\"Sum of Digits: {s_o_d_str} = {sum_of_digits}\")\n    print(f\"Product of Digits: {p_o_d_str} = {product_of_digits}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {num} + {sum_of_digits} + {product_of_digits} = {next_num}\")\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_num}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<2424>>>"
