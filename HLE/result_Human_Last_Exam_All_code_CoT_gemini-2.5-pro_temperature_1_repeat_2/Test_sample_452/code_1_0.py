# The problem is to find the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
# Based on the analysis above, the constant b is equal to the square root of (2 * pi).

# The final equation for b is b = sqrt(2 * pi)
# The numbers in this equation are 2 and pi.

# Define the numbers in the equation
number_2 = 2
number_pi = math.pi

# Calculate the value of b
b_value = math.sqrt(number_2 * number_pi)
