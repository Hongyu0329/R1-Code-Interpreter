    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms and their counts:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (a heavy atom):** The 6-31G basis set provides:\n        *   1 core orbital function (1s), which is a contraction of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   1 set of inner valence functions (2s, 2p), where each is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives 1 s-function and 3 p-functions, for a total of 4 functions.\n        *   1 set of outer valence functions (2s', 2p'), where each is a single primitive Gaussian. This also gives 1 s-function and 3 p-functions, for a total of 4 functions.\n        *   Total per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom:** The 6-31G basis set provides:\n        *   1 inner valence function (1s), which is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   1 outer valence function (1s'), which is a single primitive Gaussian.\n        *   Total per Hydrogen atom = 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Toluene chemical formula: C7H8\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom in the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (heavy atom): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for each element\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final result\nprint(f\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}):\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms uses {functions_per_carbon} contracted functions.\")\nprint(f\"Each of the {num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms uses {functions_per_hydrogen} contracted functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({total_functions_carbon}) + ({total_functions_hydrogen}) = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
