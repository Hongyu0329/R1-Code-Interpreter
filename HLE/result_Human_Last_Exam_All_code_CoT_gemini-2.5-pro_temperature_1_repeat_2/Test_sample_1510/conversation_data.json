    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2:** First, we must identify which of the 2D crystallographic point groups have an order of 2. The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. The two point groups of order 2 are:\n    *   **2 (or C₂):** This group contains the identity and a 2-fold rotation.\n    *   **m (or D₁):** This group contains the identity and a single mirror reflection.\n\n2.  **List Wallpaper Groups for Each Point Group:** Next, we'll list the specific wallpaper groups that correspond to each of these point groups.\n    *   **For point group 2:** The wallpaper groups are `p2` and `pgg`.\n    *   **For point group m:** The wallpaper groups are `pm`, `pg`, and `cm`.\n\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, we'll add the number of groups from each category to get the total. There are 2 groups for point group '2' and 3 groups for point group 'm'.\n\nThe following Python code automates this process by storing the properties of all 17 wallpaper groups and filtering them based on the order of their point group. It then prints the groups found and calculates the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and counts the number of wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups.
