    This script explains whether an ammonia molecule made with exotic, spin-0
    hydrogen atoms would exhibit tunneling.

    # --- Step 1: Explain the physical basis of ammonia tunneling ---
    print("--- The Physics of Ammonia Tunneling ---")
    print("1. Ammonia (NH3) has a pyramid shape, with Nitrogen (N) at the top and three Hydrogens (H) at the base.")
    print("2. The N atom is not fixed on one side of the H-plane. It can quantum mechanically 'tunnel' through the plane to the other side.")
    print("3. This tunneling phenomenon depends on two key physical properties:")
    print("   a) The potential energy surface of the molecule, which has a double-well shape.")
    print("   b) The masses of the atoms involved (specifically, the N atom tunneling relative to the H atoms).")
    print("This potential energy is determined by the electrostatic forces between nuclei and electrons, not by nuclear spin.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 2: Explain the role of nuclear spin and particle statistics ---
    print("--- The Role of Identical Particles and Nuclear Spin ---")
    print("The three hydrogen atoms are identical. Quantum mechanics treats identical particles based on their spin.")
    print("The total wavefunction of a molecule must obey a specific symmetry rule when two identical particles are swapped.")
    print("\nHere's the comparison:")
    print("A) Ordinary Hydrogen (Proton):")
    print("   - Nuclear Spin = 1/2")
    print("   - Particles with half-integer spin are called 'Fermions'.")
    print("   - The total wavefunction for ordinary NH3 must be ANTISYMMETRIC upon swapping any two H atoms.")
    print("\nB) Exotic Hydrogen (as described in the problem):")
    print("   - Nuclear Spin = 0")
    print("   - Particles with integer spin are called 'Bosons'.")
    print("   - The total wavefunction for this exotic NH3 must be SYMMETRIC upon swapping any two H atoms.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 3: Analyze the consequences and provide the conclusion ---
    print("--- Conclusion: Does Tunneling Still Occur? ---")
    print("The core physical mechanism causing tunneling (the potential energy surface and atomic masses) remains UNCHANGED because:")
    print(" - The exotic hydrogen is only different in its spin, not its mass or charge.")
    print(" - The potential energy surface does not depend on nuclear spin.")
    print("\nTherefore, the double-well potential still exists, and the nitrogen atom can still tunnel through it.")
    print("\nWhat does change? The switch from Fermion (spin 1/2) to Boson (spin 0) hydrogens changes the symmetry rules. This acts as a 'selection rule' that alters which rotational states are allowed in the molecule. The molecule's microwave spectrum would look different, but the energy level splitting caused by the tunneling itself would still be present.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling.")
