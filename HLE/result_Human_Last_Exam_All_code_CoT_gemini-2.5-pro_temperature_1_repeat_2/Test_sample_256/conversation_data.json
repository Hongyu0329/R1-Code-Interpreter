    "My plan is to address the user's question by looking up the known result for the optimal packing of 1135 circles. The problem of packing circles in a circle is a known difficult problem in geometry, and solutions for specific numbers of circles are often found through computational search and are considered \"putative\" or \"conjectured\" optimal solutions.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the number of circles, which is N = 1135.\n2.  Consult a reliable database of circle packing results, such as the one compiled by Eckard Specht on packomania.com.\n3.  Find the entry for N = 1135 to determine the symmetry group of its best-known packing.\n4.  The symmetry is given in Schoenflies notation. I will identify the specific notation for this case.\n5.  I will write a Python script that states the problem, retrieves this known information, and explains the meaning of the symmetry group and its notation. The instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\" will be interpreted as explaining the components of the Schoenflies symbol (e.g., for C1, explain 'C' and '1').\n6.  Finally, the script will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef get_circle_packing_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles in a circle.\n\n    The optimal packing of N congruent circles in a larger circle is a challenging mathematical\n    problem.
