    Solves the given combinatorial set theory problem.

    The solution proceeds in the following steps:
    1.  The maximum possible size of a "free set" is determined based on the
        problem's premises. The properties of head-tail weak Delta-systems
        are strong enough to prove the existence of a free set of size kappa.
    2.  Based on the maximum free set size, the complete set X of possible
        cardinalities is identified.
    3.  The order type of X is calculated, which for a finite well-ordered
        set is its number of elements.

    # Step 1: Maximum size of a free set
    # The combinatorial properties provided for the collection D, particularly that
    # any kappa-sized subset has a kappa-sized head-tail weak Delta-subsystem,
    # are powerful. Standard arguments in combinatorial set theory (involving
    # Fodor's Lemma and properties of Delta-systems) show that the set of indices
    # that prevent the construction of a free set is small (size < kappa).
    # This guarantees the existence of a free set of size kappa = omega_7 = aleph_7.
    max_free_set_size_index = kappa_index

    # Step 2: Determine the set X
    # A free set of size kappa (aleph_7) exists. Let's call it S_free.
    # Any subset of a free set is also a free set.
    # Therefore, for any infinite cardinal mu <= kappa, we can take a subset
    # of S_free of that size mu, and it will be a free set.
    # The set X, therefore, contains all infinite cardinals from aleph_0 to aleph_7.
    # X = {aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7}

    cardinal_indices_in_X = list(range(max_free_set_size_index + 1))

    # Step 3: Find the order type of X
    # X is a finite set of cardinals, ordered by their magnitude.
    # The order type of a finite well-ordered set is its cardinality.
    # The number of elements in X is the number of integers from 0 to 7, inclusive.
