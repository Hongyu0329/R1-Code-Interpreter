Rationale: According to Hidi and Renninger's model, a student with an 'emerging individual interest' is in a critical transitional phase. They are moving from an interest supported by external factors to one that is personally valued and internally driven. At this stage, they are actively seeking to build competence and knowledge.

Concrete feedback emphasizing immediate next steps provides the exact scaffolding this student needs. It helps them build skills, experience success, and gain confidence. This positive reinforcement is highly effective at converting their budding interest into a stable, long-term, well-developed individual interest.

For other phases:
- (A) Triggered interest is too fleeting for long-term impact.
- (B) Maintained interest is still dependent on the situation.
- (D) Well-developed interest is already self-sustaining, so this type of feedback is less impactful for its fundamental development.
