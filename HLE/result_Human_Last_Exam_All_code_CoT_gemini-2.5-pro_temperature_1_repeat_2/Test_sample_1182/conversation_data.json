    "To find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow a procedure to find a better model of the curve, reduce it modulo 2, and then count its singularities.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Initial Reduction:** We start with the given equation $y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. We will reduce this equation modulo 2 to see its initial form.\n2.  **Model Transformation:** The initial reduction will turn out to be singular in a way that is not \"stable\" (a non-reduced double line). This suggests that a change of variables is needed to find a better model. We observe that $y^2 - x^2$ is divisible by 4, which justifies the transformation $y-x=2u$ and $y+x=2v$.\n3.  **New Model Equation:** We will derive the new equation in terms of $u$ and $v$. This involves expressing $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$ and substituting them back into the original equation.\n4.  **Stable Reduction:** We will reduce the new model's equation modulo 2. This resulting curve is the stable reduction.\n5.  **Counting Double Points:** A double point (or node) is a type of singularity. We will find the singular points of the stable reduction by finding where its partial derivatives with respect to both variables are zero.\n6.  **Analysis of Singularities:** For each singular point found, we will analyze its nature by examining the lowest-degree terms of the curve's equation at that point. If the quadratic part is a product of two distinct linear factors, the point is an ordinary double point.\n7.  **Final Count:** The number of such ordinary double points is the answer.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the necessary symbolic mathematics to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define variables for symbolic manipulation\n    x, y, u, v = sympy.symbols('x y u v')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the curve and perform initial reduction\n    print(\"Step 1: Initial curve and reduction\")\n    f_x = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + 1*x**2 + 8*x\n    curve_eq = sympy.Eq(y**2, f_x)\n    print(f\"The curve is given by the equation: {curve_eq}\")\n\n    # Reduce coefficients modulo 2\n    reduced_f_x = sympy.Poly(f_x, x).trunc(2)\n    reduced_curve_eq_mod2 = sympy.Eq(y**2, reduced_f_x)\n    print(f\"Reducing the equation modulo 2 gives: y**2 = {reduced_f_x} (mod 2)\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to y**2 - x**2 = 0, or (y-x)**2 = 0 in characteristic 2.\")\n    print(\"This is a 'double line', which is not a stable curve.
