    "This question is about Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy. The answer is based on standard pre-flop opening ranges for a 100BB deep, 6-max No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Context:** The scenario is opening from the button (BTN), the most profitable position in poker. With 100 big blinds and no rake, the incentive to play hands is at its highest.\n2.  **Consult GTO Ranges:** Standard GTO pre-flop charts show that the BTN should open-raise a very wide range of hands, typically around 45-50%. This is because you are guaranteed to have a positional advantage post-flop against the blinds.\n3.  **Analyze Suited Jacks:** The strength of a suited jack hand (like JXs) is determined by the rank of its second card, the \"kicker\". A higher kicker means a stronger hand (e.g., JTs is stronger than J9s).\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff:** In a rake-free 100BB game, GTO strategy dictates opening all suited jacks from the button. This includes the entire range from JAs (Ace-Jack suited) down to the one with the lowest possible kicker.\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** The \"worst\" suited jack that is still a profitable, standard open-raise is the one with the lowest-ranked kicker, which is a 2. Therefore, the hand is Jack-Two suited.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The python script will list all the suited jack hands, identify the weakest one based on its position in a sorted list, and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on standard GTO poker theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In poker, suited jack hands are ranked by their second card (kicker).\n    # We list them here from strongest to weakest for demonstration.\n    # Note: Ace-Jack (AJs) and King-Jack (KJs) are premium hands.\n    # The list covers all standard suited jacks.\n    all_suited_jacks = [\n        \"AJs\", \"KJs\", \"QJs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\",\n        \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # According to GTO (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop charts for this specific\n    # game format (100BB, rake-free, BTN open), all suited jacks are a\n    # profitable open-raise.\n    \n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest expected value that is\n    # still positive. In this range, the weakest hand is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    worst_hand = all_suited_jacks[-1]\n\n    print(\"Based on standard GTO pre-flop ranges for a 100BB rake-free game:\")\n    print(\"The button's opening range is very wide and includes all suited Jack hands.\")\n    print(\"The weakest of these, and therefore the 'worst' one you should still open, is the one with the lowest kicker.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe worst suited jack to open from the button is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
