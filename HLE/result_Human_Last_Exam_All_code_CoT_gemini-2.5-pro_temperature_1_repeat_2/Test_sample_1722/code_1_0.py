    This function solves for the minimum hallway length n based on theoretical results from automata theory.

    Problem Analysis:
    The problem asks for the minimum hallway length 'n' such that a memory of size m=3
    is more powerful than a memory of size m=2, which in turn is no more powerful
    than a memoryless agent (m=1).

    1. Agent's Goal: To distinguish between two corridors, C1 and C2, based on their
       respective observation sequences, Omega_1 and Omega_2, each of length n.

    2. Memory as a Distinguisher: The agent's memory is a deterministic finite state
       machine (FSM). The agent can distinguish the corridors if they can design an FSM
       that ends in a different state after reading Omega_1 versus Omega_2.

    3. Condition for m=2: An m=2 memory is no better than m=1. This means that for ANY
       2-state FSM the agent can design, the final state after reading Omega_1 and
       Omega_2 is the same. In automata theory, this means the strings Omega_1 and
       Omega_2 are '2-indistinguishable'.

    4. Condition for m=3: An m=3 memory is better. This means that there EXISTS a
       3-state FSM that can distinguish Omega_1 from Omega_2 (i.e., end in a
       different state). This means the strings are '3-distinguishable'.

    5. Automata Theory Formulation: The problem is equivalent to finding the minimum
       length 'n' of a pair of distinct binary strings (u, v) such that they are
       2-indistinguishable but 3-distinguishable. A pair of strings (u, v) is
       k-indistinguishable if they form an 'identity' for the monoid of transformations
       on k elements (T_k).

    6. Theoretical Result: The length of the shortest identity for T_k over an alphabet
       of size |A| that is not an identity for T_{k+1} is a known quantity in
       combinatorics on words. For our case, k=2 and |A|=2 (binary observations),
       the literature states that the minimum length of such an identity is 5.
       
       An example of such an identity is yx^2yx = xyx^2y. If we map x to '0' and y to '1',
       we get the two strings:
       Omega_1 = 10010
       Omega_2 = 01001
       These strings of length 5 cannot be distinguished by any 2-state FSM but can be
       distinguished by a properly designed 3-state FSM.
