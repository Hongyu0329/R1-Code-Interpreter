    "My plan is to first identify the protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\". Then, I will recall from my knowledge base the name of the character he marries. Finally, I will create a simple Python script to assign this name to a variable and print it.\n\n```python\n# The protagonist of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# The character he marries is Angelina. This script will print her name.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
