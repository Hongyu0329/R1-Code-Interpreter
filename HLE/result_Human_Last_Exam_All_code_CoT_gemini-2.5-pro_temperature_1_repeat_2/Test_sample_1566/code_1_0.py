    print("Let E be the set of end points and I = X \\ E be the set of non-end points.")
    print("An auto-homeomorphism is a topology-preserving transformation, so it must map end points to other end points.")
    print("Given that there are exactly two orbits and E is non-empty (since n > 1), the two orbits must be the set E and the set I.")

    print("\n[Step 2: Characterizing the Orbits]")
    print("This implies two strong homogeneity conditions:")
    print(" (a) All end points in E are topologically equivalent (E is a single orbit).")
    print(" (b) All non-end points in I are topologically equivalent (I is a single orbit).")

    print("\n[Step 3: Relating End Points and Cut Points]")
    print("In continuum theory, an 'end point' as defined in the problem is a 'non-cut-point' (a point whose removal does not disconnect the space).")
    print("For the set of non-end points I to be a single homogeneous orbit, it must consist entirely of 'cut points'. If I contained any non-cut-points, they would have a different topological character from the cut points in I, contradicting that I is a single orbit.")
    print("Therefore, E is precisely the set of all non-cut-points of X.")

    print("\n[Step 4: Analyzing Cases Based on the Number of End Points (n)]")
    print("\nCase n = 2:")
    print("If n=2, X has exactly two non-cut-points. A fundamental theorem of topology states that a continuum with exactly two non-cut-points must be an arc (i.e., homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1]).")
    print("The arc is a valid solution: E = {0, 1} is one orbit, and the interior I = (0, 1) is the other. This fits all the problem's criteria.")
    
    print("\nCase n > 2:")
    print("If n > 2, X has more than two non-cut-points. Another established theorem states that such a continuum must contain a 'triod' (a space where three arcs meet at a central point).")
    print("This means the set of non-end points I must contain at least two different types of points: a 'branch point' (the center of the triod, which separates the space into >=3 components) and a 'regular point' (a point on an arm of the triod, which separates the space into 2 components).")
    print("Since these two types of points have different topological properties, they cannot belong to the same orbit. This contradicts the condition that I is a single, homogeneous orbit.")

    print("\n[Step 5: Conclusion]")
    print("The analysis shows that no solutions can exist for n > 2. The only possibility is n=2, which corresponds to a single, unique topological type: the arc.")
