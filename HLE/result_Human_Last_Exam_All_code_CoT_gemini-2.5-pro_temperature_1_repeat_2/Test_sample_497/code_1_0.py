# Let 'c' be the capacitance of the capacitors in each cell.
# The problem is to find the value of a terminating capacitor 'x'
# such that the total equivalent capacitance is independent of the number of cells.

# This condition implies that x must be equal to the characteristic capacitance
# of the infinite ladder. This value is found by solving the fixed-point equation
# derived from the circuit's recurrence relation.

# The equation for x is:
# x = (c^2 + c*x) / (3*c + 2*x)

# Rearranging this gives a quadratic equation for x:
# x * (3*c + 2*x) = c^2 + c*x
# 3*c*x + 2*x^2 = c^2 + c*x
# 2*x^2 + 2*c*x - c^2 = 0

# To solve for x, we can solve for the ratio y = x/c by setting c=1.
# The equation becomes 2*y^2 + 2*y - 1 = 0.
# The coefficients for this quadratic equation (a*y^2 + b*y + c_coeff = 0) are:
a = 2
b = 2
c_coeff = -1
