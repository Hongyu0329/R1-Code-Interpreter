    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of independent parameters that define the bosonic sector of the specified supersymmetric sigma-model. This number is equivalent to the dimension of the corresponding manifold.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the model's target space:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is a supermanifold. This supermanifold is a quotient of supergroups G/H, where for `N` replicas, G = OSp(2N|2N) and H = OSp(N|N) x OSp(N|N).\n2.  **Isolate the bosonic sector:** The non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic part of this supermanifold. We can find this by taking the bosonic part of the groups G and H.\n    *   The bosonic part of the supergroup OSp(2n|2m) is SO(2n) x Sp(2m, R).\n    *   For G = OSp(2N|2N), the bosonic part is G_b = SO(2N) x Sp(2N, R).\n    *   For H = OSp(N|N) x OSp(N|N), the bosonic part is H_b = (SO(N) x Sp(N, R)) x (SO(N) x Sp(N, R)).\n3.  **Determine the bosonic manifold:** The manifold for the bosonic sector is the quotient M_b = G_b / H_b. This space decomposes into a product of two symmetric spaces:\n    M_b = [SO(2N) / (SO(N) x SO(N))] x [Sp(2N, R) / (Sp(N, R) x Sp(N, R))]\n4.  **Calculate the dimension:** The total number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of M_b, which is the sum of the dimensions of the two component spaces.\n    *   The dimension of a symmetric space G/K is dim(G) - dim(K).\n    *   We will use the standard formulas for Lie group dimensions:\n        *   dim(SO(n)) = n(n-1)/2\n        *   dim(Sp(2n, R)) = n(2n+1)\n5.  **Substitute N=2:** The problem specifies two replicas, so we set N=2 and perform the calculation.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with N replicas.\n\n    The formula for the number of variables is the dimension of the bosonic manifold:\n    dim[SO(2N)/(SO(N)xSO(N))] + dim[Sp(2N,R)/(Sp(N,R)xSp(N,R))]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Lie group dimension formulas\n    # dim(SO(n)) = n(n-1)/2\n    def dim_so(n):\n        return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # dim(Sp(2n, R)) = n(2n+1)\n    # The input to this function is the matrix size 'm' (e.g., m=2n)\n    def dim_sp(m):\n        if m % 2 != 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"The dimension for Sp(m,R) must be even.\")\n        n = m // 2\n        return n * (2 * n + 1)\n\n    print(f\"The calculation is for N = {N} replicas.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- SO part calculation ---\n    dim_so_2N = dim_so(2 * N)\n    dim_so_N = dim_so(N)\n    dim_so_part = dim_so_2N - 2 * dim_so_N\n\n    print(\"The number of variables from the SO sector is:\")\n    print(f\"dim(SO({2*N})) - 2 * dim(SO({N}))\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_so_2N} - 2 * {dim_so_N}\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_so_2N} - {2 * dim_so_N}\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_so_part}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Sp part calculation ---\n    dim_sp_2N = dim_sp(2 * N)\n    dim_sp_N = dim_sp(N)\n    dim_sp_part = dim_sp_2N - 2 * dim_sp_N\n\n    print(\"The number of variables from the Sp sector is:\")\n    print(f\"dim(Sp({2*N},R)) - 2 * dim(Sp({N},R))\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_sp_2N} - 2 * {dim_sp_N}\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_sp_2N} - {2 * dim_sp_N}\")\n    print(f\"= {dim_sp_part}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Total calculation ---\n    total_variables = dim_so_part + dim_sp_part\n    print(\"Total number of non-Grassman variables is the sum of the two parts:\")\n    print(f\"Total = (dim SO part) + (dim Sp part)\")\n    print(f\"Total = {dim_so_part} + {dim_sp_part} = {total_variables}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Number of replicas for the given problem\n    N_replicas = 2\n    calculate_bosonic_variables(N_replicas)\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
