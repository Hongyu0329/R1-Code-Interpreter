    "To find the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (let's call it `Γ`), we can use established results from group theory regarding its subgroup growth.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The Grigorchuk group `Γ` is a residually finite 2-group. A key property of such groups is that the index of any finite-index subgroup must be a power of 2. Therefore, `Γ` has subgroups of index 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., but none of index 3, 5, 6, etc.\n2.  We denote `s_n(G)` as the number of subgroups of index `n` in a group `G`. We want to find `s_4(Γ)`.\n3.  A recursive formula for the subgroup growth of `Γ` was developed by Grigorchuk and Wilson. For `n > 1`, it states:\n    `s_{2^n}(Γ) = s_{2^{n-1}}(C_2 × Γ) + s_{2^{n-2}}(C_2 × C_2 × Γ)`\n4.  To use this, we also need a formula for the number of subgroups in a direct product `C_2 × G`. This is given by:\n    `s_k(C_2 × G) = s_k(G) + s_{k/2}(G)` (where `s_j(G)` is 0 if `j` is not an integer).\n5.  We will apply these formulas for `n=2` to find `s_4(Γ)`. This requires knowing the values for `s_1(Γ)` and `s_2(Γ)`.\n    *   `s_1(Γ)`: The number of subgroups of index 1 is always 1 (the group `Γ` itself).\n    *   `s_2(Γ)`: The number of subgroups of index 2 is 7. This is a known property of the Grigorchuk group, derived from its abelianization being `(C_2)³`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grigorchuk_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \n    This calculation is based on established formulas from group theory.\n    Let s_n(G) be the number of subgroups of index n in a group G.\n    Let Gamma be the Grigorchuk group.\n\n    We need to find s_4(Gamma).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base values for the Grigorchuk group Gamma\n    # s_1(Gamma): Number of subgroups of index 1.
