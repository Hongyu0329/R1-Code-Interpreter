    # The problem is to find the smallest number of topologically distinct
    # compactifications of the ray with a remainder X, where X is a non-degenerate,
    # locally-connected, compact metric space.

    # According to a theorem in topology, this number is equal to the number of
    # upper semi-continuous (usc) functions G from X to C(X) (the hyperspace of
    # all non-empty subcontinua of X) such that x is in G(x) for every x in X.

    # Step 1: Find a lower bound for this number.
    # For any valid space X, we can always define at least two such functions.

    # Function 1: The identity mapping, G_1(x) = {x}.
    # This map is continuous (and thus usc) and satisfies x in {x}.
    num_compactifications_g1 = 1

    # Function 2: The constant mapping, G_2(x) = X.
    # This map is continuous (and thus usc) and satisfies x in X.

    # Since X is non-degenerate, G_1 and G_2 are distinct.
    # Therefore, the total number of compactifications is at least 2.

    # Step 2: Determine if this lower bound can be achieved.
    # Topologists have constructed spaces X for which the number of such
    # compactifications is exactly 2. For these spaces, the only two
    # valid functions are the ones described above.

    # Conclusion: Since the number is always at least 2, and a space X exists
    # for which the number is exactly 2, the smallest possible number is 2.
