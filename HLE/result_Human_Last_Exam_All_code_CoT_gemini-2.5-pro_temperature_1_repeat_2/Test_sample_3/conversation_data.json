    "This problem is about the theory of elliptic curves over number fields, a topic in arithmetic geometry. The possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields, like $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, have been completely classified by mathematicians (Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and Najman).\n\nA torsion subgroup is non-cyclic if it is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$. We want to find the largest possible order, which is the product $m \\times n$.\n\nMy plan is to use Python to systematically check the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion groups that can appear over any quadratic field. The largest of these is known to be realizable specifically over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which will give us the answer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Create a list of tuples `(m, n)` representing all possible non-cyclic torsion groups $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ over quadratic fields, based on the known classification theorems.\n2.  Iterate through this list.\n3.  For each group, calculate its order by multiplying `m` and `n`.\n4.  Keep track of the maximum order found.\n5.  Print the process of checking each group and its order.\n6.  Finally, print the equation for the largest order found and state the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)) by checking the known classification for all quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the complete classification of torsion structures of elliptic curves\n    # over quadratic number fields, the possible non-cyclic groups are of the form\n    # Z/mZ x Z/nZ.
