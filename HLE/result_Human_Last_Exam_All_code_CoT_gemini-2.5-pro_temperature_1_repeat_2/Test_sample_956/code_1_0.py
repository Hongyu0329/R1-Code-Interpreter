    2. Create a GAP script to compute the Schur multiplier of G. GAP is a specialized computer algebra system for group theory.
    3. Execute the GAP script using a subprocess and capture its output.
    4. The output from GAP gives the structure of the Schur multiplier A as a direct product of cyclic groups.
    5. Analyze the structure of A to count its proper subgroups up to isomorphism.
    6. Print the detailed analysis and the final count.
