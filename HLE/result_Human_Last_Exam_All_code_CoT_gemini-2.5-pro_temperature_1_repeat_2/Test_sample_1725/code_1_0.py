    # The connection C represents the local distortion tensor, which is a 3x3 matrix in 3D space.

    # The dimension of the space of 3x3 matrices is 3 * 3.

    # Part B: How many coefficients specify E?
    # The energy E is a quadratic function of the strain tensor. The coefficients
    # form the stiffness tensor c_ijkl.
    # For a cubic crystal, there are 3 independent elastic coefficients: C11, C12, C44.

    # The additional constraint "invariant to rigid translation cell-by-cell up the z axis"
    # implies invariance to shear deformations in planes perpendicular to the z-axis.

    # the corresponding elastic constant, C44, to be zero.
    # This removes one coefficient from the count.
