# The person described is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian nobleman and statesman
# who was a key figure in the Russian-American Company.
# The quote is from Andrei Voznesensky's poem "Juno and Avos," which tells a romanticized
# version of Rezanov's journey to California.
# Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was destroyed. In the late 1980s, a memorial
# was placed at his presumed burial site, answering the question "Where is your grave?".

# This script stores and prints the last name.
