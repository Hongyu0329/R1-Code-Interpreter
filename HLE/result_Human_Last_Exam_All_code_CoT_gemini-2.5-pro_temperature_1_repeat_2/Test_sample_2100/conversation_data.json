    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  I will first analyze the clues provided in the user's query. The key elements are the poet (Andrei Voznesensky), the description (\"joy-discovering sailor\"), the mystery of a lost grave (\"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"), and the timeframe of its discovery (late 1980s).\n2.  The poem is a crucial link. I will identify the specific work by Voznesensky that contains these lines or themes. This points to the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" with libretto by Voznesensky.\n3.  The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is a historical figure. I will identify this person. He is the Russian explorer Nikolai Rezanov.\n4.  I will then verify the historical details about Rezanov's death and burial. He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and his grave was indeed lost. A new memorial was established at his presumed burial site in the late 1980s, matching the timeline in the clue.\n5.  Based on this, the man's last name is Rezanov. I will create a simple python script to print this name as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The person described is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian nobleman and statesman\n# who was a key figure in the Russian-American Company.\n# The quote is from Andrei Voznesensky's poem \"Juno and Avos,\" which tells a romanticized\n# version of Rezanov's journey to California.\n# Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was destroyed. In the late 1980s, a memorial\n# was placed at his presumed burial site, answering the question \"Where is your grave?\".\n\n# This script stores and prints the last name.\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\nprint(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
