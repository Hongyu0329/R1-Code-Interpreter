    Calculates the smallest cost in terms of field multiplications to compute 2A - 3B

    - Points A and B are given in affine coordinates.

    - Cost of squaring is the same as multiplication (1S = 1M).
    - Cost of addition, subtraction, and multiplication by constants (like 2, a, d) are
      accounted for as per standard EFD formulas.
