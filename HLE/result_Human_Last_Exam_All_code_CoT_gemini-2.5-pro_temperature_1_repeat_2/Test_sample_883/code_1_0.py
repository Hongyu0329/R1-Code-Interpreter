    print(f"With 5 mM Al2, the kcat decreases from {kcat_control}/s to {kcat_al2}/s.")
    print("Conclusion: Al2 is an inhibitor, likely functioning as an allosteric inhibitor.")

    # Analysis of Al1 and Al2 together

    print("Conclusion: This strongly suggests that Al1 and Al2 compete for the same allosteric binding site. When the inhibitor Al2 is bound, it prevents the activator Al1 from binding.")

    print("Conclusion: Since excess substrate overcomes the inhibition, XAG1 is a competitive inhibitor, which is a type of reversible inhibitor.")

    # Analysis of Rga1
    print("\n6. Analysis of Rga1:")
    print(f"With 100 mM Rga1, kcat drops from {kcat_control}/s to {kcat_rga1}/s. Adding more substrate does NOT restore activity (kcat remains {kcat_rga1_substrate}/s).")
    print("Conclusion: Since excess substrate does not reverse the effect, Rga1 is either a non-competitive or an irreversible inhibitor. In many contexts, this result is interpreted as irreversible inhibition.")

    print("- 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators': Correct.")
    print("- 'Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site': Correct, this is a key conclusion from our analysis.")
