# Define the known probability of measuring |0> at the output.
prob_output_0 = 0.36

# Define the total probability, which must always be 1.
total_probability = 1

# Based on a consistent interpretation of the problem, we derive the relationship:
# |α|² = P_out(1)
# Using the law of total probability, P_out(1) = 1 - P_out(0).
# Therefore, the equation to find |α|² is: |α|² = 1 - P_out(0).

# Calculate the final value for |α|².
alpha_squared = total_probability - prob_output_0

# Print the final equation, showing each number used in the calculation.
print("The final equation to determine the value of |α|² is:")
print(f"|α|² = {total_probability} - {prob_output_0}")

# Print the final result.
print(f"|α|² = {alpha_squared}")
