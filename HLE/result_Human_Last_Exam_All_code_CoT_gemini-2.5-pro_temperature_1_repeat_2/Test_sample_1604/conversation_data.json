    "Here is my plan to solve this request:\n1. I will create a list of some of Lady Butler's most famous paintings that depict specific historical battles.\n2. For each painting, I will identify the name of the battle and the year it took place.\n3. I will store this information in a Python dictionary, with the painting's title as the key and a tuple containing the battle's name and year as the value.\n4. The script will then iterate through this dictionary to find the maximum year.\n5. Finally, it will print out the details of the painting and battle corresponding to that latest year.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_latest_battle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the latest historical battle depicted in a selection of Lady Butler's paintings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of Lady Butler's paintings with their depicted battle and year.\n    # Format: {\"Painting Title\": (\"Battle Name\", Year)}\n    paintings_data = {\n        \"The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras\": (\"Battle of Quatre Bras\", 1815),\n        \"Scotland for Ever!\": (\"Battle of Waterloo\", 1815),\n        \"The Roll Call\": (\"Battle of Inkerman\", 1854),\n        \"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\": (\"Battle of Rorke's Drift\", 1879),\n        \"Floreat Etona!\": (\"Battle of Laing's Nek\", 1881),\n        \"The Camel Corps\": (\"Battle of Abu Klea\", 1885)\n    }\n\n    # Find the entry with the latest year\n    # The key argument to max() specifies a function to be called on each list element prior to making comparisons.\n    # operator.itemgetter(1) gets the value part of the dictionary item.\n    # [1] then gets the year from the tuple (\"Battle Name\", Year).\n    latest_painting_entry = max(paintings_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1][1])\n\n    latest_painting_title = latest_painting_entry[0]\n    latest_battle_name, latest_year = latest_painting_entry[1]\n\n    print(\"Comparing the years of battles depicted by Lady Butler:\")\n    for title, (battle, year) in sorted(paintings_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1][1]):\n        print(f\"- {title}: depicts the {battle} which occurred in {year}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"The latest historical battle is the '{latest_battle_name}'.\")\n    print(\"It was depicted in the painting '{}'.\".format(latest_painting_title))\n    print(f\"The year of the battle is: {latest_year}\")\n\nfind_latest_battle()\n```\n<<<The Camel Corps>>>"
