    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    in an aposyndetic continuum.

    The steps are as follows:
    1.  A continuum is a compact, connected, Hausdorff space.
    2.  A space is aposyndetic if for every two distinct points x, y, there exists a subcontinuum K
        such that x is in the interior of K, and K does not contain y.
    3.  A point p is a non-block point if the set X \ {p} contains a dense continuum-connected subset.
    4.  We seek the minimum cardinality for the set of non-block points.

    Let's consider the simplest possible continuum: a single-point space X = {p}.

    - Is X a continuum? Yes, a singleton space is compact, connected, and Hausdorff.
    - Is X aposyndetic? The condition for aposyndesis applies to pairs of *distinct* points.
      Since X has no distinct points, the condition is vacuously true. So, X is aposyndetic.

    Now, let's find the set of non-block points in X. The only point to check is p.

    - p is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a dense continuum-connected subset.
    - X \ {p} is the empty set (∅).
    - The only subset of ∅ is ∅ itself.
    - We check if ∅ is a dense continuum-connected subset of ∅.
        - Is ∅ continuum-connected? Yes, the condition "for any x, y in ∅..." is vacuously true.
        - Is ∅ dense in ∅? Yes, the closure of ∅ in the space ∅ is ∅.
    - Thus, p is a non-block point.

    The set of non-block points for X = {p} is {p}.
    The cardinality of this set is 1.

    Since a continuum must be non-empty, the set of non-block points cannot have a cardinality of 0.
    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
