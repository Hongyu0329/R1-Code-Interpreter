def find_common_literary_elements():
    """
    This function analyzes and identifies the common elements between
    "Key West" by Koji Suzuki and "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

    Analysis Summary:
    I. Physical confinement: This is a key element in both. In "The Yellow Wallpaper,"
       the protagonist is confined to a single room. In "Key West," the protagonist's
       obsession confines him to a specific haunted boat.
    II. Progressive detachment from reality: Both protagonists experience this. The narrator
       of "The Yellow Wallpaper" descends into psychosis related to the wallpaper. The
       protagonist of "Key West" loses his grip on reality due to grief and supernatural
       experiences.
    III. Indifference to others: This is a strong feature in "The Yellow Wallpaper" but less
         of a direct, central theme in "Key West," where the protagonist is mostly isolated.
    IV. Family reunion attempt: This occurs in "The Yellow Wallpaper" when the husband breaks
        down the door. The dynamic is different in "Key West," where the protagonist seeks a
        reunion with someone who is deceased. Thus, it's not a common feature.
    V. External locus of control: Both protagonists feel controlled by outside forces.
       In "The Yellow Wallpaper," it's her husband's medical authority. In "Key West,"
       it's overwhelming grief and a supernatural force.
    VI. Medical nature of conflict: This is central to "The Yellow Wallpaper" (a critique
        of the "rest cure") but is only the inciting incident in "Key West," which is
        framed as a supernatural horror story.

    The common elements are therefore I, II, and V.
