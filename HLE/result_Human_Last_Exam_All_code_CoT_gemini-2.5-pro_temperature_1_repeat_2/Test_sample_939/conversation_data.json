    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Space Conversion**: The problem requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if, after conversion, any of its Red, Green, or Blue components fall outside the standard range for sRGB.\n2.  **Gamut Check**: For a color to be representable in sRGB, its linear sRGB components (R, G, B) must all be within the range `[0, 1]`. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be displayed correctly without clipping or remapping.\n3.  **The Conversion Pipeline**:\n    *   **Linearization**: ROMM RGB values are typically gamma-corrected with a gamma of 1.8. The first step is to convert these non-linear values to a linear representation using the formula: `linear_value = non_linear_value ** 1.8`.\n    *   **Matrix Transformation**: The linear ROMM RGB values must be converted to linear sRGB values. This involves a series of matrix multiplications that account for the different primaries and white points (D50 for ROMM, D65 for sRGB) of the two color spaces. This includes a chromatic adaptation step.\n    *   We can combine all these transformations into a single matrix that directly converts linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB.\n4.  **Implementation in Python**:\n    *   I will use the `numpy` library for efficient vector and matrix calculations.\n    *   I will define the combined conversion matrix, which transforms linear ROMM RGB (D50-adapted) to linear sRGB (D65-adapted).\n    *   The list of five input ROMM RGB colors will be defined.\n    *   I will loop through each color, apply the linearization step, and then multiply by the conversion matrix.\n    *   For each resulting linear sRGB color, I will check if any of its R, G, or B components are outside the `[0, 1]` range.\n    *   I will collect the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n    *   Finally, I will format and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This matrix converts from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB,\n    # including chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65.\n    # It is derived from the standard transformations:\n    # M_sRGB_from_XYZ @ M_CAT_D50_D65 @ M_XYZ_from_ROMM\n    M_romm_to_srgb = np.array([\n        [ 1.34579896, -0.2555801,  -0.05110593],\n        [-0.54462249,  1.50823613, -0.0040523 ],\n        [-0.00000571, -0.00406858,  0.69183244]\n    ])\n\n    # List of the ROMM RGB colors to check\n    colors = [\n        np.array([0, 0, 1]),      # 1\n        np.array([0, 1, 0]),      # 2\n        np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),  # 3\n        np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),# 4\n        np.array([1, 1, 1])       # 5\n    ]\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for i, romm_nl in enumerate(colors):\n        # 1.
