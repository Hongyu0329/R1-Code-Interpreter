    # The coefficient g_0 is the value of the function at x=0.
    # K(0) is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind at k=0, which is pi/2.

    # g_1 = g'(0) = (2/pi) * (pi/8 + pi/2) = 2/pi * 5pi/8 = 5/4.

    # For a matrix with a single Jordan block, the Weyr form is the Jordan form itself.
