    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Use the product formula:** The simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds, such as surfaces of genus $\\ge 2$, is the product of their individual simplicial volumes.\n    $||\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}|| = ||\\Sigma_{g_1}|| \\times ||\\Sigma_{g_2}||$.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for a single surface:** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ with genus $g \\ge 2$ is given by the formula:\n    $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate for each surface:**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. So, $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4 \\times (31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. So, $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4 \\times (17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Compute the final result:**\n    *   $||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 120 \\times 64 = 7680$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Calculate the simplicial volume for the first surface, Sigma_g1\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface of genus g >= 2 is 4*(g-1)\nsv1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\n\n# Calculate the simplicial volume for the second surface, Sigma_g2\nsv2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\n# The simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces is the product of their individual simplicial volumes\ntotal_sv = sv1 * sv2\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final result\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of a surface of genus g >= 2 is given by the formula ||Σ_g|| = 4 * (g - 1).\")\nprint(f\"First, we compute the simplicial volume of Σ_{g1}:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1}|| = 4 * ({g1} - 1) = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"Next, we compute the simplicial volume of Σ_{g2}:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g2}|| = 4 * ({g2} - 1) = {sv2}\")\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of the product Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2} is the product of their individual volumes:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = ||Σ_{g1}|| * ||Σ_{g2}|| = {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\n```\n<<<7680>>>"
