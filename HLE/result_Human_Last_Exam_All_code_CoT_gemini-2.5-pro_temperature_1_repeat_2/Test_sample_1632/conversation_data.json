    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The task is to find the value of `a(10)`, which represents the total number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D Manhattan (square) lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that starts at the origin and never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method**: There is no simple mathematical formula to directly calculate `a(n)`. Therefore, we will use a computational approach to count all possible valid walks. A recursive backtracking algorithm is a perfect fit for this kind of path-finding problem.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Design**:\n    *   We'll define a recursive function that explores paths step by step.\n    *   The function will take the number of remaining steps, the current coordinates, and a set of already visited points as input.\n    *   The walk starts at `(0, 0)`.\n    *   At each position, we try to move in the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).\n    *   A move is valid only if the destination point has not been previously visited in the current path.\n    *   To keep track of visited points efficiently, we use a `set` for O(1) average time complexity lookups.\n    *   The recursion stops when the number of remaining steps becomes zero, which means we have successfully found one valid 10-step walk. In this base case, we return 1.\n    *   The function sums the counts from all valid subsequent moves to get the total number of walks from the current position.\n    *   After exploring a path, we must \"backtrack\" by removing the last point from the visited set, allowing other paths to be explored.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The plan will be implemented in a Python script. The script will initialize the walk at the origin `(0,0)` with `n=10` steps and call the recursive function. Finally, it will print the result in the format `a(10) = result`.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate `a(10)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_saw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is to find a(10).\n    n = 10\n\n    def count_walks(steps_left, x, y, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts self-avoiding walks using backtracking.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining.\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            visited (set): A set of (x, y) tuples of visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we've found one valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # The four possible moves: North, South, East, West.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # A move is valid only if the next point has not been visited.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # Mark the new point as visited for this path.\n                visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n                # Recursively count walks from the new point.\n                count += count_walks(steps_left - 1, next_x, next_y, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to allow other paths to be explored.\n                visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n\n        return count\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_point = (0, 0)\n    # The initial set of visited points contains only the origin.\n    initial_visited = {start_point}\n\n    # Start the calculation.\n    total_walks = count_walks(n, start_point[0], start_point[1], initial_visited)\n\n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final equation a(n) = result.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
