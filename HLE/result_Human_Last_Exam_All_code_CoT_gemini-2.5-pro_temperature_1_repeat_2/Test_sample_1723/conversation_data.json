    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will find the name of the mushroom genus that is famously blue, which is often mistakenly believed to have a blue spore print. The question states \"There is a single genus,\" which points towards a specific, commonly known answer, even if there's a technical inaccuracy in the premise. The genus *Lactarius*, specifically the species *Lactarius indigo* (Indigo Milk Cap), is renowned for its striking blue color and blue latex. While its spore print is actually yellowish to cream, it is the genus universally associated with this \"blue mushroom\" trivia. I will provide a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the name of a mushroom genus known for a distinct blue color,\n# often associated with the myth of a blue spore print.\n# The most famous genus fitting this description is Lactarius, due to the\n# species Lactarius indigo.\n\n# Storing the name of the genus in a variable.\ngenus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\n# Printing the final answer.\nprint(f\"The genus of mushroom known for a distinctly blue species, which is often mistakenly thought to have a blue spore print, is: {genus_name}\")\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
