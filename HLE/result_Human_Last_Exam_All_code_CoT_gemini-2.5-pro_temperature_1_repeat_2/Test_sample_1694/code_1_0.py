# Step 1 & 2: Solve the first Sylvester equation for Y1 = X1^2
# The equation is A1*Y1 + Y1*B1 = C1.
# Since A1, B1, C1 are diagonal, Y1 is also diagonal.
# Let Y1 = [[y1_11, 0], [0, y1_22]].
# The (1,1) element equation is: 5*y1_11 + 6*y1_11 = -53/12
# => 11*y1_11 = -53/12 => y1_11 = -53/(12*11)
y1_11 = -53 / 132
# The (2,2) element equation is: -5*y1_22 + 6*y1_22 = 0 => y1_22 = 0
# So, Y1 = X1^2 is a diagonal matrix with (1,1) element y1_11 and others zero.

# Step 3: Find the first coordinates of the solutions for X1
# We need to find the square root of Y1.
# The solutions for X1 are also diagonal. Let X1 = [[x1_11, 0], [0, x1_22]].
# Then x1_11^2 = y1_11 and x1_22^2 = 0.
# The solutions for the first coordinate x1_11 are the square roots of y1_11.
x1_sol1 = cmath.sqrt(y1_11)
x1_sol2 = -x1_sol1

# Step 4: Solve the second Sylvester equation for Y2 = X2^2
# The equation is A2*Y2 + Y2*B2 = C2.
# Similar to the first equation, Y2 is diagonal. Let Y2 = [[y2_11, 0], [0, y2_22]].
# The (1,1) element equation is: 4*y2_11 + 6*y2_11 = -3/11
# => 10*y2_11 = -3/11 => y2_11 = -3/(11*10)
y2_11 = -3 / 110
# The (2,2) element equation is: -5*y2_22 + 6*y2_22 = 0 => y2_22 = 0

# Step 5: Find the first coordinates of the solutions for X2
# The solutions for X2 are diagonal. Let X2 = [[x2_11, 0], [0, x2_22]].
# Then x2_11^2 = y2_11 and x2_22^2 = 0.
# The solutions for the first coordinate x2_11 are the square roots of y2_11.
x2_sol1 = cmath.sqrt(y2_11)
x2_sol2 = -x2_sol1

# Step 6: Calculate the sum of all first coordinates
total_sum = x1_sol1 + x1_sol2 + x2_sol1 + x2_sol2

# Print the final equation with each number
print("The first coordinates from the solutions are:")
print(f"c1 = {x1_sol1}")
print(f"c2 = {x1_sol2}")
print(f"c3 = {x2_sol1}")
print(f"c4 = {x2_sol2}")
print("\nThe final sum is calculated as:")
# Use .real and .imag for prettier printing if numbers are purely real or imaginary
print(f"({x1_sol1}) + ({x1_sol2}) + ({x2_sol1}) + ({x2_sol2}) = {total_sum}")

# Final Answer
# The result is a complex number (0+0j), which is 0.
final_answer = total_sum.real
print(f"\nThe sum of the first coordinate of solutions is {final_answer}.")
