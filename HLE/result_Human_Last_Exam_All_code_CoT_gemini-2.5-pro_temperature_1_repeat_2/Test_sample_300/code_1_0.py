# The user wants to identify the consequence of a hypothetical algorithm's existence.
# This is a theoretical computer science question, and the answer is derived from
# established theorems rather than a computational task.
# The reasoning is provided in the text above. The final answer is a choice from the list.
# The question asks for a Python or shell script block, so I will provide one that prints the reasoning and the answer.
