        'B': "Incorrect. Internal measures ('ethical walls') are not sufficient to overcome a direct conflict, especially when the prejudiced former client does not consent.",
        'C': "Incorrect. While partner access might be a concern, the core issue is the firm's duty as a whole, not just the status of the lawyers. The fundamental conflict exists regardless.",
        'D': "Correct. This is the central rule. A conflict of interest exists because the firm is acting against a former client in a related matter. To proceed, the firm would need the informed consent of the prejudiced party (Advanced Tech Inc.). Since consent is explicitly withheld, the firm cannot act.",
        'E': "Incorrect. This statement is too absolute. While difficult, representation with conflicts can sometimes proceed if all affected parties give informed consent."
