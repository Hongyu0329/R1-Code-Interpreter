    "My plan is to first understand the core technical differences between the Vaganova (Russian) and Balanchine (American Neoclassical) methods concerning the ballet step *cambré derrière* (a bend of the upper body backward). Then, I will create a Python script that programmatically outlines the characteristics of the movement in each style. The script will compare these characteristics against the provided multiple-choice options to identify the most fundamental and defining difference. Finally, the script will print a clear explanation of this analysis, leading to the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_method_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the key technical differences between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods and identifies the correct answer\n    from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the primary difference in a cambré derrière: Vaganova vs. Balanchine.\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    # Define the characteristics for each method\n    vaganova_technique = {\n        \"Name\": \"Vaganova Method\",\n        \"Hip Placement\": \"Hips are kept square and level, pushed slightly forward to counterbalance the backbend.
