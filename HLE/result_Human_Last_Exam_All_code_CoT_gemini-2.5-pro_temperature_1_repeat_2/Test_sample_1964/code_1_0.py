# This problem is a theoretical question from combinatorial set theory.
# The solution relies on the Finite Root Delta-System Lemma.

# The problem asks for the order type of the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.
# Let Z = Y \setminus (w U {w}).

# Step 1: Apply the Finite Root Delta-System Lemma.
# The conditions on the sequence A guarantee that for any such A, there exists
# an uncountable subfamily (of size omega_1) that is a Delta-system
# with a finite root. This means omega_1 is in Y_A for every A.

# Step 2: Determine the uncountable cardinals in Y_A.
# Since the original family A has size omega_1, any subfamily can have size
# at most omega_1. Therefore, the only uncountable cardinal in any Y_A is omega_1.

# Step 3: Determine the uncountable cardinals in Y.
# Y is the union of all Y_A. Since the set of uncountable cardinals
# in each Y_A is {omega_1}, the set of uncountable cardinals in Y is also {omega_1}.
# So, Z = {omega_1}.

# Step 4: Find the order type of Z.
# The set Z = {omega_1} has only one element.
# A set with one element has an order type of 1.
final_answer = 1

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The final result is the order type.
