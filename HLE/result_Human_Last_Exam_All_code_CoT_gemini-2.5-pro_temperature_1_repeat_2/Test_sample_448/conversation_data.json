    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases**: The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Determine Rarity**: I will compare their abundances in the Earth's atmosphere, which is their primary reservoir. While Radon (Rn) is technically the rarest due to its radioactivity and short half-life, it's often excluded from such comparisons. Among the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is the least abundant. I will proceed with Xenon as the answer, which is standard for this type of question.\n3.  **Find Abundance Data**: The abundance of Xenon in the atmosphere is approximately 0.087 parts per million (ppm).\n4.  **Calculate Percentage**: I will convert the abundance from ppm to a percentage. The conversion formula is: percentage = ppm / 10,000.\n5.  **Generate Code**: The Python code will store the atmospheric abundances of the stable noble gases, identify the one with the minimum value (Xenon), and then print the calculation to convert its ppm value to a percentage.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rarest stable noble gas in Earth's atmosphere\n    and calculates its abundance as a percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Abundance of stable noble gases in Earth's atmosphere in parts per million (ppm)\n    # Data is from 2002 or generally accepted values around that time.\n    noble_gas_abundances_ppm = {\n        'Helium': 5.24,\n        'Neon': 18.18,\n        'Argon': 9340,\n        'Krypton': 1.14,\n        'Xenon': 0.087\n    }\n\n    # Find the rarest gas by finding the minimum value in the dictionary\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundances_ppm, key=noble_gas_abundances_ppm.get)\n    abundance_in_ppm = noble_gas_abundances_ppm[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert abundance from ppm to percentage (1 ppm = 0.0001%)\n    abundance_in_percent = abundance_in_ppm / 10000\n\n    # Print the result and the calculation\n    print(f\"The rarest stable noble gas in Earth's atmosphere is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation for its percentage of all terrestrial matter (approximated by atmospheric abundance) is:\")\n    # Using f-string to format the output to show the full precision of the float\n    print(f\"{abundance_in_ppm} ppm / 10000 = {abundance_in_percent:.7f}%\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Xenon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
