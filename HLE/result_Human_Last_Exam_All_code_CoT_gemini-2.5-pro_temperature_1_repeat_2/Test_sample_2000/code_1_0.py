    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (GHTW)
    of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges and prints the result.

    A hypergraph is H = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of hyperedges.
    The generalized hypertreewidth of H concerns finding a tree decomposition where bags
    are sets of hyperedges, not vertices.

    The width of such a decomposition is the maximum size of any bag. The GHTW is the
    minimum possible width over all valid decompositions.

    We are given a hypergraph H where the number of hyperedges |E| = 3. Let E = {e1, e2, e3}.
