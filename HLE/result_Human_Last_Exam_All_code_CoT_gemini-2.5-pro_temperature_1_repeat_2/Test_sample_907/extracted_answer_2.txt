**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

The equation for the absorption cross-section is:
σ_a(ω) = C ⋅ ω ⋅ N ⋅ |μ ⋅ ε|² ⋅ exp( - (ω₀ - ω)² ⋅ τ² / 2 )

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

The equation for the absorption cross-section is a sum over exciton states:
σ_b(ω) = C ⋅ ω ⋅ Σ_{j=1,3,...}^N |μ ⋅ ε|² ⋅ (2 / (N+1)) ⋅ cot²(πj / (2(N+1))) ⋅ exp( - (ω_j - ω)² ⋅ τ² / 2 )

where the frequency of each exciton peak, ω_j, is given by:
ω_j = ω₀ + (2J / ħ) ⋅ cos(πj / (N+1))
