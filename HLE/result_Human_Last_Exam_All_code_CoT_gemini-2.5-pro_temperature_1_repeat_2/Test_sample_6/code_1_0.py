    Calculates the number of spin-2 KK mode eigenvalues below 14.

    The problem is mapped to a Schr√∂dinger equation -phi'' + V(x)phi = m^2 phi
    with a potential derived from the warp factor A(x).
    V(x) = 4*(A'(x))^2 + 2*A''(x), with A(x) = sin(x) + 4cos(x).
    This gives V(x) = 34 - 8*cos(x) - 2*sin(x) - 30*cos(2*x) - 16*sin(2*x).

    We solve this using a Fourier basis expansion, which turns the problem
    into a matrix eigenvalue problem Hc = m^2 c. The matrix elements are
    H_{mn} = n^2 * delta_{mn} + V_hat_{m-n}, where V_hat are the Fourier
    coefficients of the potential.
