    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations:\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:** I will start by finding the points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are equal to zero. These are the points where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Classify the equilibrium points:** I will linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix at each equilibrium point. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian will tell us the type of each point (e.g., node, saddle, center).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. I will focus on finding the manifolds associated with any saddle points.\n4.  **Find the equation of the separatrix:** I will look for an invariant algebraic curve that passes through the saddle point. I'll do this by testing a simple functional form, $d=f(u)$, and checking if it satisfies the differential equation for the trajectories, $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n5.  **Construct the Python code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints the derived equation of the separatrix, explicitly showing the numerical coefficients as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\nThe system of ODEs is:\n$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u' = u^2(u-1)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\nSet $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n-   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n-   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the half-plane $u \\ge 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Classification of Equilibrium Points**\nThe Jacobian matrix of the system is:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n-   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n-   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n-   At $(0,0)$: $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**3. Identify the Separatrix**\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ are separatrices. The unstable manifold is tangent to the eigenvector corresponding to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=1$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the slope of the unstable manifold at $(1,-1)$ is $-2$.\n\n**4. Find the Equation of the Separatrix**\nLet's search for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$. A simple guess is a parabola. Let's test the specific curve $d = -u^2$.\n-   It passes through the saddle point, since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n-   It passes through the origin, since $0 = -(0)^2$.\n-   The slope at $u=1$ is $\\frac{d(d)}{du}|_{u=1} = -2u|_{u=1} = -2$, which matches the slope of the unstable manifold.\n\nLet's verify if $d=-u^2$ is a trajectory of the system. We can do this by checking if it satisfies the condition $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{d(f(u))}{dt} = f'(u)\\frac{du}{dt}$.\nHere, $f(u) = -u^2$, so $f'(u) = -2u$.\nThe condition is $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$.\nLet's substitute $d=-u^2$ into the first ODE:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nNow let's compute $-2u \\cdot u'$:\n$-2u \\cdot u' = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = -2u \\cdot (u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nSince both expressions are equal, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold. It is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ and therefore is the separatrix.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the equation of the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n\n    The analysis shows that the separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle\n    point at (u, d) = (1, -1).
