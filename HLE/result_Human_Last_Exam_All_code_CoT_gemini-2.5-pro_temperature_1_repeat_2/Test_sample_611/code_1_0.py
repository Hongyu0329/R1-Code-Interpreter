    # The problem asks for the limit: lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3].

    # Step 1: Theoretical Framework
    # According to the theory of sausage densities for transient Markov processes,
    # the random variable V_n converges in probability to a constant c as n approaches infinity.
    # This constant c is the asymptotic density of the sausage S = X_[0,inf) + D_0.

    # Step 2: Formula for the density c
    # The density c is given by the probability that the dual process of X_t,
    # starting from infinity, ever hits the set D_0 (the unit disk).
    # c = P_inf[Y_t hits D_0], where Y_t is the dual process.

    # Step 3: Identify the dual process
    # The process X_t is a Doob's h-transform with h(z) = ln|z|. A process created
    # via Doob's h-transform is reversible with respect to the measure mu(dz) = h(z)^2 dz.
    # For a reversible process, its dual process has the same law as the original process.
    # Therefore, Y_t has the same law as X_t.

    # Step 4: Calculate c
    # The density c is the probability that the original process X_t, starting from infinity,
    # ever hits D_0.
    # c = P_inf[X_t hits D_0]
    # By definition, X_t is a Brownian motion conditioned on *never* hitting D_0.
    # Thus, the probability of this event is 0.
    c = 0

    # Step 5: Final Calculation
    # We have established that V_n converges to 0 in probability.
    # This means that for any epsilon > 0, lim_{n->inf} P(|V_n - 0| >= epsilon) = 0.
    # We need lim_{n->inf} P(V_n > 2/3).
    # Since V_n >= 0, the event {V_n > 2/3} is a subset of {|V_n| >= 2/3}.
    # Therefore, P(V_n > 2/3) <= P(|V_n| >= 2/3).
    # As n -> inf, the right-hand side goes to 0. So the limit of the left-hand side is also 0.

    # The numbers in the final conceptual equation lim P(V_n > a/b) = c are:
    a = 2
    b = 3
    final_limit = c
