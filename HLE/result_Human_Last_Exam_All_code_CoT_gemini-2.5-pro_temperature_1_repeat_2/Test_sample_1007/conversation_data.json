    "Answering this question requires knowledge of classical ballet terminology and the execution of specific steps. I will analyze each option to determine its starting and ending leg positions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs beat six times (three changes). It starts in the fifth position and lands in the fifth position, but with the feet reversed (the foot that was in front is now in the back). Therefore, the start and end positions are different.\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:** `Échappé` means to escape, and `changé` means changed. The step starts in a closed position (fifth), opens to a second position in the air, and lands back in the fifth position with the feet changed. Therefore, the start and end positions are different.\n3.  **C. Assemblé:** `Assemblé` means to assemble. The step starts on one leg while the other brushes out. The dancer then jumps, bringing both legs together (\"assembling\" them) in the air and landing on both feet simultaneously in the fifth position. In a basic `assemblé` (like an `assemblé en place`), the dancer lands in the exact same fifth position they started in. While some variations of `assemblé` do change the feet (e.g., `dessus`, `dessous`), it is the only step in this list that can be performed without changing the starting position.\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:** `Glissade` means to glide, and `derrière` means behind. This is a traveling step. Starting in the fifth position, the back foot glides to the side, and the front foot closes behind it. This reverses the feet. For example, if you start with the right foot front, you end with the left foot front. Therefore, the start and end positions are different.\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step. It is essentially a `pas de chat` where each leg performs a `rond de jambe`. It begins in the fifth position and ends in the fifth position, but with the feet changed. Therefore, the start and end positions are different.\n\nBased on this analysis, `Assemblé` is the correct answer as it's the only step that can conclude in the identical position from which it began. I will now generate a Python script to present this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps_data = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position and lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position and lands in fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (as \"changé\" indicates).'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Assemblé',\n            'description': 'Starts in fifth position, legs \"assemble\" in the air, and lands back in the fifth position.
