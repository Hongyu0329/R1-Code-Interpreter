# The user wants to identify the dance where overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible.
# Let's analyze the options based on ballroom dance technique.

# A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:
# These are all "swing" dances. Turns are created with continuous body rotation, sway, and momentum.
# While syllabus figures have a prescribed amount of turn, a dancer can physically
# add more rotation (overturn). It would be considered poor form or an advanced variation,
# but it is not physically prevented by the core technique of the dance.

# C. European Tango:
# Tango is a "staccato" dance without the continuous swing of the other dances.
# The standard Reverse Turn with a closed finish has a very specific technique:
# Step 1: Forward step
# Step 2: Side step with turn
# Step 3: Feet close together to finish the turn.
# The act of closing the feet on step 3 defines the figure and physically limits the
# amount of rotation possible. To turn more, a dancer would have to avoid closing
# their feet, thus performing a different figure entirely and disregarding the
# fundamental technique of the standard Reverse Turn.

# Conclusion: The technique of closing the feet in a Tango Reverse Turn makes it
# impossible to overturn without disregarding that technique.
