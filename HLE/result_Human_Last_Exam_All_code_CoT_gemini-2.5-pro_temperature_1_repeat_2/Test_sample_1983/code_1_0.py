# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem description.
k1 = 10**3000
k2 = 10**500
lambda1 = 0.5
lambda2 = 0.5
h_norm = 1000

# Step 2: Formulate the hypothesis for the asymptotic norms based on the dichotomy parameters.
# The asymptotic behavior at +infinity is assumed to be determined by the stable part's constants.
# The asymptotic behavior at -infinity is assumed to be determined by the unstable part's constants.
# The specific formula is derived from the bound given in the cited paper [1].
L_plus = (k1 * h_norm) / lambda1
L_minus = (k2 * h_norm) / lambda2

# Step 3: Calculate the two terms of the final expression.
# The expression is: 100 * log10( (1/3) * L_plus ) + 10 * log10( (1/3) * L_minus )

# To handle the very large numbers, we use logarithmic identities:
# log10( (1/3) * L_plus ) = log10(L_plus / 3)
# = log10(k1 * h_norm / lambda1 / 3)
# = log10(k1) + log10(h_norm) - log10(lambda1) - log10(3)
log_val_1 = math.log10(k1) + math.log10(h_norm) - math.log10(lambda1) - math.log10(3)
term1 = 100 * log_val_1

# Similarly for the second term:
# log10( (1/3) * L_minus ) = log10(k2 * h_norm / lambda2 / 3)
# = log10(k2) + log10(h_norm) - log10(lambda2) - log10(3)
log_val_2 = math.log10(k2) + math.log10(h_norm) - math.log10(lambda2) - math.log10(3)
term2 = 10 * log_val_2

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
result = term1 + term2

# Step 5: Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.
# The final equation is: term1 + term2 = result.
# We print the components and the final sum.
