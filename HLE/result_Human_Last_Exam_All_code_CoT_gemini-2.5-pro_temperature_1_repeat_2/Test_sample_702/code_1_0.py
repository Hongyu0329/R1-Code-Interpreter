# The user wants to find the connectivity of the map:
# f: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)
# for p=4 and q=6.

# Step 1: Set the dimensions of the spheres.
p = 4
q = 6

# Step 2: According to a theorem by Porter/Harper, the homotopy fiber of this map is
# F = Omega(Sigma S^p * Sigma S^q), where '*' is the join operation.

# Step 3: The suspension of a sphere S^n is S^{n+1}.
# So, Sigma S^p = S^{p+1} and Sigma S^q = S^{q+1}.
p_susp = p + 1
q_susp = q + 1

# Step 4: The join of two spheres S^a * S^b is S^{a+b+1}.
join_dimension = p_susp + q_susp + 1

# Step 5: The fiber is F = Omega(S^join_dimension).
# The connectivity of Omega(S^n) is n-2 for n >= 2.
# A space is k-connected if its homotopy groups pi_i are trivial for i <= k.
# pi_i(Omega S^n) = pi_{i+1}(S^n).
# pi_{i+1}(S^n) is 0 for i+1 < n, which means i < n-1.
# So Omega S^n is (n-2)-connected.
connectivity = join_dimension - 2

# Step 6: The connectivity of the map is the connectivity of its fiber.
