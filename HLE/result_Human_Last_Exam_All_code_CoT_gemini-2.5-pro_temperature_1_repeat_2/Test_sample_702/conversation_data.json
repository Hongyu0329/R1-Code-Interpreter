    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\alpha: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we need to identify the map in the context of standard constructions in homotopy theory and then apply a known theorem to find the connectivity of its homotopy fiber.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the map and relevant spaces**: The map is a form of a higher-order Hopf invariant or a generalized Whitehead product. The spaces involved are suspensions, loop spaces, and smash products of spheres. Let $X = S^4$ and $Y = S^6$. The map is $\\alpha: \\Sigma ( \\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$.\n\n2.  **Find the appropriate fibration sequence**: A result in homotopy theory, discussed by authors like G. J. Porter and J. R. Harper, states that the map $\\alpha$ fits into a homotopy fibration sequence of the form:\n    $$F \\to \\Sigma ( \\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$$\n    where the homotopy fiber $F$ is given by $\\Omega(\\Sigma X * \\Sigma Y)$. The operation $*$ denotes the join of two topological spaces.\n\n3.  **Determine the fiber for the given spaces**:\n    *   Let $X = S^4$ and $Y = S^6$.\n    *   Then $\\Sigma X = \\Sigma S^4 = S^5$, and $\\Sigma Y = \\Sigma S^6 = S^7$.\n    *   The fiber $F$ is $\\Omega(S^5 * S^7)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the join space**: The join of two spheres $S^p$ and $S^q$ is a sphere of higher dimension: $S^p * S^q = S^{p+q+1}$.\n    *   So, $S^5 * S^7 = S^{5+7+1} = S^{13}$.\n    *   The fiber is therefore $F = \\Omega S^{13}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the connectivity of the fiber**: The connectivity of a map is defined as the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. We need to find the connectivity of $F = \\Omega S^{13}$.\n    *   A space $Z$ is $k$-connected if all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(Z)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n    *   The homotopy groups of a loop space are related to the homotopy groups of the original space by the formula $\\pi_i(\\Omega Z) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(Z)$.\n    *   For the sphere $S^n$ (with $n \\ge 2$), the first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_n(S^n) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   For the fiber $F=\\Omega S^{13}$, we have $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{13}) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^{13})$.\n    *   $\\pi_{i+1}(S^{13})$ is trivial for $i+1 < 13$, which means $i < 12$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^{13})$ is trivial for $i \\le 11$. This means $\\Omega S^{13}$ is 11-connected.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The connectivity of the map is equal to the connectivity of its fiber. Since the fiber $\\Omega S^{13}$ is 11-connected, the map is 11-connected.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result based on the dimensions of the initial spheres.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the connectivity of the map:\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n# for p=4 and q=6.\n\n# Step 1: Set the dimensions of the spheres.\np = 4\nq = 6\n\n# Step 2: According to a theorem by Porter/Harper, the homotopy fiber of this map is\n# F = Omega(Sigma S^p * Sigma S^q), where '*' is the join operation.\n\n# Step 3: The suspension of a sphere S^n is S^{n+1}.\n# So, Sigma S^p = S^{p+1} and Sigma S^q = S^{q+1}.\np_susp = p + 1\nq_susp = q + 1\n\n# Step 4: The join of two spheres S^a * S^b is S^{a+b+1}.\njoin_dimension = p_susp + q_susp + 1\n\n# Step 5: The fiber is F = Omega(S^join_dimension).\n# The connectivity of Omega(S^n) is n-2 for n >= 2.\n# A space is k-connected if its homotopy groups pi_i are trivial for i <= k.\n# pi_i(Omega S^n) = pi_{i+1}(S^n).\n# pi_{i+1}(S^n) is 0 for i+1 < n, which means i < n-1.\n# So Omega S^n is (n-2)-connected.\nconnectivity = join_dimension - 2\n\n# Step 6: The connectivity of the map is the connectivity of its fiber.\nprint(f\"The dimensions of the spheres are p = {p} and q = {q}.\")\nprint(f\"The map is f: Sigma(Omega S^{p}) wedge Omega S^{q}) -> Omega(S^{p} wedge S^{q}).\")\nprint(f\"The fiber of this map is Omega(Sigma S^{p} * Sigma S^{q}) = Omega(S^{p+1} * S^{q+1}).\")\nprint(f\"The join S^{p+1} * S^{q+1} is S^({p+1} + {q+1} + 1) = S^{join_dimension}.\")\nprint(f\"The fiber is Omega(S^{join_dimension}).\")\nprint(f\"The connectivity of Omega(S^n) is n-2.\")\nprint(f\"The connectivity of the map is therefore {join_dimension} - 2 = {connectivity}.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(connectivity)\n```\n<<<11>>>"
