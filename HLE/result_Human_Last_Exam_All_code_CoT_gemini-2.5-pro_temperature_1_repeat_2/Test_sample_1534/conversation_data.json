    "This is a biological question about the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*). My plan is to first identify the relevant brain structures based on established cephalopod neuroanatomical knowledge. The cuttlefish brain is broadly divided into a supraesophageal mass (above the esophagus) and a subesophageal mass (below the esophagus). The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass. I will determine which named lobes or structures are situated directly posterior to it. Finally, I will present this information in a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the brain regions adjacent\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The palliovisceral lobe is a large structure in the posterior subesophageal mass of the cephalopod brain.\n    At its posterior end, it gives rise to functionally distinct regions that are responsible for controlling\n    the mantle and chromatophores.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the brain regions\n    region1 = \"posterior chromatophore lobes\"\n    region2 = \"giant fiber lobe\"\n    \n    # Construct the final answer string\n    answer = (f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe \"\n              f\"in the dwarf cuttlefish are the {region1} and the {region2}.\")\n              \n    print(answer)\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the main body of the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the giant fiber lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
