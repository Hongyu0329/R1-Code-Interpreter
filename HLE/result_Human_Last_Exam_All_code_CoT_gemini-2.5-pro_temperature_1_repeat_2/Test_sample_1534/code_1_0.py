    This function provides information on the brain regions adjacent

    The palliovisceral lobe is a large structure in the posterior subesophageal mass of the cephalopod brain.
    At its posterior end, it gives rise to functionally distinct regions that are responsible for controlling
    the mantle and chromatophores.
