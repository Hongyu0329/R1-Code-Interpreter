# The question asks for a conceptual answer, which is "True".
# The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) is measured by its R-squared value in an independent sample.
# SNP heritability is the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by the SNPs.
# A PGS is a practical model built on estimated effects from a finite sample, so its performance
# will be limited by estimation error and other factors.
# Therefore, the PGS R-squared is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.

# This code will print the correct answer to the statement.
