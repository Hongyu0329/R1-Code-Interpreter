    "The statement addresses the relationship between two key concepts in statistical genetics: SNP heritability and the predictive power of a Polygenic Score (PGS).\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This represents the proportion of variation in a trait that can be explained by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are measured, typically on a genotyping chip. It is a theoretical upper limit on how much of a trait's variance can be predicted using a linear model of these SNPs. It's a property of the population.\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** A PGS is a practical predictive model. It's constructed using effect sizes estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of a finite \"discovery\" sample. Its predictive ability (measured as R²) is then evaluated in a separate, independent \"target\" sample.\n\nThe predictive ability of the PGS is always lower than the SNP heritability for several reasons:\n1.  **Estimation Error:** The effect sizes used to build the PGS are *estimates* from a finite discovery sample, not the true underlying effect sizes. This sampling error reduces predictive accuracy.\n2.  **Model Imperfections:** The methods used to build PGS (e.g., clumping and thresholding, or more complex Bayesian methods) are imperfect and cannot fully capture the true, complex genetic architecture.\n3.  **Differences between Samples:** The discovery and target samples may have subtle differences in ancestry, linkage disequilibrium patterns, or environmental factors, which can reduce the PGS's performance.\n\nIn essence, SNP heritability is the theoretical ceiling, while the PGS R² is the achieved performance of a real-world model. The performance of the model can approach the ceiling as the discovery sample size becomes infinitely large, but it can never exceed it. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for a conceptual answer, which is \"True\".\n# The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) is measured by its R-squared value in an independent sample.\n# SNP heritability is the theoretical maximum variance that can be explained by the SNPs.\n# A PGS is a practical model built on estimated effects from a finite sample, so its performance\n# will be limited by estimation error and other factors.\n# Therefore, the PGS R-squared is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n# This code will print the correct answer to the statement.\nanswer = \"True\"\nprint(answer)\n```\n<<<True>>>"
