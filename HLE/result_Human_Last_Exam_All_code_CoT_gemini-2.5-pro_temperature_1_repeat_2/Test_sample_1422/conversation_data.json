    "My plan is to solve this problem by using the general topological formulas that govern the structure of Feynman diagrams.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Formulas:** There are two fundamental relationships for any Feynman diagram:\n    *   The number of loops (`L`) is given by `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators) and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   A second relation comes from counting the \"ends\" of the lines. If each vertex is an `n`-point interaction (like `n=4` for a $\\phi^4$ theory), the total number of line ends connected to vertices is `n * V`. These ends must be connected to either internal lines (which have two ends) or external lines (which have one end). This gives the formula `n * V = 2 * I + E`, where `E` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Combine and Solve:** I will combine these two formulas to derive a single equation that relates the number of vertices `V` to the number of loops `L`, external lines `E`, and the interaction type `n`. We are given `L=2`.\n\n3.  **Minimize Vertices:** The final equation will be `V = (2*L - 2 + E) / (n - 2)`. With `L=2`, this simplifies to `V = (2 + E) / (n - 2)`. To find the minimum possible integer `V`, I will need to find the right combination of `n` (the interaction type) and `E` (the number of external lines) that makes `V` as small as possible, while still being a positive integer.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that formalizes this process. The script will explain the formulas, perform the derivation, and then systematically check different plausible values for `n` and `E` to find the minimum `V`. The script will print out the logic and the final calculation that yields the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a generic interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of loops (L) in a Feynman diagram is given by the topological formula:\n    # L = I - V + 1\n    # where I is the number of internal lines and V is the number of vertices.\n    L = 2\n    print(f\"We are given the number of loops, L = {L}.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the number of loops is: L = I - V + 1\")\n    print(\"For L=2, this means the number of internal lines (I) is: I = V + 1\\n\")\n\n    # The second formula relates the vertices to the lines.
