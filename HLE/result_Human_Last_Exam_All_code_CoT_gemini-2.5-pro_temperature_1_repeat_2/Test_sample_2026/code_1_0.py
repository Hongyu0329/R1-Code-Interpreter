# Step 1: Derive the equation for the locus of points (x₀, y₀, z₀).
# Based on the perturbation analysis of the system, the solvability conditions are found to be:
# α = (y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
# β = (x₀² + z₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
# γ = (x₀² + y₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
# where x₀ = x₀(0), y₀ = y₀(0), z₀ = z₀(0).

# Step 2: Sum these conditions and use the given constraint.
# Summing the three equations gives:
# α + β + γ = (y₀² + z₀² + x₀² + z₀² + x₀² + y₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
# α + β + γ = 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
#
# We are given the constraint: α + β + γ = 10²⁵ * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
#
# Substituting this into our summed equation:
# 10²⁵ * (1 - e⁻ᵀ) = 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) * (1 - e⁻ᵀ)
#
# Assuming T > 0, (1 - e⁻ᵀ) is not zero, so we can divide by it:
# 10²⁵ = 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²)
#
# This simplifies to the equation of a sphere:
# x₀² + y₀² + z₀² = 10²⁵ / 2

# Step 3: Calculate the surface area of this sphere.
# The equation is of the form x² + y² + z² = R², where R is the radius.
# The radius squared, R², is:
radius_squared = 10**25 / 2

# The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4 * π * R².
# We will now calculate this area.

# The numbers in the final equation for the area are 4, π, and R².
