    "Of course. Here is the plan to derive the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in `φ⁴` theory.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Beta Function:** The first step is to write down the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the dimensionless coupling constant `u` in `φ⁴` theory. This function describes how the coupling `u` changes with the energy scale. In `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the beta function to one-loop order is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3 * u²) / (16 * π²)`\n\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, denoted as `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point where the coupling constant no longer changes. This occurs when the beta function is zero. So, we need to solve the equation:\n    `β(u*) = 0`\n\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** By substituting the expression for `β(u)` and solving for `u*`, we can find the non-trivial fixed point (known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point). The equation is:\n    `-ϵu* + (3 * (u*)²) / (16 * π²) = 0`\n\n4.  **Isolate u*:** Assuming `u*` is not the trivial zero solution, we can divide the equation by `u*` and rearrange it to find the expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out these derivation steps and displays the final equation, highlighting each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script derives and displays the leading order expression for the \n# Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in φ^4 theory near four dimensions.\n\n# Step 1: Define the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions.\nprint(\"Step 1: The one-loop beta function for the coupling u is given by:\")\nprint(\"β(u) = -ϵ*u + (3 * u^2) / (16 * π^2)\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Set the beta function to zero to find the fixed point u*.\nprint(\"Step 2: A non-trivial fixed point u* is found by setting β(u*) = 0:\")\nprint(\"-ϵ*u* + (3 * (u*)^2) / (16 * π^2) = 0\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Solve the equation for u* (assuming u* ≠ 0).\nprint(\"Step 3: Solving for u* in terms of ϵ:\")\nprint(\"Divide by u* -> -ϵ + (3 * u*) / (16 * π^2) = 0\")\nprint(\"Rearrange -> (3 * u*) / (16 * π^2) = ϵ\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Present the final expression.\nprint(\"Step 4: The final leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\")\nnumerator_coeff = 16\ndenominator_coeff = 3\npi_squared_str = \"π^2\"\nepsilon_str = \"ϵ\"\n\n# Output the final equation, showing each component clearly.\nprint(f\"u* = ({numerator_coeff} * {pi_squared_str} / {denominator_coeff}) * {epsilon_str}\")\n\n```\n<<<(16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
