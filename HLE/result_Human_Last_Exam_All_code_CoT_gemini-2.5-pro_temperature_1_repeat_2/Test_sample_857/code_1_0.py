    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal.

    Step 1: Relate coastal points to a more standard concept.
    A point p in a continuum X is a coastal point if there exists a dense, continuum-connected set S with p in S and S subset X. The set of points where X fails to be coastal are the non-coastal points.
    A key theorem in continuum theory (by A. Illanes and others) states that for a hereditarily decomposable continuum X, the set of non-coastal points is identical to the set of endpoints of X.
    An endpoint p of X is a point such that for any two subcontinua A and B of X containing p, either A is a subset of B or B is a subset of A.
    Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the largest possible cardinality of the set of endpoints of a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    Step 2: Establish an upper bound for the cardinality.
    In the context of such problems, "continuum" is standardly assumed to mean a *metrizable* continuum (i.e., a compact, connected metric space). Without this assumption, the question is not well-posed as one could construct examples with arbitrarily large cardinality.
    Any metrizable continuum is separable and has a cardinality of at most c, the cardinality of the continuum (c = 2^aleph_0).
    Since the set of endpoints is a subset of the continuum, its cardinality can be at most c.

    Step 3: Show the upper bound is achievable.
    We need to construct an example of a hereditarily decomposable continuum whose set of endpoints has cardinality c.
    Consider the standard Cantor set, C, in the interval [0, 1]. The Cantor set is compact and has cardinality c.
    Now, construct a cone over the Cantor set with an apex at p = (0.5, 1) in the plane R^2. This continuum, X, consists of all the line segments connecting the apex p to each point in the Cantor set C (which lies on the x-axis).
    - X is a compact, connected metric space, so it is a metrizable continuum.
    - X is a dendroid, which is a class of continua that are hereditarily decomposable.
    - The endpoints of this cone X are precisely the points of the Cantor set C. The apex p is not an endpoint, nor are the interior points of the line segments.
    - The set of endpoints of X therefore has cardinality |C| = c.

    Step 4: Conclusion.
    We have shown that the cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is bounded above by c, and that a cardinality of c can be achieved.
    Therefore, the largest possible cardinality is c.
