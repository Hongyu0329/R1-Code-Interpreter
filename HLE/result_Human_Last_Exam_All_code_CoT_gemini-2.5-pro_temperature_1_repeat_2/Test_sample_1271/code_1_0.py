         "2. A closed ray: {t*f | t >= 0}. This occurs, for example, when a line coincides with one of the rays of a bent line.\n"

         "1. The single point {0}: This is the first class.\n"
         "2. The closed ray {t*f | t >= 0}: This space is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1]. This is the second class.\n"

         "- A point space is distinct from the others (e.g., by cardinality or connectivity properties).\n"
         "- An interval [0, 1] is compact, while the real line R is not, so they are not homeomorphic.\n"
