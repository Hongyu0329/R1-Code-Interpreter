    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the author begins listing the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an after an introductory verse. My plan is to identify the exact starting verse where the first prophet's name appears and the ending verse where the last prophet's name is mentioned. I will then use a Python script to state this range clearly.\n\n1.  **Verse 38**: The author introduces the topic: `تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ...` (The detailed account of twenty-five is a must...).\n2.  **Verse 39**: The list of names begins with Adam: `هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ...` (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with...). This is our starting point.\n3.  **Verses 40-41**: The list continues with more prophets.\n4.  **Verse 42**: The list concludes with Prophet Muhammad (referred to as Taha): `...عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا` (...'Isa, and Taha, the seal, leave misguidance). This is our ending point.\n5.  **Verse 43**: This verse is a prayer for all the prophets mentioned, confirming the list has concluded.\n\nTherefore, the names are mentioned from verse 39 to verse 42. I will now generate the Python code to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that mention the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 39\n    end_bayt = 42\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from bayt:\")\n    print(f\"Start: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"End:   {end_bayt}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the names are listed from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<From bayt 39 to bayt 42>>>"
