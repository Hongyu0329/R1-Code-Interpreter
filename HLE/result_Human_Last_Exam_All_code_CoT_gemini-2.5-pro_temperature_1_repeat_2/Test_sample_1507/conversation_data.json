    "To determine the number of visible triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron, we need to understand its geometry.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the object:** The object is the \"great icosahedron,\" which is one of the four non-convex regular polyhedra known as Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.\n2.  **Understand the \"outer-hull\":** The \"outer-hull\" refers to the convex hull of the polyhedron. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that contains the entire object. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Analyze the \"visible triangles\":** The phrase \"visible triangles from the outside\" corresponds to the faces of this convex hull. Since the faces of the great icosahedron intersect each other, the parts that are visible from the outside form a new polyhedron, which is its convex hull.\n4.  **Count the faces:** A regular icosahedron is a standard Platonic solid with 20 triangular faces.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe Python code below will state this value and print it as the final result.\n\n```python\n# A great icosahedron is a complex, self-intersecting polyhedron.\n# The \"outer-hull\" or \"convex hull\" of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# The \"visible triangles from the outside\" are the faces of this regular icosahedron.\n\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n# Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n\n# Therefore, the number of visible triangles is 20.\nnum_visible_triangles = 20\n\n# The final equation is simply stating this number.\nprint(\"The number of visible triangles on the outer-hull of the great icosahedron = \" + str(num_visible_triangles))\n```\n<<<20>>>"
