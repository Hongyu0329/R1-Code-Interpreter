    "To find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can classify the categories based on how the morphisms are distributed. This is a combinatorial problem that requires analyzing possible structures and checking for isomorphisms.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Let the two objects be A and B. A category must have identity morphisms for each object, so we have $id_A: A \\to A$ and $id_B: B \\to B$. This accounts for 2 of the 4 morphisms.\n2.  The remaining 2 non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$, must be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: Hom(A, A), Hom(A, B), Hom(B, A), and Hom(B, B).\n3.  I will enumerate all possible distributions of these 2 morphisms, which correspond to partitions of the number 2 into 4 parts.\n4.  For each distribution, I will determine the number of non-isomorphic category structures that can be defined. This involves defining the composition of morphisms consistently with the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n5.  I will consider isomorphisms between categories, particularly those that arise from swapping the objects A and B. This helps to avoid overcounting.\n6.  Finally, I will sum the counts from all distinct cases to get the total number of non-isomorphic categories.\n\nThe following Python code will print a detailed step-by-step explanation of this enumeration and calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step derivation of the number of \n    categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Problem: Find the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Basic setup\")\n    print(\"Let the two objects be A and B.\")\n    print(\"Any category with these objects must include identity morphisms id_A: A -> A and id_B: B -> B.\")\n    print(\"This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms.\")\n    print(\"We are left with 2 non-identity morphisms to place.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Distribute the remaining 2 morphisms\")\n    print(\"Let n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB be the number of non-identity morphisms in Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), and Hom(B,B) respectively.\")\n    print(\"The total number of morphisms is |Hom(A,A)| + |Hom(A,B)| + |Hom(B,A)| + |Hom(B,B)| = 4.\")\n    print(\"Since |Hom(X,X)| includes the identity, |Hom(A,A)| = n_AA + 1 and |Hom(B,B)| = n_BB + 1.\")\n    print(\"The total number of non-identity morphisms is n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 2.\")\n    print(\"We list the possible integer partitions of 2 into 4 parts (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB):\")\n    \n    partitions = [\n        (2, 0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 2),\n        (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1),\n        (0, 1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1)\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"These correspond to the following sizes of Hom-sets (|Hom(A,A)|, |Hom(A,B)|, |Hom(B,A)|, |Hom(B,B)|):\")\n    # We add 1 to n_AA and n_BB for the identity morphisms\n    hom_set_sizes = sorted([(p[0]+1, p[1], p[2], p[3]+1) for p in partitions], reverse=True)\n    \n    case_map = {\n        (3, 0, 0, 1): \"Case 1\", (1, 0, 0, 3): \"Case 1 (Symmetric)\",\n        (2, 1, 0, 1): \"Case 2\", (1, 1, 0, 2): \"Case 2 (Symmetric)\",\n        (2, 0, 1, 1): \"Case 3\", (1, 0, 1, 2): \"Case 3 (Symmetric)\",\n        (1, 2, 0, 1): \"Case 4\", (1, 0, 2, 1): \"Case 4 (Symmetric)\",\n        (2, 0, 0, 2): \"Case 5\",\n        (1, 1, 1, 1): \"Case 6\"\n    }\n    \n    for i, sizes in enumerate(hom_set_sizes):\n        print(f\"  {i+1}. {sizes}  ({case_map.get(sizes, 'N/A')})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze cases up to isomorphism (including swapping A and B)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCase A: Partitions asymmetric under A <-> B swap\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Case 1: (3,0,0,1) and (1,0,0,3)\n    print(\"1.
