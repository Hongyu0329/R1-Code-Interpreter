def solve_hypersphere_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the minimum possible value for the maximum number of points
    in any single closed hyper-hemisphere for N points on a d-dimensional sphere.

    The derivation follows these steps:
    1. Let N be the number of points and d be the dimension of the ambient space.
    2. Let K be the value we are looking for: the minimized maximum number of points in any hemisphere.
    3. For any configuration, there exists a hyperplane through the origin containing at least 2 points.
       This means that for some orientation u, the number of points on the boundary n_0(u) is at least 2.
       So, max(n_0(u)) >= 2.
    4. We also derived the inequality n_0(u) <= 2*K - N for any u.
    5. Combining these, we get 2 <= 2*K - N.
    6. Solving for K gives K >= (N + 2) / 2.
    7. Since K must be an integer, K >= ceil((N + 2) / 2).
