    "To answer your question, let's break down the structural differences between polynucleotides and polysaccharides.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Polynucleotide:** Explain its monomer (nucleotide) and the linking bond (phosphodiester bond). A nucleotide consists of a phosphate, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base.\n2.  **Define Polysaccharide:** Explain its monomer (monosaccharide) and the linking bond (glycosidic bond). A monosaccharide is a simple sugar.\n3.  **Compare Key Features:** Highlight the fundamental differences in their building blocks (monomers), the chemical nature of their backbones (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-sugar), and their elemental composition (presence of phosphorus and nitrogen in polynucleotides).\n4.  **Conclusion:** Conclude that due to these significant structural differences, polynucleotides are not a type of polysaccharide.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that prints this detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains why polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. This holds true even for homopolynucleotides.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a breakdown of the key structural differences:\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1. Monomers (Building Blocks)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Polysaccharides: Composed of simple sugar monomers called monosaccharides (e.g., glucose).\")\n    print(\"Polynucleotides: Composed of complex monomers called nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three distinct parts:\")\n    print(\"   a) A phosphate group\")\n    print(\"   b) A five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose)\")\n    print(\"   c) A nitrogenous base\")\n\n    print(\"\\n2. Backbone and Linkages\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Polysaccharides: Monomers are linked directly to each other via glycosidic bonds, forming a backbone made entirely of sugar units.\")\n    print(\"Polynucleotides: Monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which connect the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of the next. This creates a repeating sugar-phosphate backbone.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. Elemental Composition\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose): Primarily composed of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).\")\n    print(\"Polynucleotides (e.g., DNA, RNA): Always contain Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) in addition to Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSummary:\")\n    print(\"While both are polymers and both contain sugar moieties, their monomers, backbone structure, and fundamental chemical composition are entirely different. A polynucleotide has a sugar-phosphate backbone, whereas a polysaccharide has a sugar-sugar backbone.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_structural_differences()\n```\n<<<No>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
