    print("Polysaccharides: Composed of simple sugar monomers called monosaccharides (e.g., glucose).")
    print("Polynucleotides: Composed of complex monomers called nucleotides. Each nucleotide has three distinct parts:")
    print("   a) A phosphate group")
    print("   b) A five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose)")
    print("   c) A nitrogenous base")

    print("\n2. Backbone and Linkages")
    print("-" * 30)
    print("Polysaccharides: Monomers are linked directly to each other via glycosidic bonds, forming a backbone made entirely of sugar units.")
    print("Polynucleotides: Monomers are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which connect the sugar of one nucleotide to the phosphate group of the next. This creates a repeating sugar-phosphate backbone.")

    print("\n3. Elemental Composition")
    print("-" * 30)
    print("Polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose): Primarily composed of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).")
    print("Polynucleotides (e.g., DNA, RNA): Always contain Phosphorus (P) and Nitrogen (N) in addition to Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen.")

    print("\nSummary:")
    print("While both are polymers and both contain sugar moieties, their monomers, backbone structure, and fundamental chemical composition are entirely different. A polynucleotide has a sugar-phosphate backbone, whereas a polysaccharide has a sugar-sugar backbone.")
