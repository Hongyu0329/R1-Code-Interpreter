This stereocenter was eliminated in the first step of the synthesis (E2 elimination) to form the achiral alkene, but-3-enylbenzene. Since all subsequent intermediates and reactions did not introduce any new chiral centers, the final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, has no chiral centers and is therefore achiral.")
