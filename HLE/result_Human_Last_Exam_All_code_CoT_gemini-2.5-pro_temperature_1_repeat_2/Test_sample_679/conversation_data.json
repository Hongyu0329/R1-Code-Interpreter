    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:** The formula C₇H₁₄ corresponds to the general formula CₙH₂ₙ. This indicates a degree of unsaturation of one, meaning the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (δ > 100 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond.\n    *   **145(s):** The 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens) that is part of the double bond.\n    *   **112(t):** The 't' (triplet) indicates a CH₂ group, specifically a terminal alkene group (=CH₂).\n    *   Together, these two signals point to a disubstituted double bond of the type R₂C=CH₂.\n    *   The remaining signals are in the aliphatic region:\n        *   **48(t):** A CH₂ group.\n        *   **27(d):** A CH group.\n        *   **22(q):** A CH₃ group.\n        *   **21(q):** A CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Account for All Atoms (Signal Overlapping):**\n    *   The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 distinct NMR signals. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\n    *   To satisfy the molecular formula C₇H₁₄, we need to account for all 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n    *   Let's check which signal could represent two carbons. If one of the quartet (CH₃) signals represents two equivalent methyl groups, our atom count works out:\n        *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 2(q) + 1(q) = 7 Carbons.\n        *   Hydrogens: 0(from C) + 2(from CH₂) + 2(from CH₂) + 1(from CH) + 6(from 2xCH₃) + 3(from CH₃) = 14 Hydrogens.\n    *   This confirms the presence of two equivalent methyl groups. The most common structural feature that gives rise to two equivalent methyls and a CH signal is an **isopropyl group, -CH(CH₃)₂**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have identified the following structural fragments:\n        1.  A terminal alkene group: `>C=CH₂`\n        2.  An isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`\n        3.  An ethyl group: `-CH₂CH₃` (from the remaining -CH₂- and -CH₃ fragments).\n    *   The only way to connect these three fragments to form a stable C₇H₁₄ molecule is to attach the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n    *   This gives the structure: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)(CH(CH₃)₂)`.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   To name the structure `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)(CH(CH₃)₂) `, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   The longest such chain is 4 carbons long (`CH₂=C-CH-CH₃`), which is a butene chain.\n    *   We number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number, so it is a 1-butene.\n    *   The parent chain has a methyl group at position 3, making it `3-methyl-1-butene`.\n    *   There is an ethyl group attached to position 2.\n    *   Combining these gives the final IUPAC name: **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. This structure has no chiral centers, so the two methyls of the isopropyl group are equivalent, consistent with the 6 signals observed in the NMR spectrum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the IUPAC name for the compound C7H14 based on the provided 13C NMR data.\n    The reasoning is as follows:\n    1.  The molecular formula C7H14 has a degree of unsaturation of 1.\n    2.  13C NMR signals at 145(s) and 112(t) confirm a >C=CH2 group.\n    3.  Having 6 signals for 7 carbons implies two carbons are chemically equivalent.\n    4.  The combination of signals at 27(d) and a quartet representing two carbons points to an isopropyl group [-CH(CH3)2].\n    5.  The remaining signals at 48(t) and a quartet correspond to an ethyl group [-CH2CH3].\n    6.  Assembling these pieces [>C=CH2, ethyl, and isopropyl] yields the structure CH2=C(CH2CH3)(CH(CH3)2).\n    7.  The IUPAC name for this structure is 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation is the IUPAC name, which includes numbers.\n    iupac_name = \"2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene\"\n    \n    print(\"The IUPAC name of the compound is:\")\n    print(iupac_name)\n\nsolve_iupac_name()\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene>>>\n```"
