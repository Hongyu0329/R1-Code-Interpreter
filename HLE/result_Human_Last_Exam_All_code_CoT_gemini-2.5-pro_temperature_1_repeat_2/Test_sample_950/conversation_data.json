    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. This is a compact manifold of dimension $3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Determine Cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients**: The dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$ are given by the number of Schubert symbols, which are partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ fitting into a $3 \\times (5-3) = 3 \\times 2$ box, i.e., $2 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 0$. The degree of the corresponding Schubert class is $|\\lambda| = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$.\n    -   dim $H^0$: 1 partition (0,0,0)\n    -   dim $H^1$: 1 partition (1,0,0)\n    -   dim $H^2$: 2 partitions (2,0,0), (1,1,0)\n    -   dim $H^3$: 2 partitions (2,1,0), (1,1,1)\n    -   dim $H^4$: 2 partitions (2,2,0), (2,1,1)\n    -   dim $H^5$: 1 partition (2,2,1)\n    -   dim $H^6$: 1 partition (2,2,2)\n    Let's denote these dimensions by $h_i$. So, we have $h = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1]$.\n\n3.  **Determine Integral Betti Numbers**: The integral Betti numbers, $\\beta_i = \\mathrm{rank}(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, are equal to the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q})$. The rational cohomology ring of the Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ is given by $H^*(Gr(k,n);\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[p_1, \\dots, p_{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor}, \\bar{p}_1, \\dots, \\bar{p}_{\\lfloor (n-k)/2 \\rfloor}] / I$, where $p_i$ and $\\bar{p}_i$ are the Pontryagin classes of the tautological and complementary bundles, and the ideal $I$ is generated by the relations derived from $p(\\gamma \\oplus \\gamma^\\perp) = p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp) = 1$. For $Gr(3,5)$, we have $k=3, n-k=2$. The ring is generated by $p_1(\\gamma)$ and $\\bar{p}_1(\\gamma^\\perp)$. The relations force $p_1=0$ and $\\bar{p}_1=0$. Thus, the rational cohomology is trivial in positive degrees. This means $\\beta_0=1$ and $\\beta_i=0$ for $i > 0$. So, we have $\\beta = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT)**: The UCT gives a short exact sequence relating integral and mod 2 cohomology:\n    $0 \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathrm{Tor}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$.\n    For dimensions of these vector spaces over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, this implies $h_i = \\beta_i + t_{i+1}$, where $t_{i+1}$ is the rank of the 2-torsion subgroup of $H^{i+1}(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. Note that for real Grassmannians, the torsion is entirely 2-torsion.\n\n5.  **Calculate Torsion Ranks**: We can now compute the ranks of the torsion subgroups $t_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n    -   $h_0 = \\beta_0 + t_1 \\implies 1 = 1 + t_1 \\implies t_1=0$\n    -   $h_1 = \\beta_1 + t_2 \\implies 1 = 0 + t_2 \\implies t_2=1$\n    -   $h_2 = \\beta_2 + t_3 \\implies 2 = 0 + t_3 \\implies t_3=2$\n    -   $h_3 = \\beta_3 + t_4 \\implies 2 = 0 + t_4 \\implies t_4=2$\n    -   $h_4 = \\beta_4 + t_5 \\implies 2 = 0 + t_5 \\implies t_5=2$\n    -   $h_5 = \\beta_5 + t_6 \\implies 1 = 0 + t_6 \\implies t_6=1$\n    So, the ranks of the torsion subgroups $T_i = \\mathrm{Tors}(H^i(Gr(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}))$ are $t_i = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n\n6.  **Find the final answer**: The rank of the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the sum of the ranks of the torsion part of each cohomology group: $\\sum_{i=1}^6 t_i$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is the Grassmannian Gr(3,5).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dimension of the manifold\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    dim = k * (n - k)\n\n    # h_i = dim(H^i(Gr(3,5); Z/2Z)) from Schubert calculus\n    # Partitions (l_1, l_2, l_3) with 2 >= l_1 >= l_2 >= l_3 >= 0\n    # deg 0: (0,0,0) -> 1\n    # deg 1: (1,0,0) -> 1\n    # deg 2: (2,0,0), (1,1,0) -> 2\n    # deg 3: (2,1,0), (1,1,1) -> 2\n    # deg 4: (2,2,0), (2,1,1) -> 2\n    # deg 5: (2,2,1) -> 1\n    # deg 6: (2,2,2) -> 1\n    h = np.array([1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1])\n    print(f\"The dimensions of the mod 2 cohomology groups h_i are: {h.tolist()}\")\n\n    # beta_i = rank(H^i(Gr(3,5); Z)), from rational cohomology calculation.\n    # H*(Gr(3,5); Q) = Q.
