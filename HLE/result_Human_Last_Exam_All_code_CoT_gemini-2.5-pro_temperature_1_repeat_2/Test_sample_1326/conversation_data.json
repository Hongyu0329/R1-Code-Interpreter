    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the function p(x) over the interval [0, 4]. The function is defined piecewise, so we must split the integral into two parts corresponding to the different definitions of the function.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Split the Integral**: The total integral from 0 to 4 is the sum of two integrals:\n    *   The integral of the first function definition, $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$, from x = 0 to x = 3.\n    *   The integral of the second function definition, $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$, from x = 3 to x = 4.\n\n2.  **Define the Functions**: Create Python functions for each piece of p(x).\n\n3.  **Numerical Integration**: Use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically compute the value of each definite integral. This function is highly accurate and suitable for complex integrands.\n\n4.  **Sum the Results**: Add the results of the two integrals to get the final answer.\n\n5.  **Output the Calculation**: Print each step of the calculation, including the value of each integral and their sum, to show the complete process.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for 0 <= x <= 3\ndef p1(x):\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for 3 < x <= 5\ndef p2(x):\n    # Handle the case where cos(x) = -1 to avoid division by zero,\n    # although it doesn't occur in the integration range [3, 4].\n    if np.isclose(np.cos(x), -1):\n        return np.inf\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Set the integration limits\nlower_bound_total = 0\nmid_point = 3\nupper_bound_total = 4\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part: from 0 to 3\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, lower_bound_total, mid_point)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part: from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, mid_point, upper_bound_total)\n\n# Calculate the total integral\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the results of each step\nprint(f\"The integral is split into two parts: from {lower_bound_total} to {mid_point} and from {mid_point} to {upper_bound_total}.\")\nprint(f\"Integral of the first part (from x={lower_bound_total} to x={mid_point}): {integral1:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Integral of the second part (from x={mid_point} to x={upper_bound_total}): {integral2:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral1:.4f} + ({integral2:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {total_integral:.4f}\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{total_integral:.4f}>>>\")\n```"
