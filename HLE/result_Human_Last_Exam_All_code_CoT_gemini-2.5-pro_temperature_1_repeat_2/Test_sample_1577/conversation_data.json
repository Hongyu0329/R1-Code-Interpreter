    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code, like the toric code, depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The introduction of holes, or boundaries, creates new non-trivial operators, which in turn increases the degeneracy of the ground state.\n\nThere are two types of boundaries in the toric code:\n1.  **Smooth boundaries:** At these boundaries, the star operators are well-defined, but plaquette operators are not. This means that magnetic anyons (`m`-particles) can be absorbed or created at a smooth boundary. They are also sometimes called \"Z-boundaries\" or \"electric boundaries\".\n2.  **Rough boundaries:** At these boundaries, the plaquette operators are well-defined, but star operators are not. This means that electric anyons (`e`-particles) can be absorbed or created at a rough boundary. They are also sometimes called \"X-boundaries\" or \"magnetic boundaries\".\n\nThe GSD can be determined by counting the number of independent logical operators that label the ground states. Assuming the code is on a planar surface (genus `g=0`), we can reason as follows:\n\n1.  **Fluxes through smooth holes:** A logical operator can be constructed by forming a closed loop of `Z` operators around a smooth hole. This operator measures the magnetic flux (`m`-anyon content) through that hole. With `n` smooth holes, we can define `n` such loop operators. However, there is a constraint: the product of all these loop operators is a trivial operator (equivalent to the identity). This is because the sum of all fluxes must be zero. Therefore, there are `n-1` independent logical operators associated with the fluxes through the smooth holes.\n\n2.  **Charges in rough holes:** Similarly, a logical operator can be constructed by forming a closed loop of `X` operators around a rough hole. This operator measures the electric charge (`e`-anyon content) within that hole. With `m` rough holes, we can define `m-1` independent logical operators associated with the charges within the rough holes.\n\n3.  **Combining the operators:** The flux-measuring operators (`Z`-loops) commute with the charge-measuring operators (`X`-loops) because their supports can be chosen to not overlap. This means we have a total of `(n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2` independent, mutually commuting logical operators.\n\n4.  **Calculating GSD:** Each of these `n+m-2` logical operators can have an eigenvalue of `+1` or `-1`, distinguishing the different ground states. The total number of orthogonal ground states, which is the GSD, is therefore `2` raised to the power of this number.\n\nThis leads to the formula:\n**GSD = 2^(n + m - 2)**\n\nThis formula holds assuming there is at least one of each type of hole (`n ≥ 1` and `m ≥ 1`). The presence of both types of boundaries allows for two separate sets of logical operators whose dimensions add up.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the GSD for given values of `n` and `m` based on this formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes on a planar surface.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (must be >= 1).\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (must be >= 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1 or m < 1:\n        print(\"This formula assumes n >= 1 and m >= 1.\")\n        # Handle cases for n=0 or m=0 if necessary, though the problem implies n,m > 0.\n        # The degeneracy is 2^(k-1) for k holes of the same type.\n        # This derivation of 2^(n+m-2) is for the mixed-boundary case.\n        return\n\n    # The number of logical qubits is (n-1) + (m-1)\n    exponent = n + m - 2\n    \n    # The GSD is 2 to the power of the number of logical qubits\n    gsd = 2**exponent\n\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy for n={n} smooth holes and m={m} rough holes is:\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{exponent} = {gsd}\")\n\n\n# Example usage with n=4 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\nn_smooth_holes = 4\nm_rough_holes = 3\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
