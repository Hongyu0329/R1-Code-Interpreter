# The problem asks to compute the value of the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# From our derivation, we found that:
# ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)
#
# Substituting this into the expression, the term (pi^2/6 - 1) cancels out,
# leaving a simplified expression: 1 + 10^15.
#
# The following code calculates the final result and prints the numbers
# in the simplified final equation.

# The first term of the simplified equation
term1 = 1.0

# The second term of the simplified equation
term2 = 10**15

# The final result
result = term1 + term2

# The problem requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is 1 + 10^15 = 1000000000000001.
print("The simplified final equation is:")
# We use int() to display the numbers as integers without scientific notation or decimals.
print(f"{int(term1)} + {int(term2)} = {int(result)}")
