    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the formula for the given infinite product, followed by a Python script to present the final result.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\nThe problem is to evaluate the infinite product:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 1: Factor the general term**\nThe term inside the product, $(1 - z^3/n^3)$, can be factored using the formula for the difference of cubes, which involves the complex cube roots of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. The factorization is:\n$$ 1 - x^3 = (1-x)(1-\\omega x)(1-\\omega^2 x) $$\nLet's substitute $x = z/n$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 2: Express the infinite product**\nSubstituting this factorization back into the infinite product gives:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis can be viewed as the product of three separate infinite series. This combined product converges because the sum of the exponents in the series expansion is zero ($1+\\omega+\\omega^2 = 0$).\n\n**Step 3: Relate the product to the Gamma function**\nTo evaluate this, we first consider the product starting from $n=1$. This is a known result from the theory of infinite products, related to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n**Step 4: Adjust the starting index of the product**\nThe given product starts from $n=3$. We can obtain this by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n**Step 5: Combine and simplify to get the final formula**\nSubstituting the result from Step 3 into the expression from Step 4 gives the final formula:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\nThis can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 8:\n$$ P = \\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z e^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-z e^{i4\\pi/3})} $$\n\nHere is the Python code that prints this final formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the final symbolic formula for the infinite product.\n    The formula is derived from the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function.\n    The output is formatted to clearly show all the numbers involved in the equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The simplified formula for the product is:\n    # 8 / ( (1 - z^3) * (8 - z^3) * Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(2*pi*I/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(4*pi*I/3)) )\n    \n    # Define the numbers present in the formula to satisfy the prompt's requirement.\n    numerator = 8\n    term1_const = 1\n    term1_power = 3\n    term2_const = 8\n    term2_power = 3\n    gamma_arg_const = 1\n    omega_factor_num = 2\n    omega_factor_den = 3\n    omega_sq_factor_num = 4\n    omega_sq_factor_den = 3\n\n    # Print the equation in a formatted, readable way.\n    # This print statement fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    print(\n        f\"  {numerator}\\n\"\n        \"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"\n        f\"({term1_const} - z^{term1_power})({term2_const} - z^{term2_power}) * Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z) * Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z*exp({omega_factor_num}*pi*I/{omega_factor_den})) * Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z*exp({omega_sq_factor_num}*pi*I/{omega_sq_factor_den}))\"\n    )\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_and_print_product_formula()\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z e^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-z e^{i4\\pi/3})} $>>>"
