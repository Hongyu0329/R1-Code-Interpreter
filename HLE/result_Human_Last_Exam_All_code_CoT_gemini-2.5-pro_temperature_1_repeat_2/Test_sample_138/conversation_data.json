    "This is a question from the mathematical theory of quadratic forms and lattices. The number of such lattices is a known result that can be determined by checking the necessary conditions for their existence.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  Identify the key properties of the lattice from the user's request:\n    *   Dimension `n = 17`\n    *   Determinant `d = 2`\n    *   It is a positive definite lattice, which means its signature `s` is equal to its dimension `n`. So, `s = 17`.\n    *   It is an even lattice, meaning the squared norm of any lattice vector is an even integer.\n\n2.  Consult the established mathematical theorems regarding the existence of such lattices. A crucial condition for the existence of an even lattice of **odd dimension** `n` and signature `s` is that the value `(-1)^((n-s)/2) * d` must be a quadratic residue modulo 4. A number is a quadratic residue modulo 4 if it is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.\n\n3.  Apply this theorem to the given parameters:\n    *   `n = 17` (odd)\n    *   `s = 17`\n    *   `d = 2`\n\n4.  Calculate the expression from the theorem:\n    *   The exponent is `(n - s) / 2 = (17 - 17) / 2 = 0`.\n    *   The power of -1 is `(-1)^0 = 1`.\n    *   The full expression is `1 * d = 1 * 2 = 2`.\n\n5.  Check if the result, 2, is a quadratic residue modulo 4.\n    *   The squares modulo 4 are `0^2 ≡ 0`, `1^2 ≡ 1`, `2^2 ≡ 0`, `3^2 ≡ 1`. The set of quadratic residues is `{0, 1}`.\n    *   The calculated value `2` is not in this set.\n\n6.  Since this necessary condition is not met, we can conclude that no such lattice exists. Therefore, the number of such lattices is 0.\n\nI will now write a Python script that implements this check and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of positive definite even lattices\n    of dimension 17 and determinant 2 by checking a necessary existence condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The properties of the lattice\n    n = 17  # Dimension\n    d = 2   # Determinant\n    # For a positive definite lattice, the signature 's' equals the dimension 'n'\n    s = n\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the existence of a positive definite even lattice with dimension n = {n} and determinant d = {d}.\")\n\n    # A necessary condition for an even lattice of odd dimension n and signature s is that\n    # the value (-1)^((n-s)/2) * d must be a quadratic residue modulo 4 (i.e., 0 or 1 mod 4).\n    \n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        print(f\"The dimension n = {n} is odd, so we can apply the existence condition.\")\n        \n        # Calculate each part of the equation from the theorem\n        exponent = (n - s) // 2\n        print(f\"The exponent in the formula is (n - s) / 2 = ({n} - {s}) / 2 = {exponent}.\")\n        \n        sign = (-1)**exponent\n        print(f\"The sign term (-1)^({exponent}) is {sign}.\")\n        \n        value_to_check = sign * d\n        print(f\"The final value to check is {sign} * {d} = {value_to_check}.\")\n        \n        value_mod_4 = value_to_check % 4\n        print(f\"This value modulo 4 is {value_mod_4}.\")\n        \n        # The quadratic residues mod 4 are 0 and 1.\n        if value_mod_4 in {0, 1}:\n            # This case is not reached for the given problem.\n            # If it were, it would mean the condition is met, but this is not sufficient\n            # to prove existence.
