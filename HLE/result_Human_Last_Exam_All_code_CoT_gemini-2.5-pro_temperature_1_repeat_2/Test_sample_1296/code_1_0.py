def solve_dessin_question():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the theoretical question about dessins d'enfants.
    The reasoning is based on abstract algebra and known theorems in the study of regular maps.

    - Part (a): The property of G being quasiprimitive on the face set F forces the socle N
      to be transitive on F. This directly implies the quotient D_N has only one face.
    - Part (b): The conditions of a smooth covering over the socle for a regular dessin imply
      G must be a split extension G = N . H, where H is the cyclic face-stabilizer.
      While this structure exists for groups of type HA, TW, and AS, a further generation
      property must be satisfied. Groups of type TW are ruled out by a known theorem (see part c).
    - Part (c): A theorem by Li and Siran (2007) proves that primitive groups of type TW with a
      point stabilizer complementing the socle cannot be generated by an involution and another
      element. This means they cannot be the automorphism group of a regular dessin under the
      given conditions. This holds for any l, including l <= 5.
