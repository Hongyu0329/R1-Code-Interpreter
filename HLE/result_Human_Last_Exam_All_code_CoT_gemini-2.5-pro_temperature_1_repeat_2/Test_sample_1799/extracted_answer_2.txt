While not strictly superfluous in the standard formulation of relativity, a strong argument exists that the existence of a universal invariant speed is a necessary consequence of the first postulate combined with general principles of spacetime (homogeneity and isotropy). The second postulate's primary role is then reduced to the empirical statement that this universal speed is finite and is equal to the speed of light.
