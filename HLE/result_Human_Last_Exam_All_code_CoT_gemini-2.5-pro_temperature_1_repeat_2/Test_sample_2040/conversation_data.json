    "My plan is to address your physics question using a Python script, as per your instructions. The script will not perform a calculation, but rather use `print` statements to logically walk through the reasoning.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Define Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) and its core requirement.\n2.  Explain the role of material symmetry, specifically the need for a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure for second-order nonlinear effects.\n3.  Discuss the crystal structure of common, free-standing boron nanosheets.\n4.  Conclude whether SPDC is expected based on this analysis, incorporating the required \"equation\" format to represent the key physical property.\n5.  Mention important caveats to provide a complete picture.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script prints a step-by-step explanation to answer the question:\n    \"When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be\n    expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Answering the Physics Question via a Script ---\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the core requirement for SPDC\n    print(\"Step 1: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"A material's ability to exhibit this process depends on its second-order nonlinear susceptibility, written as chi(2).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the symmetry condition\n    print(\"Step 2: A fundamental requirement for a material to have a non-zero chi(2) is that it must lack a center of inversion.\")\n    print(\"Materials that have a center of inversion (are 'centrosymmetric') cannot exhibit second-order effects like SPDC.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Present the property of a centrosymmetric material as an equation\n    print(\"Step 3: For a centrosymmetric material, the value of the second-order susceptibility is effectively zero.\")\n    print(\"We can represent this with the following equation:\")\n    \n    # The value of chi(2) for a centrosymmetric material\n    chi_2 = 0\n    \n    # Printing the \"equation\" with the number as requested\n    print(\"chi(2) = \" + str(chi_2))\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze boron nanosheets\n    print(\"Step 4: The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are known to be centrosymmetric.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Final Conclusion\n    print(\"Conclusion: Because free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their chi(2) is zero.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Important Caveat: This conclusion applies to ideal, free-standing sheets.

This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical effects, meaning they are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
