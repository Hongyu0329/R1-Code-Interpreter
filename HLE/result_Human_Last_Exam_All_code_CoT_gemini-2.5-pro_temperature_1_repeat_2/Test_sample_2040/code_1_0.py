    # Step 1: Explain the core requirement for SPDC
    print("Step 1: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.")

    # Step 2: Explain the symmetry condition
    print("Step 2: A fundamental requirement for a material to have a non-zero chi(2) is that it must lack a center of inversion.")
    print("Materials that have a center of inversion (are 'centrosymmetric') cannot exhibit second-order effects like SPDC.")

    # Step 5: Final Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: Because free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their chi(2) is zero.")
