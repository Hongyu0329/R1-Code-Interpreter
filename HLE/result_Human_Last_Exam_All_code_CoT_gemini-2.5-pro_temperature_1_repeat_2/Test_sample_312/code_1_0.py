    Calculates the smallest possible value of c based on the problem statement.

    The problem asks for the sharp exponent c in the estimate for the L^2 norm of
    the Fourier transform of a Frostman measure on a sphere. The general formula
    for the exponent is derived from harmonic analysis principles.

    Let s be the dimension of the Frostman measure and n be the dimension of the
    ambient space. The squared L^2 norm, I(r), decays like r^{-beta}, where
    beta = min(s, (n-1)/2). The L^2 norm itself then decays like r^{-beta/2}.
    The value c is therefore -beta/2.
