    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which represents the number of permutations of length \\(n=333\\) with exactly \\(k=3\\) inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical formula:** This is a problem in enumerative combinatorics. Fortunately, there is a known formula for the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with a small number of inversions. For \\(k=3\\) and \\(n \\ge 5\\), the number is given by:\n    \\(av_n^3(1324) = \\binom{n-2}{3} + \\binom{n-2}{2} + \\binom{n-2}{1} + 2\\)\n\n2.  **Apply the formula to the given values:** We are given \\(n=333\\). We will substitute this value into the formula. Let \\(m = n-2 = 331\\). The formula becomes:\n    \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = \\binom{331}{3} + \\binom{331}{2} + \\binom{331}{1} + 2\\)\n\n3.  **Write Python code to compute the result:** I will write a Python script that calculates each term in the formula and then sums them up to get the final answer. The script will use the `math.comb` function for efficiency and accuracy.\n\n4.  **Display the calculation:** The script will print out the full equation with the computed values for each binomial coefficient, showing the step-by-step calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions,\n    for n=333 and k=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 333\n    k = 3\n\n    # The problem is to find av_n^k(1324) for n=333, k=3.\n    # A known formula for n >= 5 is:\n    # av_n^3(1324) = C(n-2, 3) + C(n-2, 2) + C(n-2, 1) + 2\n    \n    if n < 5:\n        print(f\"The formula is valid for n >= 5. n={n} is not supported by this formula.\")\n        return\n\n    m = n - 2\n    \n    # Calculate each term in the formula\n    try:\n        # math.comb(n, k) calculates the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\"\n        c3 = math.comb(m, 3)\n        c2 = math.comb(m, 2)\n        c1 = math.comb(m, 1)\n        constant = 2\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error calculating combinations: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Sum the terms to get the final result\n    result = c3 + c2 + c1 + constant\n\n    print(f\"To find the value of av_{n}^{k}(1324), we use the formula:\")\n    print(f\"C(n-2, 3) + C(n-2, 2) + C(n-2, 1) + 2\")\n    print(f\"\\nFor n = {n}, we have n-2 = {m}.
