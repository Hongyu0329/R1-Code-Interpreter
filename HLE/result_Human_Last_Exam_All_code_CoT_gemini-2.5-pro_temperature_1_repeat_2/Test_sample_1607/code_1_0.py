    # E) True. This is the definition of the rotation operator.
    # F) True. This is a statement of Noether's theorem / Ehrenfest theorem.
    # G) True. The premise is always true, and the conclusion is true by the definition of a unitary symmetry.
    # H) False. The angular momentum operator L_z is a counterexample.
