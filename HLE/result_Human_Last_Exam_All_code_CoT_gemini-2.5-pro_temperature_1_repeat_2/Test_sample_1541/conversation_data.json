    "My plan to solve this problem involves rearranging the numbers in the sum into non-decreasing order. The most efficient way to do this, given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, is to use a counting-based approach rather than a general-purpose sorting algorithm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze the Input**: The input is a string like \"1+3+2+4+1\". The numbers are single digits (1, 2, 3, or 4) separated by plus signs.\n2.  **Core Logic (Sorting)**: Instead of parsing the numbers into a list and sorting them, which would use more memory, we can simply count how many 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are present in the string.\n3.  **Memory-Efficient C Program Design**: To answer the question about the most memory-efficient C program, I will design a program that avoids storing the entire input string. It would read the input character by character.\n    *   It would use a small integer array of size 4, say `counts`, to store the frequency of each number (1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   It would loop through the input using `getchar()`, and for each character, if it's a digit, it would increment the corresponding counter in the `counts` array.\n    *   After processing the input, it would construct the output string by printing the number '1' `counts[0]` times, then '2' `counts[1]` times, and so on, adding a '+' between each number.\n4.  **Calculate Memory Usage (m)**: For this C program, the variables needed are:\n    *   `int counts[4]`: to store frequencies. Assuming `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, this is `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n    *   `int c`: to store the character from `getchar()`. This is `4` bytes.\n    *   Loop counters and a flag for printing (e.g., `int i`, `int j`, `int first_term`): `3 * 4 = 12` bytes.\n    *   The total memory `m` for variables is `16 + 4 + 12 = 32` bytes.\n5.  **Provide Python Code**: As per the instructions, I will provide a Python script to perform the task. This script will read the input line, extract the numbers, sort them, and print the new sum.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads a sum from standard input, sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum in non-decreasing order.\n    Example: 1+3+2+1 -> 1+1+2+3\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the entire line of input, e.g., \"1+3+2+1\"\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # The input is guaranteed to be non-empty.\n    # Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of number strings.\n    # e.g., \"1+3+2+1\" becomes ['1', '3', '2', '1']\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of number strings. Python's sort for strings works\n    # correctly here since they are single digits.\n    # e.g., ['1', '3', '2', '1'] becomes ['1', '1', '2', '3']\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list of strings back together with '+' as the separator.\n    # e.g., ['1', '1', '2', '3'] becomes \"1+1+2+3\"\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final result.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<32>>>"
