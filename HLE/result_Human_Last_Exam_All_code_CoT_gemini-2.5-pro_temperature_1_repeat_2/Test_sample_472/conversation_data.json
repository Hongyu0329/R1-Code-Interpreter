    "This line of Latin is from the Roman playwright Plautus. His verse is notoriously complex to scan due to metrical variations, contractions, and elisions that were common in spoken Latin of his time.\n\nMy plan to scan the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Meter**: The line is an \"iambic senarius,\" which is a line composed of six iambic feet. An iambic foot has a short syllable followed by a long one (S L).\n2.  **Handle Contractions**: As written, the line has too many syllables for the meter. To make it fit, we must apply three contractions/elisions that are common in Plautus:\n    *   The two syllables of `tibi` are contracted into one: `tib'`.\n    *   `bene` and `esse` run together, and the first `e` of `bene` is elided, forming `ben'esse`.\n    *   The two syllables of `sibi` are contracted into one: `sib'`.\n3.  **Scan the Resulting Line**: After these changes, the line is read as \"et tib' ben'esse soli quom sib' sit male,\" which has the correct 12 syllables. I will then determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on vowel length and position.\n4.  **Group into Feet**: Finally, I will group the 12 syllables into the six feet of the iambic senarius, noting the common metrical substitutions Plautus uses.\n\nHere is the python code that prints the resulting scansion based on this plan.\n\n```python\n# The line to be scanned is:\n# \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n# After applying Plautine contractions (tibi -> tib', bene esse -> ben'esse, sibi -> sib'),\n# the line is read as \"et tib' ben'esse soli quom sib' sit male\" and scanned as follows:\n\n# Foot 1: et tib' -> L S (Trochaic substitution)\n# Foot 2: ben' es-se -> S L (Iamb)\n# Foot 3: -se so-li -> S L (Iamb)\n# Foot 4: -li quom -> S L (Iamb)\n# Foot 5: sib' sit -> S L (Iamb)\n# Foot 6: ma le -> S S (Pyrrhic substitution)\n\nfoot1 = \"L S\"\nfoot2 = \"S L\"\nfoot3 = \"S L\"\nfoot4 = \"S L\"\nfoot5 = \"S L\"\nfoot6 = \"S S\"\n\n# Print each foot separated by a space.\nprint(f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6}\")\n\n```\n<<<L S S L S L S L S L S S>>>"
