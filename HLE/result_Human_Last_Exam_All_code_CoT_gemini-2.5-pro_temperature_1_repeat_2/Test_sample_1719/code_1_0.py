    # Step 1: Identify the algebraic obstruction.
    # The user has two paths, φ_t and ψ_t, in the space of bundle automorphisms Aut(E),
    # both starting at id_E and ending at -id_E.
    # The question of whether these paths are homotopic relative to their endpoints
    # is equivalent to asking if the loop formed by φ_t followed by the reverse of ψ_t
    # is contractible. This loop represents an element in the fundamental group
    # of the identity component of Aut(E), which we denote Aut₀(E).
    # The obstruction is therefore an element of the group π₁(Aut₀(E)).
    # The group Aut₀(E) is the gauge group of the associated principal SO(2k)-bundle P.

    # Step 2: Simplify the base space ΣX.
    # The base space is the suspension of X, where X is a homology (n-1)-sphere.
    # This means the reduced homology groups of X are H̃ᵢ(X; ℤ) = ℤ if i = n-1, and 0 otherwise.
    # There exists a map f: X → Sⁿ⁻¹ that induces an isomorphism on homology.
    # The suspension of this map, Σf: ΣX → ΣSⁿ⁻¹ = Sⁿ, is also a homology isomorphism.
    # For n>1, ΣX and Sⁿ are simply-connected. A homology equivalence between
    # simply-connected CW-complexes is a homotopy equivalence.
    # For n=1, X is a homology 0-sphere, so X ≅ S⁰, and ΣX ≅ S¹. In this case, ΣX is also
    # homotopy equivalent to Sⁿ.
    # Thus, we can replace the base space ΣX with Sⁿ for our homotopy calculations.

    # Step 3: Analyze the obstruction group π₁(Aut₀(E)) over Sⁿ.
    # Let G(P) be the gauge group of the principal SO(2k)-bundle P over Sⁿ.
    # The obstruction lies in π₁(G(P)).
    # There is a fibration obtained by evaluating a gauge transformation at a basepoint x₀ ∈ Sⁿ:
    #   G(P, x₀) → G(P) → SO(2k)
    # where G(P, x₀) is the "based" gauge group of automorphisms fixing the fiber over x₀.
    # This based gauge group G(P, x₀) is homotopy equivalent to the space of based maps
    # from Sⁿ to SO(2k), which is denoted ΩⁿSO(2k).

    # Step 4: Use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this fibration.
    # ... → π₁(G(P, x₀)) → π₁(G(P)) → π₁(SO(2k)) → π₀(G(P, x₀)) → ...
    # The space of based maps G(P, x₀) is path-connected, so π₀(G(P, x₀)) = 0.
    # The long exact sequence yields a short exact sequence:
    #   0 → π₁(G(P, x₀)) → π₁(G(P)) → π₁(SO(2k)) → 0
    
    # Step 5: Identify the group π₁(G(P, x₀)).
    # π₁(G(P, x₀)) is isomorphic to π₁(ΩⁿSO(2k)).
    # Using the property that πₖ(ΩⁿY) ≅ πₖ₊ₙ(Y), we get:
    #   π₁(ΩⁿSO(2k)) ≅ π₁₊ₙ(SO(2k)) = πₙ₊₁(SO(2k)).

    # Step 6: Conclude and present the list of groups.
    # The obstruction group π₁(G(P)) is an extension of π₁(SO(2k)) by πₙ₊₁(SO(2k)).
    # The problem asks for the list of groups that determine this obstruction.
    # These groups are π₁(SO(2k)) and πₙ₊₁(SO(2k)).
