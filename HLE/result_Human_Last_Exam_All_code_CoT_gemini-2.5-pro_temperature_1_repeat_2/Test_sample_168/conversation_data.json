    "To solve this, we will analyze the hearing capabilities of each animal listed. The key is to understand the frequency of sound produced by human muscle twitches and compare it to the hearing range of each animal.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the frequency range of sounds produced by muscle contractions. This is a very low-frequency sound, often called phonomyography, typically in the 5-35 Hz range.\n2.  List the approximate hearing frequency ranges for each animal in the options.\n3.  Compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range.\n4.  The animal whose hearing range comfortably includes these low frequencies and is known for high sensitivity is the correct answer. The Python script below will present this data and reasoning. The \"equation\" in this context will be the comparison of these frequency numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_animal_hearing_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the reasoning for determining which animal can hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of the sound source.\n    # The 'equation' involves comparing the muscle twitch frequency to animal hearing ranges.\n    muscle_twitch_min_freq = 5  # in Hertz\n    muscle_twitch_max_freq = 35 # in Hertz\n\n    print(\"The task is to find which animal can hear human muscle twitches.\")\n    print(\"This requires comparing the sound frequency of a muscle twitch to the hearing range of each animal.\")\n    print(f\"The sound of a muscle twitch (phonomyography) is in the very low-frequency range of approximately {muscle_twitch_min_freq} Hz to {muscle_twitch_max_freq} Hz.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the hearing ranges of the animals.\n    # This data includes all the numbers needed for our comparison.\n    hearing_ranges = {\n        \"A.
