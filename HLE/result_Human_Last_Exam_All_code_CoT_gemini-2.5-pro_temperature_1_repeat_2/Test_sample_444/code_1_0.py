    Alice's strategy relies on a pre-chosen "representative" sequence for a given
    class of sequences. Let's assume for the class of sequences that are eventually
    zero, the representative is the all-zero sequence.

    An adversary can then choose a sequence that is also eventually zero but differs
    from the representative in a few key places, to lower Alice's win probability.
