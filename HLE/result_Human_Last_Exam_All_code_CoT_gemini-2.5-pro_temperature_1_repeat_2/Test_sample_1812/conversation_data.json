    "My plan is to calculate the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. I will not use any external libraries like NumPy. Instead, I will implement the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix and print out each step of the calculation to make the process clear and transparent, as requested by the user. The information about the Markov quiver is contextual and does not alter the mathematical task of computing the determinant of the provided matrix.\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis given by `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nI will follow these steps in the code:\n1.  Define the elements of the matrix A.\n2.  Substitute these elements into the determinant formula and print the expression.\n3.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
