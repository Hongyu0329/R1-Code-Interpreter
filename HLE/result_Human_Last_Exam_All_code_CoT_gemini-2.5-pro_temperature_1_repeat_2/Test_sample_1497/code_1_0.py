# The solution identifies the primary parameter group affected by each variation in violin playing,
# based on the physics of sound production and the provided waveform formula.

# (1) 'sul ponticello': Emphasizes high harmonics -> affects harmonic decay parameter nu -> group ii.
# (2) 'bridge mute': Adds mass to the bridge, lowering the main wood resonance frequency f2 -> group iv. Direction is down.
# (3) 'helium': Increases speed of sound inside the body, increasing the air resonance frequency f1 -> group iii.
# (4) 'E string scale': The scale starts at a different note (F5 vs F#5), changing the fundamental frequency F -> group i.

# The final answer is constructed by ordering the group identifiers and appending the direction for case (2).
final_answer = "ii,iv,iii,i,down"
