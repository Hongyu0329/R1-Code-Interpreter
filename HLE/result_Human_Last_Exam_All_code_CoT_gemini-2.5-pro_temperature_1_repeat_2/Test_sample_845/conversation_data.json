    "The value you are referring to is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. While it is generally called the 'beat-to-beat interval' or 'inter-beat interval (IBI)', the most common and standard term in the context of HRV analysis, originating from ECG measurements, is the 'R-R interval'. I will provide a simple Python script to print this term.\n\n```python\n# This script will define and print the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis.\n\n# The value is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n# In electrocardiography (ECG), this is measured from the peak of one QRS complex (the R wave) to the next.\n# This term is widely used even when data is collected from other sources like PPG.\nvalue_name = \"R-R interval\"\n\nprint(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to measure HRV is called the: {value_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
