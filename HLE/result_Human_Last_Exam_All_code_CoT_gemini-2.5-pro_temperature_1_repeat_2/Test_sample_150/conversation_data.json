    "The provided Java program does not correctly solve the problem.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Correctness Analysis:** The problem specifies four possible statement formats: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`. The Java program checks for substrings using `test.contains(\"++X\")` and `test.contains(\"--X\")`. This logic correctly identifies `++X` and `--X`, but it fails to identify `X++` and `X--`, as these strings do not contain the specified substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.\n\n2.  **Efficiency Plan (C Rewrite):** To create the most efficient C program, I will focus on minimizing both character comparisons (for speed) and memory usage.\n    *   **Speed:** Instead of reading the entire 3-character string and comparing it, a faster way is to identify the operation by looking at a single character. In all four valid statements, the character at the second position (`s[1]`) is guaranteed to be either `+` or `-`, uniquely identifying the operation. This requires only one character comparison per statement.\n    *   **Memory:** To use the least memory, I will avoid using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` which requires a character array buffer. Instead, I will use `getchar()` to read characters one by one. This allows me to process the input stream using only a few integer/char variables on the stack, minimizing the memory footprint.\n\n3.  **C Code:** The following C code implements this efficient approach. It reads the number of statements `n`, then loops `n` times. In each loop, it reads the three characters of the statement and the trailing newline, but only uses the second character to determine whether to increment or decrement the result `x`.\n\n4.  **Calculation for Final Answer (`Nx+y`):**\n    *   The program is incorrect, so the answer starts with `N`.\n    *   `x` (character comparisons for 100 instructions): The code performs one comparison (`if (op == '+')`) for each of the 100 instructions. Thus, `x = 100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   `y` (memory size in Bytes): The C code uses `int n` (4 bytes), `int x` (4 bytes), and `char op` (1 byte). The total memory usage is `4 + 4 + 1 = 9` bytes. Thus, `y = 9`.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    // Read the number of statements\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n\n    // Consume the newline character left in the input buffer after reading n\n    getchar();\n\n    int x = 0;\n    while (n-- > 0) {\n        // The first character can be 'X', '+', or '-'\n        getchar();\n        // The second character is always the operator we care about\n        char op = getchar();\n        \n        if (op == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n        \n        // Consume the third character and the final newline for this line\n        getchar();\n        getchar();\n    }\n    \n    printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<N100+9>>>"
