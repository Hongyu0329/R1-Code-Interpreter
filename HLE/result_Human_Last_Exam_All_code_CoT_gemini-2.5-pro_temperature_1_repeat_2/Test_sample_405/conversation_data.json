    "Here is my plan to determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n1.  I will first identify the main, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color.\n3.  I will then count the number of distinct colors.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that lists these colors, adds them up to demonstrate the count, and prints the final number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Create a new in-memory text stream\ncaptured_output = io.StringIO()\n# Redirect stdout to the new stream\nsys.stdout = captured_output\n\n# Phosphorus has several allotropes, each with a distinct color.\n# We will count the number of unique colors from the most common and stable forms.\n\n# 1. White Phosphorus: This allotrope is a waxy solid that is white,\n#    but can appear yellowish due to impurities or conversion to red phosphorus.\n#    We will count this as 1 color: White.\ncolor_1 = \"White\"\nnum_1 = 1\n\n# 2. Red Phosphorus: This is an amorphous form whose color can vary\n#    from orange to a deep red. We will count this as 1 color: Red.\ncolor_2 = \"Red\"\nnum_2 = 1\n\n# 3. Violet Phosphorus: Also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus,\n#    this is a well-defined crystalline form that is deep violet.\n#    We will count this as 1 color: Violet.\ncolor_3 = \"Violet\"\nnum_3 = 1\n\n# 4. Black Phosphorus: This is the most stable form, with a layered\n#    structure similar to graphite. It is black and has a metallic luster.\n#    We will count this as 1 color: Black.\ncolor_4 = \"Black\"\nnum_4 = 1\n\n# Now, we sum the counts for each distinct color.\ntotal_colors = num_1 + num_2 + num_3 + num_4\n\nprint(\"The distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes are:\")\nprint(f\"- {color_1}\")\nprint(f\"- {color_2}\")\nprint(f\"- {color_3}\")\nprint(f\"- {color_4}\")\nprint(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we can represent it as an equation:\")\n# The instruction requires outputting each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"{num_1} ({color_1}) + {num_2} ({color_2}) + {num_3} ({color_3}) + {num_4} ({color_4}) = {total_colors}\")\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output as a string\noutput_str = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the final result to the user\nprint(output_str)\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{total_colors}>>>\")\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
