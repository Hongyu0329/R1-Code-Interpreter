    Analyzes strategies for mitigating identifiability issues in birth-death models
    and identifies the one that does not help.

    The unidentifiability issue in fitting time-varying birth-death models to phylogenies
    of extant species means that infinitely many pairs of speciation rates (λ(t)) and
    extinction rates (μ(t)) can result in the same likelihood for a given tree.

    A valid mitigation strategy must either:
    1. Add new information to constrain the parameters (e.g., fossils, priors).
    2. Reparameterize the model to focus on identifiable quantities.
    3. Regularize (simplify) the model to make inference more stable.

    A strategy that makes the problem worse would typically increase model complexity
    without adding any new constraining information.
