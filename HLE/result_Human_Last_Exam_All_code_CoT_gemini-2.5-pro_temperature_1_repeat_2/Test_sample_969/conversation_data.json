    "Here is my plan to solve this sequence puzzle:\n1.  First, I will analyze the given sequence: `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`.\n2.  I will look for simple mathematical patterns like arithmetic or geometric progressions, but they don't seem to apply here.\n3.  I will then look for structural patterns. The sequence seems to break down into parts. The start `3 2 1 2` looks like a non-repeating part, which I'll call the \"seed\".\n4.  What follows the seed is `3 3 3` (three 3s) and `2 2` (two 2s). This suggests a self-referential or rule-based generation for the latter part of the sequence.\n5.  For puzzle sequences like this, a common type of solution is that after an initial complex phase, the pattern \"resets\" in a simple way. One common reset pattern is to reuse the initial seed.\n6.  I will test the hypothesis that the next part of the sequence is a simple transformation of the seed `3 2 1 2`.\n7.  Reversing the seed `3 2 1 2` gives `2 1 2 3`.\n8.  This result, `2 1 2 3`, matches one of the multiple-choice answers, which gives me confidence in this hypothesis.\n9.  I will write a Python script to demonstrate this logic by identifying the seed, reversing it, and printing the original sequence followed by the newly found elements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by identifying a seed and reversing it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The pattern appears to be an initial seed followed by repeating blocks.\n    # The seed is the first four numbers, before the repeats start.\n    seed = sequence[0:4]\n\n    # The hypothesis is that the sequence continues by reversing the seed.\n    next_four_elements = seed[::-1]\n\n    # Print the full sequence including the original part and the next 4 elements.\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(*sequence, *next_four_elements)\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<D>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Complete the next 4 elements of this sequence:\n3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 2 1 1 1\nB. 2 4 4 4\nC. 2 3 1 2\nD. 2 1 2 3\nE. 2 3 5 5\nF. 2 3 2 1\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
