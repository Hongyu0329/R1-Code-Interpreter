    Calculates the number of triangular prisms that can fit within a cube.
    This involves three main steps:
    1. Calculate the prism base dimension T from a heat transfer problem.
    2. Calculate the prism depth D from a beam stress problem.
    3. Solve the packing problem of the prisms into the cube.
