    "My plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants**: The reaction involves two key molecules: the aldehyde \"pivalaldehyde\" and the phosphorus ylide \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\".\n2.  **Determine the Chemical Structures**:\n    *   Pivalaldehyde has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It provides the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the final product.\n    *   The phosphorus ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, corresponds to the structure (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(C₆H₅)₃. It will contribute the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl-2)` fragment to the final product.\n3.  **Apply the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**: This reaction is known for creating a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) by effectively swapping the oxygen atom of an aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) with the substituted carbon group of the ylide (=CR'R'').\n4.  **Construct the Product's Structure**: By combining the fragments from the aldehyde and the ylide, we get the alkene structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl-2).\n5.  **Determine Stereochemistry**: The ylide used in this reaction is classified as \"unstabilized\" because there are no electron-withdrawing groups to stabilize the carbanion. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides are known to predominantly yield the *Z* (or cis) isomer.\n6.  **Name the Final Product**: Using IUPAC nomenclature, the longest chain is a pentene, with the double bond at the second position (`pent-2-ene`). The substituents are two methyl groups at position 4 (`4,4-dimethyl`) and a `2-chlorophenyl` group at position 1. Combined with the *Z* stereochemistry, the full name is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n7.  **Final Script**: The Python code below will walk through this logic and print the name of the final product, explicitly highlighting the numbers in the name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and describes the product of a Wittig reaction\n    between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
