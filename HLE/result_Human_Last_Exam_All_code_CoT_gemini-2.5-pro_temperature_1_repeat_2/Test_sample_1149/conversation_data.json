    "Based on the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specifically, Sues et al., 2002), we can determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess. The description notes that this recess contains two large pneumatic foramina. The following Python code will store this value and print the answer.\n\n```python\n# The scientific description of the Irritator challengeri holotype (SMNS 58022)\n# details the anatomy of the skull.\n# The lacrimal bone features a distinct recess on its lateral surface.\n\n# Number of depressions (pneumatic foramina) identified within the lacrimal recess.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The equation is a simple statement of this fact.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
