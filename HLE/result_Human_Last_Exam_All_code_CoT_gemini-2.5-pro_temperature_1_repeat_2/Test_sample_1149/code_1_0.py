# The scientific description of the Irritator challengeri holotype (SMNS 58022)
# details the anatomy of the skull.
# The lacrimal bone features a distinct recess on its lateral surface.

# Number of depressions (pneumatic foramina) identified within the lacrimal recess.
number_of_depressions = 2

# The equation is a simple statement of this fact.
