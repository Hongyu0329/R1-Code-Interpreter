    # A molar ratio of approximately 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine is used.

    # Let's evaluate the given temperature choices:
    # A. 600 C: This higher temperature, especially with excess fluorine, tends to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6).
    # B. 400 C: This is the most commonly cited and optimal temperature for the efficient industrial and laboratory synthesis of XeF4.
    # C. 200 C: At this temperature, the reaction rate is significantly slower, and the formation of Xenon difluoride (XeF2) is more likely to be the major product.
    # D. 78 C: Far too low for an efficient thermal reaction rate.
    # E. 0 C: No significant thermal reaction occurs.
    # F. -78 C: No significant thermal reaction occurs.
