    "An analysis of the Connect 4 board is required to determine the best moves for player 'O'. The goal is to find moves that lead to a win in the minimum number of turns.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Board:** I will first represent the game board in a 2D data structure (a list of lists in Python) to make it easy to analyze. The board has 6 rows and 7 columns.\n2.  **Identify Player and Valid Moves:** The current player is 'O'. I'll identify all valid moves for 'O', which are the lowest empty cells in each column.\n3.  **Define \"Optimal Move\":** An optimal move is one that forces a win as quickly as possible. In Connect 4, the fastest way to force a win is typically to create a situation where you have two threats that the opponent can only block one of. The classic example is an \"open-ended three-in-a-row\" (`.OOO.`), which guarantees a win on the next turn. This is a \"win in 2\" (Player plays, opponent blocks, player wins).\n4.  **Analyze Potential Moves:** I will systematically check each valid move for 'O'.\n    *   **Check for Win-in-1:** First, I'll see if any move results in an immediate four-in-a-row. (A quick check shows there are none).\n    *   **Check for Win-in-2:** Next, I'll search for moves that create an unblockable threat, like the `.OOO.` pattern.\n5.  **Evaluate Specific Moves:**\n    *   **Row 4 Analysis:** The board currently has two adjacent 'O's in row 4 (`d4`, `e4`). This presents an opportunity.\n    *   **Move `c4`:** Placing an 'O' at `c4` would create a line of three: `c4, d4, e4`. I will then check if the cells at both ends of this line (`b4` and `f4`) are empty. If they are, 'X' can only block one, and 'O' can play in the other on the next turn to win. This makes `c4` an optimal move.\n    *   **Move `f4`:** Similarly, placing an 'O' at `f4` would create `d4, e4, f4`. I will check if the ends (`c4` and `g4`) are both available. If so, `f4` is also an optimal move.\n    *   **Other Moves:** I'll consider other moves like `d3`. This creates a vertical three-in-a-row, but it's a single threat that 'X' can easily block at `d2`. This leads to a slower win (win in 3), so it is not as optimal as `c4` or `f4`.\n6.  **Final Output:** I will collect all moves that lead to the fastest possible win and format them as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connect_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Connect 4 board to find the optimal moves for 'O'.\n    An optimal move is one that guarantees a win in the fewest possible turns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board representation: 6 rows, 7 columns\n    # '.' is empty, 'X' and 'O' are players.\n    # Top-left is (0, 0), corresponding to g1 in the image if inverted, but we use standard matrix indexing\n    # The image has row 1 at the top, so we'll map row 1->index 0, row 6->index 5\n    # col a -> 0, col g -> 6\n    board = [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    ]\n    rows = 6\n    cols = 7\n    player = 'O'\n    \n    def get_valid_moves(current_board):\n        \"\"\"Finds the lowest empty cell in each column.\"\"\"\n        moves = []\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n                if current_board[r][c] == '.':\n                    moves.append((r, c))\n                    break\n        return moves\n\n    def check_forced_win(move_r, move_c, current_board, p):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a move creates an unblockable threat, like an open-ended three-in-a-row.\n        This is a simplified check focusing on the most likely winning pattern.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Create a temporary board with the move made\n        temp_board = [row[:] for row in current_board]\n        temp_board[move_r][move_c] = p\n        \n        # Directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal up-right, diagonal down-right\n        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            # Check for patterns around the new piece at (move_r, move_c)\n            for i in range(-3, 1):\n                try:\n                    p1 = temp_board[move_r + i * dr][move_c + i * dc]\n                    p2 = temp_board[move_r + (i + 1) * dr][move_c + (i + 1) * dc]\n                    p3 = temp_board[move_r + (i + 2) * dr][move_c + (i + 2) * dc]\n                    p4 = temp_board[move_r + (i + 3) * dr][move_c + (i + 3) * dc]\n\n                    # Check for an open-ended three-in-a-row: .OOO.\n                    if [p1, p2, p3, p4] == [p, p, p, '.']:\n                        # Check the other side\n                        if move_r + (i - 1) * dr >= 0 and move_c + (i - 1) * dc >= 0:\n                            if temp_board[move_r + (i - 1) * dr][move_c + (i - 1) * dc] == '.':\n                                # Check if both empty spots are playable\n                                empty1_r, empty1_c = move_r + (i - 1) * dr, move_c + (i - 1) * dc\n                                empty2_r, empty2_c = move_r + (i + 3) * dr, move_c + (i + 3) * dc\n                                \n                                # A spot is playable if it's on the bottom row or the spot below it is filled\n                                playable1 = (empty1_r == rows - 1) or (temp_board[empty1_r + 1][empty1_c] != '.')\n                                playable2 = (empty2_r == rows - 1) or (temp_board[empty2_r + 1][empty2_c] != '.')\n\n                                if playable1 and playable2:\n                                    return True\n                except IndexError:\n                    continue\n        return False\n\n\n    optimal_moves = []\n    valid_moves = get_valid_moves(board)\n\n    # A win in 2 is the fastest possible here (no immediate win)\n    for r, c in valid_moves:\n        if check_forced_win(r, c, board, player):\n            col_name = chr(ord('a') + c)\n            row_name = str(r + 1)\n            optimal_moves.append(f\"{col_name}{row_name}\")\n\n    # Based on manual analysis, d3 is a win-in-3, which is slower.\n    # The check_forced_win function is designed to find win-in-2 scenarios.\n    \n    print(\", \".join(sorted(optimal_moves)))\n\nsolve_connect_4()\n```\n<<<c4, f4>>>"
