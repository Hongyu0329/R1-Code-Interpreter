# Based on the logical deduction that resolves the problem's contradictions,
# we found the values for the components of the equation for l(k).

# p_k(1) is the probability density of the random variable z at z=1.
# Our analysis suggests this value must be 1.
p_k_at_1 = 1

# d_k is the differential entropy of the random variable z.
# Our analysis suggests this value must be 0.
d_k = 0

# The constant coefficients in the formula for l(k)
coeff_p = 1
coeff_d = 2
constant_term = -1

# The function l(k) is defined as l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1
l_k = coeff_p * p_k_at_1 + coeff_d * d_k + constant_term

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1 = result
# The numbers are the determined values of p_k(1), d_k and the final result l_k,
# along with the coefficients from the formula.
