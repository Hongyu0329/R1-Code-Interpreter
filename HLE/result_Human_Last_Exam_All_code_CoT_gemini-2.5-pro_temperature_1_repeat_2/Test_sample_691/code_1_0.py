# Step 1: Define the properties of the homotopy-equivalent graph.
# V is the number of vertices in the simplified graph model.
# The vertices are: the identified waistband point, the two "crotch" points,
# and the two points where the legs are joined.
V = 5

# E is the number of edges in the simplified graph model.
# The edges connect the waistband point to the crotches, and the crotches
# to the leg-join points.
E = 6

# Step 2: Calculate the rank of the fundamental group.
# For a connected graph, the fundamental group is a free group with a rank
# calculated as E - V + 1.
rank = E - V + 1

# Step 3: Print the calculation and the result.
# The prompt requires printing the numbers used in the final equation.
print(f"The simplified space is a graph with V = {V} vertices and E = {E} edges.")
print(f"The rank of the fundamental group is calculated as rank = E - V + 1.")
print(f"rank = {E} - {V} + 1 = {rank}")
print(f"A free group on {rank} generators is denoted as Z * Z.")
print("Therefore, the fundamental group is Z * Z.")
