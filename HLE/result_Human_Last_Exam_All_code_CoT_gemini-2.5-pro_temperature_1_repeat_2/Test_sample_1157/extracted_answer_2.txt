The appropriate management involves a multi-disciplinary approach prioritizing systemic health stabilization (managing the 7.5% HbA1c diabetes) before addressing the dental issues from the 28-hour-old trauma. The cells of interest are fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and immune cells. A suitable prosthetic would be a chrome-cobalt removable partial denture, using the left central incisor and second premolar as abutments, pending assessment of their health. This plan must account for the Class III skeletal relationship indicated by the 88 degree SNB angle.
