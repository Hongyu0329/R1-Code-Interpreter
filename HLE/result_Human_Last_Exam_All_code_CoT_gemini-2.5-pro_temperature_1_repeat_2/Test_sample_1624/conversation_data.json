    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an upper bound on the cardinality of a connected metric space $X$ which contains a dense open subset $U$, where every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the subset U:** We'll first determine the topological properties of $U$ based on the given information. The condition that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n2.  **Determine the cardinality of U:** By using the classification theorem for 1-manifolds and properties derived from $X$ being a metric space, we can determine the structure of $U$ and subsequently its cardinality. This will give us a lower bound for the cardinality of $X$.\n3.  **Analyze the space X:** We'll use the fact that $U$ is a dense subset of $X$ to deduce properties of $X$ itself. Specifically, we'll show that $X$ must be a separable metric space.\n4.  **Establish the upper bound for |X|:** There's a standard result in topology that provides an upper bound for the cardinality of any separable metric space.\n5.  **Combine the bounds:** By combining the lower bound from step 2 and the upper bound from step 4, we can determine the exact cardinality of $X$ and thus provide the tightest possible upper bound.\n\nThis logical flow will be presented in the Python script below.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step explanation to find the upper bound\n    on the cardinality of the metric space X.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define common cardinality symbols for clarity\n    aleph_0 = \"aleph_0 (the cardinality of natural numbers)\"\n    c = \"c (the cardinality of the continuum, 2^aleph_0)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Analyze the topological structure of the subset U ---\")\n    print(\"Given that U is an open subset of X and every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R, U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"Since U is a subspace of a metric space X, U is itself a metrizable space.
