    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** The graph \\( G \\) is defined as the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which can be written as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The \"sum\" of graphs (also known as the graph join) means we take the three cycles, and then add an edge between every vertex of one cycle and every vertex of the other two cycles.\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number Property:** There is a well-known property for the chromatic number of a graph sum: the chromatic number of the sum of two graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers. That is, \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n3.  **Apply the Property to G:** We can apply this rule to our graph \\( G \\). This gives us \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n4.  **Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on its length \\( n \\):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is an even number (\\(n \\ge 2\\)), the cycle is a bipartite graph and can be colored with 2 colors. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is an odd number (\\(n \\ge 3\\)), the cycle requires 3 colors. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n5.  **Find the Maximal Value:** The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\), we must use the maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:** By substituting the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into the equation, we get the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\).\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Explain the chromatic number property for graph sums.\n    # For G = G1 + G2, χ(G) = χ(G1) + χ(G2).\n    # For G = C_n + C_n + C_n, this means χ(G) = χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) + χ(C_n).\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the chromatic number of G = C_n + C_n + C_n is χ(G) = χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) + χ(C_n).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of a cycle C_n.\n    # χ(C_n) = 2 for even n, and 3 for odd n.\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle graph, χ(C_n), is:\")\n    print(\"- 2, if n is an even number.\")\n    print(\"- 3, if n is an odd number.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the maximal chromatic number.\n    # To maximize χ(G), we must maximize χ(C_n).\n    print(\"To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we must choose n such that χ(C_n) is maximized.\")\n    max_chi_cn = 3\n    print(f\"The maximum value for χ(C_n) is {max_chi_cn}, which occurs when n is odd.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final result and print the equation.\n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number of G is calculated by substituting this value into the equation:\")\n    result = max_chi_cn + max_chi_cn + max_chi_cn\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
