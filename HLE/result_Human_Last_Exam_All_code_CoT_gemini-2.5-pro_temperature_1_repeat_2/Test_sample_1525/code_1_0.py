    Analyzes the provided statements and returns the count of correct ones.

    A. Correct. The "order of appearance" is ambiguous for a set-based Datalog program.
    B. Incorrect. The identity gamma[gamma_inv[P]] = P holds, as segregation replaces constants
       with their pre-images and aggregation maps them back.
    C. Correct. Aggregation is lossy. If gamma(c1)=gamma(c2)=c, then after aggregation,
       the distinction between c1 and c2 is lost and cannot be recovered by segregation.
    D. Incorrect. The formula for segregation, while complex, is unambiguous. The union
       operator specifies that combinations are generated.
    E. Incorrect. The claim is about equivalence of two computational paths, not that one
       path has "no effect", which is a false characterization.
