    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` from the Cartesian product of sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` that remains invariant under a system of three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\nThe function signatures you provided appear to contain typos, as `G` is defined twice and the argument patterns are non-standard. In the mathematical study of coupled and tripled fixed points, a more common and symmetric structure is used, which involves cyclic permutations of the variables. The standard signatures are:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * Z * X → Y`\n*   `H: Z * X * Y → Z`\n\nBased on this standard formulation, a point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations. The following Python code will print these defining conditions. These equations are the fundamental requirement for a tripled fixed point. The *existence* of such a point would require further conditions on the functions and spaces, such as those found in contractive mapping theorems.\n\n```python\ndef print_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the defining equations for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \n    A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies\n    the following system of equations, based on the standard cyclic\n    definition of the functions F, G, and H.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The list of conditions (equations) that must be met.\n    conditions = [\n        \"F(x, y, z) = x\",\n        \"G(y, z, x) = y\",\n        \"H(z, x, y) = z\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"The conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are given by the following system of equations:\")\n    \n    # We iterate through the list and print each equation, prefixed with its number.\n    for i, eq in enumerate(conditions):\n        equation_number = i + 1\n        print(f\"Equation {equation_number}: {eq}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the conditions.\nprint_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<The conditions for a point `(x, y, z)` to be an FGH-tripled fixed point are the satisfaction of the system of equations: `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, z, x) = y`, and `H(z, x, y) = z`.>>>"
