    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we first need to establish the rank of the Danish flag.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rank of the Flag of Denmark:** A flag's design can be viewed as a matrix. The rank of this matrix depends on its structure. To achieve the maximal rank, we consider the fundamental patterns. The Danish flag consists of a red field and a white Nordic cross.\n    *   This structure creates two distinct types of rows (a row with `red-white-red` and a row with `white-white-white`).\n    *   It also creates two distinct types of columns (a column with `red-white-red` and a column with `white-white-white`).\n    *   Since there are two linearly independent row vectors and two linearly independent column vectors that can describe the flag, its maximal rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify African Flags with Rank 2:** We will look for flags whose structure is more complex than simple horizontal or vertical stripes (which have a rank of 1), but not so complex as to require three or more basis vectors to describe them (which would give them a rank of 3 or higher). Flags with rank 2 typically include:\n    *   A single-color field with a central emblem (e.g., Morocco).\n    *   Stripes (horizontal or vertical) with a central emblem (e.g., Ghana, Senegal).\n    *   Stripes with a canton (a rectangular area in the corner, e.g., Liberia).\n    *   A design with a hoist-side element like a vertical stripe or triangle (e.g., Madagascar, Sudan).\n    *   Flags with a single diagonal division or stripe. After careful consideration, flags with simple diagonal divisions (like Republic of the Congo) or complex ones (like Tanzania) often result in a rank of 3 or more due to the way rows and columns are constructed. Therefore, they will be excluded. Flags like South Africa (Y-shape) and Seychelles (radiating bands) are also excluded for having a rank higher than 2.\n\n3.  **Generate the List:** Based on this methodology, I will compile a list of all African nations whose flags have a structural rank of 2.\n\n4.  **Python Code:** The final Python code will simply print this curated list.\n\n```python\ndef find_rank_two_flags():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the list of African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank (2) as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The determination of rank is based on the flag's geometric structure:\n    - Rank 1: Simple parallel stripes (all horizontal or all vertical).\n    - Rank 2: A cross, stripes with an emblem/canton, a field with an emblem, a hoist-side element, etc.\n    - Rank 3+: More complex designs like Y-shapes, saltires, or multiple diagonal elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of African nations with flags of rank 2\n    rank_two_nations = [\n        \"Algeria\",\n        \"Angola\",\n        \"Burkina Faso\",\n        \"Cameroon\",\n        \"Cape Verde\",\n        \"Central African Republic\",\n        \"Comoros\",\n        \"Djibouti\",\n        \"Egypt\",\n        \"Equatorial Guinea\",\n        \"Eswatini\",\n        \"Ethiopia\",\n        \"Ghana\",\n        \"Kenya\",\n        \"Lesotho\",\n        \"Liberia\",\n        \"Libya\",\n        \"Madagascar\",\n        \"Malawi\",\n        \"Mauritania\",\n        \"Morocco\",\n        \"Mozambique\",\n        \"Niger\",\n        \"Rwanda\",\n        \"Sao Tome and Principe\",\n        \"Senegal\",\n        \"Somalia\",\n        \"South Sudan\",\n        \"Sudan\",\n        \"Togo\",\n        \"Tunisia\",\n        \"Uganda\",\n        \"Zambia\",\n        \"Zimbabwe\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The flags of the following African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark (Rank 2):\")\n    for nation in sorted(rank_two_nations):\n        print(f\"- {nation}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_rank_two_flags()\n\n```\n<<<Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe>>>"
