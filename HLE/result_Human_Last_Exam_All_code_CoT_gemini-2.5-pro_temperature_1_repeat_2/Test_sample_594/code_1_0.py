    print("This is UNLIKELY for the following reason:")
    print("1. Gas is more effectively trapped in the pores in the part's INTERIOR.")
    print("2. These gas-filled pores are stable and resist shrinking. They act as pinning points for grain boundaries.")
    print("3. By pinning the grain boundaries, the pores INHIBIT grain growth in the interior.")
    print("4. Near the SURFACE, gas can escape more easily, allowing for better densification and less inhibited grain growth.")
