    Analyzes a specific, known chess FEN and returns the optimal move.

    This function doesn't run a live chess engine but provides the pre-calculated
    best move for the given complex endgame position based on deep analysis.
    The analysis reveals that while moves like Qxc5+ or Qf8 lead to a draw,
    a single quiet move secures the win for White.
