    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is not a single, universally agreed-upon number. It is determined experimentally and can vary based on the catalyst synthesis method, nanoparticle morphology, and specific reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.). The key is to maximize the interface between Ni and Ceria, as these interface sites are believed to be the most catalytically active, while preventing the sintering (clumping) of Ni particles at high temperatures.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that summarizes key findings from scientific literature for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions. The script will calculate the Ni/Ce atomic ratios from reported compositions (e.g., mole percent or weight percent) and print a clear summary. This approach uses coding to present the scientific data as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Summarizes findings from scientific literature on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio\n    for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts depends on the target reaction.\")\n    print(\"The goal is typically to achieve high Ni dispersion and maximize the Ni-CeO2 interface.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction ---\n    print(\"For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction:\")\n    # A Ni/(Ni+Ce) atomic ratio of 0.11 is reported as highly active in some studies.\n    # Let's calculate the corresponding Ni/Ce ratio.\n    wgs_ni_fraction = 0.11\n    wgs_ce_fraction = 1 - wgs_ni_fraction\n    wgs_ni_ce_ratio = wgs_ni_fraction / wgs_ce_fraction\n    \n    print(f\"A reported highly active composition has a Ni/(Ni+Ce) atomic fraction of {wgs_ni_fraction}.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation for the Ni/Ce ratio is: {wgs_ni_fraction} / (1 - {wgs_ni_fraction})\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to an ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately: {wgs_ni_ce_ratio:.3f}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Water Splitting (WS) via Thermochemical Cycles ---\n    print(\"For Water Splitting (WS) via thermochemical cycles:\")\n    # A 5 mol% Ni doping is shown to be highly effective.\n    # This means Ni/(Ni+Ce) = 0.05.
