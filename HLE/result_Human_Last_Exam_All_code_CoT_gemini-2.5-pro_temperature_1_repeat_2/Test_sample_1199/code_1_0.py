    # --- Step 1: Analysis of the first call ---

    # A* a = new A();
    # a->foo();
    #
    # At this point, the compiler has just seen the object's creation.
    # It knows with certainty that the dynamic type of the object pointed to by 'a' is 'A'.
    # A perfectly optimizing compiler will perform "devirtualization" and convert
    # the virtual call `a->foo()` into a direct call `A::foo()`.
    # This optimization avoids using the virtual table entirely.

    # --- Step 2: Analysis of the second call ---
    # C++ code:
    # escape(a); // something that potentially changes the virtual type
    # a->foo();
    #
    # The function `escape(a)` tells the compiler that the pointer 'a' has "escaped"
    # its analysis. The compiler must discard any assumptions about the object 'a'
    # points to, as its type could have been changed by external code.
    # Therefore, the compiler cannot devirtualize this call. It must generate code
    # to perform a full virtual dispatch: load the vtable pointer from the object
    # and call the function at the correct offset. This incurs one vtable load.

    # C++ code:

    #
    # The expression `new(a) B` is a "placement new". It constructs a new 'B'
    # object in the memory location pointed to by 'a'.
    # The compiler sees this and knows with certainty that the pointer 'b' (which holds
    # the same address as 'a') now points to an object of dynamic type 'B'.
    # It will again perform devirtualization, converting `b->foo()` into a direct
    # call to `B::foo()`. This optimization avoids a vtable load.
