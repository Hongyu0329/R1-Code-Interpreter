        "1. Constant Precision Transformers:\n\n"
        "A transformer's computation is based on operations like matrix multiplication, additions, and activation functions (e.g., softmax).\n"
        "When we assume constant precision, all numbers are represented by a fixed number of bits, k, regardless of the input size n.\n\n"
        "  - Arithmetic: Basic arithmetic operations (multiplication, addition) on k-bit numbers can be performed by constant-size, constant-depth circuits.\n"
        "  - Dot Products: Matrix multiplication involves dot products, which sum up n terms. The problem of summing n numbers (iterated addition) is known to be in TC0 (the class of problems solvable by constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with threshold gates).\n"
        "  - Activation Functions: Functions like softmax can be approximated by polynomials. For constant-precision inputs, these approximations can also be computed by TC0 circuits.\n\n"
        "Since a transformer consists of a constant number of layers, and each layer's computation can be performed by a TC0 circuit, the entire constant-precision transformer model is in TC0."

        "Chain-of-thought (CoT) involves feeding the model's output from one step back into the input of the next step. This process is repeated for a polynomial number of steps, p(n).\n\n"
        "  - Iterative Computation: This model is equivalent to iterating a function f for p(n) times, where f represents a single pass of the transformer. From the analysis above, f is in TC0.\n"
        "  - Simulation in P: This iterative process can be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine. Each iteration takes polynomial time to simulate the TC0 circuit, and there are a polynomial number of iterations. The total time is poly(n) * poly(n) = poly(n), placing the entire computation in the class P (Polynomial Time).\n"
        "  - P-hardness: To determine if it is P-complete, we check if it can solve any problem in P. A generic P-complete problem is the Circuit Value Problem (CVP), which involves evaluating a polynomial-size boolean circuit. A circuit can be evaluated layer by layer. The computation of one layer from the previous one is a highly parallelizable task that can be implemented in TC0. Therefore, iterating a TC0 function for polynomial steps is powerful enough to simulate any polynomial-size circuit, making the model P-hard.\n\n"
        "Since the model is in P and is also P-hard, it is P-complete."
