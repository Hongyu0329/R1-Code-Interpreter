    # The equation for alpha comes from the construction:
    # Measure = (Number of rationals b/q with q < N^(1/4)) * (width of interval around each rational)
    # Number of rationals is of order (N^(1/4))^2 = N^(1/2)

    # This implies alpha = -1/2.

    # Final equation based on the derivation.
    # We found that the measure |X| has a lower bound of order N^a * N^b = N^(a+b)
    # where the number of intervals ~ N^a with a = 1/2
    # and the width of intervals ~ N^b with b = -1
