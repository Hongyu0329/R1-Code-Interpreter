    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal (wrap-around) board such that no two queens threaten each other.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Toroidal Board:** A queen at `(r, c)` on an `N x N` toroidal board attacks any square `(r', c')` if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. The wrap-around nature of the board can be elegantly handled using modular arithmetic. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if any of these conditions are met:\n    *   **Row attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Main diagonal attack:** `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n2.  **Brute-Force Approach:** Since the board (5x5) and the number of queens (4) are small, we can check every possible placement. The total number of ways to choose 4 squares out of 25 is C(25, 4) = 12,650, which is a manageable number for a computer to check.\n\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   Generate all combinations of 4 distinct squares from the 25 available squares on the board.\n    *   For each combination, check if it's a valid placement by ensuring that for the 4 chosen squares, all row numbers, all column numbers, all main diagonal indices (`(r-c)%5`), and all anti-diagonal indices (`(r+c)%5`) are unique.\n    *   Count the number of valid placements.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script that uses the `itertools.combinations` library to generate the placements and then iterates through them to count the valid ones based on the rules above.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_non_attacking_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5\n    toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n\n    # Create a list of all possible squares (r, c) on the board\n    all_squares = [(r, c) for r in range(board_size) for c in range(board_size)]\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of placing the queens on the board\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(all_squares, num_queens)\n\n    valid_placement_count = 0\n    # Iterate through each possible placement\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        # For a placement to be valid, all queens must be on different...\n        # 1. rows\n        # 2. columns\n        # 3. main diagonals (r - c)\n        # 4. anti-diagonals (r + c)\n        # We use the modulo operator to handle the toroidal \"wrap-around\" effect.\n\n        rows = {q[0] for q in placement}\n        cols = {q[1] for q in placement}\n        main_diagonals = {(q[0] - q[1]) % board_size for q in placement}\n        anti_diagonals = {(q[0] + q[1]) % board_size for q in placement}\n\n        # A valid placement has no two queens on the same line.\n        # This means the number of unique rows, cols, and diagonals\n        # must be equal to the number of queens.\n        if (len(rows) == num_queens and\n            len(cols) == num_queens and\n            len(main_diagonals) == num_queens and\n            len(anti_diagonals) == num_queens):\n            valid_placement_count += 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens on a {board_size}x{board_size} toroidal chessboard is:\")\n    print(valid_placement_count)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_non_attacking_queens()\n```\n<<<100>>>"
