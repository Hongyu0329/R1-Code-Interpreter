    "The number of nonzero coefficients of a given order `n` in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for `log(exp(X)exp(Y))` is equivalent to the dimension of the subspace of the free Lie algebra with two generators (`X` and `Y`) of degree `n`. This dimension is calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (`X` and `Y`).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to implement this formula in Python:\n1.  Define a function to compute the Möbius function, `μ(d)`.\n2.  Find all divisors of `n=10`.\n3.  Apply Witt's formula for `n=10` and `k=2`, calculating each term in the sum.\n4.  Print the full calculation, including the intermediate values, to show how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function μ(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the BCH expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # For pretty printing the formula\n    formula_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius_mu(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k**power)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        formula_terms.append(f\"μ({d})*({k}^({n}//{d}))\")\n        value_terms.append(f\"({mu_d})*({k**power})\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula L_k(n) for k=2 and n=10.\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating each term for divisors of 10: {\", \", \".join(map(str, divisors)), \"}\")\n    \n    formula_str = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(formula_terms) + \" ]\"\n    print(formula_str)\n\n    value_str = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" + \".join(value_terms) + \" ]\"\n    print(value_str.replace(\"+ -\", \"- \"))\n\n    calc_str = f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\"\n    print(calc_str)\n    \n    final_str = f\"L_2(10) = {result}\"\n    print(final_str)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is {result}.\")\n\nsolve_bch_coeffs()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
