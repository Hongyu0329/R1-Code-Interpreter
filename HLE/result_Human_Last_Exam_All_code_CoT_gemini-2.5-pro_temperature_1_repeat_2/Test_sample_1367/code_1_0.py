    Solves a series of questions about the vertex algebra V(p).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The vertex algebra V(p) is known to be simple if and only if p is a prime number.
        Since p can be any integer >= 1, it is not simple for all p (e.g., p=4 is not a prime).
        Therefore, the answer is No.

    (b) If a VOA like V(p) has a non-trivial ideal, that ideal must be generated by a "singular vector"
        (in the context of highest-weight modules). Thus, the ideal must contain a singular vector.
        Furthermore, an ideal I in a VOA V is a subspace such that for any a in I and b in V, the product Y(b,z)a is in I.
        This implies that I is closed under the action of any element in V, and therefore also under the action of any subalgebra.
        Since L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p), any ideal of V(p) must also be a module for L_k(sl_2).
        Thus, both given conditions must be met.

    (c) Simplicity as a VOA does not imply irreducibility as a module over a subalgebra.
        A simple VOA can be decomposable (reducible) when viewed as a module over a subalgebra.
        In fact, V(p) is known to decompose into a direct sum of irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules.
        Therefore, even when V(p) is simple (e.g., for p=2, 3, 5...), it is not irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module.
        The answer is No.
