    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Formula:** The number of independent real components of the Riemann curvature tensor on a manifold depends on its specific geometric structure. For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` (and thus real dimension `n = 2m`), the additional symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure significantly reduce the number of independent components compared to a general Riemannian manifold. The formula for this number is:\n    $$ N = \\left( \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \\right)^2 $$\n2.  **Explain the Formula:** This formula arises because the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor can be written as $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$ in complex coordinates. These components can be organized into a Hermitian matrix of size $d \\times d$, where $d = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. The number of independent real entries in such a matrix is $d^2$.\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that takes the complex dimension `m` as input and uses this formula to calculate the number of independent components, printing out each step of the calculation. For the example, we will use a complex dimension of `m = 3`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m.\n\n    Args:\n        m (int): The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The formula for the number of components is (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\n    # Let's calculate the intermediate part first.\n    # This represents the dimension of the space of symmetric m x m matrices.\n    d_val = m * (m + 1) // 2\n\n    # The final number of components is the square of d_val.\n    num_components = d_val ** 2\n\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the number of independent components is ( (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2 ).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
