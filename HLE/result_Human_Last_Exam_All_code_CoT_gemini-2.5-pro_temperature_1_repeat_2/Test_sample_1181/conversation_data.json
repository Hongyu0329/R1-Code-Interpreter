    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character who most profoundly feels the separation from Earth and its natural environment is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin. His nostalgia and homesickness are central themes, often visualized through his watching of old home video footage that includes scenes of nature, his father, and his childhood home. He is the one who is ashamed to have forgotten such a fundamental sensory experience as the sound of rustling leaves, a symbol of everything he has left behind.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the correct character from the movie Solaris (1972).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question asks which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\n    # In the film, the protagonist Kris Kelvin is overwhelmed with nostalgia and longing for Earth.\n    # He is the character most deeply connected to memories of Earth's nature, which he revisits through old videos.\n    # This specific sentiment is a hallmark of his character arc.\n\n    character_options = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_letter = 'A'\n    correct_character_name = character_options[correct_answer_letter]\n\n    print(f\"The character in 'Solaris' (1972) who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is {correct_character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_answer_letter}.\")\n\nsolve_solaris_trivia()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
