# 1. Define the elliptic curve
# The given curve y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10x - 20 is a model for the curve with Cremona label "49a1".
# The L-function is an invariant of the rational isomorphism class, so we can use the label directly.
try:
    E = EllipticCurve("49a1")
except Exception:
    print("Could not initialize the elliptic curve. Please ensure your SageMath installation is working correctly.")
    exit()

# 2. Find the rank r
# The rank of the Mordell-Weil group E(Q) is a known property for this curve.
r = E.rank()

# 3. Define the Dirichlet characters
# We need the two primitive cubic characters of conductor 7.
G = DirichletGroup(7)
cubic_chars = [chi for chi in G if chi.is_primitive() and chi.order() == 3]
chi1 = cubic_chars[0]

# The second character, chi2, is the complex conjugate of chi1.
# chi2 = cubic_chars[1]

# 4. Compute the leading coefficients a and b
# The L-function of E twisted by chi1.
L1 = E.lseries().twist(chi1)

# The function `lvalue(1)` computes the leading coefficient of the Taylor series expansion at s=1.
# It automatically determines the order of vanishing k and returns the value L^(k)(1)/k!.
a = L1.lvalue(1)

# Since chi2 is the complex conjugate of chi1, the leading coefficient b of L(E, s, chi2)
# is the complex conjugate of a.
b = a.conjugate()

# 5. Calculate the final sum
result = r + a + b

# 6. Print the results as requested by the user
# We use .n() to get a numerical approximation for printing.
a_real = a.n().real()
a_imag = a.n().imag()
b_real = b.n().real()
b_imag = b.n().imag()
result_val = result.n()

# Output the components of the final equation
print("The problem is to compute r + a + b.")
print(f"The rank of the elliptic curve E(Q) is r = {r}.")
print(f"The leading coefficient of L(E, s, chi1) at s=1 is a ≈ {a_real:.4f} + {a_imag:.4f}i")
print(f"The leading coefficient of L(E, s, chi2) at s=1 is b ≈ {b_real:.4f} + {b_imag:.4f}i")
print("\nThe final equation with the computed values is:")
# Use a sign for the imaginary part for clarity
a_imag_sign = '+' if a_imag >= 0 else '-'
b_imag_sign = '+' if b_imag >= 0 else '-'
print(f"{r} + ({a_real:.4f} {a_imag_sign} {abs(a_imag):.4f}i) + ({b_real:.4f} {b_imag_sign} {abs(b_imag):.4f}i) = {result_val:.4f}")

final_answer = round(result_val, 4)
print(f"\nThe value of r + a + b rounded to four decimal places is {final_answer}.")
