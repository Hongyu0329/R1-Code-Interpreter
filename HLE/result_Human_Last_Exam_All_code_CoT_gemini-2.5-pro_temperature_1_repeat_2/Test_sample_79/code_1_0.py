    print("This is NOT necessarily true. 'Non-overlapping generations' means parents die before offspring reproduce, but it does not preclude parental care before their death.")

    print("This is NOT necessarily true. While the gene pool is homogenized by random mating, the phenotype is also influenced by the environment (since Heritability H^2 = 0.7). A systematic environmental difference between the west and east could cause a phenotypic difference.")
