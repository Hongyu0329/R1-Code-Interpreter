# The clues point to an analysis of the Ten Commandments.
# The "prohibition against representation" is commandment number 2.
commandment_representation = 2

commandment_possessions = 10

first_name = "Jacques"
last_name = "Lacan"

# We present the final answer as an equation combining the clues.
# The analysis of commandment 2 + commandment 10 -> The Name
