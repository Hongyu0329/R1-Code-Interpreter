# Step 1: Determine the minimized probability of Agent A winning.
# Based on the analysis, the probability P(F) is an increasing function of F.
# Thus, the minimum probability occurs at the lowest possible value of F, which is F=0.
# For F=0, the probability of A winning is 1/2.
prob_A_wins_numerator = 1
prob_A_wins_denominator = 2
prob_A_wins = prob_A_wins_numerator / prob_A_wins_denominator

# Step 2: The problem asks for the value of floor(1 / P(A wins)).
# The final equation is floor(1 / (1/2)) = 2.
numerator = 1
value = numerator / prob_A_wins
result = math.floor(value)

# Step 3: Output the numbers in the final equation as requested.
# The final equation is floor(1 / (1/2)) = 2.
# The numbers are 1, 1, 2, and the result 2.
