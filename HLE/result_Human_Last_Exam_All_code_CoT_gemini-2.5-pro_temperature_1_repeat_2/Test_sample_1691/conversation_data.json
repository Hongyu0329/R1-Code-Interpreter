    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can use the methods of asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the nature of the problem:** The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^L \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the integrand develops a sharp peak near $x=0$, where $f(x)$ is small. This suggests that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from this region. This is a classic singular perturbation problem.\n\n2.  **Approximate the function f(x):** For small $x$, the function $f(x)$ can be approximated by the first few terms of its power series expansion. The leading term is $9.0x^{5.0}$ and the next dominant term is $5.0x^{6.0}$. So, we'll use the approximation $f(x) \\approx 9.0x^{5.0} + 5.0x^{6.0}$.\n\n3.  **Develop an asymptotic expansion:** We seek an expansion for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$. By performing a suitable change of variables (related to the dominant balance between $\\epsilon$ and the leading term of $f(x)$), we can show that the integral has an asymptotic series in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. The expansion takes the form:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5} + O(\\epsilon^{-2/5})$\n\n4.  **Calculate the coefficients:**\n    *   The first coefficient, $C_1$, is determined by the leading behavior of $f(x)$, i.e., $f(x) \\sim 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n    *   The second coefficient, $C_2$, is a correction term that depends on the next term in the expansion of $f(x)$, which is $5.0x^{6.0}$.\n    *   These coefficients can be calculated by transforming the integral and evaluating some standard definite integrals related to the Beta and Gamma functions. Specifically, we use the formula $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{a-1}}{1+x^b} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{b \\sin(\\pi a/b)}$.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The following Python code implements this plan. It calculates the numerical values of the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ and prints the final approximate formula for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic approximation of the integral I(epsilon).\n    The approximation is of the form I(epsilon) ~ C1 * epsilon^a + C2 * epsilon^b.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the integral's denominator polynomial\n    # f(x) = p0*x^n + p1*x^k + ...\n    p0 = 9.0\n    p1 = 5.0\n    n = 5.0\n    k = 6.0\n\n    # --- Calculate C1, the coefficient of the leading term ---\n    # The leading term exponent is a = (1-n)/n\n    a = (1 - n) / n\n    # The coefficient C1 is given by (1/p0^(1/n)) * integral(1/(1+y^n))\n    # The integral is (pi/n) / sin(pi/n)\n    integral_c1 = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n    c1 = (1 / (p0**(1/n))) * integral_c1\n\n    # --- Calculate C2, the coefficient of the first correction term ---\n    # The correction term exponent is b = (k - 2n + 1)/n\n    b = (k - 2*n + 1) / n\n    # The coefficient C2 involves an integral of the form integral(y^k / (1+y^n)^2)\n    # This integral can be simplified to ((k-n+1)/n) * integral(y^(k-n) / (1+y^n))\n    # The second integral is (pi/n) / sin(pi*(k-n+1)/n)\n    j = k - n\n    integral_c2_part2 = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi * (j + 1) / n)\n    integral_c2 = ((j + 1) / n) * integral_c2_part2\n    \n    # The full C2 coefficient is -p1 / p0^((k+1)/n) * integral_c2\n    c2 = - (p1 / (p0**((k+1)/n))) * integral_c2\n    \n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ~= C1 * epsilon^a + C2 * epsilon^b\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {c1:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"a = {a}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {c2:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"b = {b}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal equation:\")\n    # Using '+' for the second term and letting the sign of C2 handle it\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ~= {c1:.4f} * epsilon**({a:.1f}) + ({c2:.4f}) * epsilon**({b:.1f})\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) ~= {c1:.4f} * epsilon**(-4/5) {c2:+.4f} * epsilon**(-3/5)\")\n\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n<<<I(epsilon) ~= 0.6889 * epsilon**(-0.8) - 0.0610 * epsilon**(-0.6)>>>\n```"
