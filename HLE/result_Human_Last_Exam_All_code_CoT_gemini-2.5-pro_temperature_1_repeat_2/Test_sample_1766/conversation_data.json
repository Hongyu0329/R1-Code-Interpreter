    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the quantum numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. As it's an electron, its spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine possible total angular momentum `j` values**: The total angular momentum quantum number `j` results from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine possible `m_j` values**: For each value of `j`, the total magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate the eigenvalues**: The states characterized by the quantum numbers `j` and `m_j` are common eigenstates of the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$. The corresponding eigenvalues are:\n    *   For $J^2$: The eigenvalue is $j(j+1)\\hbar^2$.\n    *   For $J_z$: The eigenvalue is $m_j\\hbar$.\n    We will set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity, which is a common convention in such problems.\n5.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a Python script that iterates through all possible `j` and `m_j` values, calculates the eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$, and prints the results clearly. To maintain precision and represent the values as they appear in textbooks, I will use Python's `fractions` module.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum for p-shell\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)  # spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron, l = {l} and s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in steps of 1\n    j_values = np.arange(float(j_min), float(j_max) + 1, 1.0)\n    \n    print(\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are:\")\n    for j_val in j_values:\n        print(f\"j = {Fraction(j_val)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, find mj values and calculate the eigenvalues\n    for j_float in j_values:\n        j = Fraction(j_float)\n        \n        # Calculate the J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)hbar^2 = {j}({j}+1)hbar^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue} hbar^2\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible mj values\n        mj_values = [Fraction(m) for m in np.arange(-float(j), float(j) + 1, 1.0)]\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values range from -j to +j:\")\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is simply mj\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {mj:<5}, the eigenvalue of J_z is {jz_eigenvalue} hbar\")\n        print(\"-\" * 40)\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<The eigenvalues for J^2 are 15/4 and 3/4 (in units of hbar^2).
