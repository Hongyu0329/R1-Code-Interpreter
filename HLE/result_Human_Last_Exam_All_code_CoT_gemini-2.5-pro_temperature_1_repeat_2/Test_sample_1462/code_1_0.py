    # --- Analysis ---
    # Step 1: Evaluate the patient's size.
    # A weight of 12 lb 1 oz is well above the 90th percentile for a newborn,
    # a condition known as macrosomia or Large for Gestational Age (LGA).
    # The most common cause of fetal macrosomia is maternal diabetes.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the respiratory status.
    # An oxygen saturation of 89% indicates significant respiratory distress.
    # This is consistent with the lung finding. In the context of maternal diabetes,
    # fetal hyperinsulinemia can impair surfactant production, leading to
    # Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS).

    # Step 3: Evaluate the physical findings.
    # Micrognathia is a congenital anomaly. Uncontrolled maternal diabetes is a
    # known risk factor for various congenital anomalies.

    # Step 4: Synthesize the findings to find the unifying diagnosis.
    # The combination of macrosomia, respiratory distress, and a congenital anomaly
    # is a classic presentation for an infant of a diabetic mother.
