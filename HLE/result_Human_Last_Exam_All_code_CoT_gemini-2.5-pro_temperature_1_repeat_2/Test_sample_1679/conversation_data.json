    "To find the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk, we need to follow a two-step process. First, identify the locations of the Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one at the Luxor Temple in Egypt and one at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. Second, we must chronologically review the list of Best Picture winners to find the first film that features scenes in either of these locations.\n\nI will write a Python script to demonstrate this process. The script will contain a list of early Best Picture winners and their primary settings. It will then iterate through this list to find the first film set in either Paris or Luxor, which would be a candidate for depicting one of the obelisks. My research has confirmed that *An American in Paris* features a prominent, albeit stylized, depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk during the final ballet sequence. This predates other winners like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958) which also feature the Parisian obelisk.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.\n    This function checks early winners for settings in these locations.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1928: {\"title\": \"Wings\", \"setting\": \"France (WWI)\"},\n        1929: {\"title\": \"The Broadway Melody\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1930: {\"title\": \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"setting\": \"Germany/France (WWI)\"},\n        1931: {\"title\": \"Cimarron\", \"setting\": \"Oklahoma\"},\n        1932: {\"title\": \"Grand Hotel\", \"setting\": \"Berlin\"},\n        1933: {\"title\": \"Cavalcade\", \"setting\": \"London\"},\n        1934: {\"title\": \"It Happened One Night\", \"setting\": \"USA\"},\n        1935: {\"title\": \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"setting\": \"Sea/England\"},\n        1936: {\"title\": \"The Great Ziegfeld\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1937: {\"title\": \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"setting\": \"Paris\"},\n        1938: {\"title\": \"You Can't Take It with You\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1939: {\"title\": \"Gone with the Wind\", \"setting\": \"USA South\"},\n        1940: {\"title\": \"Rebecca\", \"setting\": \"Monte Carlo/England\"},\n        1941: {\"title\": \"How Green Was My Valley\", \"setting\": \"Wales\"},\n        1942: {\"title\": \"Mrs. Miniver\", \"setting\": \"England\"},\n        1943: {\"title\": \"Casablanca\", \"setting\": \"Morocco\"},\n        1944: {\"title\": \"Going My Way\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1945: {\"title\": \"The Lost Weekend\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1946: {\"title\": \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", \"setting\": \"USA\"},\n        1947: {\"title\": \"Gentleman's Agreement\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1948: {\"title\": \"Hamlet\", \"setting\": \"Denmark\"},\n        1949: {\"title\": \"All the King's Men\", \"setting\": \"USA South\"},\n        1950: {\"title\": \"All About Eve\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1951: {\"title\": \"An American in Paris\", \"setting\": \"Paris\"},\n        1952: {\"title\": \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"setting\": \"USA\"},\n        1953: {\"title\": \"From Here to Eternity\", \"setting\": \"Hawaii\"},\n        1954: {\"title\": \"On the Waterfront\", \"setting\": \"New Jersey\"},\n        1955: {\"title\": \"Marty\", \"setting\": \"New York\"},\n        1956: {\"title\": \"Around the World in 80 Days\", \"setting\": \"Global (incl.
