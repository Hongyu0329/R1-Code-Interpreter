    "Of course. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atoms in the molecule. I will provide a Python script that calculates this for a given molecular formula and demonstrates it for a common molecule, formaldehyde (CH2O).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** First, I'll break down what \"6-311G**\" means in terms of primitive Gaussians for different types of atoms (Hydrogen vs. heavy atoms like C, N, O).\n    *   **Heavy Atoms (e.g., C, O):** These have core and valence electrons. The `6-311G` part defines the contractions for these, and the first `*` adds `d`-type polarization functions.\n    *   **Hydrogen Atoms (H):** These only have valence electrons. The `6-311G` part defines their contractions, and the second `*` adds `p`-type polarization functions.\n2.  **Develop a Python Script:** I'll create a script that takes a chemical formula (e.g., \"CH2O\") as input.\n3.  **Parse the Formula:** The script will parse the formula to count the number of atoms of each element.\n4.  **Calculate and Print:** Using the counts and the rules from step 1, the script will calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians and print a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation. I will use formaldehyde (CH2O) as the example.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_primitive_gaussians(formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the total number of primitive Gaussian functions\n    for a given molecule with the 6-311G** basis set.\n\n    This script demonstrates the calculation for the molecule specified in the\n    `formula_to_calculate` variable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define primitives per atom for 6-311G** ---\n    # This is generally valid for 2nd-row elements (Li-Ne).\n    # Heavy Atom (like C, N, O): 6(core) + 4*(3+1+1)(valence) + 6(d-pol) = 32\n    # Hydrogen Atom: (3+1+1)(valence) + 3(p-pol) = 8\n    primitives_per_atom = {\n        'H': 8,\n        'C': 32, 'N': 32, 'O': 32, 'F': 32, 'B': 32, 'Be': 32, 'Li': 32, 'Ne': 32\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 2: Parse the chemical formula to get atom counts ---\n    try:\n        atom_counts = Counter()\n        # Find all atom-count pairs (e.g., 'C', 'H2', 'O')\n        for atom, count_str in re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula):\n            count = int(count_str) if count_str else 1\n            atom_counts[atom] += count\n    except Exception:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse the chemical formula '{formula}'.\")\n        print(\"Please use a standard format like 'H2O', 'CH4', or 'C6H6'.\")\n        return\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the total and prepare the explanation ---\n    total_primitives = 0\n    calculation_parts = []\n    equation_parts = []\n    value_parts = []\n\n    # Sort atoms for consistent output (e.g., C, H, then others)\n    sorted_atoms = sorted(atom_counts.keys(), key=lambda x: (x != 'C', x != 'H', x))\n\n    for atom in sorted_atoms:\n        count = atom_counts[atom]\n        if atom not in primitives_per_atom:\n            print(f\"Warning: The calculation for atom '{atom}' is not defined.\")\n            continue\n\n        primitives = primitives_per_atom[atom]\n        total_primitives += count * primitives\n\n        calculation_parts.append(f\"({count} * {atom})\")\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({count} * {primitives})\")\n        value_parts.append(str(count * primitives))\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the detailed explanation and result ---\n    print(f\"To find the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set for {formula}:\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we determine the number of primitives for each type of atom:\")\n    print(\"  - For a heavy atom (like C, N, O):\")\n    print(\"    - Core orbitals (1s) are represented by 6 primitives.\")\n    print(\"    - Valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split into 3 parts (3+1+1), for 4 orbitals: 4 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 20 primitives.\")\n    print(\"    - The first '*' adds one set of d-polarization functions: 6 primitives.\")\n    print(\"    - Total per heavy atom = 6 + 20 + 6 = 32 primitives.\")\n    print(\"\\n  - For a Hydrogen atom (H):\")\n    print(\"    - Valence orbital (1s) is split into 3 parts: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives.\")\n    print(\"    - The second '*' adds one set of p-polarization functions: 3 primitives.\")\n    print(\"    - Total per Hydrogen atom = 5 + 3 = 8 primitives.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nNext, we apply this to the molecule {formula}, which has:\")\n    for atom in sorted_atoms:\n        print(f\"  - {atom_counts[atom]} atom(s) of {atom}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of primitive Gaussians is calculated as follows:\")\n    # Print the equation with atom symbols, e.g., Total = (1 * C) + (2 * H) + (1 * O)\n    print(f\"  Total = {' + '.join(calculation_parts)}\")\n    # Print the equation with primitive counts, e.g., Total = (1 * 32) + (2 * 8) + (1 * 32)\n    print(f\"        = {' + '.join(equation_parts)}\")\n    # Print the equation with intermediate results, e.g., Total = 32 + 16 + 32\n    if len(value_parts) > 1:\n        print(f\"        = {' + '.join(value_parts)}\")\n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"        = {total_primitives}\")\n    \n    return total_primitives\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # We will use formaldehyde (CH2O) as our example molecule.\n    formula_to_calculate = \"CH2O\"\n    final_answer = calculate_primitive_gaussians(formula_to_calculate)\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
