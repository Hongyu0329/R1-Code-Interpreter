def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the stated problem about a topological group.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
    of an open subset of a specific type of Hausdorff topological group G
    with cardinality c (the continuum).

    The analysis shows that the properties of the group do not force it to be
    locally connected, which would have made the answer 0. Through advanced
    constructions in topological group theory, it is possible to create a group
    satisfying the given conditions that has an open subset with c non-open
    components. Since the number of components cannot exceed the cardinality of
    the group itself, c is the maximum possible number.

    # The largest possible number is the cardinality of the continuum.
    # We represent this number with the symbol 'c'.
    answer = 'c'
