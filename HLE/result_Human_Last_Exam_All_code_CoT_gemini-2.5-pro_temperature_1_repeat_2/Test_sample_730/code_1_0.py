# --- Introduction and Plan ---
print("Yes, we can instruct the parrot. Here is the calculation using the smallest possible integers.")
print("The formula is: Mass = Density * (4/3) * PI * r^3")
print("We will approximate the given values (Density=0.9, Radius=0.5) with simpler numbers.")

# --- Approximations ---
print("\nApproximations for the parrot:")
print("- Density (0.9) is approximated as 1.")
print("- The formula constant 4/3 is used directly.")
print("- PI is approximated as 3.")
print("- Radius (0.5) is used as the fraction 1/2.")

# --- The Parrot's Calculation ---
print("\nThe final calculation for the parrot is:")
print("Mass_estimated = 1 * (4/3) * 3 * (1/2)^3")

print("\nStep-by-step evaluation:")
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.
# The equation is 1 * 4/3 * 3 * (1/8) = 1/2
print("1 * 4 / 3 * 3 * 1 / 8 = 12 / 24 = 1/2")

# --- Verification (for user's reference) ---
actual_mass = 0.9 * (4/3) * math.pi * (0.5**3)
estimated_mass = 0.5
error_percentage = abs(estimated_mass - actual_mass) / actual_mass * 100
print(f"\nThe actual mass is ~{actual_mass:.4f} kg. The estimated mass is {estimated_mass} kg.")
print(f"The error is ~{error_percentage:.1f}%, which is less than the 10% requirement.")

# --- Final Answer ---
# The integers used in the expression 1 * (4/3) * 3 * (1/2)^3 are 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2.
# The set of unique integers is {1, 2, 3, 4}.
