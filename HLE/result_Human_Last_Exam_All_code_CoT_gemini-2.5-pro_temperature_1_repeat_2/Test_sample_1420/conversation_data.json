    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Epsilon (ϵ) Parameter:** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method used in renormalization group theory. It expands physical quantities in powers of ϵ = d_c - d, where d is the spatial dimension and d_c is the upper critical dimension. For the universality class of systems like the Ising or n-vector models, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. Given d = 3, we have ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\n2.  **State the Formula for α:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α in the n-vector model is given by the formula:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    Here, 'n' represents the number of components of the order parameter.\n\n3.  **Select the Model (Value of n):** The problem does not specify the model. We will assume the most common and fundamental case, the **Ising model**, which describes systems with a scalar order parameter (e.g., magnetism with up/down spins). For the Ising model, n = 1.\n\n4.  **Calculate α:** We will now substitute the values d=3, d_c=4, ϵ=1, and n=1 into the formula to calculate α. The following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # Spatial dimension\n    d = 3\n    # Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\n    d_c = 4\n    # Number of components of the order parameter.\n    # We assume the Ising model universality class, where n=1.\n    n = 1\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # 1.
