    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a music theory question that can be answered by analyzing the chord progressions of The Beatles' songs.\n\nHere is my plan to identify the song:\n1.  First, I need to understand the user's query. The user is asking for a song that begins with a specific chord movement: from the tonic chord (the \"home\" chord of the key, represented as 'I' in major or 'i' in minor) to the minor fifth chord (a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale, represented as 'v'). This 'i -> v' progression is common in minor keys.\n2.  I will search my knowledge base of The Beatles' discography for songs that start with this particular harmonic movement.\n3.  The song \"And I Love Her\" from the album \"A Hard Day's Night\" is a perfect match. The song's iconic opening guitar riff is played over a C# minor chord, which then moves to a G# minor chord.\n4.  In the key of C# minor, the tonic chord (i) is C# minor, and the minor fifth chord (v) is G# minor.\n5.  I will create a Python script that states this finding and explains the musical theory behind it.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song that matches\n    the user's music theory query.\n    \"\"\"\n    band = \"The Beatles\"\n    song_title = \"And I Love Her\"\n    description = \"a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\"\n\n    # Musical Analysis details\n    key = \"C# minor\"\n    tonic_chord_symbol = \"i\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"C# minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_symbol = \"v\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"G# minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by {band} that starts with {description} is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Musical Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The song's famous opening guitar riff establishes the key of {key}.\")\n    print(\"The two chords that make up this iconic intro are:\")\n\n    # Using the prompt's instruction to output each part of the \"equation\" or progression\n    print(f\"Chord 1 (The Tonic): The '{tonic_chord_symbol}' chord, which is {tonic_chord_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Chord 2 (The Minor Fifth): The '{minor_fifth_chord_symbol}' chord, which is {minor_fifth_chord_name}.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis progression from {tonic_chord_symbol} to {minor_fifth_chord_symbol} ({tonic_chord_name} -> {minor_fifth_chord_name}) perfectly fits the description.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<And I Love Her>>>"
