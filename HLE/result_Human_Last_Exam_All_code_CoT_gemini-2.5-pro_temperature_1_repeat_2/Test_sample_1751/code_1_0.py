    print(f" - {lipid_1}: Contains two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains (a d18:0 sphingoid base and a 16:0 fatty acid). Saturated chains are linear and flexible.")
    print(f" - {lipid_2}: Contains one unsaturated chain (a d18:1 sphingoid base with a trans double bond) and one saturated chain (16:0 fatty acid).\n")

    print("Step 2: Relate structure to molecular packing.")
    print(" - Saturated chains can align parallel to each other, allowing for very tight and ordered packing. This maximizes the attractive van der Waals forces between chains.")
    print(" - The trans double bond in C16-ceramide introduces a rigid kink into the sphingoid chain. This disruption prevents the molecules from packing as closely together as the fully saturated C16-dihydroceramide molecules.\n")

    print("Step 3: Connect packing to surface area.")
    print(" - The surface area of a compressed monolayer is determined by the cross-sectional area of each molecule.")
    print(" - Tighter, more ordered packing leads to a smaller cross-sectional area per molecule.")
    print(f" - Therefore, because {lipid_1} can pack more tightly, it will occupy a smaller area.\n")
