def solve_quaternion_rope_properties():
    """
    This function determines the true statements about the proposed Quaternion RoPE scheme.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. The inner product depends on the relative position `m-n`, not its absolute value.
    B: False. The equality does not hold as R_m R_n = R_{m+n} but R_{m+p} R_{n+p} = R_{m+n+2p}.
    C: True. A fixed rotation axis is required to maintain the algebraic structure like R_m R_n = R_{m+n}.
    D: False. The rotation has only one degree of freedom (m), insufficient for encoding 3D positions.
    E: True. R_m is a unit quaternion, and multiplication by it is an isometry that preserves the norm (magnitude).
    F: True. Scalar multiplication is commutative with quaternion multiplication.
    G: True. As an isometry, the rotation preserves the inner product, and thus orthogonality.
    H: True. Composition of rotations about the same axis is additive in their angles, so R_m R_n = R_{m+n}.
    J: True. R_m and R_n commute, so their commutator is zero. The zero quaternion is purely imaginary.
    K: False. The real component of the rotated vector is generally not preserved.
    L: True. The trace of the 4x4 left-multiplication matrix of a quaternion q=a+... is 4a. For R_m, a=cos(mÎ¸).
    M: False. The commutator is zero for any fixed axis u, not just a specific one.
    N: False. The magnitude is always 1 for a unit vector, so the limit is 1.

    The set of correct statements is {C, E, F, G, H, J, L}.
