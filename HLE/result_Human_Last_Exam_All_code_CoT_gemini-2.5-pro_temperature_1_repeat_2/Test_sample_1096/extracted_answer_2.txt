The best choice of the pair $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is given by the two roots of the quadratic equation $z^2 - \frac{8(M+1)}{M^2+6M+1}z + \frac{8}{M^2+6M+1} = 0$. Explicitly, the formulas are:
$\gamma_1 = \frac{4(M+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(M-1)}{M^2+6M+1}$
$\gamma_2 = \frac{4(M+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(M-1)}{M^2+6M+1}$
where $M$ is the condition number $\kappa$.
