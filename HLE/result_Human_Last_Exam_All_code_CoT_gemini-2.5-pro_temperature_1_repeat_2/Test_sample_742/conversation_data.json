    "This is a fascinating question that bridges formal logic, metaphysics, and theoretical physics. The short answer is no, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is not suited for proving Gödel's ontological argument. The two systems operate in entirely different domains with different objects, axioms, and purposes.\n\nHere is my plan to demonstrate this:\n1.  **Explain the disconnect:** I will first clarify why these two mathematical frameworks are incompatible. Gödel's proof is a system of modal logic concerned with properties and necessity, while the math of quantum mechanics (primarily linear algebra in Hilbert spaces) is a system for modeling the probabilistic behavior of physical systems.\n2.  **Illustrate with Code:** I will write a single Python script to highlight this difference.\n    *   **Part 1 (Quantum Mechanics):** The script will perform a fundamental calculation from quantum mechanics—finding the expectation value of an observable for a given quantum state. This demonstrates that QM math is about calculating probabilities and measurable quantities.\n    *   **Part 2 (Gödel's Proof):** The script will then outline the basic structure of Gödel's ontological proof, representing its axioms and conclusion as text. This shows it's a sequence of logical deductions, not numerical calculations about the physical world.\n3.  **The Conclusion:** The code's output will starkly contrast a numerical, probabilistic result from physics with a set of abstract logical propositions, making it clear that one cannot be used to derive the other. The final \"equation\" I will output will be the symbolic conclusion of Gödel's proof.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_frameworks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the fundamental differences between the mathematical\n    framework of Quantum Mechanics and the logical framework of Gödel's ontological proof.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Part 1: A Calculation in Quantum Mechanics ---\")\n    print(\"The math of QM describes the physical world.
