    "The problem asks for the value of `a(4)`, where `a(n)` is the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function with `n` variables.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The function `a(n)` represents a well-known sequence in combinatorial mathematics related to Boolean algebra.\n2.  **Identify the Sequence:** This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000375.\n3.  **Formulate a Solution:** Calculating `a(n)` from first principles or a general formula is computationally complex. The most straightforward and reliable method for a small `n` like 4 is to use the known values from this established sequence.\n4.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the first few known values of the sequence `a(n)` in a dictionary.\n    *   Specifies the input variable `n=4`.\n    *   Looks up `a(4)` in the dictionary.\n    *   Prints the result in a clear statement that shows the relationship between the input (`n=4`) and the output, effectively showing the \"equation\" `a(4) = result`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the value of `a(4)`.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_prime_implicants():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds a(4), which is the maximal number of prime implicants\n    of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n    The sequence a(n) is known as OEIS A000375. Since there is no simple\n    closed-form formula to calculate it, we use the known values from the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # a(n) = Maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.\n    # The sequence starts at n=0.\n    # Source: The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), A000375.\n    a_sequence = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 2,\n        2: 6,\n        3: 20,\n        4: 78,\n        5: 352,\n        6: 1792\n    }\n\n    n = 4\n\n    if n in a_sequence:\n        result = a_sequence[n]\n        # We present the result in the form of an equation as requested.\n        print(f\"The function a(n) gives the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables.\")\n        print(f\"For the input n = {n}:\")\n        print(f\"The final equation is a({n}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not available in the pre-computed list.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_max_prime_implicants()\n\n```\n<<<78>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
