    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its structure to find the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core substituted at the 1, 3, and 5 positions with three identical, bulky substituents. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent arms are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments in the central core and in one of the substituent arms.\n2.  **Count Peaks from the Central Core:** Identify the unique proton environments on the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n3.  **Count Peaks from One Substituent Arm:** The arm is `-[CH2]-[camphopyrazole]`. Because this arm is chiral, we must consider that some protons may be diastereotopic (chemically non-equivalent) even if they appear structurally similar. We will count the unique proton signals from the `-CH2-` linker and the camphopyrazole moiety separately.\n4.  **Sum the Peaks:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the peaks from the core and one arm.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the detailed calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule.\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the molecular structure to determine the number of 1H NMR peaks.\")\n    print(\"The molecule has a C3 axis of symmetry, making the three large substituent arms chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"We will count the unique proton environments on the central core and on a single substituent arm.\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
