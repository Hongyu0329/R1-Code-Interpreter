    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ and order $d$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\chi_i$, where $N = p_1^{k_1} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, and each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{k_i}$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive. This means the conductor of $\\chi$ is $C(\\chi) = \\prod C(\\chi_i)$, and for $C(\\chi)$ to be $N$, we must have $C(\\chi_i) = p_i^{k_i}$ for all $i$.\n\n2.  **Order of a Character**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n3.  **Counting Strategy**: We need to count the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r)) = d$. We can solve this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let $n(k)$ be the number of characters where the order divides $k$. The number of characters with order exactly $d$ is given by the formula based on Mobius inversion over the lattice of divisors of $d$. If $d=p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_m^{a_m}$, the number is:\n    $\\sum_{S \\subseteq \\{p_1, \\dots, p_m\\}} (-1)^{|S|} n(d / \\prod_{p \\in S} p)$.\n    For our problem, $d=6$, whose prime factors are 2 and 3. The formula is:\n    Number = $n(6) - n(6/2) - n(6/3) + n(6/(2 \\cdot 3)) = n(6) - n(3) - n(2) + n(1)$.\n    Here, $n(k)$ is the total count of primitive characters of conductor $N$ whose order divides $k$. This is calculated by multiplying the counts for each prime power factor of $N$:\n    $n(k) = \\prod_{p^a || N} (\\text{number of primitive chars mod } p^a \\text{ with order dividing } k)$.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python code below will implement this strategy.\n    *   It starts by factoring the conductor $N=36036$.\n    *   It defines helper functions to compute Euler's totient function `phi` and to determine the number of primitive characters for a given prime power conductor $p^a$ with orders that divide a given integer $k$.\n    *   It calculates $n(6), n(3), n(2), n(1)$ by finding the number of choices for each factor of $N$ and multiplying them.\n    *   Finally, it applies the inclusion-exclusion formula to get the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while (temp_n % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors[temp_n] = factors.get(temp_n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a set of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return divs\n\n_phi_cache = {}\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n in _phi_cache:\n        return _phi_cache[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    _phi_cache[n] = result\n    return result\n\n_prim_orders_cache = {}\ndef get_primitive_orders(p, k):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary {order: count} for primitive characters of conductor p^k.\"\"\"\n    if (p, k) in _prim_orders_cache:\n        return _prim_orders_cache[(p, k)]\n\n    orders = {}\n    if p == 2:\n        if k == 2:  # Conductor 4\n            orders = {2: 1}\n        elif k == 3:  # Conductor 8\n            orders = {2: 2}\n        elif k >= 4: # Conductor 2^k\n             orders = {2: 1, 2**(k-2): 1}\n    else:  # p is an odd prime\n        if k == 1:\n            group_order = p - 1\n            for o in get_divisors(group_order):\n                if o > 1:\n                    orders[o] = phi(o)\n        else:\n            group_order = phi(p**k)\n            subgroup_order = phi(p**(k-1))\n            divs_group = get_divisors(group_order)\n            divs_subgroup = get_divisors(subgroup_order)\n            for o in divs_group:\n                if o not in divs_subgroup:\n                    orders[o] = phi(o)\n    \n    _prim_orders_cache[(p, k)] = orders\n    return orders\n\ndef count_prim_chars_order_divides_k(p, k, d):\n    \"\"\"Counts primitive characters of conductor p^k whose order divides d.\"\"\"\n    prim_orders = get_primitive_orders(p, k)\n    count = 0\n    for order, num in prim_orders.items():\n        if d % order == 0:\n            count += num\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"Main function to solve the problem.\"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    d = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order d = {d}.\")\n    \n    N_factors = prime_factors(N)\n    N_factors_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{k}\" for p, k in N_factors.items()])\n    print(f\"\\nStep 1: The prime factorization of N is {N_factors_str}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: We use inclusion-exclusion.
