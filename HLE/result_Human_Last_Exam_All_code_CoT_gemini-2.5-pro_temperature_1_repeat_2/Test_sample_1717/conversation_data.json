    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Health Formula:** First, I will find the formula Terraria uses to calculate boss health in Expert Mode, specifically how it scales with the number of players.\n2.  **Analyze the Formula for Infinite Players:** I'll apply the condition of having an \"infinite\" number of players to this formula. A simple linear formula would suggest infinite health.\n3.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** The key to finding a concrete \"theoretical maximum\" lies in the technical limitations of the game's engine. Terraria, being a C# application, stores numerical values in specific data types. The health value is stored in a 32-bit signed integer (`System.Int32`).\n4.  **Determine the Data Type Limit:** A 32-bit signed integer has a fixed maximum value. Any calculation that exceeds this value will result in an overflow, effectively capping the health. This maximum value is the true *theoretical* limit within the game's code.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the constants from the health formula and the maximum integer value. The script will then print out an explanation of the logic and provide the final maximum health value, ensuring all numbers from the formula are displayed as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the constants from the Terraria health scaling formula.\n    base_health = 3640  # Base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    per_player_increase = 0.35  # Health increases by 35% for each additional player.\n\n    # Step 2: Define the technical limitation from the game's source code.\n    # In Terraria (C#), NPC health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (System.Int32).\n    # This data type has a maximum possible value.\n    max_health_limit = 2**31 - 1  # This is 2,147,483,647.\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the logic.\n    # The formula for health is: Total Health = base_health * (1 + per_player_increase * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    # As the number of players approaches infinity, the result of this formula also approaches infinity.\n    # However, the health value is capped by the maximum value of the integer data type used to store it.\n\n    print(\"Terraria Boss Health Calculation Analysis\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The health scaling formula for a boss in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(\"Final Health = Base Health * (1 + Player Increase * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nBreaking down the formula for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    # The final prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Final Health = {base_health} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nWith an infinite number of players, the result of this formula would mathematically be infinite.\")\n    print(\"However, the game's code stores health in a 32-bit signed integer, which has a hard technical limit.\")\n    print(\"This limit is the highest number the variable can hold before it overflows.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTheoretical Maximum Health:\")\n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The theoretical maximum health is capped by the 32-bit integer limit, which is {max_health_limit}.\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
