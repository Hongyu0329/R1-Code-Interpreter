def solve_poem_swap():
    """
    This function identifies the two swapped lines in the poem based on literary analysis.

    The analysis reveals the poem is a double sestina, which uses a specific, rotating pattern of six end-words:
    A=mountains, B=valleys, C=forests, D=music, E=morning, F=evening.
    The end-word pattern throughout the poem is perfectly preserved, which means the two swapped lines must share the same end-word.

    The secondary structure of the poem involves parallel rhetorical devices in paired stanzas.
    For example, stanzas 7 and 8 both use "Meseems..." multiple times.
    Stanzas 5 and 6 use the phrase "Long since...".

    In Klaius's stanza (Stanza 6), lines 35 and 36 form a clear, logical pair:
    35: "Long since my thoughts chase me like beasts in forests,"
    36: "And make me wish myself laid under mountains."
    The thought of being chased by beasts (35) directly causes the wish to hide under mountains (36).

    In Strephon's stanza (Stanza 5), line 28 is a standalone thought:
    28: "Long since my thoughts more desert be than forests;"

    Both line 28 and line 35 end with the word "forests," so they could have been swapped without breaking the sestina's end-word pattern.

    However, the current arrangement places the standalone thought (line 28) in Strephon's stanza and the "chasing beasts" thought (line 35) in Klaius's stanza. If they were swapped, the logical link between line 35 and line 36 would be broken by placing line 28 between them. The weak connection between "my thoughts more desert be" (28) and "And make me wish myself laid under mountains" (36) reveals that the original pairing was likely 35 and 36.

    Therefore, the two lines that have been swapped are 28 and 35.
