    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Conformation**: The specific stereoisomer (1S,2R) corresponds to cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. We must analyze its chair conformations to see which one will react.\n    *   **Conformation A**: Bromo group is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    *   **Conformation B**: Bromo group is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    Because the methyl group is bulkier than the bromo group, Conformation A with the equatorial methyl group is much more stable and is the predominant conformation from which the reaction will occur.\n\n3.  **Apply E2 Reaction Rule**: The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) to be in an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) orientation. In the stable Conformation A, the bromo group is already in the required axial position.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**: We look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: There is an axial hydrogen that is anti-periplanar to the axial bromo group. Removing this hydrogen would form **1-methylcyclohexene** (the more substituted Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6**: There is an axial hydrogen that is also anti-periplanar to the axial bromo group. Removing this hydrogen would form **3-methylcyclohexene** (the less substituted Hofmann product).\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product**: The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann product depends on the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it preferentially attacks the less sterically hindered beta-hydrogen. The hydrogen on C6 is part of a -CHâ‚‚- group and is much more accessible than the hydrogen on C2, which is on a carbon bearing a methyl group. Therefore, the bulky base will predominantly remove the proton from C6.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**: The reaction favors the Hofmann elimination pathway, making 3-methylcyclohexene the major product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n    # The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a cis isomer.\n    # The most stable chair conformation has an axial Br and an equatorial CH3.\n    # The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of H and Br.\n    # There are two possible beta-hydrogens that are axial: one at C2 and one at C6.\n    # Elimination at C2 gives the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    # Elimination at C6 gives the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).\n    # The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, is a bulky base.\n    # Bulky bases favor the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product)\n    # by abstracting the less sterically hindered proton.\n    # The proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2.\n    # Therefore, the major product is the Hofmann product.\n    \n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    # Printing the name of the final product, including the number as requested.\n    number = 3\n    name = \"methylcyclohexene\"\n    \n    print(f\"The major product of the reaction is: {number}-{name}\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
