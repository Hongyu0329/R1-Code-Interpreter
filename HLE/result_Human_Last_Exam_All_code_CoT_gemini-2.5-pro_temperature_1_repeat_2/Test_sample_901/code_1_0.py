    # The reaction is an E2 elimination.
    # The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a cis isomer.
    # The most stable chair conformation has an axial Br and an equatorial CH3.
    # The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of H and Br.
    # There are two possible beta-hydrogens that are axial: one at C2 and one at C6.
    # Elimination at C2 gives the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).
    # Elimination at C6 gives the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).
    # The reagent, potassium tert-butoxide, is a bulky base.
    # Bulky bases favor the formation of the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product)
    # by abstracting the less sterically hindered proton.
    # The proton at C6 is less hindered than the proton at C2.
    # Therefore, the major product is the Hofmann product.
