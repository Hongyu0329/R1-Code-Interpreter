# Define the constants provided in the problem
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1

# As derived in the reasoning, the solution for X_0(t) is a constant value
# determined by the equation X_0(t) = A / (B + 1).
# The question asks for this value at t = 10^20.

# Calculate the components of the final equation
# The term p represents (B + 1)
p = B + 1
result = A / p

# Print the components of the equation and the final result
# The final equation is X_0(10^20) = A / (B+1)
print(f"The final equation is: X_0(10^20) = A / (B + 1)")
print(f"The value of A is: {float(A)}")
print(f"The value of (B + 1) is: {float(p)}")
print(f"Therefore, X_0(10^20) = {float(A)} / {float(p)}")
print(f"The final result is: {float(result)}")
