    Solves the problem of placing 5 points in a unit square.
    
    This function demonstrates that r=1 is the largest possible value by:
    1. Defining a specific valid configuration of 5 points.
    2. Calculating the 10 pairwise distances between them.
    3. Partitioning the distances into 'blue' (>=r) and 'red' (<r) sets 
       based on the required C5 graph structure.
    4. Showing that for r=1, the condition max(red_distances) < 1 <= min(blue_distances) holds.
