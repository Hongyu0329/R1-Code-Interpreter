    "Of course, I can help with that. First, I will address the coding portion of your request, and then I will answer your question about Curt Querner's self-portrait.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Since a specific coding problem was not provided, I will create a simple Python script as a placeholder. This script will follow all the specified formatting rules, including printing an equation. It will calculate the year mentioned in your question (1933) to make it relevant.\n2.  I will then research the 1933 self-portrait by German painter Curt Querner, focusing on the context of his escape from the Gestapo.\n3.  I will identify the object he is holding in the painting and its symbolic meaning in the context of resistance.\n4.  Finally, I will provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\n# The user did not provide a specific coding task.\n# This is a placeholder example demonstrating the requested format.\n# The code calculates the year of the painting mentioned in the user's question.\n\na = 1900\nb = 33\nresult = a + b\n\n# As requested, printing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The year of the painting is {result}, calculated as: {a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<a poppy seed pod>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In 1933, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait after having escaped from Gestapo.
