# The reasoning explained above leads to the conclusion that no more efficient
# box can be designed under the given constraints.
# The initial 12x12x12 box is already optimal for packing 27 spheres
# when their centers must lie on a 0.5 cm grid.
# Any attempt to use a theoretically denser packing method for a small, finite
# number of spheres like 27 results in a less compact cluster shape (e.g., flatter),
# which paradoxically requires a container with a larger surface area.
# Therefore, the answer is 0.
