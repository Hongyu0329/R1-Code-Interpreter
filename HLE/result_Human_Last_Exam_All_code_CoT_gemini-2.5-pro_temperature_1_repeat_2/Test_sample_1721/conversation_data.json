    "This problem asks for the largest density `c` of a set `A` of integers from `{1, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares. This is a known difficult problem in additive number theory, and the exact value of `c` is still an open question. However, we can establish lower bounds for `c` by constructing such sets `A`.\n\nThe most common method is to use modular arithmetic. We can construct `A` by selecting all numbers up to `N` that belong to a specific set of residue classes modulo some integer `m`. Let `R` be a subset of `{0, 1, ..., m-1}`. We define `A = {n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\pmod m \\in R}`. For the sumset `A+A` to not contain any squares, the set of sums of residues, `R+R = {r1 + r2 \\pmod m | r1, r2 \\in R}`, must not contain any quadratic residues modulo `m`. The density of such a set `A` is `c = |R|/m`.\n\nFor a long time, the best-known result was `c >= 1/3`, achieved with `m=3` and `R={1}`. However, in 2019, Chen and Fang found a better construction using `m=32`, which gives `c >= 3/8`. This is currently the densest known construction.\n\nThe following Python code verifies the validity of this modern construction. It defines the set of \"allowed\" residues `R` modulo 32, computes the set of quadratic residues `Q_32`, and then confirms that the sumset `R+R` does not intersect with `Q_32`. Finally, it calculates the resulting density `c`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. The problem of finding the largest c is an open research problem. We will demonstrate\n#    the construction that gives the best known lower bound, c >= 3/8.\n# 2. The method involves constructing the set A using modular arithmetic with a modulus m=32.\n# 3. A is defined as the set of numbers n such that (n mod 32) is in a special set of residues R.\n# 4. The condition that A+A contains no squares requires that the sumset R+R (mod 32)\n#    contains no quadratic residues mod 32.\n# 5.
