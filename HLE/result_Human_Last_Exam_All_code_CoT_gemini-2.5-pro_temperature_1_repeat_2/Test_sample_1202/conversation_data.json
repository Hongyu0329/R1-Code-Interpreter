    "Of the choices provided, both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. To determine which is \"most likely,\" we need to consider the underlying processes.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate incorrect options:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences, which tends to homogenize the genes (make them identical). This works directly against divergence.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process by which a duplicate gene loses its function and becomes a \"pseudogene.\" While this is the most common fate for a duplicate gene, it is a mechanism of *loss*, not functional *retention*.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern describing the rapid diversification of species, not a specific molecular mechanism acting on genes.\n\n2.  **Compare plausible options:**\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new, beneficial function. This certainly explains retention and divergence, but it relies on the occurrence of a rare beneficial mutation before the redundant copy is lost to pseudogenization.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model), the ancestral gene had multiple functions (pleiotropy). After duplication, each copy sustains loss-of-function mutations in different subfunctions. As a result, both gene copies become essential to carry out the full set of original functions.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The mutations required for subfunctionalization (degenerative, loss-of-function mutations) are far more common than those required for neofunctionalization (rare, gain-of-function mutations). The subfunctionalization model provides a passive route for preserving both gene copies because they become mutually necessary for the original, complete function. This protects both copies from being lost. Because this mechanism relies on more frequent mutational events, it is often considered the most likely initial mechanism responsible for the retention of duplicate genes, allowing them to diverge.\n\nSince there is no calculation or data processing involved, a script is not necessary to arrive at the answer. The solution is based on established concepts in evolutionary genetics.\n\n<<<D>>>"
