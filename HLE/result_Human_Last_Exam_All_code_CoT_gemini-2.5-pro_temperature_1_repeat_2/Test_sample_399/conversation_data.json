    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  The given differential equation is $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. This is a separable differential equation. I will separate the variables, putting all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n2.  Next, I will integrate both sides of the separated equation. This will give a general solution that includes a constant of integration, C.\n3.  I will use the initial condition, $x(0)=-8$, to solve for the constant C. This provides the particular solution for the given initial value problem.\n4.  Finally, with the particular solution for $x(t)$, I will substitute $t=1$ to find the value of $x(1)$.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that calculates this final value and prints the equation with the numbers substituted in, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# The initial value problem is x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\n# By separating variables and integrating, we get:\n# -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n# Using the initial condition x(0) = -8, we find C = 1/8.\n# So, the particular solution is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + 1/8.\n# Solving for x(t) gives: x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\n\n# We need to find x(1). Let's define the variable and the numbers.\nt = 1\nnumerator = -8\ncoeff_t_squared = 4\ncoeff_t = -8\nconstant = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator of the expression for x(1)\ndenominator = coeff_t_squared * (t**2) + coeff_t * t + constant\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print out the calculation steps as requested\nprint(f\"The particular solution is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\")\nprint(f\"To find x(1), we substitute t = 1 into this equation:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({coeff_t_squared} * ({t})**2 - {abs(coeff_t)} * ({t}) + {constant})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({coeff_t_squared * t**2} - {abs(coeff_t) * t} + {constant})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"The final value is:\")\nprint(result)\n```\n<<<2.6666666666666665>>>"
