    # The problem asks for the value of n, where F is an n-resolvable functor.
    # "n-resolvable" refers to the projective dimension of F.
    # The key is to combine the properties of F being "tame" and "discretized by f".

    # Step 1: The condition that F is "discretized" by an exact functor f^k
    # from Fun(I, Vect_K) (where I is a finite poset) implies that F has a finite homological dimension.
    # Fun(I, Vect_K) has finite global dimension. Let F be in the image of f^k.

    # Step 2: The functor f^k is likely a right Kan extension (f_*), as this choice
    # leads to a unique solution. A right Kan extension f_* preserves injective objects.
    # This implies that F must have a finite injective dimension.

    # Step 3: The condition that F is a "tame functor" means it is an indecomposable
    # representation in a tame category.

    # Step 4: An indecomposable representation in a tame category that has finite injective dimension
    # must be a preinjective module.

    # Step 5: The question asks for n, which is the projective dimension of F.
    # For a preinjective module in a tame (but not finite-type) category, the projective dimension is infinite.
    # This aligns with the hint that n can be "possibly infinite".
