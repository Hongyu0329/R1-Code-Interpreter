# Given parameters
# c: consistency level of the decentralized identifier resolution
c = 0.95
# b: branching factor of semantic version control
b = 3

# --- Step-by-step model based on FAIR principles ---

# 1. Findability (f) is capped by the identifier consistency.
# With a consistency of c, we can find the correct data at most c of the time.
f = c

# 2. Accessibility (a) is assumed to be perfect (1.0) under the "best implementation" assumption.
a = 1.0

# 3. Interoperability (i) is inversely affected by the branching factor b.
# A higher branching factor introduces ambiguity, reducing interoperability.
# A simple model is i = 1/b.
i = 1 / b

# 4. Reusability (r) is fundamentally limited by interoperability.
# If data is not interoperable due to versioning chaos, it cannot be reliably reused.
# So, the maximum reusability is capped by the interoperability score.
r = i

# 5. The total FAIR compliance score R is the average of the four components.
R = (f + a + i + r) / 4

# --- Output the results ---
