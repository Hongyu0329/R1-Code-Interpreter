def solve_mimicry_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes a list of biological triplets and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the following reasoning:
    - A triplet is correct if the mode of mimicry/signaling directly relates to both species and their specified traits.
    - After evaluating all eight options, three are found to be correct.

    The correct triplets are:

    3) Batesian, Eristalini - color, Melipotini - color
       - Rationale: Batesian mimicry involves a harmless species mimicking a harmful one. Both Eristalini (hoverflies)
         and Melipotini (a moth tribe) are taxa known to contain species that exhibit Batesian mimicry using color
         patterns. Thus, all elements are thematically related.

    5) Müllerian, Heliconiini - color, Melipotini - color
       - Rationale: Müllerian mimicry is a phenomenon where two or more well-defended species share a similar
         warning signal. Heliconiini butterflies are famous for this. Unpalatable moths (like some Melipotini)
         are also known to participate in these mimicry rings, sharing warning coloration. This is a direct relationship.

    8) Aposematism, Danaus plexipus - wing, Cycnia tenera - tymbal
       - Rationale: Aposematism is the use of warning signals to deter predators. Both listed species are textbook
         examples. Danaus plexippus (Monarch butterfly) uses its bright wing colors as a visual aposematic signal.
         Cycnia tenera (a tiger moth) uses ultrasonic clicks produced by its tymbal organ as an acoustic
         aposematic signal. Both are directly related to the principle of aposematism.

    The other triplets are incorrect because they contain unrelated elements (e.g., a fake mimicry mode,
    unrelated species for a specific mode, or mischaracterization of a species' strategy).

    The "final equation" requested is the list of the numbers of these correct triplets.
