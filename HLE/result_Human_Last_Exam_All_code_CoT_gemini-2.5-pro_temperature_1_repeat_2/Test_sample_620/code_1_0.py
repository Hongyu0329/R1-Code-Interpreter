    A non-linear plot means the reaction rate is changing. The two most unusual pieces of information are the chilling step and the enzyme's dimeric nature. Low temperatures, like on ice, can cause some multi-subunit (oligomeric) enzymes to fall apart or 'dissociate' into their inactive subunits. This is a known biochemical phenomenon.
    
    Therefore, it's highly probable that chilling the 'obligate dimer' enzyme on ice is causing it to break apart into inactive single units (monomers). When the reaction is started, there would be a lag period as these monomers slowly re-form the active dimer, resulting in a non-linear curve. This is a more subtle or 'not immediately obvious' reason than other common issues.
