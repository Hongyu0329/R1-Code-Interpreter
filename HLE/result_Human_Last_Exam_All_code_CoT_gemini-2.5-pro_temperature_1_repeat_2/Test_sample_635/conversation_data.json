    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: First, I will express the transfer function $H(s)$ in the form of a fraction with a polynomial matrix numerator and a scalar polynomial denominator. This is done by finding the least common multiple of the denominators of the elements in $H(s)$. This will give an initial, but not necessarily coprime, factorization $H(s) = D_1(s)^{-1} N_1(s)$.\n2.  **Coprimeness Check**: I will check if the polynomial matrices $D_1(s)$ and $N_1(s)$ are left coprime. Two matrices are left coprime if the concatenated matrix $[D_1(s) \\quad N_1(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n3.  **Extraction of Common Factors**: If the initial factorization is not coprime, it means there is a common polynomial matrix factor $G(s)$ on the left, such that $D_1(s) = G(s)D(s)$ and $N_1(s) = G(s)N(s)$. I will find this greatest common left divisor (GCLD) and cancel it.\n4.  **Final Factorization**: The resulting matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, will form a left coprime factorization $H(s) = D(s)^{-1} N(s)$.\n5.  **Code Presentation**: Finally, I will present the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ using a Python script that utilizes the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\nHere is the Python code that defines and prints the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays a left coprime factorization for the given\n    transfer function H(s).\n\n    H(s) = [[(s-1)/(s+1), 1], [2/(s**2-1), 0]]\n    We want to find D(s) and N(s) such that H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    and D(s), N(s) are left coprime.\n\n    Step 1: Find a common denominator factorization.\n    The least common denominator is s^2 - 1.\n    H(s) = (1/(s^2-1)) * [[(s-1)^2, s^2-1], [2, 0]]\n    This gives an initial (non-coprime) factorization:\n    D1(s) = [[s^2-1, 0], [0, s^2-1]]\n    N1(s) = [[s^2-2*s+1, s^2-1], [2, 0]]\n\n    Step 2: Find and cancel the Greatest Common Left Divisor (GCLD).\n    Through analysis (e.g., using row reduction on [D1(s) N1(s)]), the GCLD G(s)\n    can be found. The final coprime matrices are D(s) and N(s) where\n    D1(s) = G(s)D(s) and N1(s) = G(s)N(s).\n\n    The calculated coprime matrices are:\n    D(s) = [[1, s-1], [0, s^2-1]]\n    N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # The resulting left coprime polynomial matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N_s = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_s)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N_s)\n\n    # Optional: Verification step\n    # H_calc = sympy.simplify(D_s.inv() * N_s)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: D(s)^-1 * N(s) simplifies to:\")\n    # sympy.pprint(H_calc)\n    # H_original = sympy.Matrix([[(s-1)/(s+1), 1], [2/(s**2-1), 0]])\n    # print(\"\\nWhich matches the original H(s):\")\n    # sympy.pprint(H_original)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_factorization()\n\n```\n<<<D(s) = $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$, N(s) = $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$>>>"
