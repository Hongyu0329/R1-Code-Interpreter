# The riddle asks to arrange five numbers in the correct order based on a series of clues.
# My analysis leads to the sequence 1, 2, 4, 3, 0.
# Here is the breakdown:
# 1. The numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
#    - "Number 1, 2, 3, 4" are mentioned directly.
#    - "the fifth, who never had a thing" points to 0.
# 2. The positions are determined as follows:
#    - "Number 1 is the first": 1 is in the first position.
#    - "the fifth ... lastly follows": 0 is in the last position.
#    - "Number three ... protects the last": 3 is in the fourth position.
#    - "Number 4 ... always goes behind [two]": 2 and 4 are together as (2, 4).
# 3. Assembling these pieces gives the order: 1, 2, 4, 3, 0.

# This script will print each number in the final sequence.
final_sequence = [1, 2, 4, 3, 0]

# The final solution is the sequence of these numbers.
# I will print them separated by commas as requested by the prompt's context
# to "output each number".
print("The final ordered sequence is:")
print(*final_sequence, sep=", ")
