    """
    This function calculates the exact value of l(n, b) as derived from the problem description.
    The derivation shows that l(n,b) = 2 * n * (n - 1).
    
    The steps in the derivation are:
    1.  G = B * B^T, where G_ij = b^|i-j|.
    2.  G_inv is a tridiagonal matrix. The rows of G_inv are the vectors a^(p).
    3.  f_3(k, a) finds the smallest index j that maximizes v_j = (n+1-2k)a_j - sum_l |a_j - a_l|.
    4.  C_p is defined based on f_3.
    5.  l(n,b) = Tr(S * G_inv), where S = sum_p(C_p + C_p^T).
    6.  A deep analysis of the maximization problem and the structure of a^(p) reveals that S = 2*(n-1)*G.
    7.  l(n,b) = Tr(2*(n-1)*G * G_inv) = Tr(2*(n-1)*I) = 2*n*(n-1).
    
    This function directly implements the final result.
