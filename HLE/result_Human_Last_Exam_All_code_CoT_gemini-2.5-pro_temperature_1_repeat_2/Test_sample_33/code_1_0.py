# Protein secondary structure analysis from FTIR data

# --- Step 1: Define observed FTIR peaks and their assignments ---

# Characteristic wavenumber (cm^-1) ranges for protein secondary structures
structure_assignments = {
    "Alpha-Helix": "1650-1658 cm^-1",
    "Anti-parallel Beta-Sheet": "Strong peak at 1610-1640 cm^-1 and a weak peak at 1680-1700 cm^-1",
    "Disordered / Random Coil": "Broad peak at 1640-1650 cm^-1"
}

# Observed peaks from the experiment
peak_disordered = 1645
peak_alpha_helix = 1652
peak_beta_sheet_strong = 1618
peak_beta_sheet_weak = 1680

# --- Step 2: Analyze the experimental evidence ---

print("Analyzing the behavior of tardigrade hydrogel proteins based on FTIR data.")
print("-" * 60)

print(f"Initial State: The proteins are described as initially disordered.")
print(f"Evidence: A broad peak is seen at {peak_disordered} cm^-1, which is characteristic of a disordered structure ({structure_assignments['Disordered / Random Coil']}).")
print("-" * 60)

print("Observation during Gelation (Concentration Titration):")
print(f"As protein concentration increases, there is a dual increase in the peaks at {peak_alpha_helix} cm^-1 and {peak_beta_sheet_strong} cm^-1.")
print("\nExplanation:")
print(f" -> The peak at {peak_alpha_helix} cm^-1 corresponds to the formation of Alpha-Helices ({structure_assignments['Alpha-Helix']}).")
print(f" -> The peak at {peak_beta_sheet_strong} cm^-1, along with its partner peak at {peak_beta_sheet_weak} cm^-1, corresponds to the formation of Anti-parallel Beta-Sheets ({structure_assignments['Anti-parallel Beta-Sheet']}).")
print("\nThis means that upon gelation, the initial disordered proteins are folding into BOTH alpha-helices AND beta-sheets.")
print("-" * 60)

print("Observation upon Heating:")
print(f"The beta-sheet peaks ({peak_beta_sheet_strong} and {peak_beta_sheet_weak} cm^-1) disappear, while the disordered peak ({peak_disordered} cm^-1) grows.")
print("\nExplanation:")
print("This confirms that the beta-sheets are part of the gel structure and are thermally less stable, melting back into a disordered state upon heating. This reinforces the idea that gelation involves a disorder-to-order transition.")
print("-" * 60)

# --- Step 3: Conclude the most likely explanation ---
print("Conclusion:")
print("The evidence strongly supports a process where initially disordered proteins undergo a conformational change to form a structured hydrogel.")
print(f"This structure is composed of both alpha-helical segments (indicated by the {peak_alpha_helix} cm^-1 peak) and beta-sheet segments (indicated by the {peak_beta_sheet_strong} and {peak_beta_sheet_weak} cm^-1 peaks).")
print("\nTherefore, the most accurate description is that disordered structures fold into both beta sheets and alpha helices upon gelation.")

# The final answer is I.
