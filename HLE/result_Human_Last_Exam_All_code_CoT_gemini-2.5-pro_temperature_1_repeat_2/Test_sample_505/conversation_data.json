    "In a surface code, logical qubits are encoded using the topological features of the surface on which the physical qubits are arranged. For a planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits it can store is related to the number of its boundaries, often called \"holes\".\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will use the formula for the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a planar code with `d` boundaries: `k = d - 1`.\n2.  I'll interpret the problem statement \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" to mean that each of the two patches has two internal holes.\n3.  Each planar patch also has one outer boundary. So, the total number of boundaries (`d`) for a single patch is the number of internal holes plus the one outer boundary.\n4.  I will calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch using the formula from step 1.\n5.  Since there are two separate, identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n6.  The Python code will perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of separate patches of surface code\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# The problem states each patch has two holes.\n# These are interpreted as internal boundaries.\nnum_internal_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# Each planar patch also has one outer boundary.\n# The total number of boundaries 'd' is the sum of internal and outer boundaries.\nnum_boundaries_per_patch = num_internal_holes_per_patch + 1\n\n# The number of logical qubits 'k' for a single patch is d - 1.\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = num_boundaries_per_patch - 1\n\n# The total number of logical qubits is the sum from each independent patch.\ntotal_logical_qubits = logical_qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n\nprint(f\"A single patch with {num_internal_holes_per_patch} internal holes has {num_boundaries_per_patch} total boundaries, encoding {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\nprint(f\"For {num_patches} such patches, the total number of logical qubits is:\")\nprint(f\"{logical_qubits_per_patch} + {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
