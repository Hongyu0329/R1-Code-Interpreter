    This script analyzes the provided reaction scheme and NMR data to identify the starting material.
    
    1. Product Structure Analysis:
       - The 1H and 13C NMR data suggest a final product with:
         - A benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-Ph) confirmed by the t/d coupling pattern.
         - A tert-butyl group attached to a nitrogen (tBu-N-) confirmed by the 13C shift at 59.79 ppm.
         - A heteroaromatic ring with two uncoupled protons (two singlets at 8.24 and 8.11 ppm).
    
    2. Stoichiometry and Reaction Path:
       - Counting the protons in the final product (19H) and the reactants implies the starting material (A) must have 2 protons.
       - The reaction of tert-butyl hydrazine likely involves an initial substitution followed by oxidation of the -NH-NH-tBu group to an azo group (-N=N-tBu), which accounts for the loss of 2 protons to match the final 19H count.
    
    3. Identification of Compound A:
       - We need a dihalo-heterocycle with 2 protons that would result in two uncoupled protons with similar chemical shifts in the final product.
       - 4,6-Dichloropyrimidine is ruled out because H-2 and H-5 would have very different chemical shifts.
       - 3,6-Dichloropyridazine is ruled out because H-4 and H-5 would be coupled.
       - 2,6-Dichloropyrazine is the correct choice. Its two protons (H-3 and H-5) are uncoupled and electronically similar, matching the observed NMR data perfectly.
