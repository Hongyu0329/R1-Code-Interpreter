    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of this set, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$\n\nFirst, let's establish some fundamental properties of any function $f \\in S$.\n\n1.  **$f$ is injective (one-to-one):**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. By the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing, it is injective, so we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ is injective.\n\n2.  **$f$ is strictly monotonic:**\n    The problem states that $f$ is a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$. A continuous and injective function whose domain is an interval (in this case, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the two cases for monotonicity\n\nWe consider the two possibilities for the monotonicity of $f$.\n\n**Case A: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n\nIf a function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and strictly decreasing, it must have a unique fixed point. This is because the function $h(x) = g(x) - x$ is continuous and strictly decreasing, with $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} h(x) = -\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a unique $x_0$ such that $h(x_0)=0$, which means $g(x_0)=x_0$.\n\nLet's assume our function $f$ is strictly decreasing. Then it must have a unique fixed point $x_0$, such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\nApplying $f$ again to this fixed point:\n$f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\nFrom the given equation, we have $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\nThis leads to the equation $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$.\nHowever, it is a well-known fact that the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$).\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no strictly decreasing functions satisfying the condition. The number of solutions in this case is 0.\n\n**Case B: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n\nIf $f$ is strictly increasing, let's analyze its behavior further.\n1.  For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $\\exp(x) > x$. The equation is $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, so $f(f(x)) > x$.\n    If there were an $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) \\le x_0$, then since $f$ is increasing, we would have $f(f(x_0)) \\le f(x_0) \\le x_0$. This contradicts $f(f(x)) > x$.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n2.  Let $R_f$ be the range of $f$. Since $f$ is continuous and its domain is $\\mathbb{R}$, $R_f$ is an interval. The range of the composite function $f \\circ f$ is $f(R_f)$, which must be equal to the range of $\\exp(x)$, i.e., $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n3.  Let's consider the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \\to -\\infty$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, this limit exists and is either a finite value $L$ or $-\\infty$.\n    If $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$, then since $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ (because $f(x)>x$), the range of $f$ would be $R_f = (-\\infty, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}$.\n    But then $f(R_f) = f(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$, which contradicts $f(R_f) = (0, \\infty)$.\n    So, the limit must be a finite value $L$: $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$.\n\n4.  Since $f$ is increasing and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$, the range of $f$ is $R_f = (L, \\infty)$.\n    The condition $f(R_f) = (0, \\infty)$ means $f$ maps the interval $(L, \\infty)$ to $(0, \\infty)$.\n    Because $f$ is continuous and increasing, this implies $\\lim_{x\\to L^+} f(x) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    Since $f$ is defined and continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f(L) = \\lim_{x\\to L^+} f(x) = 0$.\n\n5.  From the property $f(x)>x$, we have $f(L) > L$, which means $0 > L$. So, $L$ must be a negative number.\n\n6.  We can now use the main equation for specific points.\n    - At $x=L$: $f(f(L)) = \\exp(L)$. Since $f(L)=0$, this becomes $f(0) = \\exp(L)$.\n    - At $x=0$: $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. Since $f(0)=\\exp(L)$, this becomes $f(\\exp(L))=1$.\n    So, any increasing solution must pass through the points $(L, 0)$, $(0, \\exp(L))$, and $(\\exp(L), 1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Count the number of increasing solutions\n\nThe analysis above shows that any increasing solution is determined by the choice of $L$ and the behavior of the function on a starting interval, for instance, $[L, 0]$.\n\n1.  **Choose $L$**: We can choose any $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. The set of possible values for $L$ is the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\n2.  **Choose $f$ on an interval**: Let's define $f$ on the interval $[L, 0]$. It must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that satisfies $f(L)=0$ and $f(0)=\\exp(L)$. Such a function is a homeomorphism from $[L, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(L)]$.\n    Let $c = \\exp(L)$. Since $L<0$, we have $c \\in (0,1)$. We need to choose a continuous strictly increasing function $h: [L, 0] \\to [0, c]$.\n    The set of such functions $h$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. For any two distinct intermediate points, we can construct different functions, leading to a continuum of choices. For example, for any $y \\in (0,c)$, we can define a piecewise linear function $h$ passing through $(L,0)$, $(L/2, y)$, and $(0,c)$, and each choice of $y$ gives a different function.\n\n3.  **Uniqueness of extension**: Once $L$ is chosen and the function $h(x) = f(x)$ is defined on $[L, 0]$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by the equation $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$.\n    - For $x \\in [0, c]$, we define $f(x) = \\exp(h^{-1}(x))$.\n    - This process can be continued to define $f$ on $[L, \\infty)$.\n    - For $x < L$, we define $f(x) = h^{-1}(\\exp(x))$.\n    This construction yields a valid, continuous, strictly increasing solution for each initial choice.\n\nThe total number of strictly increasing solutions is the number of ways to choose $L$ times the number of ways to choose the function $h$.\n$|S_{\\text{increasing}}| = (\\text{choices for } L) \\times (\\text{choices for } h) = \\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe total number of solutions is the sum of the number of decreasing and increasing solutions.\n$|S| = |S_{\\text{decreasing}}| + |S_{\\text{increasing}}| = 0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of these functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the same as the cardinality of the real numbers).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions\n    f: R -> R that satisfy the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Let S be the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).\")\n    print(\"We want to find the cardinality of S, |S|.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Properties of f\")\n    print(\"1. f must be injective (one-to-one).\")\n    print(\"   Proof: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)).\")\n    print(\"   This means exp(x1) = exp(x2), which implies x1 = x2 since exp(x) is injective.\")\n    print(\"2.
