    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group is defined by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. For size 128, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$.\n\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group (e.g., $\\langle g \\rangle$ for some element $g$). The task is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in $Q_{128}$.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Counting:** I will partition the cyclic subgroups into two disjoint sets based on the structure of $Q_{128}$:\n    *   **Set 1: Subgroups within the maximal cyclic subgroup.** The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order $2n = 64$. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$ (denoted $\\tau(m)$). I will calculate $\\tau(64)$.\n    *   **Set 2: Subgroups generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$.** The other elements of the group are of the form $yx^k$. There are $2n=64$ such elements. I will determine their order and how many distinct cyclic subgroups they generate. All these elements have order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4)=2$ generators (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function). The number of distinct subgroups is the number of elements divided by the number of generators for each subgroup.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these two sets, as they are disjoint.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef number_of_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of positive divisors of an integer n (tau function).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If divisors are the same (perfect square), count one\n            if n // i == i:\n                count += 1\n            # Otherwise, count both i and n/i\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_q128_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n    \n    # For a generalized quaternion group Q_4n, the order is 4n.\n    # Q_128 implies 4n = 128, so n = 32.\n    n = group_order // 4\n    \n    # The group has a maximal cyclic subgroup <x> of order 2n.\n    order_of_x_subgroup = 2 * n\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the number of cyclic subgroups contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup <x>.\")\n    print(f\"The order of <x> is {order_of_x_subgroup}.\")\n    # The number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order m is the number of divisors of m, tau(m).\n    num_subgroups_in_x = number_of_divisors(order_of_x_subgroup)\n    print(f\"The number of divisors of {order_of_x_subgroup} is {num_subgroups_in_x}.
