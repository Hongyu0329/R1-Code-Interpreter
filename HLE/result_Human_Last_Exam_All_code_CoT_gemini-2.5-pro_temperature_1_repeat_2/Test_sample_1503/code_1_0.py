    This function demonstrates that there is not necessarily a unique t>0 
    such that a scaled function lies on the Pohozaev manifold.

    We consider a hypothetical case where the Pohozaev identity for a function (u,v)
    and its amplitude scaling (tu, tv) leads to the equation:
    s*K - N4*t^2 - N6*t^4 = 0
    where s>0, K is the kinetic energy, and N4, N6 are nonlinear terms
    with homogeneity 4 and 6 respectively.

    We choose coefficients to show that this equation can have more than one positive solution for t.
    Let y = t^2. The equation becomes a quadratic in y:
    N6*y^2 + N4*y - s*K = 0
