# The normalised density of the invariant measure, rho(x), for the given map
# has been derived using a transformation to the Gauss map.
# The final expression is rho(x) = 1 / (2 * ln(2) * (x + sqrt(x))).

# The problem asks to output the equation and each number within it.

print("The normalised density of the invariant measure is given by the equation:")
# We can write (x + sqrt(x)) as sqrt(x)*(1+sqrt(x)) but the former is simpler.
