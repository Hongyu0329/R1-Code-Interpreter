    # Step 1: Identify the correct physical structure and optical phenomenon.
    # The cuticle of scarab beetles like Protaetia cuprea has a helicoidal,
    # layered microstructure known as a Bouligand structure.
    correct_structure = "Bouligand structures"
    # This structure is known to selectively reflect circularly polarized light.
    correct_phenomenon = "Circular polarization of light"

    # Step 2: Evaluate the options based on structure and phenomenon.
    # Options that do not mention 'Bouligand structures' or mention 'linear polarization'
    # are less accurate or incorrect. This leaves G, I, and K as strong candidates.
    # G: 'Make cuticle appear unpolarized to most insects' - a consequence, not a primary function.
    # I: 'attracting predator attention to less important areas' - a plausible defense mechanism.
    # K: 'for mate attraction' - a plausible communication mechanism.

    # Step 3: Select the best ecological function.
    # Both predator interaction and mate attraction are debated functions. However,
    # mate attraction via a 'covert' signaling channel that most predators cannot see
    # is a well-supported hypothesis with experimental evidence in related scarab species.
    # Therefore, K is considered a highly accurate relationship.
