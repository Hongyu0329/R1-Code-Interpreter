    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time $t$, space $\\mathbf{x}$) and dependent variables (velocity $\\mathbf{u}$, pressure $p$) that leave the form of the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters that define these transformations.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the fundamental symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. These are well-known and consist of translations, rotations, boosts, and scaling.\n2.  For each type of symmetry, determine the number of independent parameters it requires. For example, a translation in 3D space requires a 3-component vector, so it contributes 3 to the total dimension.\n3.  Sum the dimensions from all identified symmetry types. This will give the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries.\n4.  I will write a Python script to perform this summation and present the result clearly, showing how each symmetry type contributes to the final total.\n\nThere is also an infinite-dimensional part of the symmetry group related to pressure transformations ($p \\rightarrow p + f(t)$), but typically, when asked for \"the dimension\", the question refers to the maximal finite-dimensional part, which is what I will calculate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 are given by:\n        ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇)u = -∇p + ν∇²u\n        ∇ ⋅ u = 0\n\n    A symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the variables (t, x, u, p)\n    that maps solutions to other solutions. These continuous symmetries form a Lie group.\n    The dimension of this group is the number of independent parameters that define\n    these transformations.\n\n    This function calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group\n    of symmetries by summing the dimensions of its constituent symmetry subgroups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
