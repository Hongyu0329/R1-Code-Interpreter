def solve_lie_group_dimension():
    """
    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D
    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

    The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 are given by:
        ∂u/∂t + (u ⋅ ∇)u = -∇p + ν∇²u
        ∇ ⋅ u = 0

    A symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the variables (t, x, u, p)
    that maps solutions to other solutions. These continuous symmetries form a Lie group.
    The dimension of this group is the number of independent parameters that define
    these transformations.

    This function calculates the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group
    of symmetries by summing the dimensions of its constituent symmetry subgroups.
