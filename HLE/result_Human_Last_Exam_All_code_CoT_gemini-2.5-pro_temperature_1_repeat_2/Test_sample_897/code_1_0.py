    # According to braid theory, a braid in B_n of the form (beta' * sigma_{n-1}^k), where beta' is in B_{n-1},
    # can be "destabilized". Its closure is topologically equivalent to the closure of beta'.
    # In our case, n=3, so sigma_{n-1} is sigma_2.
    # The braid is beta = (sigma_1^-1)^3 * sigma_2^-1, which fits the form with beta' = (sigma_1^-1)^3 (an element of B_2) and k = -1.
    # Therefore, the knot K2 is equivalent to the closure of the braid beta' = (sigma_1^-1)^3 in B_2.
