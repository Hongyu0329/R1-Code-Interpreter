# The problem defines a special topological space X containing a set of 5 distinct points, P = {a, b, c, d, e}.
# The crucial property is that no proper subcontinuum of X contains any three points from P.
# We are asked for the largest number n for a decomposition X = A_1 U ... U A_n,
# where each A_i is a subcontinuum with a non-empty private part (A_i is not a subset of the union of the others).

# Since each A_i must have a private part, A_i must be a proper subcontinuum of X.
# Therefore, based on the given property, each A_i can contain at most 2 points from the set P.

# This suggests that the decomposition is fundamentally related to the pairs of points in P.
# The number of points in the set P is m.
m = 5

# The number of points from P that each subcontinuum A_i can contain is at most k.
k = 2

# The structure of X is determined by the irreducible continua connecting pairs of points from P.
# There is one such fundamental continuum for each pair of points.
# The number of ways to choose a pair of points from a set of 5 is C(5, 2).
# These C(5, 2) continua form a valid decomposition, establishing a lower bound for n.
# It can be shown that this is also the maximum possible number for n.
# Thus, the largest possible value for n is the number of combinations of 5 items taken 2 at a time.
