    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to understand the definitions clearly.\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a finite group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`. In other words, `S \\cap S^2 = \\emptyset`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in a product-free set, because `e*e = e`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** (or just maximal) if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the new set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n\n2.  Next, I will devise an algorithm to check any given finite group for this property.\n    *   For a group `G`, I will iterate through all of its subsets `S` of size 2.\n    *   For each subset `S`, I will first check if it's product-free. If it contains the identity, I can skip it immediately.\n    *   If `S` is product-free, I will then check if it's maximal. To do this, I'll iterate through every element `g` not in `S`. For each `g`, I form a new set `S' = S \\cup \\{g\\}` and check if `S'` is product-free. If I find even one `g` for which `S'` is still product-free, then the original set `S` was not maximal, and I can stop and move to the next subset.\n    *   If `S` is product-free and is maximal, then the group `G` has the desired property.\n\n3.  Finally, I will implement this algorithm in Python. To avoid the complexity of a full group theory library, I will represent small finite groups by their multiplication tables (Cayley tables). I will check a list of small groups up to a reasonable order and count how many of them satisfy the condition. The script will output the total count. I will check the cyclic groups `C_n`, the dihedral groups `D_{2n}`, the symmetric group `S_3`, the quaternion group `Q_8`, and the dicyclic group `Dic_3`. Based on my preliminary analysis, the groups are all of small order.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(group_elements, mult_table, subset):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset of a group is product-free.\"\"\"\n    # The identity element cannot be in a product-free set.\n    # The identity is assumed to be the first element (index 0).\n    if group_elements[0] in subset:\n        return False\n        \n    indices = {group_elements.index(s) for s in subset}\n    \n    for i in indices:\n        for j in indices:\n            product_idx = mult_table[i][j]\n            if product_idx in indices:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group_name, elements, mult_table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(elements) < 3:\n        return False\n\n    # Generate all subsets of size 2 that do not contain the identity\n    non_identity_elements = elements[1:]\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(non_identity_elements, 2):\n        s = set(s_tuple)\n        if not is_product_free(elements, mult_table, s):\n            continue\n\n        # Check for maximality\n        is_maximal = True\n        other_elements = set(elements) - s\n        for g in other_elements:\n            s_prime = s.union({g})\n            if is_product_free(elements, mult_table, s_prime):\n                is_maximal = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_maximal:\n            # Found one, so the group has the property.\n            # print(f\"Group {group_name} has a maximal product-free set of size 2: {s}\")\n            return True\n            \n    return False\n\ndef get_cyclic_group(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates the cyclic group C_n.\"\"\"\n    elements = list(range(n))\n    table = [[(i + j) % n for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    return f\"C_{n}\", elements, table\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to check various finite groups and count how many have the property.\n    \"\"\"\n    groups_to_check = []\n    \n    # Add cyclic groups C_3 to C_12\n    for n in range(3, 13):\n        groups_to_check.append(get_cyclic_group(n))\n\n    # Add other common small groups\n    # V4 (Klein Four Group)\n    v4_elems = ['e', 'a', 'b', 'c']\n    v4_map = {e:0, 'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}\n    v4_table = [[0,1,2,3], [1,0,3,2], [2,3,0,1], [3,2,1,0]]\n    groups_to_check.append((\"V4\", v4_elems, v4_table))\n\n    # S3 (Symmetric Group on 3 elements)\n    s3_elems = ['e', '(12)', '(13)', '(23)', '(123)', '(132)']\n    s3_map = {el: i for i, el in enumerate(s3_elems)}\n    s3_table = [\n        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 0, 5, 4, 3, 2], [2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 3],\n        [3, 5, 4, 0, 2, 1], [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0], [5, 3, 1, 2, 0, 4]\n    ]\n    groups_to_check.append((\"S3\", s3_elems, s3_table))\n\n    # Q8 (Quaternion Group)\n    q8_elems = ['1', '-1', 'i', '-i', 'j', '-j', 'k', '-k']\n    q8_map = {el: i for i, el in enumerate(q8_elems)}\n    q8_table = [\n        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6],\n        [2, 3, 1, 0, 6, 7, 5, 4], [3, 2, 0, 1, 7, 6, 4, 5],\n        [4, 5, 7, 6, 1, 0, 2, 3], [5, 4, 6, 7, 0, 1, 3, 2],\n        [6, 7, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0], [7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1]\n    ]\n    groups_to_check.append((\"Q8\", q8_elems, q8_table))\n    \n    # Dic3 (Dicyclic group of order 12, also Q12)\n    dic3_elems = [f'a{i}' for i in range(6)] + [f'a{i}x' for i in range(6)]\n    dic3_map = {el: i for i, el in enumerate(dic3_elems)}\n    dic3_table = [[0]*12 for _ in range(12)]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            dic3_table[i][j] = (i+j)%6 # a^i * a^j = a^{i+j}\n            dic3_table[i][j+6] = (i+j)%6 + 6 # a^i * a^j x = a^{i+j}x\n            dic3_table[i+6][j] = (i-j)%6 + 6 # a^i x * a^j = a^i a^{-j} x = a^{i-j}x\n            dic3_table[i+6][j+6] = ((i-j)%6 + 3)%6 # a^i x * a^j x = a^{i-j}x^2 = a^{i-j+3}\n    groups_to_check.append((\"Dic3\", dic3_elems, dic3_table))\n\n\n    count = 0\n    found_groups = []\n    for name, elements, table in groups_to_check:\n        if has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(name, elements, table):\n            count += 1\n            found_groups.append(name)\n            \n    print(f\"Found {count} groups with the property.\")\n    print(f\"The groups are: {', '.join(found_groups)}\")\n    \n    # The final answer is the count.
