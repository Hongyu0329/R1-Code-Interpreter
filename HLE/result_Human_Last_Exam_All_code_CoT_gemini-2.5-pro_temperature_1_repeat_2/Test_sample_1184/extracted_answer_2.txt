1) The primary interaction hotspots on the beta-1 subunit for binding the alpha-1 subunit are located in a hydrophobic groove within its Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. Key residues include: Leucine (L) at position 265, Tyrosine (Y) at 268, Valine (V) at 288, Isoleucine (I) at 343, Tryptophan (W) at 344, Methionine (M) at 368, and Leucine (L) at 371.

2) The hotspots for fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit are located in regions outside the main binding interface. These include the entire N-terminal domain (residues 1-45), which modulates channel inactivation, and specific residues within the SH3 domain, such as Tryptophan (W) at position 237, which is critical for regulating the voltage-dependence of the channel.
