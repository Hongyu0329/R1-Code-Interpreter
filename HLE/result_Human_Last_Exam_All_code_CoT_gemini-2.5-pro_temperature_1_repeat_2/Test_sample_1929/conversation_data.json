    "This is a chemistry question that can be solved by identifying the type of reaction and predicting its outcome.\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂) is a conjugated diene. It has 4 pi electrons available for a reaction.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl₂=CF₂) is an alkene, which can act as a dienophile ('diene-loving'). It has 2 pi electrons in its double bond.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic example of a **[4+2] cycloaddition**, also known as the **Diels-Alder reaction**.\n\n**2. Predict the Product:**\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the 4 pi electrons from the diene and 2 pi electrons from the dienophile rearrange in a concerted step to form a new six-membered ring.\n*   The diene (butadiene) forms one part of the ring, containing a new double bond between its central carbons (C2 and C3).\n*   The dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) forms the other part of the ring, with its double bond becoming a single bond. The substituent groups (2 Chlorine atoms and 2 Fluorine atoms) remain attached to their respective carbons.\n*   The resulting molecule is a substituted cyclohexene. Its IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\nThe following Python script will print the reaction equation and the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the product of the reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define reactant and product information\n    diene_name = \"Butadiene\"\n    diene_formula = \"C4H6\"\n    dienophile_name = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene\"\n    dienophile_formula = \"C2Cl2F2\"\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n\n    # Explain the reaction\n    print(f\"The reaction between {diene_name} and {dienophile_name} is a [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder reaction).\")\n    print(\"This reaction forms a six-membered ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Print the reaction equation, which includes the required numbers (subscripts)\n    print(\"Final Reaction Equation:\")\n    # The numbers in the equation are the subscripts for each element.\n    # For C4H6: 4, 6\n    # For C2Cl2F2: 2, 2, 2\n    # For C6H6Cl2F2: 6, 6, 2, 2\n    print(f\"    {diene_formula} + {dienophile_formula} -> {product_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Print the product name, which includes the required numbers (locants)\n    print(\"The IUPAC name of the product is:\")\n    # The numbers in the name are the locants for the substituent groups and the double bond.\n    # The locants are 4, 4, 5, 5, and 1.\n    print(f\"    {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_reaction()\n```\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
