# The problem asks to find values a and b that satisfy a specific integral equation.
# Based on the analysis of the properties of integrals of inverse functions,
# the equation holds if and only if a and b satisfy the relation:
# a = f(ln(b)), where f(x) = (1/4)*e^(2x) + e^x - 3.
# This simplifies to the algebraic relation: a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3.

# The problem asks for a unique value of a+b, which suggests there's a unique
# intended solution pair (a, b). We can find this pair by looking for special
# conditions that simplify the original integral equation.
# The integrals become zero if their limits are equal.
# The first integral is zero if a = 0.
# The second integral is zero if b = 2.
# We check if the pair (a=0, b=2) satisfies the derived algebraic relation.

# Define the values for a and b
a = 0
b = 2

# Check if these values satisfy the condition a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3
calculated_a = (1/4) * (b**2) + b - 3

if a == calculated_a:
    print(f"The pair (a={a}, b={b}) is the correct unique solution.")
    # Now, we calculate the required sum a+b.
    final_sum = a + b
    
    print(f"The value of a is {a}.")
    print(f"The value of b is {b}.")
    print(f"The final sum is: a + b = {a} + {b} = {final_sum}")

    print("The chosen pair is not a valid solution.")
