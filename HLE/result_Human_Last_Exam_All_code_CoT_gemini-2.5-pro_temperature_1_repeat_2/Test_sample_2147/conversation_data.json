    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nPavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian liberal politician and historian, was a complex figure. While he was a \"Westernizer\" who advocated for constitutional democracy in Russia, he was also a sharp critic of what he perceived as the negative aspects of modern Western culture, particularly in the arts. He believed that art should have a social purpose and contribute to progress.\n\nHe saw the rise of artistic movements like Decadence and Symbolism as a retreat from social responsibility into individualism, mysticism, and pessimism. He famously described this trend as a \"stagnant swamp of decadent moods.\" The group of artists and writers he was criticizing is best described by the compound term \"Decadent-Symbolists.\"\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the group Pavel Milyukov criticized.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov was a critic of certain modern art movements.\n    # He saw them as detached from social reality and pessimistic.\n    # The term that fits the \"X-Y\" placeholder and describes this group is \"Decadent-Symbolists\".\n    x = \"Decadent\"\n    y = \"Symbolists\"\n\n    print(f\"The term 'X-Y' in the context of Pavel Milyukov's criticism refers to: {x}-{y}\")\n\nsolve_milyukov_riddle()\n```\n<<<Decadent-Symbolists>>>"
