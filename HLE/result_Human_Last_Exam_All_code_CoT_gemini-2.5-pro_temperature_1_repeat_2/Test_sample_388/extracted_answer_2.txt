Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions ready here for Atorvastatin 20mg, Junel Fe 1.5/30mg, and Fluoxetine 20mg.

I noticed you mentioned taking Excedrin for your headache. I want to provide an important piece of counseling regarding that. Your new prescription, Fluoxetine 20mg, can increase the risk of stomach bleeding. The aspirin in most Excedrin products also carries a similar risk. When you take them together, that risk of bleeding becomes much higher.

For future headaches, I would recommend a safer alternative like acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) instead of Excedrin.

It is a great choice for pain relief that doesn't have this specific interaction with your Fluoxetine 20mg. Please feel free to ask if you have any other questions about your medications.
