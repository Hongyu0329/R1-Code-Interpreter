  This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a topology T can have under the given conditions.
  
  Let X be a set of cardinality c.
  Let T be a topology on X that is neither trivial nor discrete.
  A topology S is a complement to T if:
  1. The union T U S generates the discrete topology.
  2. The intersection T & S is the trivial topology.

  The problem asks for the minimum possible value for the number of complements T can have.

  If a topology exists that has no complements, its set of complements is empty, and the cardinality of this set is 0.
  If such a topology exists, then the minimum possible number of complements is 0.

  An example of such a topology is the density topology on the real numbers. The set of real numbers has cardinality c. The density topology is neither trivial nor discrete. It is a known result in point-set topology that the density topology has no complements.

  Therefore, the smallest possible number of complements is 0.
