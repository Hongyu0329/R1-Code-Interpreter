    "This is a problem in algebraic geometry. I will outline the necessary theoretical background and then use Python to perform the simple final calculations.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Jacobian of C**:\n    *   Let `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g=3`.\n    *   Let `X = C^(15)` be its 15th symmetric power. `X` is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on `C`.\n    *   Let `J(C)` be the Jacobian of `C`, which is an abelian variety of dimension `g=3`.\n    *   There is a fundamental map called the Abel-Jacobi map, `u: C^(d) -> Pic^d(C)`, where `d` is the degree of the symmetric power. `Pic^d(C)` is the space of all divisor classes of degree `d`.\n    *   `Pic^d(C)` is isomorphic to `J(C)`.\n    *   When the degree `d` is large enough, specifically `d >= 2g - 1`, the map `u` makes `X = C^(d)` into a projective bundle over `J(C)`.\n    *   In our case, `g=3` and `d=15`. The condition is `15 >= 2*3 - 1 = 5`, which is satisfied.\n    *   For a projective bundle `P -> B`, the rank of the Néron-Severi group `ρ(P)` is related to the rank of the base `ρ(B)` by the formula `ρ(P) = ρ(B) + 1`.\n    *   Therefore, we have the key relation: `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\n2.  **Find the Smallest Possible Rank**:\n    *   The problem now is to find the minimum and maximum possible values for `ρ(J(C))` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n    *   The rank `ρ(J(C))` is minimized when the curve `C` is \"generic\".\n    *   For a generic curve `C`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible Néron-Severi group. Its Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization.\n    *   In this case, `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n    *   This gives the smallest possible rank for `X`: `ρ(X)_min = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n3.  **Find the Largest Possible Rank**:\n    *   The rank `ρ(J(C))` is bounded above by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(J(C))`, which is equal to `g^2`.\n    *   So, for `g=3`, we have `ρ(J(C)) <= 3^2 = 9`.\n    *   This maximum value is achieved for certain special curves. Specifically, it is attained when the Jacobian `J(C)` is isogenous to the product of `g` copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM).\n    *   An example of such a curve for `g=3` is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`. Its Jacobian is known to be isogenous to the cube of a CM elliptic curve.\n    *   Thus, the maximum possible rank is `ρ(J(C))_max = 9`.\n    *   This gives the largest possible rank for `X`: `ρ(X)_max = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   The smallest rank is 2.\n    *   The largest rank is 10.\n    *   I will use a Python script to formalize these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\n# A program to calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group\n# of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n\n# Define the properties of the curve C\ngenus_g = 3\n# Define the symmetric power degree\npower_d = 15\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Verify the condition for the structure of X = C^(d).\")\n# The 15th symmetric power X = C^(15) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian J(C)\n# if d >= 2g - 1.\ncondition_value = 2 * genus_g - 1\nprint(f\"The genus g = {genus_g} and the symmetric power d = {power_d}.\")\nprint(f\"The condition is d >= 2g - 1, which is {power_d} >= {condition_value}.\")\nif power_d >= condition_value:\n    print(\"The condition is satisfied.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X), is related to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian J(C), rho(J(C)), by the formula:\")\n    print(\"rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1\\n\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The condition is not satisfied, the formula may not apply.\")\n    # The program will proceed assuming the formula holds, as it does in this specific case.\n\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the smallest possible rank.\")\n# For a generic curve C, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is 1.\nmin_rho_jc = 1\nprint(f\"The minimum possible rank for rho(J(C)) is {min_rho_jc}.\")\nsmallest_rank_X = min_rho_jc + 1\nprint(f\"Smallest rank of NS(X) = rho(J(C))_min + 1 = {min_rho_jc} + 1 = {smallest_rank_X}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the largest possible rank.\")\n# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of a Jacobian of a genus g curve is bounded by g^2.\n# This maximum is achieved for special curves (e.g., those whose Jacobian is isogenous\n# to a product of g CM elliptic curves).\nmax_rho_jc = genus_g ** 2\nprint(f\"The maximum possible rank for rho(J(C)) is g^2 = {genus_g}^2 = {max_rho_jc}.\")\nlargest_rank_X = max_rho_jc + 1\nprint(f\"Largest rank of NS(X) = rho(J(C))_max + 1 = {max_rho_jc} + 1 = {largest_rank_X}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Final Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The smallest possible rank is {smallest_rank_X}.\")\nprint(f\"The largest possible rank is {largest_rank_X}.\")\n```\n<<<2 and 10>>>"
