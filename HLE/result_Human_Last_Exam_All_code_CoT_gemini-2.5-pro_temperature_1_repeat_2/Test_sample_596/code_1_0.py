def solve_mobius_forests():
    """
    This function calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests on the Möbius band
    that fail to simplicially collapse onto their root set.

    The problem is interpreted using algebraic topology. The number of such objects
    is given by a formula related to the homology of the Möbius band (M) relative
    to its boundary (dM). The formula is:
    N = |Tor H_0(M, dM)|^2 * |Tor H_1(M, dM)|^2 * ...

    The relevant homology groups are calculated as:
    - H_0(M, dM) is trivial, so its torsion subgroup has order 1.
    - H_1(M, dM) is Z_2 (the integers mod 2), so its torsion subgroup has order 2.
    - Higher homology groups are trivial.

    Thus, the number is determined by the torsion in H_1.
