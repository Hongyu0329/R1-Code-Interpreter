    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` followed by a Python script that presents the final result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Context:** We are working within finite-temperature quantum field theory, specifically with the functional integral representation of the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`.\n2.  **State the Euclidean Action:** The partition function is `Z = ∫Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action. For a free, massive, neutral scalar field, the action is:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ dᵈx [ ½(∂_μ ϕ)(∂^μ ϕ) + ½m²ϕ² ]`\n    Here, `dᵈx` is the integral over `d`-dimensional Euclidean spacetime, `∂_μ` are the partial derivatives, `m` is the mass, and `ϕ` is the field.\n3.  **Relate Action to the Inner Product:** The action `S[ϕ]` is a quadratic functional of the field. It can be expressed compactly using an operator `D` and an inner product:\n    `S[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, D_ϕ)`\n4.  **Define the Operator and Inner Product:** By performing integration by parts on the kinetic term `(∂_μ ϕ)(∂^μ ϕ)` and assuming boundary terms vanish (which is valid in this context), we can rewrite the action as:\n    `S[ϕ] = ½ ∫ dᵈx ϕ(x) [-∂² + m²] ϕ(x)`\n    From this, we can identify:\n    *   The **inner product** `(f, g)` as `∫ dᵈx f(x)g(x)`.\n    *   The **operator `D`** as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator: `D = -∂² + m²`, where `∂²` is the Laplacian `(∂_0² + ∇²)`.\n5.  **Calculate `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`:** Using the definitions above, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is:\n    `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ dᵈx ϕ(x) [D ϕ(x)] = ∫ dᵈx ϕ(x) [-∂² + m²] ϕ(x)`\n    By reversing the integration by parts, this is equivalent to `2S[ϕ]`. Therefore:\n    `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ dᵈx [ (∂_μ ϕ)(∂^μ ϕ) + m²ϕ² ]`\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that prints this result and breaks down each component of the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef display_inner_product_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the expression for the inner product\n    (ϕ, D_ϕ) in finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the Euclidean action S[ϕ] for a free, neutral scalar field is:\")\n    print(\"S[ϕ] = ∫dᵈx [ (1/2) * (∂_μϕ∂^μϕ) + (1/2) * m²ϕ² ]\")\n    print(\"\\nThis action can be written in the compact quadratic form S[ϕ] = (1/2) * (ϕ, D_ϕ).\")\n    print(\"This defines the operator D = -∂² + m² (the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator) and the inner product.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is therefore equal to 2 * S[ϕ].\")\n    print(\"\\n--- The Final Equation ---\")\n    print(\"The inner product is given by the integral:\")\n    print(\"\\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫dᵈx [ (∂_μϕ∂^μϕ) + m²ϕ² ]\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Let's break down each component of this equation:\")\n    print(\"1. ∫dᵈx: This represents the integral over all d dimensions of Euclidean spacetime.\")\n    print(\"   - At finite temperature T, the imaginary time dimension τ is compact, so its integral ∫dτ runs from 0 to β=1/T.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n2.
