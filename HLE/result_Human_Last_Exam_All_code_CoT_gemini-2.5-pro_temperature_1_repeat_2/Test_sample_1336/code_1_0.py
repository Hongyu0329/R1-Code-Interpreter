    """
    Calculates the total number of smooth coverings for a given prime p > 5.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2, p), b, w)
    by D(SL(2, p), b, w). In the context of modular representation theory, this
    can be interpreted as summing the number of blocks of SL(2, p) that cover
    each block of PSL(2, p).

    1. For p > 3, PSL(2, p) has (p+1)/2 p-blocks.
       - 1 principal block.
       - (p-1)/2 non-principal blocks.
    2. The principal block of PSL(2, p) is covered by |Z(SL(2, p))| = 2 blocks of SL(2, p).
    3. Each of the (p-1)/2 non-principal blocks is covered by exactly 1 block of SL(2, p).
    4. The total number is the sum: 2 (for the principal block) + (p-1)/2 (for the others).
