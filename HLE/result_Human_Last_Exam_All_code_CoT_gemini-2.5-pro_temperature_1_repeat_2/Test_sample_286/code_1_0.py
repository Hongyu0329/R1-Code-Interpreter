# The problem reduces to finding the smallest positive integer M that satisfies
# the inequality 2*B >= 1, where B = 1 - 10**-M.

# We start with the inequality:
# 2 * B >= 1
# Substitute B = 1 - 10**-M:
# 2 * (1 - 10**-M) >= 1
print("The derivation leads to the inequality:")
print("2 * (1 - 10**-M) >= 1")

# Divide by 2:
# 1 - 10**-M >= 0.5
print("1 - 10**-M >= 0.5")

# Rearrange the terms:
# 1 - 0.5 >= 10**-M
# 0.5 >= 10**-M
print("0.5 >= 10**-M")

# Take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the inequality sign:
# 2 <= 10**M
print("2 <= 10**M")

# Take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:
# log10(2) <= M
print("log10(2) <= M")

# Calculate the value of log10(2)
log10_2 = math.log10(2)
print(f"The value of log10(2) is approximately {log10_2:.5f}.")
print(f"So, M must be greater than or equal to {log10_2:.5f}.")

# M must be the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition.
# The smallest integer greater than or equal to 0.30103 is 1.
# Since M must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value is 1.
M = 1
print(f"Since M must be the smallest positive integer, the value for M is {M}.")
