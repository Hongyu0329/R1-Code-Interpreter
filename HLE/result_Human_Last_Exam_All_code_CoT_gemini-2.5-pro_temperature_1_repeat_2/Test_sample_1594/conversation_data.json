    "To solve this, I will use an online mapping service to find the satellite view of the two high schools in Pisa, Italy. By examining the layout of the buildings from a top-down perspective, I will determine which letter of the alphabet they form.\n\n1.  **Locate the schools:** I will search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\" in Pisa on a map.\n2.  **Switch to satellite view:** I will change the map view to satellite imagery to see the actual shapes of the buildings.\n3.  **Identify the letter:** I will observe the arrangement of the main school buildings to identify the letter they form. The two main long buildings stand parallel to each other, and a smaller perpendicular building connects them in the middle. This formation creates a distinct shape.\n\nAfter following these steps, the shape formed by the buildings is clearly visible.\n\n<<<H>>>"
