    This molecule is symmetrical. We need to count the types of chemically non-equivalent aromatic protons (those with chemical shifts > 6.0 ppm).
    
    1. Protons on the central Dithienoisoindoledione (DTI) core: There are two equivalent protons (H-1 and H-7).
       - Contribution to signals: 1 peak.
    2. Protons on the two outer thiophene rings: Each thiophene has a proton at the C3 position and the C5 position. Due to the molecule's symmetry, the two C3 protons are equivalent, and the two C5 protons are equivalent.
       - Contribution to signals: 2 peaks.
       
    Calculation for Starting Material:
    Number of signals = (DTI core signals) + (Outer thiophene signals)
    Number of signals = 1 + 2 = 3

    Hypothesis: The excess NBS forces a third bromination on the next most reactive site. After the outer thiophenes are brominated at C5, the remaining aromatic protons are the C3 protons on the outer thiophenes and the H-1/H-7 protons on the DTI core. The DTI core is electron-deficient, but bromination is still possible under forcing conditions. Let's assume a third bromine adds to the DTI core, for example at the C1 position.
    
    Proposed Structure (P3): 1-bromo-2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-...-dione.
    This molecule is now ASYMMETRICAL.
    
    1. Protons on the central DTI core: One proton was substituted (H-1). Only one proton remains (H-7).
       - Contribution to signals: 1 peak.
    2. Protons on the outer thiophene rings: Both rings have protons at C3. Because the molecule is no longer symmetric, the two thiophene rings are in different chemical environments. Therefore, their C3 protons are NOT equivalent.
       - Contribution to signals: 2 peaks.

    Calculation for Proposed Product (P3):
    Number of signals = (DTI core signals) + (Outer thiophene signals)
