    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principles and formulas required.**\n    *   We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to find the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`). The principle states `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `Δx` is the uncertainty in position and `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   We will use the Bohr model to find the momentum of the electron (`p`) in the first orbit. According to the model, the angular momentum (`L`) is quantized: `L = p * r = n * ħ`, where `r` is the orbit's radius and `n` is the principal quantum number. For the first orbit (`n=1`), the momentum is `p = ħ / r₁`, where `r₁` is the Bohr radius.\n\n2.  **Formulate the ratio.**\n    *   The ratio we need to find is `Δp / p`.\n    *   Substituting the formulas from step 1: `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the expression.**\n    *   The reduced Planck constant `ħ` cancels out, leaving a simplified formula for the ratio: `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n4.  **Gather the constants and given values.**\n    *   Uncertainty in position `Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m`.\n    *   Radius of the first Bohr orbit `r₁ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n\n5.  **Write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the result.**\n    *   The script will define the values for `r₁` and `Δx`, calculate the ratio using the simplified formula, and print the final equation with the numbers and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of an electron's momentum\n# to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n# Define the constants and given values.\n# r_1 is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (Bohr radius) in meters.\nr_1 = 5.29e-11\n# delta_x is the given uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10e-12 m).\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# The ratio is derived from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model.\n# Uncertainty in momentum, delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n# Momentum in first Bohr orbit, p = h_bar / r_1\n# The ratio delta_p / p simplifies to r_1 / (2 * delta_x).\nratio = r_1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Print the final equation with the numerical values.\nprint(f\"The equation for the ratio is r_1 / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(f\"Plugging in the values: {r_1} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\n\n# Print the final calculated ratio.\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n<<<2.645>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit if the uncertainty of its position is 10 pm.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
