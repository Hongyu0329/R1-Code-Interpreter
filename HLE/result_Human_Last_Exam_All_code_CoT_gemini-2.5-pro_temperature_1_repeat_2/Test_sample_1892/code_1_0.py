# Based on the analysis of the number of primitive Dirichlet characters.
# The asymptotic behavior of |A(X)| is determined by the sum of the number of characters
# for each order k that divides 12.

# For k=1, the number of characters is constant (1).
# For k >= 2, the number of primitive characters of order k with conductor up to X,
# denoted N_k(X), follows the asymptotic N_k(X) ~ C_k * X for some constant C_k > 0.

# The total number |A(X)| is the sum of these counts:
# |A(X)| = N_1(X) + N_2(X) + N_3(X) + N_4(X) + N_6(X) + N_12(X)
# As X -> infinity, the sum is dominated by the linear terms in X.
# |A(X)| ~ (C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_6 + C_12) * X

# We compare this to the given formula: |A(X)| ~ c * X^alpha * log^beta(X)
# By matching the terms, we find the values for alpha and beta.
# X is equivalent to X^1 * log^0(X).

alpha = 1
beta = 0

# The problem asks for the sum of alpha and beta.
