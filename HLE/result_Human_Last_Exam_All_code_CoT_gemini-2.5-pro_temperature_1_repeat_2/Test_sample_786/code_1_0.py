log_k = math.log(k)

# Calculate sqrt(log(k))
sqrt_log_k = math.sqrt(log_k)

# The approximation ratio is O(log k).
# We calculate the value for the given k to check against the options.
# Option C gives values for log(k) and sqrt(log(k)). Let's print our calculated values.
# The final equation mentioned in option C is: alpha <= log k
# We will print the numbers for this equation.
