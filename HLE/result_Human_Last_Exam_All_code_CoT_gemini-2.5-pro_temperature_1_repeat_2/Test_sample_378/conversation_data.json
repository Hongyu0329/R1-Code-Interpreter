    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no public record of him ever identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". Therefore, it's not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\nI will provide a Python script that prints this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef find_year():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Jonathan\n    publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on public records, the former President of Nigeria's full name\n    # is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    name_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\"\n    actual_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    \n    # There is no evidence he ever used \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name.\n    # Therefore, we print a statement explaining this.\n    print(f\"Based on available public records, the individual known as {actual_name} has never publicly identified himself with the name 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, there is no year in which such an event occurred.\")\n\nfind_year()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
