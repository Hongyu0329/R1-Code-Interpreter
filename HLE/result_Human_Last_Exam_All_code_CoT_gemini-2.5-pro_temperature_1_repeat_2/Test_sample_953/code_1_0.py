def solve_mis_complexity():
    """
    This function determines the complexity class for the MIS algorithm on three graph classes.

    The analysis shows that for all three classes, the complexity is Theta(log n).
    1.  Cycle of length n: The graph has a bounded degree (2) and a large diameter.
        This leads to a Theta(log n) runtime.
    2.  Tree with max degree 100: This is a bounded degree graph. The worst-case instance
        is a path, which has a large diameter. This leads to a Theta(log n) runtime.
    3.  General graph with max degree 100: This is a bounded degree graph. The worst-case
        instance is a path or cycle. This leads to a Theta(log n) runtime.

    The complexity f(n) = Theta(log n) falls into category 9: f(n) = Omega(log n).
