# Parameters given in the problem statement
n = 4048

# As derived in the plan, the final value simplifies to the sum of alpha_i^2 plus 10^15.
# We are given alpha_i = sqrt(i), which means alpha_i^2 = i.
# So, the first term is the sum of the first n integers.
# The sum of the first n integers is given by the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.
# We use integer division // since the result is guaranteed to be an integer.
first_term = n * (n + 1) // 2

# The second term in the final expression is 10^15.
second_term = 10**15

# The final result is the sum of these two numbers.
final_result = first_term + second_term

# The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The numbers are the first_term, the second_term, and the final_result.
# We print the final value as requested.
# first_term = 8195176
# second_term = 1000000000000000
# final_result = 8195176 + 1000000000000000 = 1000000008195176
