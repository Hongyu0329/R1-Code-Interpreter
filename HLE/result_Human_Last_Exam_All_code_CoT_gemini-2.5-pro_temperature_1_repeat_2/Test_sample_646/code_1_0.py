    Calculates the Hazard Quotient (HQ) for PFHxS exposure from consuming contaminated produce.
    The function follows these steps:
    1. Calculates the initial concentration of PFHxS in the soil.
    2. Calculates the concentration of PFHxS in the soil solution.
    3. Calculates the concentration of PFHxS in the consumed fruits and legumes.
    4. Calculates the total Chronic Daily Intake (CDI) from both food sources.
    5. Calculates the final Hazard Quotient (HQ) by comparing the CDI to the reference dose.
