    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **The Challenge of Scale**: The number `10^100` (a googol) is enormous. Standard floating-point data types (like Python's `float`) cannot store this number with the precision required to get a meaningful result for a trigonometric function. We need a special tool.\n2.  **High-Precision Math**: The best approach is to use a library designed for arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The `mpmath` library in Python is the perfect tool for this. It allows us to perform calculations with hundreds or thousands of digits of precision. *(Note: If you don't have it installed, you can add it to your environment by running `pip install mpmath`)*.\n3.  **Periodicity of Tangent**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The `mpmath` library's `tan` function automatically and accurately handles this reduction of `10^100` modulo π. To do this correctly, the library's working precision must be greater than the number of digits in the input. Since `10^100` has 101 digits, we'll set the precision to 110 decimal places to be safe.\n4.  **Execution Steps**:\n    *   Import the `mpmath` library.\n    *   Set the decimal precision (`dps`) to 110.\n    *   Define the number `10^100` using `mpmath`'s high-precision format.\n    *   Calculate the tangent of this number.\n    *   To find the first 3 digits after the decimal point, we will isolate the fractional part of the result, multiply it by 1000, and take the integer part.\n    *   Finally, I will print the full equation and the resulting digits as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision (dps = decimal places).\n# The number 10^100 has 101 digits, so we need a working precision\n# greater than that to get an accurate result. We'll use 110.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# Define the numbers in the equation.\n# We use mpmath.mpf() to handle the large number with high precision.\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\nx = mpmath.mpf(base) ** exponent\n\n# Calculate the tangent. mpmath handles the periodicity automatically.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# To find the first 3 digits after the comma, we take the absolute value\n# of the result, get its fractional part, multiply by 1000, and take the floor.\nfractional_part = mpmath.fmod(mpmath.fabs(result), 1)\nfirst_three_digits = int(mpmath.floor(fractional_part * 1000))\n\n# As requested, we print the numbers in the final equation.\n# We display the result truncated to a few decimal places for readability.\nprint(f\"The final equation is: tan({base}^{exponent}) = {mpmath.nstr(result, 6)}...\")\n\n# Print the extracted digits. We use :03d to ensure it's padded with leading\n# zeros if needed (e.g., for a result like 0.012...).\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits:03d}\")\n\n```\n<<<518>>>"
