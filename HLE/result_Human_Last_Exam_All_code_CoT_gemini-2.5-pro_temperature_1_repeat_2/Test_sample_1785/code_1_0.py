# This problem requires finding the minimum total length of a non-trivial 3-component link on a 3D lattice.
# The simplest such link is the Borromean rings.

# 1. Define the number of components in the link.
num_components = 3

# 2. State the known minimum length for a single component.
# Based on research in mathematical knot theory, the minimal number of edges for a single
# component to form a lattice Borromean link is 12. Each of the three rings must have at
# least 12 edges to be able to interlock in the required Borromean fashion without intersection.
min_edges_per_component = 12

# 3. Calculate the total minimum number of edges for the entire link.
total_min_edges = num_components * min_edges_per_component

# 4. Print the final equation and the result, showing each number.
print(f"The minimum total number of edges is found by multiplying the number of components by the minimum edge count per component.")
print(f"Final Equation: {num_components} * {min_edges_per_component} = {total_min_edges}")
