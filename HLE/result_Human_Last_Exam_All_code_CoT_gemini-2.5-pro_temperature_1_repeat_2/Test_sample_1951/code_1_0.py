# This script identifies the incorrect statements from the provided list.
#
# Analysis Summary:
# A. Correct. Both graph generation complexities can be exponential in the worst case.
# B. Incorrect. A Logical Attack Graph (LAG) is intended to be a complete logical representation of attack reachability. While standard implementations assume monotonicity and thus cannot represent non-monotonic paths, this statement mischaracterizes the fundamental goal of the model. Within its defined scope, a LAG is complete.
# C. Correct. The monotonicity assumption is a primary reason why LAGs are vastly more scalable than SEGs, as it prevents state-space explosion.
# D. Incorrect. The claim "cannot calculate" is false. While probability calculation in graphs with loops is complex and requires advanced methods (e.g., Markov chains), it is not impossible.
# E. Correct. The monotonicity assumption in standard LAGs prevents the handling of negation (i.e., retracting a fact), whereas State Enumeration Graphs (SEGs) can represent any state change.
#
# The incorrect statements are B and D.
