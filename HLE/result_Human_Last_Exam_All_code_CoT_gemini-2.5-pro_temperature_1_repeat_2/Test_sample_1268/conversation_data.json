    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Mathematical Context:** The question relates concepts from the geometry of numbers to properties of squarefree integers. I'll interpret this in the context of lattices derived from real quadratic number fields, which are defined by squarefree integers.\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Squarefree Natural Number (N):** This defines the real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **Covolume (V):** The ring of integers of this field can be embedded into a 2D lattice. The covolume $(V)$ of this lattice is the volume of its fundamental domain, which equals the square root of the field's discriminant, $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n    *   **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This non-standard notation will be interpreted as the $L_\\infty$ norm (or maximum norm) of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, a value commonly denoted as $\\lambda_{1,\\infty}$.\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem:** I will use Minkowski's theorem for convex bodies. This theorem provides a fundamental relationship between the volume of a convex, centrally symmetric set and its ability to contain a point from a given lattice.\n4.  **Derive the Upper Bound:** By applying Minkowski's theorem to a 2-dimensional square (which is the unit ball for the $L_\\infty$ norm), I will establish a direct inequality between the maximum norm of the shortest vector and the covolume of the lattice. This results in the inequality $k_{k,\\infty} \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script to programmatically display this final relationship. To adhere to the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will represent the square root as a fractional exponent, $V^{1/2}$, and print each component of the formula.\n\nNow, I will execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_upper_bound_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the upper bound for the maximum norm\n    in relation to the covolume for lattices associated with squarefree integers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols used in the formula.\n    # k_{k,∞} represents the maximum norm of the shortest non-zero lattice vector.\n    # V represents the covolume of the lattice.\n    maximum_norm_symbol = \"k_{k,∞}\"\n    covolume_symbol = \"V\"\n\n    # The relationship is k_{k,∞} <= sqrt(V), which can be written with exponents.\n    # The numbers in the equation are the 1 and 2 in the exponent 1/2.\n    exponent_numerator = 1\n    exponent_denominator = 2\n\n    # Print the full formula.\n    print(\"The upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume is given by the formula:\")\n    # Using Unicode for better mathematical representation\n    # k_{k,∞} ≤ V^(1/2)\n    print(f\"{maximum_norm_symbol.replace('∞', '\\u221e')} \\u2264 {covolume_symbol}^({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator})\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Formula Components ---\")\n    print(f\"Left-hand side (Maximum Norm): {maximum_norm_symbol.replace('∞', '\\u221e')}\")\n    print(\"Inequality operator: \\u2264 (less than or equal to)\")\n    print(f\"Right-hand side base (Covolume): {covolume_symbol}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent Numerator: {exponent_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent Denominator: {exponent_denominator}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result.\ndisplay_upper_bound_formula()\n```\n<<<k_{k,∞} <= V^(1/2)>>>"
