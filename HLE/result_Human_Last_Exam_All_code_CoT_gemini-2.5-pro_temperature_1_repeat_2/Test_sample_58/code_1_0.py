    Calculates the topological invariant group for a defect in a 2D free fermion model.

    T_squared = -1
    P_squared = -1

    # Note: The spatial dimension d=2 is not needed for the stable classification.

    # --- Step 1: Identify the symmetry class ---
    # The Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) classification ("tenfold way") organizes systems
    # by their symmetries. A system with T^2=-1 and P^2=-1 belongs to class CII.
    # In the periodic table, the real classes are indexed by an integer s from 0 to 7.
    # The class CII corresponds to s=5.

    s = 5

    # --- Step 2: Apply the classification theorem for defects ---
    # The classification of a topological defect of codimension D in a system of
    # symmetry class s is given by the stable homotopy group π_(s-D). This is a
    # fundamental result from the K-theory classification of topological phases.

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the group index ---
    # The index k for the homotopy group is calculated as k = (s - D) mod 8.
    k = (s - codimension_D) % 8

    # --- Step 4: Find the group from Bott Periodicity ---
    # The relevant groups (π_k for real K-theory) follow an 8-fold periodicity
    # known as Bott periodicity. The sequence for k = 0, 1, 2, ... , 7 is:
