# Step 1: Define the given parameters.
Eg = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E_1s_peak = 1.0  # Resonance peak for the 1s exciton in eV
n = 3 # Principal quantum number for the target state

# Step 2: Calculate the 1s exciton binding energy, which is the 2D Rydberg energy (Ry_2D).
# The energy of the 1s exciton peak is E_1s_peak = Eg - E_b(1s).
# Therefore, the 1s binding energy E_b(1s) = Eg - E_1s_peak.
# This 1s binding energy is the Rydberg energy for the 2D system.
Ry_2D = Eg - E_1s_peak

# Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for the n=3 state.
# The formula for the binding energy of the n-th state in a 2D exciton model is:
# E_b(n) = Ry_2D / (n - 1/2)^2
E_b_n3 = Ry_2D / (n - 0.5)**2

# Step 4: Print the final result, showing the equation used.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
