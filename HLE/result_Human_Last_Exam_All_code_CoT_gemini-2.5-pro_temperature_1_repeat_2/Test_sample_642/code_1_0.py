# Plan:
# Based on the analysis, the state complexity f(k) of the Turing machine
# can be optimized to be a constant, C, independent of the modulus k.
# This is achieved by using the infinite tape to store the counter, with k
# distinct symbols in the tape alphabet to represent the count modulo k.

# Let's represent this constant state complexity f(k) with an arbitrary
# number, for example, 5. The actual value does not matter, only that it
# is constant for all k.
C = 5
f_k = C
f_k_plus_1 = C

# We need to compute the limit of the difference f(k+1) - f(k) as k -> infinity.
# The difference for any given k is:
difference = f_k_plus_1 - f_k

# The limit of a constant value is the value itself.
limit_result = difference

print(f"For the purpose of illustrating the calculation, let's say C = {C}.")
print(f"Then, f(k) = {f_k} for any k.")
