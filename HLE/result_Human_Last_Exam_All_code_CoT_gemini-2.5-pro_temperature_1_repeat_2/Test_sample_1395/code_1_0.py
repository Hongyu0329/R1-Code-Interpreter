# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# Before 1991, the largest clique in the Asian country graph was of size 3 (e.g., USSR-China-Afghanistan).
# The graph was 3-colorable.
chi_before = 3
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution (chi_before) was: {chi_before}")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# After 1991, the dissolution led to the formation of a 4-clique in the Caucasus region: {Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey}.
# The presence of a 4-clique requires a minimum of 4 colors.
chi_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the Soviet dissolution (chi_after) is: {chi_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change in the chromatic number.
# This value is the difference between the 'after' and 'before' states.
delta_soviet = chi_after - chi_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is {chi_after} - {chi_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed.
# A political map is a planar graph. The dissolution of a country creates a new map, which is also planar.
# Since the planarity of the graph did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The graph's planarity did not change, so beta = {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result as per the user's instruction.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
