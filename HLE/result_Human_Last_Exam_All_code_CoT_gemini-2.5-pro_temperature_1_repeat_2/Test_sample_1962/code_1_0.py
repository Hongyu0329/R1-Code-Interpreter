    This function prints the solution to the given set theory problem.
    The problem asks for the minimum size of a set of functions g that satisfy a bounding condition determined by a function f.
    
    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    Let g be a function from kappa^+ to kappa.
    Let f be a function from kappa^+ x kappa^+ to kappa.
    
    The condition is: for all alpha, beta < kappa^+, f(alpha, beta) <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)).
    We want to find the minimum size of the set of such functions g, over all possible f.
    
    This is a known result in set theory. The minimum value is 2^kappa.
