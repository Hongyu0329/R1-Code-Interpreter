    # Step 1: Analyze the problem's dimensions.

    # This implies the system's dimension n is 202000.
    n = 202000

    # Step 2: Identify the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.
    # The given conditions are:
    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0
    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0
    # 3. 5*(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0  (Linearly dependent on condition 2)

    # Step 3 & 5: Calculate the dimension of the cokernel, dim(coker(P)).
    # The dimension of the cokernel is the number of solutions to the adjoint problem.
    # For this type of problem, the adjoint boundary conditions are such that they force
    # the solution of the adjoint homogeneous equation to be the trivial zero solution.
    # Thus, the dimension of the kernel of the adjoint operator is 0.
