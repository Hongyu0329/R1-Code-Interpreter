    This function explains the reasoning and computes the clique number.

    1.  The problem describes a graph X, which is the directed line graph of a tournament on the real numbers.
    2.  The vertices of X are ordered pairs (u, v) of real numbers such that u < v.
    3.  An edge exists between two vertices (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) in the underlying undirected graph of X if v1 = u2 or v2 = u1.
    4.  A clique is a set of vertices where every two vertices are connected.
    5.  A clique of size 2 exists. For example, let x1=1, x2=2, x3=3. The vertices (x1, x2) and (x2, x3) form a clique.
        e1 = (1, 2)
        e2 = (2, 3)
        The head of e1 (which is 2) equals the tail of e2 (which is 2), so they are connected.
        Thus, the clique number is at least 2.
    6.  A clique of size 3 cannot exist. A 3-clique requires three edges e1=(u1, v1), e2=(u2, v2), e3=(u3, v3) that are all pairwise connected.
       Analysis shows this requires the set of tails {u1, u2, u3} to be the same as the set of heads {v1, v2, v3}.
       This structure, combined with the ordering constraint (u < v for every edge), forces a contradiction.
       For example, it would require finding three distinct numbers x, y, z such that x < y, y < z, and z < x, which is impossible.
    7.  Since a 2-clique exists and a 3-clique is impossible, the clique number must be 2.
