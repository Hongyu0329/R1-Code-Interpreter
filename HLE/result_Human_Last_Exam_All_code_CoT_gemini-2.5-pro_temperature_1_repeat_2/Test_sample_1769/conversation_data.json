    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the etymological origin of the current Modern English word \"sister\".\n2.  Next, I will find the original, native Old English word that was used before the Norse influence.\n3.  Then, I will analyze the predictable sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English by looking at parallel words like \"brother\" and \"mother\".\n4.  By applying these sound changes to the original Old English word, and looking at related words in other Germanic languages like German, I will deduce the most likely modern form.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to explain this linguistic journey and print the final, hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the linguistic reasoning to find what the word \"sister\"\n    would be in Modern English without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir\",\n    # introduced during the Viking invasions.\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    \n    # The original, native Old English word was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    # To see how \"sweostor\" might have evolved, we can look at other Old English\n    # family terms and their modern equivalents.\n    # OE brōþor -> ModE brother\n    # OE mōdor  -> ModE mother\n    # This shows a common pattern where the unstressed \"-or\" ending becomes \"-er\".\n    \n    # Applying this pattern to \"sweostor\" would give us \"swester\".\n    # This form is supported by two key pieces of evidence:\n    # 1. The word \"swester\" did exist in Middle English, alongside \"sister\", before \"sister\" won out.\n    # 2. The cognate word in Modern German, which did not undergo the same Norse influence, is \"Schwester\".\n    \n    hypothetical_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(f\"The current word 'sister' comes from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"However, the original Old English word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nIf this word had evolved naturally into Modern English, following the same pattern as 'brother' and 'mother',\")\n    print(\"it would have become:\")\n    print(f\"\\n---> {hypothetical_word} <---\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
