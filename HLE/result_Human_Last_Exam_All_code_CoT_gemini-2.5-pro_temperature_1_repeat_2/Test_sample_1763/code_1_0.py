    1. Sufficiency: It is a known theorem in topology that any infinite topological space must contain a subspace homeomorphic to one of these five types. The proof involves analyzing the separation properties (T0, T1) and the specialization preorder of the space. An infinite T1 space must contain one of the first three types. An infinite T0 space that is not T1 can be shown to contain one of the last two. Any space that is not T0 can be reduced to a T0 space.

    2. Minimality: To show this family of 5 is the smallest possible, we must show none can be removed. Each of these five spaces has the property that all of its own infinite subspaces are homeomorphic to itself, but not to any of the other four. For example:
       - The discrete space is T2, but its points are all isolated, unlike the convergent sequence.
       - The cofinite space is the only one that is T1 but not T2.
       - The two T0-but-not-T1 spaces are not homeomorphic to each other (one has a minimal non-empty open set, {1}, while the other does not).
    Therefore, all five are necessary.
