    print("The problem provides the following information:")
    print("  - The continuum hypothesis fails: 2^omega > Aleph_1.")
    print("  - 2^omega is not a regular cardinal: This means cf(2^omega) < 2^omega (i.e., it's a singular cardinal).")
    print("  - 2^omega < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}: This provides an upper bound.")
    print("\nFrom these facts and standard theorems in ZFC, we deduce the properties of lambda = cf(2^omega):")
    print("  a) By KÃ¶nig's Theorem, cf(2^omega) > omega. Thus, lambda is an uncountable cardinal.")
    print("  b) The cofinality of any cardinal is, by definition, a regular cardinal. So, lambda is a regular cardinal.")
    print("  c) Combining the previous two points, lambda must be an uncountable regular cardinal.")
    print(f"  d) From the given bounds, we have: lambda = cf(2^omega) <= 2^omega < Aleph_{{omega_{{omega+5}}}}.")
    print("In summary, lambda must be an uncountable regular cardinal strictly smaller than Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.\n")

    print("Step 2: Determine the set X of all possible values for lambda.")
    print("The consistency results of Easton show that ZFC has very few restrictions on the value of 2^omega.")
    print("Specifically, 2^omega can be any cardinal kappa whose cofinality is greater than omega.")
    print("The problem requires 2^omega to be a singular cardinal. For any uncountable regular cardinal lambda satisfying the bound from Step 1,")
    print("it is consistent with ZFC that 2^omega is a singular cardinal kappa with cf(kappa) = lambda and kappa < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.")
    print("Therefore, the set X of all possible cofinalities is precisely the set of all uncountable regular cardinals less than Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.\n")

    print("Step 3: Characterize the set X and its indices.")
    print("In ZFC, an uncountable cardinal is regular if and only if it is of the form Aleph_{alpha+1} for some ordinal alpha >= 0.")
    print("So, the set X can be written as: X = { Aleph_{alpha+1} | Aleph_{alpha+1} < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}} }.")
    print("The inequality Aleph_{alpha+1} < Aleph_{omega_{omega+5}} is equivalent to the inequality on their indices: alpha+1 < omega_{omega+5}.")
    print("Let I be the set of these indices: I = { beta | beta is a successor ordinal and beta < omega_{omega+5} }.\n")

    print("Step 4: Determine the order type of X.")
    print("The function mapping an index beta to the cardinal Aleph_beta is an order-isomorphism.")
    print("Therefore, the order type of the set X is the same as the order type of the set of indices I.")
    print("We need to find the order type of I, the set of all successor ordinals less than omega_{omega+5}.")
    print("First, note that for any ordinal alpha, the initial ordinal omega_alpha is a limit ordinal.")
    print("A fundamental result of ordinal theory states that for any limit ordinal L, the set of all successor ordinals less than L has an order type of L.")
