    "In this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d=53599$ and order $g=6$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Factor the conductor**: The conductor is $d = 53599$. We will first find its prime factorization. A quick check shows it's a square-free integer.\n2.  **Analyze the structure of primitive characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. A non-principal character is one with order greater than 1.\n3.  **Relate the order of the character to its components**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n4.  **Count the component characters**: The order of a character $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i$ must divide the order of the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p_i) = p_i-1$. The condition $\\text{lcm}(\\dots)=6$ implies that the order of each component, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since $\\chi_i$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. We need to confirm that these orders are valid for each prime factor $p_i$ (i.e., they divide $p_i-1$). The number of characters of a specific order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n5.  **Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: We want to count the number of tuples of component characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that their orders $g_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ are in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ and their lcm is exactly 6.\n    - First, we calculate the total number of tuples where each $g_i$ can be any value from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    - Then, we subtract the number of tuples where the lcm is not 6. This occurs if the lcm is not divisible by 2 or not divisible by 3.\n        - The lcm is not divisible by 2 if all $g_i$ are 3.\n        - The lcm is not divisible by 3 if all $g_i$ are 2.\n6.  **Calculate and Present the Final Result**: The Python script will perform these calculations and print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\")\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    k = len(prime_factors)\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {prime_factors}.
