    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for sterile preparations is governed by guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically chapter <797>. The rules differ based on the container type (ampule vs. vial) and the environment in which it is opened.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  Define the specific item in question: a single-dose ampule.\n2.  Reference the relevant standard (USP <797>).\n3.  Explain the guideline for an ampule, which is a glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\n4.  State the resulting BUD, which is \"immediate use.\"\n5.  Create a Python script that prints this information clearly. The script will set the allowed storage time to 0 to represent \"immediate use\" in a numerical format.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef calculate_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and determines the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    opened in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the user's question\n    container_type = \"Single-Dose Ampule\"\n    environment = \"Sterile Environment (e.g., ISO Class 5)\"\n    \n    # According to USP <797>, an ampule is an open-system container.\n    # Once broken, it cannot be resealed to protect against contamination.\n    # Therefore, it cannot be stored for any period.\n    allowed_storage_hours = 0\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a Single-Dose Ampule\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Environment: {environment}\")\n    print(\"\\nGuideline Summary (from USP <797>):\")\n    print(\"An opened ampule is an open system that cannot be resealed. To prevent microbial contamination, its contents must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBUD Calculation:\")\n    # We represent \"immediate use\" as a storage time of 0 hours.\n    puncture_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n    bud_time = puncture_time + datetime.timedelta(hours=allowed_storage_hours)\n    \n    print(f\"Allowed storage time after puncture: {allowed_storage_hours} hours\")\n    print(f\"This means the contents must be used 'Immediately'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The BUD for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture is Immediate Use.\")\n    print(\"Storage is not permitted.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_ampule_bud()\n\n```\n<<<Immediate Use>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
