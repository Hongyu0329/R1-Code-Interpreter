    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Convert the fraction to binary:** The value of a simple red-blue-Hackenbush stalk (where all pieces are in a single line connected to the ground) corresponds to the binary representation of a number. For a dyadic fraction like $\\frac{13}{16}$, which is less than 1, we look at its binary expansion after the decimal point. The denominator, 16, is $2^4$, which tells us the binary representation will have exactly 4 digits after the decimal point.\n    \n    To find these digits, we can convert the numerator, 13, to a 4-digit binary number. The binary representation of 13 is $1101_2$.\n    \n    Therefore, $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary is $0.1101_2$.\n\n2.  **Map binary digits to pieces:** In the standard representation of a number between 0 and 1, each binary digit corresponds to a game piece in a stalk.\n    *   A digit '1' corresponds to a **red** piece.\n    *   A digit '0' corresponds to a **blue** piece.\n\n3.  **Count the pieces:** The binary representation $0.1101_2$ has four digits after the decimal point. This means we need a total of four pieces.\n    *   The first digit ('1') is a red piece.\n    *   The second digit ('1') is a red piece.\n    *   The third digit ('0') is a blue piece.\n    *   The fourth digit ('1') is a red piece.\n    \n    This gives us 3 red pieces and 1 blue piece, for a total of 4 pieces.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces(num, den):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of red and blue pieces needed to represent\n    a dyadic fraction in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Check if the denominator is a power of two and find the exponent n.\n    # For a fraction num / (2^n), the total number of pieces is n.\n    if den <= 0 or (den & (den - 1) != 0):\n        print(f\"Error: The denominator {den} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(den))\n    total_pieces = n\n\n    # Step 2: Convert the numerator to its binary representation, padded to length n.\n    # This binary string determines the color of each piece.\n    binary_numerator = bin(num)[2:].zfill(n)\n\n    # Step 3: Count the '1's (red pieces) and '0's (blue pieces).\n    red_pieces = binary_numerator.count('1')\n    blue_pieces = binary_numerator.count('0')\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The fraction is {num}/{den}.\")\n    print(f\"The binary representation of {num}/{den} is 0.{binary_numerator}.\")\n    print(f\"This representation requires {red_pieces} red pieces (for the '1's) and {blue_pieces} blue pieces (for the '0's).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of red and blue pieces.\")\n    print(f\"Total pieces = {red_pieces} + {blue_pieces} = {total_pieces}\")\n\n\n# The specific numbers from the problem.\nnumerator = 13\ndenominator = 16\n\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces(numerator, denominator)\n```\n<<<4>>>"
