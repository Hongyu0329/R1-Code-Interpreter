    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x = cos(9t)` and `y = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve, which is described by parametric equations of the form `x = A sin(at + δ)` and `y = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x = cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)` and `y = sin(5t)`, with frequencies `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Use the formula for self-intersections:** For a Lissajous curve with integer frequencies `a` and `b`, the number of self-intersection points depends on their greatest common divisor (GCD). Let `d = gcd(a, b)`, `p = a / d`, and `q = b / d`. The number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\n    `Number of intersections = (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Apply the formula to the specific curve:**\n    *   The frequencies are `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   Calculate the greatest common divisor: `gcd(9, 5) = 1`.\n    *   Since the GCD is 1, the frequencies are coprime, so `p = 9` and `q = 5`.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula: `(9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final result:** The calculation is `8 * 4 / 2 = 16`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps of the equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the integer frequencies for the Lissajous curve (cos(nx*t), sin(ny*t))\nnx = 9\nny = 5\n\n# The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve with coprime\n# frequencies p and q is given by the formula (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2.\n# In this case, nx=9 and ny=5 are coprime, so we use p=9 and q=5.\n\n# Calculate the terms of the formula\np_minus_1 = nx - 1\nq_minus_1 = ny - 1\nnumerator = p_minus_1 * q_minus_1\ndenominator = 2\nresult = numerator // denominator\n\n# Print the step-by-step evaluation of the formula\nprint(f\"The number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos({nx}t), sin({ny}t)) is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Formula: (p - 1) * (q - 1) / 2\")\nprint(f\"Substituting p={nx} and q={ny}:\")\nprint(f\"({nx} - 1) * ({ny} - 1) / {denominator} = {p_minus_1} * {q_minus_1} / {denominator} = {numerator} / {denominator} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
