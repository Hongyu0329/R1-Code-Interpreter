    # The problem asks for the maximal integer k for which a statement holds.
    # Let's break down the statement: "for any choice of such measures, we are not
    # able to guarantee (with probability 1) that the controlled random walk
    # will return to the origin".

    # 1. Condition for Recurrence: A controlled random walk with mean-zero measures
    # can be made recurrent if and only if the supports of all k measures
    # lie in a common proper linear subspace (a hyperplane).
    # Let S_i be the support of measure nu_i.
    # Recurrence is possible <=> span(S_1 U S_2 U ... U S_k) is a proper subspace of R^d.

    # 2. Condition for Guaranteed Transience: Consequently, the walk is guaranteed
    # to be transient (i.e., we are "not able to guarantee recurrence") if and only if
    # span(S_1 U S_2 U ... U S_k) = R^d.

    # 3. The Question: We are looking for the maximal k such that for ANY choice of
    # k measures {nu_1, ..., nu_k} satisfying the given properties, the walk is
    # guaranteed to be transient. That is, for any valid choice of measures,
    # span(S_1 U ... U S_k) = R^d.

    # 4. The "Genuinely d-dimensional" Property: The problem states that each
    # measure nu_i is "genuinely d-dimensional", meaning its support S_i is not
    # contained in any subspace of lesser dimension.
    # This means for EACH i from 1 to k, we must have span(S_i) = R^d.

    # 5. The Final Argument:
    # Let's consider any k >= 1 and any valid set of measures {nu_1, ..., nu_k}.
    # From property (4), we know that span(S_1) = R^d.
    # The union of all supports, U = S_1 U S_2 U ... U S_k, contains S_1.
    # Therefore, the linear span of U must contain the linear span of S_1.
    # This gives the chain of inclusions: R^d = span(S_1) <= span(U).
    # This implies that span(U) must be R^d.

    # 6. Conclusion: The condition for guaranteed transience holds for ANY valid
    # choice of measures, and this is true for ANY number of measures k >= 1.
    # The question asks for the maximal such k. Since the condition holds for all
    # positive integers k, there is no finite maximum.

    print("The problem's constraints, particularly the 'genuinely d-dimensional' property applied to each measure, dictate the outcome.")
    print("This property ensures that for any k >= 1 and any valid choice of measures, the union of their supports always spans the entire space R^d.")
    print("This implies the walk is always transient, regardless of the control strategy.")
    print("Thus, the statement holds for all k, and the maximal value is not finite.")
