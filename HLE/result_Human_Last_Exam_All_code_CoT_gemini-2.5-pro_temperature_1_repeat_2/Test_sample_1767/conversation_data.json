    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the core physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant that describes the bulk properties of a 2D material. A key property of topological invariants like the Chern number is their additivity.\n2.  **Formulate the rule:** When two topological systems are combined (either by stacking or joining laterally with negligible interaction barriers), the Chern number of the resulting composite system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems.\n3.  **Define the variables:**\n    *   Let `C1` be the Chern number of the first insulator.\n    *   Let `C2` be the Chern number of the second insulator.\n    *   Let `C_total` be the Chern number of the combined system (the junction).\n4.  **Apply the rule:** Calculate `C_total = C1 + C2`.\n5.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will define the values for `C1` and `C2`, calculate the sum, and print an explanation along with the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_junction_chern_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators.\n\n    The Chern number is an additive topological invariant.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
