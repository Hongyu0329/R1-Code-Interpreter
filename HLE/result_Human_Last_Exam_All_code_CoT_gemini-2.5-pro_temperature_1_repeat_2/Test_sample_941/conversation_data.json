    "My plan is to first create a data structure, such as a dictionary, in Python to hold information about the training methodologies of the listed ballet schools. Specifically, I will focus on their approach to using pointe shoes during barre exercises. Then, I will write a script to iterate through this data, evaluate each school's method against the question's criteria, and print an explanation for each. The script will identify the school that is most known for having dancers train on the barre predominantly with pointe shoes and will print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the training methods of several famous ballet schools\n    to determine which one is known for extensive use of pointe shoes at the barre.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following ballet schools are female dancers known to train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes?\"\n\n    schools_info = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"pointe_method\": \"Follows traditional methods (like Cecchetti) where barre is conducted in soft shoes to warm up before pointe work.\"\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Vaganova\",\n            \"pointe_method\": \"The Vaganova method is systematic, emphasizing a gradual build-up.
