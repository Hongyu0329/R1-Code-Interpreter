    print("A. An increase in tree ring thickness as the tree matures: This is a 'juvenile effect' and is unlikely to be the predominant factor over a 100-year trend.")
    print("B. Periods of drought: Drought causes water stress, which leads to an INCREASE in the 13C ratio. This contradicts the observed trend.")
    print("C. Increased photosynthetic reserves of starch: This is a secondary physiological effect, not a primary driver of a long-term isotopic trend.")
    print("D. Thinning earlywood tree ring proportion: This relates to seasonal variation and is not the main driver of a century-long decline.")
    print("E. Changes in the SE Asia monsoon: The monsoon is the dominant regional climate system. Long-term changes in the monsoon, such as increased precipitation and humidity, would cause trees to take up less 13C, leading to a declining 13C ratio. This is a powerful regional driver.\n")

    print("The primary driver for the decline in 13C in the atmosphere (and thus in tree rings) during this period is the 'Suess Effect' - the burning of fossil fuels, which releases 13C-depleted CO2. While this isn't an option, large-scale climate patterns like the monsoon are linked to these global changes and are the strongest climatic modulators of the signal.\n")
