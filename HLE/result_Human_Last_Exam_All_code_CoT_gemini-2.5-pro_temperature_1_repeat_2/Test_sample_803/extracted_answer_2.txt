The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(Q)`, where `Q` is any abelian group of order `q^m`. These groups are semidirect products `Q ⋊ C₂` where the generator of `C₂` acts on `Q` by sending every element to its inverse.
