    "An HSS (Hierarchical Semi-separable) matrix multiplication algorithm leverages the matrix's structure, which is defined by a hierarchical partitioning of the matrix. To determine the number of submatrices accessed, we need to count the total number of blocks (off-diagonal and diagonal) defined by this structure for a tree of a given depth.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the depth `d` of the HSS tree. For this problem, `d = 4`. The levels of the tree are numbered 0 to 4.\n2.  The partitioning at each non-leaf level `l` (from 0 to `d-1`) creates off-diagonal blocks. At level `l`, there are `2^l` parent nodes, and each partitioning creates 2 off-diagonal blocks. So, we calculate the number of off-diagonal blocks for each level from 0 to 3.\n3.  Sum the off-diagonal blocks from all non-leaf levels to get the total number of off-diagonal submatrices.\n4.  The leaf level of the tree is `d=4`. At this level, the diagonal blocks are not partitioned further. The number of these dense diagonal blocks is `2^d`.\n5.  The total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the off-diagonal blocks and the leaf-level diagonal blocks. This represents the number of distinct structural components in one HSS matrix that are manipulated during the multiplication.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices in an HSS representation of a matrix\n    with a tree of depth 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    depth = 4\n\n    print(\"To solve this, we will count the total number of submatrices (blocks) in the HSS structure for a tree of depth 4.\")\n    print(\"The HSS multiplication algorithm accesses these blocks from the input matrices to compute the result.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe depth of the HSS tree is d = {depth}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the tree has levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
