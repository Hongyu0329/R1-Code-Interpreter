# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement about St. Augustine's "free will".
# Based on historical and philosophical analysis, each statement is evaluated for its accuracy.

# A. Comparison of Augustine to Calvinism on predestination. This is a common scholarly parallel. Correct.

# D. The fusion of philosophy and theology in Augustine. This is a foundational aspect of his work. Correct.
# E. Ã‰tienne Gilson's interpretation of "irresistible grace." This is a standard, nuanced scholarly take, distinguishing Augustine from later Jansenism. Correct.

# The incorrect statement is B.
