    Calculates the minimal number of forward passes for an 8-choice MCQ problem.

    - 4 choices are single-token.
    - 4 choices are multi-token (>1 token).

    The minimal number of passes is found by assuming the multi-token choices
    have their minimum possible length (2) and by using batching to run
    multiple sequences through the model in a single pass.
