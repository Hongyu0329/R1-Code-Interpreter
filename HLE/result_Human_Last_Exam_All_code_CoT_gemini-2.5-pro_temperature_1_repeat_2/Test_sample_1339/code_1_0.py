    # Part (b): Maximum possible derived length of `hat(G)`
    # The notation `G = G_1 \triangleleft G_2 ...` means G_i is a normal subgroup of G_{i+1}.
    # The quotient `G_i / G_{i+1}` requires G_{i+1} to be a normal subgroup of G_i.
    # Both can only be true if G_i = G_{i+1} for all i.
    # The chain ends with `G_n \triangleleft G_{n+1} = {1}`, which implies G_n = {1}.
    # Therefore, G = G_1 = ... = G_n = {1}.
    # The group G is the trivial group.
    # The group `hat(G)` for G={1} is {1} itself.
    # The derived length of the trivial group {1} is 0.
