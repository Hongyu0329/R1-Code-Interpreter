    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. This is a fundamental description of attack graphs and their analysis using graph theory.
    B. Correct. This accurately describes the state explosion problem, a key challenge in attack graph scalability.
    C. Incorrect. While many analysis problems on attack graphs are NP-hard (e.g., finding the optimal set of countermeasures), the generation of the graph itself is generally not considered an NP-hard problem. The core task is reachability, which is solvable in polynomial time with respect to the graph size. The issue is that the graph itself can be exponentially large.
    D. Correct. Real-world systems are dynamic, necessitating incremental updates to keep attack graphs relevant.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs are frequently used as models for formal verification techniques like model checking to prove or disprove security properties.

    The only incorrect statement is C.
