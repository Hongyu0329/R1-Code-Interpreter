    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand functions are equal. Then, we can calculate the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer and producer surplus. This is equivalent to the total area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Q_e, P_e):** We will set the supply equation equal to the demand equation, `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`, and solve for the equilibrium quantity `Q_e` using a numerical solver. The supply function is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`, which sets a lower bound for `Q_e`. After finding `Q_e`, we'll calculate the equilibrium price `P_e` by plugging `Q_e` back into either function.\n\n2.  **Formulate Total Welfare:** Total Welfare (TW) is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS).\n    *   CS is the integral of the demand curve minus `P_e` from 0 to `Q_e`.\n    *   PS is the integral of `P_e` minus the supply curve from the minimum production quantity (`Q_min = 2^(1/3)`) to `Q_e`.\n    *   The combined formula for Total Welfare is:\n        `TW = ∫[from 0 to Q_e] Demand(Q)dQ - ∫[from Q_min to Q_e] Supply(Q)dQ - P_e * Q_min`\n\n3.  **Calculate and Output:** We will use Python with the SciPy library to perform the numerical calculations for the equilibrium point and the integrals. The script will print each calculated value and show how they fit into the final equation to determine the total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_print_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the market equilibrium and total welfare\n    for the given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\n    def demand(q):\n        \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n    def supply(q):\n        \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n        # This function is only defined for q > 2^(1/3)\n        # The solver will keep q in the valid domain using a bracket.\n        return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\n    # Define the equation whose root is the equilibrium quantity\n    def equilibrium_equation(q):\n        \"\"\"Returns Demand(Q) - Supply(Q).
