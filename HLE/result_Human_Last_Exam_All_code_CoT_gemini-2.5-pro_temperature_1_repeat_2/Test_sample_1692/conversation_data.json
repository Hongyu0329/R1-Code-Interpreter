    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the rule and the intermediate state of a one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton (ECA) that produces the given sequence.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** An ECA's evolution is governed by a rule, typically numbered 0-255. This rule dictates the next state of a cell based on its own state and the states of its left and right neighbors. The system uses periodic boundary conditions, meaning the grid wraps around (the neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and vice-versa).\n2.  **Formulate the Problem:** We are given a starting row (`T = 01101001`) and an ending row (`B = 10000111`) after two steps. We need to find the unknown intermediate row (`M = ????????`) and the single ECA rule that governs both transitions: `T -> M` and `M -> B`.\n3.  **Brute-Force Approach:** Since there are only 256 possible rules, I will write a Python script to iterate through every rule from 0 to 255.\n4.  **Verification Steps:** For each rule, the script will:\n    a. Calculate a hypothetical intermediate row (`M_calc`) by applying the rule to the top row `T`.\n    b. Calculate a final row (`B_calc`) by applying the same rule to `M_calc`.\n    c. Compare `B_calc` with the given bottom row `B`.\n5.  **Find the Solution:** If `B_calc` matches `B`, the script has found the correct rule and the corresponding intermediate row. Since the problem asks for the \"only valid solution,\" the script will stop and print this result. The final output will clearly display the solved intermediate row.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton\n    by brute-forcing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row_str = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row_str = \"10000111\"\n    n = len(top_row_str)\n\n    # Convert initial rows to lists of integers for easier processing\n    top_row = [int(c) for c in top_row_str]\n    expected_bottom_row = [int(c) for c in bottom_row_str]\n\n    def apply_rule(input_row, rule_number):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given ECA rule to an input row to generate the next row.\n        \"\"\"\n        # The rule number (0-255) is represented as an 8-bit binary string.\n        # Each bit corresponds to the output for a specific 3-cell neighborhood,\n        # ordered from '111' down to '000'.\n        rule_bits = format(rule_number, '08b')\n        rule_map = {\n            (1, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[0]),\n            (1, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[1]),\n            (1, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[2]),\n            (1, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[3]),\n            (0, 1, 1): int(rule_bits[4]),\n            (0, 1, 0): int(rule_bits[5]),\n            (0, 0, 1): int(rule_bits[6]),\n            (0, 0, 0): int(rule_bits[7]),\n        }\n        \n        output_row = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighborhood with periodic boundary conditions (the grid wraps around)\n            left = input_row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = input_row[i]\n            right = input_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            neighborhood = (left, center, right)\n            \n            # Determine the next state for the cell using the rule map\n            output_row.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n            \n        return output_row\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary cellular automaton rules\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # 1.
