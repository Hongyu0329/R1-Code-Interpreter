    # --- Option A ---
    print("A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k.")
    print("Analysis: This is FALSE.")
    print("Consider the class of grid graphs. The n-by-n grid has a maximum degree of 4, so the degree is bounded.")
    print("The treewidth of an n-by-n grid is n, which is unbounded as n grows.")
    print("However, grid graphs only contain induced cycles of length 4. They do not contain an induced cycle of length k=3 or k=5, for example.")
    print("Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n")

    # --- Option B ---
    print("B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph.")
    print("Analysis: This is NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.")
    print("The famous Grid Minor Theorem states that graphs with sufficiently large treewidth must contain a large grid *minor*.")
    print("For graphs with bounded degree, it is also known they must contain a large grid *subdivision* (a topological grid).")
    print("However, whether they must contain a large grid *subgraph* (an isomorphic copy) is a long-standing open conjecture. Since it is not a proven theorem, it is not something that *must* be true.\n")

    # --- Option C ---
    print("C. C is a family of expander graphs.")
    print("Analysis: This is FALSE.")
    print("A family of graphs is an expander family if their Cheeger constant is bounded below by a positive number.")
    print("Let's again consider the class of n-by-n grid graphs, which fits the properties of C.")
    print("The Cheeger constant h(G) for an n-by-n grid is approximately 2/n. As n increases, h(G) approaches 0.")
    print("Since the Cheeger constant is not bounded away from 0, the family of grid graphs is not an expander family. Thus, C is not necessarily a family of expanders.\n")

    # --- Option D ---
    print("D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k.")
    print("Analysis: This is NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.")
    print("Similar to option B, it is conjectured that any graph with large treewidth and bounded degree must contain a large induced matching. However, this is still an open problem and not a proven theorem.")
    print("Therefore, we cannot conclude that this *must* be true.\n")

    # --- Option E ---
    print("E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size.")
    print("Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("This is a direct and fundamental consequence of the Graph Minors theory by Robertson and Seymour.")
    print("A key theorem states that treewidth and the size of the largest clique minor are polynomially related. Let tw(G) be the treewidth and k(G) be the size of the largest clique minor.")
    print("The relationship ensures that tw(G) is unbounded if and only if k(G) is unbounded.")
    print("The logic is as follows: For any integer k, the theorem guarantees there is a treewidth value W(k) such that any graph with treewidth at least W(k) must contain a K_k (a clique of size k) as a minor.")
    print("Since the class C has unbounded treewidth, for any k, we can find a graph G in C with treewidth greater than W(k). This graph G must contain a K_k minor.")
    print("This holds for any k, meaning the size of clique-minors in C is unbounded.\n")

    print("-" * 20)
    print("Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is E.")
