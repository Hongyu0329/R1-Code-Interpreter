    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large $x$, we will use an asymptotic analysis approach.\n\n**The ODE and Initial Conditions:**\nThe given ODE is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\nwith initial conditions at $x = 0$: $y(0) = 0.00$, $y'(0) = 3.00$, $y''(0) = 2.00$.\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Simplify the ODE for large x:** In the large $x$ regime ($x \\to \\infty$), we analyze the behavior of each term in the equation to find the dominant balance.\n    *   The term $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ diminishes as $x \\to \\infty$, provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$. We will verify this assumption later.\n    *   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is an oscillatory and singular term. When seeking the smooth, long-term trend of the solution, it is common practice to neglect such rapid oscillatory terms, which can be thought of as high-frequency noise superimposed on the main solution.\n    *   This leaves us with the simplified non-linear ODE: $y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$.\n\n2.  **Assume a power-law solution:** We look for an approximate solution of the form $y(x) = A x^n$, which is a common form for asymptotic solutions.\n    *   The derivatives are: $y'(x) = A n x^{n-1}$, $y''(x) = A n (n-1) x^{n-2}$, and $y'''(x) = A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}$.\n\n3.  **Perform dominant balance analysis:** We substitute the power-law form into the simplified ODE:\n    $A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx (A x^n)^4 + (A n x^{n-1})^4$\n    $A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3} \\approx A^4 x^{4n} + A^4 n^4 x^{4n-4}$\n\n    For large $x$, we must balance the most dominant terms.\n    *   On the right-hand side, the term with the higher power of $x$ will dominate. Comparing $x^{4n}$ and $x^{4n-4}$, the term $x^{4n}$ dominates if $4n > 4n-4$, which is always true. Thus, the $y^4$ term dominates over the $y'^4$ term.\n    *   Now, we balance the dominant term on the right-hand side, $A^4 x^{4n}$, with the term on the left-hand side, $A n (n-1) (n-2) x^{n-3}$.\n    *   Equating the powers of $x$: $n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n\n4.  **Verify consistency:**\n    *   Our finding $n=-1$ implies that the solution decays as $x \\to \\infty$. This is consistent with the assumption that the $y^4$ term dominates the $y'^4$ term, as $y \\sim x^{-1}$ implies $y' \\sim x^{-2}$, and thus $y^4 \\sim x^{-4}$ dominates $y'^4 \\sim x^{-8}$ for large $x$.\n    *   Let's also check the term we neglected, $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$. With $y \\sim x^{-1}$, we have $y'' \\sim x^{-3}$. The term is of order $x^{-3}/x^2 = x^{-5}$. The terms we balanced ($y'''$ and $y^4$) are of order $x^{-4}$. Since $x^{-5}$ decays faster than $x^{-4}$, our neglect of this term is justified for large $x$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the coefficient A:** We equate the coefficients of the dominant terms ($y'''$ and $y^4$ for $n=-1$):\n    *   For $n=-1$, $y'''(x) = A(-1)(-2)(-3)x^{-4} = -6Ax^{-4}$.\n    *   $y(x)^4 = (Ax^{-1})^4 = A^4x^{-4}$.\n    *   Setting them equal: $-6Ax^{-4} = A^4x^{-4} \\implies -6A = A^4$.\n    *   This gives $A^4 + 6A = 0$, so $A(A^3+6)=0$. This has a non-trivial solution $A^3 = -6$.\n    *   $A = \\sqrt[3]{-6} \\approx -1.81712$. Rounding to two decimal places, $A \\approx -1.82$.\n\n6.  **Final Expression:** The approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$ in the large $x$ regime is $y(x) = \\frac{-1.82}{x}$. The initial conditions affect the transient behavior but not the final asymptotic form for this type of problem.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final derived expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_ode_asymptotic():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the derivation and prints the approximate analytical solution\n    for the given ODE in the large x regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient A from A^3 = -6\n    A_cubed = -6\n    A = math.copysign(abs(A_cubed)**(1./3.), A_cubed)\n    \n    # Round to two decimal places\n    A_rounded = round(A, 2)\n    \n    # The power of x in the solution\n    n = -1\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The original ODE is y''' = y**4 + y'**4 - y''/(3*x**2 + 2) + 1/(tan(x) + 1).\")\n    print(\"Step 2: For large x, we simplify the equation by neglecting the oscillatory and sub-dominant terms, leading to y''' â‰ˆ y**4.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: Assuming a solution of the form y(x) = A * x**n, we find the dominant balance.\")\n    print(\"Step 4: The balance of powers gives n - 3 = 4n, which solves to n = -1.\")\n    print(\"Step 5: Substituting y(x) = A * x**-1 into y''' = y**4 gives -6*A*x**-4 = A**4*x**-4.\")\n    print(f\"Step 6: This simplifies to A**3 = {A_cubed}.\")\n    print(f\"Step 7: Solving for A gives A = {A:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final approximate analytical expression for y(x) in the large x regime is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with the calculated coefficient\n    # We use a special format to output the equation clearly.\n    equation_string = f\"y(x) = {A_rounded:.2f} / x\"\n    print(equation_string)\n\nsolve_ode_asymptotic()\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = -1.82 / x>>>"
