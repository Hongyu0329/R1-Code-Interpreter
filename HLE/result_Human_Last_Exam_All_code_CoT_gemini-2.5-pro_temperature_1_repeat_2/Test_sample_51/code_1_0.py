    Analyzes a problem in dependent type theory to find an inconsistent axiom.
    The question describes a system with structural recursion and a peculiar
    subterm relation that undermines termination checking.

    The key components are:
    1. Dependent Type Theory with Structural Recursion.
    2. A special subterm relation where:
       - `case` statements are subterms of X if their branches are.
       - Any lambda abstraction `(λ x. f)` is a subterm of any term X.

    Step 1: Analyze the Subterm Relation
    The second rule is extremely permissive. Since `X` is always a subterm of itself,
    the condition "whenever X is a subterm of X" is always true. This means
    *any lambda abstraction is a subterm of any term*.

    Step 2: The Consequence - Non-Terminating Functions
    Structural recursion requires that any recursive call is made on a structurally
    smaller argument (a subterm). The rule above allows us to fool the termination
    checker. We can define a function like this (in pseudo-code):

      define omega(arg : SomeType) : AnyType :=
        omega(λx. x)

    The recursive call is on `(λx. x)`, which, by the given rule, is a subterm of `arg`.
    So, the definition is accepted as a valid structurally recursive function, but it
    clearly runs forever. This allows us to define a non-terminating term `bottom`
    of *any* type.

    Step 3: Path to Inconsistency
    Having a non-terminating term does not, by itself, always lead to logical
    inconsistency (the ability to prove False). To do that, one typically needs to
    construct a paradoxical object, like a proposition `P` that is equivalent to
    its own negation or, more generally, `P -> False`. This is known as Curry's Paradox.

    Step 4: Reviewing the Axioms
    The axioms listed are various principles one might add to type theory. Most are
    relatively safe in many contexts. However, 'Propositional Resizing' is famously
    powerful and can be dangerous. It posits that the universe of all propositions (`Prop`),
    which is "large", can be mapped bijectively to a "small" type within another universe.
    This allows one to treat the entire collection of propositions as data that can be
    manipulated and recursed over. This is a form of "large elimination".

    Step 5: Synthesizing the Paradox
    The inconsistency arises from combining the non-terminating functions with
    propositional resizing. The overall argument is as follows:
    a. Propositional Resizing gives you a type `Code` and an equivalence `decode : Code <-> Prop`.
    b. You can define a function `F` on codes: `F(c) := code(decode(c) -> False)`.
       This function takes a code for a proposition `P` and returns the code for `P -> False`.
    c. Using the non-terminating `omega` function from Step 2, you can construct a
       fixed-point combinator `Y` of type `(Code -> Code) -> Code`. This is the crucial
       step enabled by the weird subterm rule.
    d. You can then find a fixed point for `F`, let's call it `c_bad = Y(F)`. By definition
       of a fixed point, `c_bad` is equal to `F(c_bad)`.
    e. Let `BadProp := decode(c_bad)`. From the fixed-point equation, we get that
       `BadProp` is equivalent to `(BadProp -> False)`.
    f. From this equivalence, a contradiction can be derived in a few lines of logic,
       proving `False` and making the entire system inconsistent.

    Conclusion: The axiom that enables this paradox, in combination with the powerful
    (and non-standard) recursion principle, is Propositional Resizing.
