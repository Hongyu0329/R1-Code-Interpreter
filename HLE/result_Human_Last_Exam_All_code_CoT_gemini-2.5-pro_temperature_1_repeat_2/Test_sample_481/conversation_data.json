    "Based on publicly available drug information, the numerical imprint on the Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsule is \"3107\" and the imprint on the 20mg capsule is \"3108\".\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Store the two numerical imprints, \"3107\" and \"3108\", in variables.\n2.  Compare these two numbers to find the digits that are different.\n3.  Print a clear statement that shows both full numbers and explicitly states which digits are different, satisfying the prompt's requirement to \"output each number\".\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint on a Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 3107.\nimprint_10mg = \"3107\"\n\n# The numerical imprint on a Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 3108.\nimprint_20mg = \"3108\"\n\n# We will find the numbers that are different between the two imprints.\ndiff_num_1 = ''\ndiff_num_2 = ''\n\n# Iterate through the strings to find the first point of difference.\nfor i in range(len(imprint_10mg)):\n    if imprint_10mg[i] != imprint_20mg[i]:\n        diff_num_1 = imprint_10mg[i]\n        diff_num_2 = imprint_20mg[i]\n        break\n\n# Display the full numbers and the differing digits.\n# The numbers on the capsules are 3107 and 3108.\n# The different numbers are 7 and 8.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg[0]}{imprint_10mg[1]}{imprint_10mg[2]}{imprint_10mg[3]}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg[0]}{imprint_20mg[1]}{imprint_20mg[2]}{imprint_20mg[3]}.\")\nprint(f\"The different numbers are {diff_num_1} and {diff_num_2}.\")\n```\n<<<7 and 8>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
