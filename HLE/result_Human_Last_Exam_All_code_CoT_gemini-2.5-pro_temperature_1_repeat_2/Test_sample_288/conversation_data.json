    "To find the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will use the `neuprint-python` library to query the adult male C. elegans connectome dataset published by Cook et al. (2019).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Connect to the neuPrint database which hosts the connectome data.\n2.  Identify the ASJ neurons, which are a left/right pair: 'ASJL' and 'ASJR'.\n3.  Query for all outgoing synaptic connections from both ASJ neurons.\n4.  Sum the number of synapses (connection 'weight') for each unique postsynaptic cell.\n5.  Identify the postsynaptic cell that receives the highest total number of synapses. This will be our main target.\n6.  To show the breakdown, I will display how many synapses this target cell receives from ASJL and ASJR individually.\n\nThis will give us the single cell that is the largest recipient of ASJ synapses.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom neuprint import Client\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main projection target of ASJ axons in the C. elegans\n    adult male connectome by synapse number.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # It is recommended to have your neuprint token stored in a file\n        # and the path to that file set as the NEUPRINT_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\n        # environment variable.\n        # See: https://connectome-neuprint.github.io/neuprint-python/docs/quickstart.html\n        c = Client('neuprint.janelia.org', dataset='c-elegans-male')\n        c.fetch_version()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to connect to neuPrint server.
