    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the key historical figure who addressed this specific theological problem.\n2.  The question asks for the theologian who *first* developed *specialized terminology* for changes in natural law, applying it to both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall.\n3.  My research points to Augustine of Hippo, who lived much earlier than other key thinkers like Thomas Aquinas.\n4.  Augustine's specialized terminology centers on the concept of *rationes seminales*, or \"seminal reasons.\" He argued that God embedded the potential for all future events, including miracles and changes, into the initial creation.\n5.  Therefore, a miracle is not a violation of nature, but the activation of a potential that was always present within nature's created order.\n6.  I will then create a Python script that prints this answer clearly and concisely.\n\n```python\ndef print_theologian_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the theologian who developed terminology\n    to explain changes in the laws of nature.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    key_concept = \"rationes seminales\"\n    \n    answer_text = (\n        f\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes \"\n        f\"in the laws of nature was {theologian_name}.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"He used the term '{key_concept}' (Latin for 'seminal reasons') to propose that God \"\n        f\"implanted the latent potentials for all future events into the original creation. \"\n        f\"Therefore, miracles like the virgin birth or changes in nature after the Fall were not \"\n        f\"violations of the created order, but rather the divinely-timed activation of these \"\n        f\"hidden potentials.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(answer_text)\n\nprint_theologian_answer()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
