# Step 1: Define variables based on the problem description.
# Let b4 be the number of black vertices of degree 4.
# Let w4 be the number of white vertices of degree 4.
# Let b3 be the number of black vertices of degree 3.
# Let w3 be the number of white vertices of degree 3.
# The graph is 2-colorable (bipartite) with partitions B (black) and W (white).

# Step 2: Analyze the edge coloring rules.
# Edges are colored red or blue.
# - At degree-3 vertices, all incident edges have the same color.
#   Let b3_R and b3_B be the number of black degree-3 vertices with all red and all blue edges.
#   Let w3_R and w3_B be the number of white degree-3 vertices with all red and all blue edges.
# - At degree-4 vertices, incident edges alternate in color, so each has 2 red and 2 blue edges.

# Step 3: Consider the subgraph G_R consisting of only the red edges.
# The degree of a vertex v in G_R, denoted deg_R(v), is as follows:
# - If v is a degree-4 vertex in G (black or white), it has 2 red edges, so deg_R(v) = 2.
# - If v is a degree-3 vertex of type b3_R or w3_R, it has 3 red edges, so deg_R(v) = 3.
# - If v is a degree-3 vertex of type b3_B or w3_B, it has 0 red edges, so deg_R(v) = 0.

# Step 4: Apply two fundamental graph theory properties to G_R.

# Property 1: The sum of degrees in any graph is an even number.
# Sum of degrees in G_R = (2 * b4) + (2 * w4) + (3 * b3_R) + (3 * w3_R)
# This sum must be even. Since (2 * b4 + 2 * w4) is even, (3 * b3_R + 3 * w3_R) must also be even.
# This means 3 * (b3_R + w3_R) is even. As 3 is odd, it implies that (b3_R + w3_R) must be an even number.

# Property 2: G is bipartite, so G_R is also bipartite on the same partitions B and W.
# In a bipartite graph, the sum of degrees of vertices in one partition equals the sum of degrees in the other.
# Sum of degrees in B for G_R = (2 * b4) + (3 * b3_R)
# Sum of degrees in W for G_R = (2 * w4) + (3 * w3_R)
# Therefore, these two sums must be equal:
# 2 * b4 + 3 * b3_R = 2 * w4 + 3 * w3_R

# Step 5: Combine the results to find a constraint on (b4 - w4).
# Rearrange the equation from Property 2:
# 2 * b4 - 2 * w4 = 3 * w3_R - 3 * b3_R
# 2 * (b4 - w4) = 3 * (w3_R - b3_R)

# From Property 1, we know (b3_R + w3_R) is even.
# If two numbers sum to an even number, they must have the same parity (both even or both odd).
# Therefore, their difference (w3_R - b3_R) must also be an even number.
# We can write (w3_R - b3_R) = 2k for some integer k.

# Step 6: Substitute this back into our equation.
# 2 * (b4 - w4) = 3 * (2k)
# This simplifies to the final equation by dividing both sides by 2.
# b4 - w4 = 3 * k

# Step 7: Final conclusion.
# The equation `b4 - w4 = 3k` shows that the difference (b4 - w4) must be an integer multiple of 3.
# The problem states that b4 is strictly greater than w4, so (b4 - w4) must be a positive integer.
# The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 3 is obtained by setting k=1.
