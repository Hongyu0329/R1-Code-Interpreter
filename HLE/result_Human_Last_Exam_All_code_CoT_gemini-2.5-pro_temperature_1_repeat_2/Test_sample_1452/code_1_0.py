# The scientist in question is Max Born.
scientist_name = "Max Born"

# His most famous contribution is the Born rule, which provides a probabilistic
# interpretation of the wave function (Ψ) in quantum mechanics.
# The rule states that the probability density of finding a particle
# is proportional to the square of the modulus of the wave function.

# Define the components of the equation: |Ψ|²
