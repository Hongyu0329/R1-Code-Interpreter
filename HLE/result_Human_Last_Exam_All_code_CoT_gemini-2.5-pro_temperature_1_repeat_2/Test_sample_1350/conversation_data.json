    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who describes seeing the Roman founding myth is Thiodolf, the chieftain of the Wolfings. He recounts his time fostered among the Romans and specifically mentions seeing an image of a she-wolf suckling two infant boys in a Roman city, a clear reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python script:\n1.  Define a variable to hold the name of the character.\n2.  Use the `print()` function to display the name of the character as the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\n# This script will identify and print the name of the character from\n# William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes the\n# Roman founding myth.\n\n# The character is Thiodolf, the chieftain of the Wolfings. In the book,\n# he recounts his experiences living among the Romans and seeing the\n# image of the she-wolf and the twins (Romulus and Remus).\ncharacter_name = \"Thiodolf\"\n\nprint(f\"The character is: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
