    "To solve this problem and determine the memory usage of the most memory-efficient C program, we need to devise a strategy that minimizes the amount of data stored in variables.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** The core task is a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of equal length. The comparison can stop as soon as the first differing pair of characters is found.\n2.  **Standard Approach vs. Memory-Efficient Approach:**\n    *   A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays (buffers). For strings up to 100 characters long, this would require `char str1[101];` and `char str2[101];`, plus loop variables. This would use over 200 bytes.\n    *   To be more memory-efficient, we must avoid storing both strings if possible. Since standard input is a sequential stream, we must read the first string entirely before we can start reading the second. Therefore, we have to store the first string. However, we do not need to store the second string in its entirety. We can read it character by character and perform the comparison on the fly.\n3.  **Designing the Memory-Efficient Program:**\n    *   We will declare one character array (buffer) to store the first string.\n    *   We will then loop, reading one character at a time from the second string using `getchar()`.\n    *   Inside the loop, we will compare the character from the second string with the corresponding character from our stored first string.\n    *   We need an index variable to keep track of our position in the first string.\n4.  **Calculating Memory Usage for Variables:**\n    Let's identify the necessary variables for this memory-efficient C program and calculate their size in bytes. We assume a standard modern 32-bit or 64-bit architecture where `sizeof(char)` is 1 and `sizeof(int)` is 4.\n\n    *   **First String Buffer:** To store the first string, which can be up to 100 characters long. In C, a string requires a null terminator (`\\0`).\n        *   `char str1[101];`\n        *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **Loop Index:** To iterate through the `str1` buffer as we read characters from the second string. The maximum length is 100, so the index will go from 0 to 99. A `char` type is sufficient to store this value.\n        *   `char i;`\n        *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 * 1 = **1 byte**.\n    *   **Second String Character:** To hold each character of the second string as we read it from input. The standard C function `getchar()` returns an `int` type, not a `char`. This is crucial because it needs to be able to return every possible character value as well as a special non-character value, `EOF` (End of File).\n        *   `int c2;`\n        *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int)` = 1 * 4 = **4 bytes**.\n\n5.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    The total memory `m` used for variables is the sum of the sizes of the variables listed above.\n\n    m = (memory for `str1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\n    m = 101 + 1 + 4\n    m = 106 bytes\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because it stores the absolute minimum data required to solve the problem correctly: one full string and one character at a time from the second, plus a small index.\n\n<<<106>>>"
