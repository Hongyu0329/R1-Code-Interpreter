# Define the number of bases in the genetic code.
num_bases = 8

# For each of the 8 bases (x from 0 to 7), the condition for success is that
# the count of that base, c_x, does not equal x when taken modulo 8.
# As n approaches infinity, the probability of c_x mod 8 taking any specific
# value from 0 to 7 is 1/8.
# Therefore, the probability of the failure condition for a single base x (c_x mod 8 = x)
# is 1/8.
prob_failure_per_base = 1 / num_bases

# The probability of the success condition for a single base x (c_x mod 8 != x)
# is 1 - (1/8).
prob_success_per_base = 1 - prob_failure_per_base

# The limiting probability P(n) is the probability that this success condition holds
# for all 8 bases simultaneously. By taking the long-term average, we can treat these
# events as independent.
limiting_probability = prob_success_per_base ** num_bases

# Calculate the numerator and denominator for the final equation
numerator = 7**8
denominator = 8**8
