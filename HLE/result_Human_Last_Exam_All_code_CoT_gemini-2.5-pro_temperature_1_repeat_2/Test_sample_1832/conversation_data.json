    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Spacetime Geometry:** The problem describes the empty space outside a spherically symmetric body. In General Relativity, this is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **State the Metric:** In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$. Specifically:\n    *   $g_{00}$ and $g_{11}$ depend on $r$.\n    *   $g_{22}$ depends on $r$.\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    The metric is independent of time $t$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\n3.  **Use the Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the derivatives of the metric tensor:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n4.  **Count Non-Zero Components:** Instead of calculating the exact value of each of the $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ symbols, we can determine which ones must be non-zero based on the properties of the metric. A symbol can be non-zero only if it involves derivatives with respect to $r$ or $\\theta$. By systematically analyzing the indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$, we can find all the non-zero components.\n5.  **Develop a Script:** I will write a Python script that encodes this analytical result. The script will list the unique non-zero symbols and then calculate the total count, accounting for the symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. It will also provide a breakdown of the count for each upper index $\\rho$ and print the final summation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef count_schwarzschild_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n    The spacetime is described by coordinates (t, r, theta, phi), indexed 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    The metric is diagonal, and its components' dependencies are known. This allows \n    us to determine which Christoffel symbols are non-zero without computing \n    their exact values.\n\n    This script is based on the analytical derivation of the non-zero symbols.\n    We list the unique non-zero symbols (using the convention mu <= nu)\n    and then count the total, accounting for symmetry (Gamma^rho_mu_nu = Gamma^rho_nu_mu).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of unique non-zero Christoffel symbols identified by (rho, mu, nu)\n    # where mu <= nu.
