    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Syllables and Vowel Quantities**: I will break the line down into its constituent syllables and determine if each vowel is naturally long or short.\n2.  **Apply Rules of Position**: A syllable is \"long by position\" if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants, regardless of the vowel's natural length.\n3.  **Resolve Elisions**: When a word ends in a vowel, `-m`, or a diphthong and the next word begins with a vowel or `h`, the first word's final syllable is typically elided (dropped). This line has several elisions that condense it.\n4.  **Group into Feet**: I will group the resulting long (`—`) and short (`∪`) syllables into six metrical feet. The first four feet can be dactyls (`D`, `— ∪ ∪`) or spondees (`S`, `— —`). The fifth foot is usually a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n5.  **Assemble the Final Scansion**: Combine the types for all six feet to get the final pattern. This particular line is a famous example of a \"spondaic line,\" where the fifth foot is a spondee, used for a heavy, solemn effect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the scansion is as follows:\n*   **Foot 1**: `verum ubi e-` (with elisions `ver(um) ub(i)`) -> `vē-r' u-b' e-` -> `— ∪ ∪` -> **Dactyl (D)**\n*   **Foot 2**: `equi atque hominis` (with elisions `equ(i) atqu(e)`) -> `-qu' at-qu' ho-mi-` -> `— ∪ ∪` -> **Dactyl (D)**\n*   **Foot 3**: `-nis casu` -> `-nis cā-` -> `— —` -> **Spondee (S)**\n*   **Foot 4**: `-su convenit` -> `-sū con-` -> `— —` -> **Spondee (S)**\n*   **Foot 5**: `convenit` -> `-vē-nit` -> `— —` -> **Spondee (S)**\n*   **Foot 6**: `imago` -> `-mā-gō` -> `— —` -> **Spondee (S)**\n\nThe following Python code will print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of a given Latin hexameter line.\n    The scansion represents dactyls as 'D' and spondees as 'S'.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    # The scansion for this line is Dactyl-Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee\n    scansion_feet = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"S\", \"S\"]\n    \n    print(f\"Latin line: {line}\")\n    \n    # Print the final scansion, showing each foot's type\n    final_scansion = \" - \".join(scansion_feet)\n    print(f\"Scansion: {final_scansion}\")\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D - D - S - S - S - S>>>"
