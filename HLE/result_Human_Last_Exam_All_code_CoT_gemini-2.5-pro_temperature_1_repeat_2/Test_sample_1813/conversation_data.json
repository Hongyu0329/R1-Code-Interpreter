    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to identify the corresponding quadratic irrationality.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Associated Quadratic Equation:** For a generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\), the associated quadratic irrationality is the larger root of the equation:\n    \\[ qx^2 - (3q - p)x - q = 0 \\]\n    We will substitute \\( p=4 \\) and \\( q=7 \\) into this equation.\n\n2.  **Find the Larger Root:** We will solve the resulting quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to find its larger root. This root will be of the form \\( \\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q} \\).\n\n3.  **Compute the Continued Fraction:** We will use the standard algorithm for computing the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number. The algorithm proceeds by generating a sequence of integers \\( a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\) where:\n    *   \\( \\xi_0 = \\frac{P + \\sqrt{D}}{Q} \\)\n    *   \\( a_k = \\lfloor \\xi_k \\rfloor \\)\n    *   \\( \\xi_{k+1} = \\frac{1}{\\xi_k - a_k} \\)\n    Since the number is a quadratic irrationality, its continued fraction will be periodic. We will detect the repeating block of coefficients.\n\n4.  **Present the Result:** The Python code will perform these calculations and print the quadratic equation, its root, and the final sequence of coefficients that form the continued fraction.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_continued_fraction(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n\n    This is the continued fraction of the larger root of the equation:\n    q*x^2 - (3*q - p)*x - q = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
