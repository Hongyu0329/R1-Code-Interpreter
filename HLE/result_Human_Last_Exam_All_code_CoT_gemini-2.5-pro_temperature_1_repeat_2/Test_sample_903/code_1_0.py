    # Step 2: Analyze the ligand's donor atoms
    # "Di-" means two arms.
    # Each arm has a (2'-pyridyl) group (1 N donor) and a pyrazolyl group (1 N donor).
    # The pyrazol-1-yl indicates N1 is for linkage, so N2 is the donor.

    # Step 4: Determine the most likely coordination sphere
    # The 4 N atoms from the tetradentate ligand will coordinate to the Zn(II) ion.
    # Zn(II) commonly adopts a 6-coordinate geometry. The two bromide ions
    # can act as ligands to fill the remaining two coordination sites,
    # forming a stable, neutral complex [Zn(Ligand)Br2].
    # This is a common outcome for such reactions.
