    print("1. Consider all Python programs with source code less than 10000 characters.")
    print("2. From those that halt and return an integer, find the largest integer returned. Let's call it `Huge_int`.")
    print("3. The function should return `Huge_int + 1`.")
    print("\n--- The Question: Can a program `P` exist to compute this? ---")
    print("Let's use a proof by contradiction to find the answer.")
    print("\nStep 1: Assume such a program `P` exists.")
    print("Let's assume we can write a program, `P`, that successfully computes `def_superfast(10000)`.")
    print("This program `P` will produce a final number. Let's call it `Result`.")
    print("According to the definition, this means: Result = Huge_int + 1")
    print("\nStep 2: Consider the program `P` itself.")
    print("`P` is a Python program. We can certainly write its source code to be shorter than 10000 characters.")
    print("This means `P` meets the criteria from step 1 of the function's definition.")
    print("\nStep 3: The Contradiction.")
    print("Because `P` is one of the programs being considered by the function, its output (`Result`) must be included when finding the maximum.")
    print("By the definition of `Huge_int` (the largest integer returned by any such program), the output of `P` cannot be larger than `Huge_int`.")
    print("Therefore, it must be true that: Result <= Huge_int")
    print("\nStep 4: The Paradoxical Equation.")
    print("We have two conflicting statements derived from our assumption:")
    print("  1. From the function's definition: Result = Huge_int + 1")
    print("  2. From analyzing `P` itself:      Result <= Huge_int")
    print("\nIf we substitute the first statement into the second, we get the final equation:")
    print("   Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int")
    print("\nThis statement is a mathematical impossibility. A number cannot be smaller than itself plus one.")
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Our initial assumption in Step 1 must be false. The contradiction proves that no program `P` can compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")
    print("This is because the function is uncomputable, a concept related to the Halting Problem in computer science.")
