    "Of course. Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user is asking for the smallest number of \"composants\" in an \"indecomposable continuum\". They specify \"composants, not components\" and \"indecomposable (not necessarily metric)\". The final answer should be delivered via a Python or shell script that prints the result and reasoning, including the numbers involved in any \"equation\".\n\n2.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff topological space.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum `X` that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum `K` is proper if `K` is a continuum and `K ≠ X`).\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain the point `p`. Two points are in the same composant if they are both contained within some proper subcontinuum. The set of all composants of `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n\n3.  **Initial Analysis & Lower Bound:**\n    *   First, consider a decomposable continuum, like a line segment `[0,1]`. It has only one composant: the segment itself. This is because for any point `p`, the union of all proper subcontinua containing `p` eventually covers the entire segment.\n    *   Now, consider an indecomposable continuum `X`. A fundamental theorem in continuum theory states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if at least one of its composants is the entire space `X`.\n    *   Therefore, for an indecomposable continuum, *every* composant must be a proper subset of the space (`C(p) ≠ X` for all `p`).\n    *   Since the composants partition the space `X`, and no single composant can be all of `X`, there must be more than one composant.\n    *   This establishes a lower bound: the number of composants must be strictly greater than 1. The smallest possible integer would be 2.\n\n4.  **Investigate Standard Examples and Theorems:**\n    *   Most common examples of indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc, the solenoid, or the Knaster bucket-handle continuum) are metric spaces.\n    *   For these spaces, a very strong theorem (due to Mazurkiewicz) applies: any separable indecomposable continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. This is an uncountable number. The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem.\n    *   This might lead one to believe the answer is `c` or \"uncountable\".\n\n5.  **Address the \"Not Necessarily Metric\" Clause:**\n    *   The user's specific instruction \"not necessarily metric\" is a crucial hint. The theorem mentioned above is for *separable* continua (which all metric continua are). The question becomes: does a non-separable indecomposable continuum exist that violates this theorem and has a smaller, finite number of composants?\n    *   For a long time, this was an open question. However, a specific (and highly non-trivial) construction of a non-separable indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants was published by D. P. Bellamy in 1994.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   From step 3, we know the number must be greater than 1.\n    *   From step 5, we know that an example with exactly 2 composants exists.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants is 2.\n\n7.  **Construct the Code:**\n    *   The task requires a Python script. The script can't \"compute\" this answer, as it's a fact from a deep mathematical proof.\n    *   The script's purpose will be to explain the reasoning clearly using `print` statements, as requested.\n    *   I will structure the output to follow the logic: define the lower bound, mention the common (but misleading) case, and present the correct answer based on the more obscure counterexample.\n    *   To satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" constraint, I will explicitly print the numbers `1` and `2` as part of the logical deduction.\n\nThis plan leads directly to the Python code below, which explains the logic and provides the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_composants_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest number of composants\n    in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing a lower bound.\")\n    print(\"Let N be the number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem states that a continuum is indecomposable if and only if all of its composants are proper subsets of the space.\")\n    print(\"Since the composants must cover the entire space, and no single one can be the whole space, there must be more than one.\")\n    print(\"This gives us the inequality: N > 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Considering the possibilities.\")\n    print(\"For all standard (separable metric) indecomposable continua, like the pseudo-arc or solenoid, the number of composants is known to be 'c', the cardinality of the continuum, which is uncountable.\")\n    print(\"This might suggest that no finite number is possible.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Finding the minimum possible number.\")\n    print(\"However, the question allows for non-metric continua. While very exotic, a non-separable indecomposable continuum has been constructed that has exactly 2 composants.\")\n    print(\"Since N must be greater than 1, and a valid example with N = 2 exists, the smallest possible number is 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Final Conclusion:\")\n    final_number = 2\n    print(f\"The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is {final_number}.\")\n\nsolve_composants_question()\n\n# The final answer is derived from the fact that the number must be greater than 1,\n# and a specific construction proves that 2 is achievable.\n# So, the smallest number is 2.\nsys.stdout.flush()\nprint(\"<<<2>>>\")\n```"
