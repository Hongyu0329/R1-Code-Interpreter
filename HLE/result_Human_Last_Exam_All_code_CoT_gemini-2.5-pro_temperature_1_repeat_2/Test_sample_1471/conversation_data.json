    "Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Roman Numerals**: The equation contains three Roman numerals: `VIII`, `CCC`, and `CCXCVIII`.\n2.  **Convert to Modern Numbers**: I will convert each Roman numeral into its corresponding modern (Arabic) number.\n    *   `VIII` = 8\n    *   `CCC` = 300\n    *   `CCXCVIII` = 298\n3.  **Formulate the Equation**: I will substitute the modern numbers back into the equation, which becomes `8 / 300 - 298`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: I will solve the equation following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that automates this process. The script will:\n    *   Include a function to handle the Roman to modern number conversion.\n    *   Process the input numerals.\n    *   Perform the calculation.\n    *   Print the final equation with the modern numbers and the solution, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check for subtractive notation (e.g., IV, IX, XL)\n        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i+1]]:\n            result += roman_map[s[i+1]] - roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 2\n        else:\n            result += roman_map[s[i]]\n            i += 1\n    return result\n\n# The Roman numerals from the equation\nroman_num1 = \"VIII\"\nroman_num2 = \"CCC\"\nroman_num3 = \"CCXCVIII\"\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern integers\nnum1 = roman_to_int(roman_num1)\nnum2 = roman_to_int(roman_num2)\nnum3 = roman_to_int(roman_num3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\n# Equation: num1 / num2 - num3\nsolution = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {solution}\")\n\n```\n<<<-297.9733333333333>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
