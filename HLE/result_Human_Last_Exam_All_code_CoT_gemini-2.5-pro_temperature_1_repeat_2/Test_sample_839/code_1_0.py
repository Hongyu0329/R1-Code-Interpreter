    The question asks how the dissolution of ammonium sulfate aerosol particles enables the sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction, which typically requires an external energy source. This points towards a catalytic mechanism occurring at the particle's surface.

    1.  **The Environment:** The surface of a deliquescing (dissolving) aerosol particle is a unique air-water interface, not a simple bulk solution.
    2.  **The Mechanism:** At this interface, ions arrange themselves differently than they would in a well-mixed solution. Specifically, ammonium (NH₄⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions form specific arrangements or 'ion pairs'.
    3.  **Catalysis:** These ordered surface arrangements act as transient complexes. By bringing the reactants into a favorable orientation and electronic configuration, these complexes stabilize the reaction's transition state.
    4.  **Lowering the Energy Barrier:** Stabilizing the transition state is equivalent to lowering the reaction's activation energy barrier. This allows the reaction, which is normally energetically unfavorable, to proceed without the need for additional external energy.

    Choice E, "It alters surface ion pairing, forming transient complexes that lower the reaction energy barrier," most accurately and specifically describes this catalytic process.
