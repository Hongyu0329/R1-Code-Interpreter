    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** The crucial information is the set of weights for the ambient projective space, which are given as $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree:** For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree, `d`, must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space. We calculate this sum.\n    $d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *(Note: The provided polynomial equation contains a term, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, with a weighted degree of 224, while all other terms have a degree of 225. This is likely a typo in the problem statement. As the problem specifies it is a Calabi-Yau link, we proceed by enforcing the Calabi-Yau condition, $d = \\sum w_i = 225$.)*\n\n3.  **Apply the Crawley-Nordström Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant, $c_N$, for a quasi-smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurface is calculated using the formula:\n    $c_N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} (d - w_i)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} w_i}$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We will substitute the values of `d` and the weights `w` into the formula and compute the result. This involves calculating the product of the terms in the numerator and the product of the terms in the denominator, followed by their division.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient projective space\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' is the sum of the weights.\n    # This is a necessary condition for the variety to be Calabi-Yau.\n    degree = sum(weights)\n\n    # Numerator terms of the formula: (d - w_i)\n    numerator_terms = [(degree - w) for w in weights]\n\n    # Denominator terms of the formula: w_i\n    denominator_terms = weights\n\n    # Calculate the products for the numerator and the denominator\n    numerator = math.prod(numerator_terms)\n    denominator = math.prod(denominator_terms)\n\n    # The invariant is the integer result of the division\n    invariant = numerator // denominator\n\n    # Display the full calculation as requested\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"c_N = product(d - w_i) / product(w_i)\")\n    print(f\"\\nGiven weights w = {weights}\")\n    print(f\"The degree d = sum(w) = {' + '.join(map(str, weights))} = {degree}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nPlugging these values into the formula:\")\n    \n    # Building the string for the equation with numbers\n    num_display_1 = ' * '.join([f\"({degree} - {w})\" for w in weights])\n    num_display_2 = ' * '.join(map(str, numerator_terms))\n    den_display = ' * '.join(map(str, denominator_terms))\n    \n    print(f\"c_N = ( {num_display_1} ) / ( {den_display} )\")\n    print(f\"c_N = ( {num_display_2} ) / ( {den_display} )\")\n    print(f\"c_N = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"c_N = {invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom()\n<<<1568>>>"
