The patient has undergone heart valve surgery. A primary and severe risk following this procedure is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) on the new valve. These clots can lead to life-threatening thrombotic events, such as a stroke.

Therefore, the most critical action to prevent this specific adverse complication is to administer medication that prevents clotting.

Let's evaluate the options:
- A, F: Inappropriate. Prophylactic treatment is required, not just symptomatic.
- B, C, D, E, H, G: These are all important parts of a recovery plan but do not address the immediate, high-risk of thromboembolism.
- J: Prescribing anticoagulant medication is the standard of care and the most direct way to prevent thrombotic events after heart valve surgery.

The correct course of action is to prescribe anticoagulants.
