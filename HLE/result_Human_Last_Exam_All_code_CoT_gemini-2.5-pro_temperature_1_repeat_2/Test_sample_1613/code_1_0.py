# Step 1: Define the number of trees that can block the view to E.
# These are the trees A, B, C, and D.
num_choices_for_E_blocker = 4

# Step 2: Define the number of trees that can block the view to F.
# The blocker for F must be different from the blocker for E.
# So, after choosing one tree to block E, there are 3 remaining choices.
num_choices_for_F_blocker = 3

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of possible combinations.
# This is the number of ordered pairs of distinct trees from the set {A, B, C, D}.
# It is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each position in the pair.
max_children = num_choices_for_E_blocker * num_choices_for_F_blocker

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
print(f"The maximum number of children is the number of ways to choose an ordered pair of distinct trees from 4, which is:")
print(f"{num_choices_for_E_blocker} * {num_choices_for_F_blocker} = {max_children}")
