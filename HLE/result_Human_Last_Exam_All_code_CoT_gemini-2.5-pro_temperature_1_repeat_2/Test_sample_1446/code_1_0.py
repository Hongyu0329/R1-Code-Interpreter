# In the context of a G₄ (or φ⁴) theory, the upper critical dimension is d=4.
# For d>=4, the critical exponents are given by their mean-field theory values.

# The mean-field value for the critical exponent ν is given by the equation ν = 1/2.
# We will define the numbers in this equation to perform the calculation.

numerator = 1
denominator = 2

# Calculate the precise value of ν
nu_value = numerator / denominator

# As requested, we will output the final equation showing each number.
