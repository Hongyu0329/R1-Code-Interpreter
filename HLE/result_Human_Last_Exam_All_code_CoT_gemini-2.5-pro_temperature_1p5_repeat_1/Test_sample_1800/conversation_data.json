    "Based on a review of scientific literature, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is determined experimentally to optimize the catalyst's properties. A low nickel content is generally preferred to ensure high dispersion, prevent the sintering of Ni particles at high temperatures, and maximize the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) with the ceria support. This interaction is crucial for the high catalytic activity in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that reports this experimentally-determined optimal ratio. The script will:\n1.  Define the atomic parts of Nickel (Ni) and Cerium (Ce) that represent an ideal ratio found in many studies.\n2.  Calculate the decimal value of this ratio.\n3.  Print a detailed explanation of why this ratio is considered optimal, referencing the underlying chemical principles.\n4.  Clearly display the numbers that make up the ratio, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_optimal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the experimentally-determined ideal Ni/Ce ratio\n    for Ni-Ceria catalysts based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on numerous experimental studies, a well-cited optimal atomic ratio\n    # that balances activity and stability is approximately 1 part Ni to 9 parts Ce.\n    ni_parts = 1\n    ce_parts = 9\n    \n    # Calculate the decimal representation of the ratio\n    decimal_ratio = ni_parts / ce_parts\n    \n    # Print the explanation and results\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is determined through experimental research, not a simple calculation.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to maximize the dispersion of active Ni sites and the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) with the Ceria (CeO2) support.\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on scientific literature, a frequently cited optimal atomic ratio is:\")\n    \n    # Per the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    print(f\"Ni : Ce = {ni_parts} : {ce_parts}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to a decimal ratio of Ni/Ce = {decimal_ratio:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis composition ensures that Ni is highly dispersed as small nanoparticles or even single atoms on the ceria surface, which is crucial for maximizing catalytic activity and stability in the Water Gas Shift and water splitting reactions.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_optimal_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.11>>>"
