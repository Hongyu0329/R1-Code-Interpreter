    print("This indicates that the amygdala neurons in alcohol-preferring rats show a stronger, more synchronous response to stimulation. This is interpreted as *increased* evoked neuronal activity/excitability.\n")

    print("Step 3: Connecting the experiments.")
    print(f"Knocking down '{gene_knockdown}' in sucrose-preferring rats resulted in a PS amplitude of {ps_shRNA_knockdown} mV.")
    print(f"This value is almost identical to the PS amplitude of alcohol-preferring rats ({ps_alcohol_preferring} mV).")
    print("This strongly implies that the neurobiological state of alcohol-preferring rats is phenocopied by the knockdown, meaning they likely also have higher extracellular GABA levels.\n")

    print("Step 4: Deducing the mechanism and therapeutic approach.")
    print(" - Higher extracellular GABA causes *increased tonic inhibition* in the amygdala.")
    print(" - The increased PS (evoked activity) is likely due to disinhibition: the tonic GABA preferentially silences inhibitory interneurons, making principal neurons more excitable.")

    print('  - "The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats." -> TRUE (inferred from the knockdown experiment).')
    print('  - "Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala..." -> TRUE (result of higher extracellular GABA).')
