    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: First, we analyze the given polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ to see if it can be simplified.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: We'll determine the Galois group for each factor over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of the splitting field of $P(x)$ will be the (direct) product of the Galois groups of its irreducible factors, provided the intersection of their splitting fields is just $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Apply Galois Theory**: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a correspondence between subfields of the splitting field $K$ and subgroups of its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. Normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G$.\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups**: We will list all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of the Galois group $G$.\n5.  **Calculate Degrees**: The degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the index of its corresponding normal subgroup $H$ in $G$, which is calculated as $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$. Collecting all such possible indices gives the set of all possible degrees.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan by first establishing the structure of the Galois group and then programmatically finding the orders of its normal subgroups and calculating their indices to determine the possible degrees.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_field_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the possible degrees of normal field extensions L/Q\n    such that Q < L < K, where K is the splitting field of\n    P(x) = x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6 over Q.\n\n    This function implements the logic derived from Galois theory.\n    1. The polynomial P(x) can be factored by grouping terms:\n       P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2).\n    2. The Galois group of x^2 - 2 over Q is C_2, the cyclic group of order 2.\n    3. The polynomial x^5 - 9x + 3 is irreducible over Q (by Eisenstein's criterion with p=3). It has 3 real roots and 2 complex roots, which implies its Galois group is S_5, the symmetric group on 5 elements (order 120).\n    4. The splitting fields of these two factors only intersect at Q. Therefore, the Galois group G of P(x) is the direct product G = S_5 x C_2.\n    5. The order of G is |S_5| * |C_2| = 120 * 2 = 240.\n    6. Normal subfields L correspond to normal subgroups H of G. The degree of the\n       extension L/Q is the index of the subgroup H in G, which is |G|/|H|.\n    7.
