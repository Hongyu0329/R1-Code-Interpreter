    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the minimum radius of a larger circle (`R`) that can contain a given number (`N`) of smaller, equal-sized circles (with radius `r`).\n\nFor `N=14`, the problem is particularly complex. The optimal arrangement of the 14 smaller circles is not a simple, symmetrical pattern, and its radius cannot be derived from a straightforward geometric formula. The solution has been found using numerical optimization methods and confirmed with computer-assisted proofs.\n\nMy plan is to solve this problem by:\n1.  Using the established, proven value for the packing ratio (`k = R/r`) for 14 circles.\n2.  The radius `r` of the small circles is given as 1.\n3.  The radius of the large circle `R` is calculated using the formula `R = k * r`.\n4.  A Python script will be provided to perform this calculation and print the result rounded to 4 significant digits, as requested.\n\nThe script will use the known optimal packing ratio for `N=14`, which is approximately `k = 3.428054013`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 smaller circles of radius 1.\n\n    This problem, known as the circle packing problem for N=14, does not have a simple\n    analytical solution.
