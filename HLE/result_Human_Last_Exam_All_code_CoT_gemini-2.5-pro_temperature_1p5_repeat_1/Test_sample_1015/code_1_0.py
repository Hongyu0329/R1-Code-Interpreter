    This function explains the primary difference between a cambré derrière
    in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods.

    explanation = """
In a cambré derrière (a bend backwards), the fundamental difference between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the alignment of the hips.

1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method places a strong emphasis on maintaining square hips. The dancer must keep both hips aligned and facing forward, initiating the backbend from the upper and middle spine. This is done to maintain core stability and control, protecting the lower back.

2.  **Balanchine Method:** This style often features a more extreme and dynamic line. In a cambré derrière, the Balanchine technique allows or encourages the dancer to release the hip of the supporting leg, pushing it forward as the back arches. This creates a deeper-looking curve and a distinct visual aesthetic, but requires different muscular control.

Therefore, the most significant and defining difference is the placement of the hip.
