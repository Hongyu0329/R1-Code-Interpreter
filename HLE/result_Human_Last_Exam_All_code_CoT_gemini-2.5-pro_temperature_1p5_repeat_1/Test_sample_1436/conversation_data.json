    "Of course. Let's determine the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram:** The problem describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators or lines). The only way to construct this is to have two vertices, let's call them A and B, with all four lines running between A and B. This is a type of vacuum bubble or \"melon\" diagram.\n\n2.  **Identify Symmetries:** The symmetry factor `S` of a diagram is the number of distinct permutations of its lines and vertices that leave the diagram's structure unchanged. We need to identify these permutation operations.\n    *   **Vertex Permutation:** The two vertices, A and B, are indistinguishable. Swapping them results in the same diagram. This gives a symmetry factor related to the number of vertices.\n    *   **Line Permutation:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are also identical. They can be permuted among themselves in any way without changing the diagram. This gives a symmetry factor related to the number of lines.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the number of ways each permutation can be performed.\n    *   Number of vertex permutations = 2!\n    *   Number of line permutations = 4!\n    *   Total Symmetry Factor, S = (2!) * (4!)\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to calculate the factorials, multiply them, and print the step-by-step calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    and four lines connecting them.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 2\n    num_lines = 4\n\n    print(\"This Feynman diagram consists of two vertices connected by four identical lines (propagators).\")\n    print(\"The symmetry factor 'S' is calculated by considering the permutations of identical components that leave the diagram unchanged.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # 1.
