    This function determines the solution to the Minecraft block riddle.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. An Overworld start is a dead end as there's no way to obtain wood.
    2. A Nether start is the only viable path.
    3. The scenario most closely matches starting on a piece of a Ruined Portal structure.
    4. In this structure, the first obtainable block that can be broken by hand
       and allows for progression (by bridging to the loot chest) is the Magma Block.
