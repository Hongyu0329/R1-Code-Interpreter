    "This sequence is a bit tricky, but it's based on a specific property of numbers. Let's break it down.\n\nThe rule for this sequence is as follows: each number in the sequence is a **Harshad number** (also known as a Niven number), and the sum of its digits is *also* a Harshad number.\n\nA Harshad number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.\n\nLet's test this rule with the last number in the sequence, **2352**:\n1.  **Find the sum of its digits:** 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n2.  **Check if 2352 is a Harshad number:** Is 2352 divisible by 12? Yes, 2352 / 12 = 196.\n3.  **Check if the sum of digits (12) is also a Harshad number:**\n    *   Find the sum of digits for 12: 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   Is 12 divisible by 3? Yes, 12 / 3 = 4.\n    *   Since both conditions are met, 2352 is part of the sequence.\n\nNow, we need to find the next integer greater than 2352 that satisfies these same two conditions. The following Python code will start from 2353, check each subsequent integer, and stop when it finds the first one that fits our rule. It will then print the verification steps.\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the digits of a number.\"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    # Store the original number to print later\n    original_n = n\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        digit = n % 10\n        s += digit\n        digits.append(str(digit))\n        n //= 10\n    \n    # For printing purposes, let's create the equation string\n    # E.g., for 123, it returns (6, \"1 + 2 + 3 = 6\")\n    equation = \" + \".join(reversed(digits)) + f\" = {s}\"\n    return s, equation\n\ndef is_harshad(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a Harshad number.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return False, None\n    s, _ = sum_digits(n)\n    return n % s == 0, s\n\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence(start_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the next number in the sequence starting from start_num + 1.\n    The sequence is Harshad numbers whose sum of digits is also a Harshad number.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = start_num + 1\n    while True:\n        # Check if num is a Harshad number\n        is_num_harshad, num_digit_sum = is_harshad(num)\n        \n        if is_num_harshad:\n            # If it is, check if its sum of digits is also a Harshad number\n            is_sum_harshad, _ = is_harshad(num_digit_sum)\n            if is_sum_harshad:\n                # We found the number\n                return num\n        num += 1\n\n# The last number in the provided sequence\nlast_number = 2352\n\n# Find the next number\nnext_number = find_next_number_in_sequence(last_number)\n\nprint(f\"The last number in the sequence is {last_number}.\")\nprint(\"The rule is that the number must be a Harshad number, and its sum of digits must also be a Harshad number.\")\nprint(f\"Searching for the next number after {last_number}...\")\nprint(f\"\\nFound the next number in the sequence: {next_number}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Verification for {next_number}:\")\n\n# Verification Step 1: Check if next_number is a Harshad number\ns_num, eq_num = sum_digits(next_number)\nprint(f\"1.
