    "Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the approximate analytical expression for the solution of the given differential equation in the large $x$ regimes.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large `x`**: The given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. The initial conditions $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=3$, $y''(0)=2$ suggest that the solution $y(x)$ will grow rapidly. For large and growing $y(x)$, the terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ are likely to dominate the equation. The term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ decays with $x^2$, and the term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is oscillatory and bounded (except at its poles). Thus, for large $y$, these terms can be considered negligible compared to the fast-growing $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ terms. This simplifies the ODE to $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n\n2.  **Posit a singular solution**: Non-linear ODEs like this often lead to solutions that have a finite-time singularity, meaning the solution goes to infinity at a finite value of $x$, let's call it $x_0$. This corresponds to the \"large $x$ regime\" approaching this singularity. We'll look for a solution of the form $y(x) \\approx C + A(x_0 - x)^n$.\n\n3.  **Find the dominant balance**: We substitute the proposed solution form into the simplified ODE $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$. By comparing the powers of $(x_0-x)$, we can find which terms dominate as $x \\to x_0$.\n    *   $y \\to C$\n    *   $y' \\sim (x_0-x)^{n-1}$\n    *   $y'' \\sim (x_0-x)^{n-2}$\n    *   $y''' \\sim (x_0-x)^{n-3}$\n    As $x \\to x_0$, the derivatives blow up if $n-1, n-2, n-3 < 0$. The terms in the ODE become:\n    *   $y''' \\sim (x_0-x)^{n-3}$\n    *   $y^4 \\to C^4$ (a constant)\n    *   $(y')^4 \\sim (x_0-x)^{4n-4}$\n    The dominant terms are the ones that diverge the fastest (i.e., have the most negative exponent). Comparing $y'''$ and $(y')^4$, we balance their exponents: $n-3 = 4n-4$, which gives $3n=1$ or $n=1/3$. With $n=1/3$, the exponent is $-8/3$. The term $y^4$ approaches a constant, so it's negligible compared to the diverging terms. This gives a consistent dominant balance: $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\n\n4.  **Determine the coefficient `A`**: By substituting $y(x) = C + A(x_0-x)^{1/3}$ into $y''' = (y')^4$, we can solve for the constant $A$.\n    *   $y' = -\\frac{A}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$\n    *   $y''' = -\\frac{10A}{27}(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n    *   $(y')^4 = \\left(-\\frac{A}{3}(x_0-x)^{-2/3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{A^4}{81}(x_0-x)^{-8/3}$\n    Equating the expressions for $y'''$ and $(y')^4$ gives $-\\frac{10A}{27} = \\frac{A^4}{81}$, which simplifies to $A^3 = -30$.\n\n5.  **Determine `x_0` and `C` from initial conditions**: We can use the initial conditions to find the constants of our approximate solution.\n    *   The ratio of the first two derivatives from our model is $\\frac{y''(x)}{y'(x)} = \\frac{2}{3(x_0-x)}$. Using the initial conditions at $x=0$, $\\frac{y''(0)}{y'(0)} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3x_0}$, which implies $x_0=1$.\n    *   Using the initial condition $y(0)=0$ with our solution form $y(x) = C + A(x_0-x)^{1/3}$ and $x_0=1$:\n        $y(0) = C + A(1-0)^{1/3} = C+A = 0 \\implies C=-A$.\n    *   Combining $C=-A$ and $A^3=-30$, we get $A = -\\sqrt[3]{30}$ and $C = \\sqrt[3]{30}$.\n\n6.  **Construct the final expression**: Substituting the values of $A$, $C$, and $x_0$ into the solution form gives:\n    $y(x) \\approx \\sqrt[3]{30} - \\sqrt[3]{30}(1-x)^{1/3} = \\sqrt[3]{30}(1-(1-x)^{1/3})$.\n\n7.  **Final Formatting**: Round the numerical coefficient to two decimal places and present the result in the required format. $\\sqrt[3]{30} \\approx 3.11$.\n\nThe python code below calculates the constant and prints the final formatted expression.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_ode_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives the approximate analytical solution for the given ODE in the large x regime.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # As derived in the plan, the dominant balance y''' â‰ˆ (y')^4 near the singularity\n    # leads to the condition A^3 = -30 for the coefficient in the solution form y(x) = C + A(x0-x)^(1/3).\n    A_cubed = -30\n    A = np.cbrt(A_cubed)\n\n    # From the ratio of initial conditions y''(0)/y'(0) = 2/3, we find x0 = 1.\n    x0 = 1.0\n\n    # From the initial condition y(0)=0, we find C = -A.\n    C = -A\n\n    # Round the constant to two decimal places for the final expression.\n    coeff = round(C, 2)\n\n    # The power in the expression is n = 1/3.\n    power_numerator = 1\n    power_denominator = 3\n\n    # Print the final expression with each number explicitly stated.\n    print(\"The analytical expression that approximates the solution for large x is:\")\n    # The final expression is y(x) = C - A * (x0 - x)^(1/3)\n    # y(x) = C * (1 - (x0 - x)^(1/3)), substituting A=-C\n    print(f\"y(x) = {coeff:.2f} * (1 - ({int(x0)} - x)**({power_numerator}/{power_denominator}))\")\n\nsolve_ode_approximation()\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = 3.11 * (1 - (1 - x)**(1/3))>>>"
