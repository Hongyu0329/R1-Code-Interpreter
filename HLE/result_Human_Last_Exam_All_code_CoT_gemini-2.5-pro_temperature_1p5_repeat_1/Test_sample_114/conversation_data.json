    "To solve this, I will write a Python script that analyzes the text of Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess.\"\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Fetch the full text of the poem from Project Gutenberg.\n2.  Clean the text to isolate the poem's lines and extract the last word from each line. This will create a list of all rhyming words in the poem.\n3.  For each word in the provided answer choices (A-E), I will check if it can be found in our list of line-ending words.\n4.  If a word is found, I will identify its rhyming partner from the adjacent line (since the poem is written in rhyming couplets) and print the rhyming pair.\n5.  If a word is not found at the end of any line, it cannot be part of a rhyme. I will report this as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_chaucer_rhymes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" to find which word from a given\n    list is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
