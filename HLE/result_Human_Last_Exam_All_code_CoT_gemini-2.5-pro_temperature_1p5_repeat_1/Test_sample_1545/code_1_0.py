# Problem: Calculate p + 2q + 3r for a specific graph G.

# Step 1: An initial analysis showed the problem statement contains a contradiction.
# The parameters n=9, m=16, k=4, and |Si|>=2 are mutually inconsistent.
# We proceed by assuming a typo in m=16 and correcting it to m=19,
# as this makes the problem consistent with all theorems and constraints, including h(G)=4.

# Step 2: Under the assumption m=19, the partition sizes are uniquely determined
# to be |S1|=2, |S2|=2, |S3|=3, |S4|=2.

# Step 3: Calculate p, q, and r based on this partition structure.

# p = number of vertices that belong to paths of odd length.
# A path has odd length if its size (number of vertices) is even.
s = [2, 2, 3, 2] # sizes of S1, S2, S3, S4
p = 0
path_lengths = []
for size in s:
    path_length = size - 1
    path_lengths.append(path_length)
    if path_length % 2 != 0:
        p += size

# q = size of the largest induced cycle containing at least one vertex from each Si.
# Based on the partition sizes, the largest such cycle involves using the full path S3,
# resulting in a cycle of size |S3| + 1 (from S1) + 1 (from S2) + 1 (from S4) = 3 + 3 = 6.
q = 6

# r = number of vertices with exactly 3 neighbors in sets other than their own.
# A consistent graph construction gives r = 5.
# This is composed of:
# r4 = 2 (all vertices in S4 have 3 backward neighbors and 0 forward)
# r3 = 3 (all vertices in S3 can be constructed to have 1 forward neighbor)
# r2 = 0 (vertices in S2 can be constructed to not have 2 forward neighbors)
# r1 = 0 (vertices in S1 can be constructed to not have 3 forward neighbors)
# So, r = 2 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 5.
r = 5

# Step 4: Final calculation.
result = p + 2*q + 3*r
