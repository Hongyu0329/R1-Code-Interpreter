    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric-key cryptography, which is Grover's algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Target Security Level:** The generally accepted standard for strong cryptographic security today (against classical computers) is 128 bits. This means an attacker would need to perform approximately 2^128 computations to break the encryption, which is considered infeasible. We'll aim to maintain this 128-bit security level against quantum computers.\n2.  **Understand the Quantum Threat:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, such as brute-forcing a symmetric key. While a classical computer needs roughly 2^N operations to brute-force an N-bit key, a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm needs only about sqrt(2^N) = 2^(N/2) operations.\n3.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** This means that to maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the effective security (N/2) must be at least 128. We can set up a simple equation to find the required key length (N).\n    *   `N / 2 = 128`\n4.  **Solve for N:** By solving for N, we can determine the minimum symmetric key length needed for post-quantum security.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a Python script to perform and explain this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length for quantum resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The industry standard for strong security is 128 bits.\n    # This means a classical computer would need 2^128 operations to break it.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the target security level.\")\n    print(f\"The desired security level, equivalent to today's standards, is {target_security_level} bits.\")\n    print(\"This means an attacker should need to perform at least 2^128 operations.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Account for the quantum threat (Grover's Algorithm).\")\n    print(\"Grover's algorithm gives a quadratic speedup to brute-force attacks.\")\n    print(\"This effectively halves the security bits of a symmetric key.\")\n    print(\"For an N-bit key, the security against a quantum computer is N/2 bits.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the required key length.\")\n    print(\"To achieve a post-quantum security level of 128 bits, we set up the equation:\")\n    print(\"Required Key Length / 2 = Target Security Level\")\n    \n    # To find the required key length, we reverse the effect of Grover's algorithm.\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * 2\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{target_security_level} * 2 = {required_key_length}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: To achieve {target_security_level}-bit security against a quantum computer, a symmetric key needs to be at least {required_key_length} bits long.\")\n\nsolve_quantum_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
