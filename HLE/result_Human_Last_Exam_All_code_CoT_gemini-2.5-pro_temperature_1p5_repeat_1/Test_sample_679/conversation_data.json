    "Here is my plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first look at the molecular formula, C7H14, to calculate the degree of unsaturation. This will tell me if the molecule contains double bonds or rings.\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal provided:\n    *   The chemical shift (e.g., 145 ppm) indicates the chemical environment of the carbon (e.g., alkene, alkane).\n    *   The multiplicity (s, t, d, q) tells how many hydrogen atoms are directly attached to that carbon (s=0H, d=1H, t=2H, q=3H). This is determined using the DEPT technique or off-resonance decoupling.\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon Count**: The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but only 6 NMR signals are given. The hint \"there may be signal overlapping\" suggests that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons. I will use the multiplicities and hydrogen count to figure out which signal corresponds to two carbons.\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**: Based on the fragments identified from the NMR data (`=CH₂`, `>C=`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH-`, etc.), I will piece together a structure that is consistent with all the data. The key will be to find a structure that correctly accounts for the two equivalent carbons.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Once the correct structure is identified, I will determine its official IUPAC name.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that programmatically prints out this step-by-step deduction and states the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of a C7H14 hydrocarbon from its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    print(\"For an alkane with 7 carbons (C_n H_{2n+2}), the formula would be C7H16.\")\n    print(\"The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating one degree of unsaturation.\")\n    print(\"This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(\"The 13C NMR signals are:\")\n    for shift, mult in nmr_signals.items():\n        print(f\"  - {shift} ppm ({mult})\")\n    print(\"\\nInterpreting the signals:\")\n    print(\"  - The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm).\")\n    print(\"    - 145(s): A singlet 's' means a quaternary carbon (0 hydrogens).\")\n    print(\"    - 112(t): A triplet 't' means a CH2 group (2 hydrogens).\")\n    print(\"    - Together, these strongly indicate a R2C=CH2 terminal alkene group.\")\n    print(\"  - The other signals are in the alkane region:\")\n    print(\"    - 48(t): A CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"    - 27(d): A CH group.\")\n    print(\"    - 22(q): A CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"    - 21(q): A CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Count\")\n    print(\"The formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals.\")\n    print(\"As hinted, one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\")\n    print(\"Let's identify the carbon types from the signals:\")\n    print(\"  - C (quaternary, from 145(s))\")\n    print(\"  - CH2 (from 112(t))\")\n    print(\"  - CH2 (from 48(t))\")\n    print(\"  - CH (from 27(d))\")\n    print(\"  - CH3 (from 22(q))\")\n    print(\"  - CH3 (from 21(q))\")\n    print(\"\\nIf one signal represents two carbons, let's see which one fits the molecular formula C7H14.\")\n    print(\"The sum of hydrogens from the 6 signals is 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 11.\")\n    print(\"The formula C7H14 requires 14 hydrogens, a deficit of 3 hydrogens.\")\n    print(\"This deficit of 3 hydrogens (and 1 carbon) must come from one signal representing two methyl (CH3) groups instead of one.\")\n    print(\"So, the actual fragments are: 1x C, 2x CH2, 1x CH, and 3x CH3, where two CH3 groups are equivalent.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Assemble the Structure\")\n    print(\"We need to build a C7H14 alkene with the following parts:\")\n    print(\"  - A terminal alkene: >C=CH2\")\n    print(\"  - An unbranched CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"  - A CH group with two equivalent methyl groups attached, forming an isopropyl-like structure: -CH(CH3)2\")\n    print(\"  - A lone methyl group.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's assemble these fragments.
