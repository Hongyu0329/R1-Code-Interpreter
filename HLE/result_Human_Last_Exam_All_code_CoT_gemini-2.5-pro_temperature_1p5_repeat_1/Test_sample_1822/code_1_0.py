# Define the given parameters
# c: Confidence of the discriminatory pattern in the subgraph G
c = 0.85
# s: Support of the discriminatory pattern
s = 0.12
# c_prime: Confidence of the anti-correlated pattern in the neighborhood
c_prime = 0.78
# beta: Bottleneck coefficient of the knowledge graph
beta = 0.23

# Step 1: Calculate the evidence for the violation
# This is the product of the pattern's confidence and support.
evidence_for_violation = c * s

# Step 2: Calculate the evidence for a statistical artifact
# This combines the counter-evidence with a "structural skepticism" factor from the bottleneck.
evidence_for_artifact = c_prime * (1 - beta)

# Step 3: Calculate the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)
# This is the ratio of the evidence for the violation to the evidence for the artifact.
evidence_ratio = evidence_for_violation / evidence_for_artifact

# Step 4: Output the calculation step-by-step as requested
print("The formula for the evidence ratio (E_r) is:")

# Show the calculated numerator and the expression for the denominator
