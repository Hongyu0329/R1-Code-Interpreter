    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to identify the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** I will break down the molecule into its three main structural components:\n    *   The central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n    *   The three `-CH2-` (methylene) linkers.\n    *   The three large `((4S,7R)-...)` substituents attached to the linkers.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** I'll analyze the overall symmetry of the molecule. The `1,3,5-` and `2,4,6-` substitution pattern on the benzene ring creates a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This means the three arms of the molecule (linker + substituent) are identical, as are the three methyl groups on the core.\n\n3.  **Count Peaks for Each Component:** I will count the number of unique proton signals for each distinct part of the molecule.\n    *   **Core:** The three equivalent methyl groups on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Linkers:** The protons of the equivalent `-CH2-` groups. I'll consider the effect of the adjacent chiral substituent, which makes the two protons of each `-CH2-` group diastereotopic (non-equivalent).\n    *   **Substituent:** The chiral substituent itself. Since it's rigid and has no internal symmetry, I will count every proton in a unique chemical environment. This includes protons on the pyrazole ring, the bicyclic skeleton (methine and methylene groups), and the three methyl groups.\n\n4.  **Sum the Results:** I will add up the number of signals from each unique part to get the total number of expected peaks.\n\nThis step-by-step process will be encoded in a Python script to calculate and display the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n    \n    The molecule is: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the central benzene core and its methyl groups.\n    # The molecule has C3 symmetry.

This makes the two protons\n    # within each -CH2- group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    # Therefore, the linker protons will give rise to two distinct signals.\n    num_signals_linker_CH2 = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze one of the three equivalent chiral substituents.\n    # The substituent is ((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl).\n    # This is a rigid, chiral structure.
