    arc_gap_mm = 6.0

    material = "Inconel 718"
    component = "Thin aeroengine turbine blade tip"

    # --- Step 1: Analyze and Calculate Voltage ---
    # The arc voltage (V_arc) is highly dependent on the arc length.
    # A common empirical formula for TIG welding with argon shielding gas is:
    # V_arc = V_anode_cathode_drop + (E_arc * L_arc)
    # V_anode_cathode_drop: Combined voltage drop at the anode and cathode (typically 10-12 V)
    # E_arc: Electric field gradient in the arc column (typically 1-2 V/mm)
    # L_arc: Arc length in mm

    # Using typical values for the calculation
    v_anode_cathode_drop = 10.0  # Volts
    e_arc_v_per_mm = 1.25      # Volts per mm

    # Calculate the estimated voltage
    estimated_voltage = v_anode_cathode_drop + (e_arc_v_per_mm * arc_gap_mm)
