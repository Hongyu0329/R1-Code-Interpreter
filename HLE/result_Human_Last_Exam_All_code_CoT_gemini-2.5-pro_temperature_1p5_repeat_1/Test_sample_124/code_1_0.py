    Analyzes the statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the true ones.

    The correct statements are:
    C: The nodes of a junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm operates on potential tables representing distributions over these cliques.
    E: The algorithm's complexity is exponential in the treewidth, so high treewidth makes it impractical.
    G: The reason for the lack of resilience to high treewidth is precisely because it requires manipulating distributions over large cliques.
    I: The computational cost grows exponentially with the number of variables in the largest clique.
    L: This is a correct description of the Running Intersection Property.
