# A temporal fixed point `k` is defined by the condition where the result of
# temporal multiplication `k ⊗ k` is the same regardless of time-flow direction.
# Forward flow: k ⊗ k = |k + k|
# Backward flow: k ⊗ k = |k - k|
# The condition is: |k + k| = |k - k|

# This simplifies to |2k| = |0|, which is only true if 2k = 0, meaning k = 0.
# The problem asks for the sum of all *positive integer* temporal fixed points
# less than 100. Since 0 is not a positive integer, there are no such fixed points.
# The "temporal horizon" h(T) = 48 is extraneous information not used in the calculation.

# We will programmatically verify this by checking all positive integers up to 99.

# This list will store the fixed points we find.
