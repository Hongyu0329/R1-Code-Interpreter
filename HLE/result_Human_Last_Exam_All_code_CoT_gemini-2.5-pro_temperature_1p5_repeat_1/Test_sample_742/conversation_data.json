    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your request.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user is asking if the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (QM) can be used to prove Gödel's ontological proof of God.\n2.  **Establish the Domains:**\n    *   **Gödel's Ontological Proof:** This is a formal proof within a specific system of modal logic (S5). It defines \"God\" as a being that possesses all \"positive properties\" and uses logical axioms to argue for its necessary existence. Its domain is metaphysics and formal logic.\n    *   **Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics:** This is a framework based on linear algebra in Hilbert spaces, differential equations, and probability theory. It is designed to model the behavior of physical particles and energy. Its domain is physics.\n3.  **Determine Commensurability:** I will explain that these two systems are fundamentally non-commensurable. The tools of one (e.g., Hermitian operators, state vectors) have no defined meaning or application within the other's context (e.g., logical propositions about \"positive properties\"). It would be like trying to use the rules of baseball to prove a theorem in number theory.\n4.  **Develop an Illustrative Python Script:** Since a direct proof is impossible, the code cannot perform one. Instead, I will write a Python script that illustrates this very incompatibility.\n    *   The script will schematically represent key concepts from both domains (e.g., a function for Gödel's axioms, a function for QM principles).\n    *   It will then use `print` statements to explain why applying QM's mathematical objects to Gödel's logical propositions is a category error.\n    *   To satisfy the unique constraint of printing numbers from a \"final equation,\" I will create a symbolic equation representing this incompatibility, such as `Framework_1 + Framework_2 = Incompatible_0`, and then print the numbers `1`, `2`, and `0`.\n\nThis approach directly answers the user's question, explains the reasoning, and uses the requested coding format to illustrate the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_framework_incompatibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script illustrates the conceptual gap between Gödel's Ontological Proof\n    and the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Representing Gödel's Ontological Framework ---\n    print(\"--- Domain 1: Gödel's Ontological Proof ---\")\n    print(\"This is a proof in modal logic (S5).
