No, it is not possible. The mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, which deals with physical systems like particles and energy, is conceptually and functionally distinct from the modal logic used in GÃ¶del's ontological proof, which deals with metaphysical propositions. There is no valid way to map the concepts of one framework onto the other.
