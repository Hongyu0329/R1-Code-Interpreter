# The problem is about finding a critical exponent for a reverse square function estimate for the cone in R^3.
# The theory of Fourier restriction for the cone indicates two critical exponents where the behavior of the estimate changes.
# One is given as p = 4. The other is known from mathematical literature.

# We will define the other critical exponent as a fraction.
p_numerator = 10
p_denominator = 3

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation for the other critical exponent is p = 10 / 3.
print("The final equation for the other critical exponent `p` is:")
print(f"p = {p_numerator} / {p_denominator}")

# To be explicit about the numbers in the equation:
print(f"The numerator is: {p_numerator}")
print(f"The denominator is: {p_denominator}")

# We can express the answer as a rational number or a decimal.
# Using sympy to represent the fraction.
other_critical_exponent = sympy.Rational(p_numerator, p_denominator)
print(f"\nThe other critical exponent is {other_critical_exponent}.")
