    "The problem asks for the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the space X**: We will first identify the space $X$ as a quotient of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup. A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by a basis, which can be represented by a 2x2 matrix $A$. The area condition translates to a condition on the determinant of $A$. The \"moduli space\" aspect means we quotient by changes of basis, which corresponds to the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  **Simplify the quotient**: We will show that this space $X$ can be expressed as the quotient of a known 3-manifold $Y = SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ action.\n3.  **Compute $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$**: We will determine the first homology group of $Y$. This is a known result from the theory of 3-manifolds and Seifert fiber spaces. The space $Y$ is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. Its fundamental group is a central extension of $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$, and its abelianization is $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n4.  **Determine the action on homology**: We will describe the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ action on $Y$ and its induced action on $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n5.  **Compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**: Using the result from the previous steps, we will compute the homology of the quotient space $X = Y/\\mathbb{Z}_2$. For a finite group action, the first homology of the quotient can be related to the homology of the original space and the group action.\n6.  **Final Answer**: Provide the resulting group in a Python script.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n**Step 1: The Space X**\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by two linearly independent vectors, which we can take as the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means $|\\det(A)| = 1$. Let $B = \\{A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)|=1\\}$.\nTwo different bases $A_1$ and $A_2$ define the same lattice if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A_2 = A_1 G$.\nThus, the moduli space $X$ is the quotient space $X = B / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplifying the Quotient**\nLet's analyze the quotient. The space of bases $B$ consists of two connected components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(A)=1$) and the set $\\{A \\mid \\det(A)=-1\\}$. The group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ also has two components, $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\nLet $[A]$ be an equivalence class in $X$. We can choose a representative $A'$ such that $\\det(A')=1$. If $\\det(A)=1$, we take $A'=A$. If $\\det(A)=-1$, we can act with an element $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(G)=-1$, for instance $G = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $A' = AG$ has $\\det(A') = \\det(A)\\det(G) = (-1)(-1)=1$.\nSo, every lattice has a basis with positive orientation. This means we can represent the space $X$ by considering the equivalence relation on $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\nLet $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. They represent the same lattice in $X$ if $A_2 = A_1 G$ for some $G \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Taking the determinant, $\\det(A_2) = \\det(A_1)\\det(G)$, which implies $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(G)$, so we must have $\\det(G)=1$, meaning $G \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis is not entirely correct. $A_1$ and $A_2$ represent the same point in $X$ if the lattices they generate are the same. This means $\\Lambda(A_1) = \\Lambda(A_2)$. If we only consider bases in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, two bases $A_1, A_2$ can generate the same lattice if $\\Lambda(A_1)$ and $\\Lambda(A_2)$ are related by an isometry of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that preserves the origin. Let's reconsider the quotient.\nLet $Y = SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, which is the moduli space of *oriented* unit-area lattices. The space $X$ does not distinguish between a lattice and its reflection. Let $\\Lambda(A)$ be the lattice generated by the columns of $A$. Reflection across the x-axis transforms the basis $A$ to $J A$ where $J=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This changes the orientation of the basis.\nThe space $X$ is the quotient of $Y$ by the involution $\\phi$ that maps a lattice to its reflection. On the representation $Y = SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, the involution is $\\phi([A]) = [JAJ^{-1}]$. But this corresponds to conjugating the whole space. The correct action corresponds to identifying a lattice $\\Lambda$ with its image under an orientation-reversing isometry, which corresponds to identifying $[A]$ with $[AJ]$ where $J=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ has determinant -1. So $X = Y / \\phi$ where $\\phi([A])=[AJ]$.\n\n**Step 3: Homology of Y**\nThe space $Y = SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-studied 3-manifold. It is the unit tangent bundle to the modular orbifold $M = \\mathbb{H}/PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$. There is a fiber bundle $S^1 \\to Y \\to M$. The long exact sequence in homotopy implies that $\\pi_1(Y)$ is a central extension $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(Y) \\to PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$. The group $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$. A known presentation for $\\pi_1(Y)$ is $\\langle a,b,z \\mid a^2=z, b^3=z \\rangle$, where $z$ is the central generator corresponding to the $S^1$ fiber.\nThe first homology group is the abelianization of the fundamental group:\n$H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = (\\pi_1(Y))_{ab} = \\langle \\bar{a}, \\bar{b}, \\bar{z} \\mid \\bar{a}\\bar{b}=\\bar{b}\\bar{a}, \\bar{a}^2=\\bar{z}, \\bar{b}^3=\\bar{z} \\rangle$.\nThe relations imply $\\bar{a}^2 = \\bar{b}^3$. Let $g = \\bar{a}\\bar{b}^{-1}$. Then $\\bar{a}=g\\bar{b}$. The relation becomes $(g\\bar{b})^2=\\bar{b}^3$, which is $g^2\\bar{b}^2=\\bar{b}^3$, so $g^2=\\bar{b}$. Then $\\bar{a}=g \\cdot g^2 = g^3$.\nAny element in the group can be written in terms of $g$. There are no further relations on $g$. Thus, the abelianization is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 4: The Involution's Action on Homology**\nThe space $X$ is the quotient of $Y$ by the involution $\\phi([A])=[AJ]$. This action reverses the orientation of the underlying space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The generator of $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ can be represented by the circle fiber in the fibration $S^1 \\to Y \\to M$. The involution $\\phi$ reverses the orientation of the fibers. Therefore, its induced action on homology, $\\phi_*: H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$, maps the generator to its inverse.\nIn additive notation for the group $\\mathbb{Z}$, the action is multiplication by -1.\n\n**Step 5: Homology of the Quotient X**\nFor a quotient of a space $M$ by a finite group $G$, there is a formula relating their homologies. Over a field of characteristic 0 like $\\mathbb{Q}$, $H_k(M/G, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H_k(M, \\mathbb{Q})^G$, the invariants under the group action.\nWith integer coefficients, the situation is more subtle, but for the first homology group, we can use the formula that $H_1(M/G, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the cokernel of the map $\\sum_{g \\in G} (g_* - 1_*) : H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nIn our case, $M=Y$, $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{e, \\phi\\}$. The map is $(e_* - 1_*) + (\\phi_* - 1_*) = (1-1) + (-1-1) = -2$.\nThe map is multiplication by -2 on $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe first homology group of the quotient is the cokernel of this map:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\text{coker}(\\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\times -2} \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/(-2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nThe first homology group is the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the computation of H_1(X, Z).\n    The steps are:\n    1. The space of nondegenerate lattices of unit area, X, is identified as the quotient\n       X = (SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z)) / Z_2.\n       Let Y = SL(2,R)/SL(2,Z). X = Y / Z_2.\n    2. The first homology group of Y is H_1(Y, Z) = Z.\n    3. The Z_2 action on Y induces an action on H_1(Y, Z) which corresponds to\n       multiplication by -1.\n    4. The homology of the quotient is the cokernel of the map (phi_* - id_*),\n       where phi_* is the map on homology induced by the non-trivial element of Z_2.\n       This map is (-1 - 1) = -2.\n    5. So, H_1(X, Z) = coker(Z -> Z, z -> -2z) = Z / 2Z = Z_2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Representing the cyclic group of order 2.\n    result = \"Z_2\"\n    \n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Z_2>>>"
