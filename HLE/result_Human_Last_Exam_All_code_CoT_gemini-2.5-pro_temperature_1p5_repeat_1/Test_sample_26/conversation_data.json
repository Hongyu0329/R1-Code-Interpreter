    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can employ tools from algebraic topology, specifically the long exact sequence of homotopy groups and rational homotopy theory.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Establish the relationship between $\\pi_3(X)$ and the homotopy groups of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the relative homotopy groups of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ using the long exact sequence (LES) for a pair.\n2.  Determine the group $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. We will find that it is the trivial group, which greatly simplifies the LES.\n3.  From the simplified LES, we'll see that $\\pi_3(X)$ is a quotient of the relative homotopy group $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. This implies that the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is less than or equal to the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n4.  Use the rational Hurewicz theorem to relate the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to the dimension of the rational homology group $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$.\n5.  Calculate the dimension of $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X; \\mathbb{Q})$ using the long exact sequence of homology for the pair. This will involve the Betti numbers of $X$ and properties of the inclusion map.\n6.  Combine these results to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through these steps and calculate the necessary values to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X) for a smooth\n    quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 5  # Degree of the hypersurface\n    n = 3  # Dimension of the ambient complex projective space CP^n\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Long Exact Sequence (LES) of Homotopy Groups\")\n    print(\"Let X be a smooth quintic hypersurface in Y = CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The LES for the pair (Y, X) contains the segment:\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_4(Y, X) -> pi_3(X) -> pi_3(Y) -> ...\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the group pi_3(CP^3)\")\n    print(f\"We can find the homotopy groups of CP^n using the Hopf fibration:\")\n    print(f\"S^1 -> S^(2n+1) -> CP^n\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, we have S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The LES of homotopy groups for this fibration gives:\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_k(S^1) -> pi_k(S^7) -> pi_k(CP^3) -> pi_{k-1}(S^1) -> ...\")\n    print(\"For k=3, pi_3(S^1) = 0 and pi_2(S^1) = 0.
