    "My plan is to identify the physicist based on the provided clues. The key details are: their main field is microscopy, they discovered an optical effect in real imagery, and the discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors. This unique story points to a specific historical event in physics. I will use this information to identify the person and then write a simple Python script to print their name.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on several key clues:\n    1. Known for work in microscopy (specifically X-ray microscopy).\n    2. Discovered an optical effect related to forming real images.\n    3. The discovery was inspired by a janitor/custodial worker's observation\n       while cleaning concave (cylindrical) mirrors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # These clues point to the co-inventor of the Kirkpatrick-Baez microscope.\n    physicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\n\n    print(f\"The physicist described is: {physicist_name}\")\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
