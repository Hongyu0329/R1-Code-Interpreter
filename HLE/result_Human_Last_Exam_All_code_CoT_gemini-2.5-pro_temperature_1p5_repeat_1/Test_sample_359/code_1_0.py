    """
    This function solves the given King of the Hill chess puzzle.

    The FEN for the position is: 8/2k5/5pn1/1Pp1pNpp/3PP3/4K1B1/8/8 w - - 0 43

    Analysis of the position:
    - White can win by moving their king to one of the central squares: d4, e4, d5, e5.
    - Squares d4 and e4 are occupied by White's own pawns.
    - The path to e5 is blocked.
    - White's objective is to move the King to the d5 square.

    Obstacle:
    - The target square d5 is attacked by Black's knight on g6. The White king cannot legally move there.

    Winning Plan for White:
    1. White must first deal with the knight on g6. The key move is 1. Bh4, attacking the knight.
    2. Assuming optimal defense, Black will play 1... g4 to force White's bishop to move, thus delaying the win.
    3. The forced winning sequence is as follows:
        1. Bh4 g4
        2. Bg3 Nf8
        3. Kd3 cxd4
        4. Kc4 Kb6
        5. Kd5 (White's king reaches a central square, winning the game).

    This shows that White can force a win in 5 moves.
