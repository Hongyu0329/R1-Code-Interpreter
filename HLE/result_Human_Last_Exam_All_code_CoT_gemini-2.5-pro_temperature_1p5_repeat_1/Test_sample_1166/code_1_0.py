        {"letter": "B", "text": "A bounded measurable function", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. The domain of integration is not specified and could have infinite measure. Counterexample: f(x) = 1 on the entire real line R. The function is bounded and measurable, but ∫_R |1| dx = ∞."},
        {"letter": "C", "text": "A measurable function", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. The function could be unbounded or its domain could have infinite measure, leading to an infinite integral. Counterexample: f(x) = 1 on R."},
        {"letter": "D", "text": "A continuous function", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. A continuous function is measurable, but its integral can be infinite. Counterexample: f(x) = x on R. ∫_R |x| dx = ∞."},
        {"letter": "E", "text": "A measurable function on [a,b]", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. While the domain [a,b] has finite measure, the function can be unbounded in a way that makes its integral infinite. Counterexample: f(x) = 1/x on (0,1] with f(0)=0. The function is measurable on [0,1], but ∫_[0,1] |1/x| dx = ∞."},

         "reason": "Correct. A continuous function on a closed, bounded interval [a,b] is guaranteed to be bounded by the Extreme Value Theorem. Let |f(x)| ≤ M. Since f is also measurable and the domain has finite measure (b-a), its integral is finite: ∫_[a,b] |f| dx ≤ M(b-a) < ∞."},
        {"letter": "G", "text": "A bounded function on [a,b]", "is_correct": False,

        {"letter": "H", "text": "A function whose absolute value is integrable", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. For f to be Lebesgue integrable, f itself must be measurable. A function |f| can be integrable (i.e., |f| is measurable and ∫|f|<∞) without f being measurable. Counterexample: Let E be a non-measurable set. Define f(x) = 1 if x is in E and f(x) = -1 otherwise. Then |f(x)| = 1, which is measurable, but f is not."},

         "reason": "Incorrect. The function could be unbounded near the endpoints. Counterexample: f(x) = 1/(x-a) on a finite interval (a,b). The integral ∫_(a,b) |f| dx diverges."},
        {"letter": "H", "text": "A bounded function on (a,b) (duplicate H)", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. This is the second option labeled 'H'. The function is not necessarily measurable."},
        {"letter": "K", "text": "A measurable function on (a,b)", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. The function could be unbounded. The same counterexample as for (J) applies, since a continuous function is measurable."},
        {"letter": "L", "text": "A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable", "is_correct": True,
         "reason": "Correct. This is the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function. It states both required conditions: (1) f is measurable, and (2) ∫|f|dμ < ∞."},
        {"letter": "M", "text": "A bounded continuous function on (a,b)", "is_correct": False,
         "reason": "Incorrect. The notation (a,b) can represent an interval of infinite length (e.g., (-∞, ∞) or R). Counterexample: f(x) = 1 on R. This function is bounded and continuous, but its integral over R is infinite. The property does not *necessarily* hold."}
