print("""Based on the information provided, Charles is likely struggling because his new diet is overly restrictive and unsustainable.

The first place Charles needs to adjust is his **diet**.

Here is the reasoning:
1.  **Severe Energy Deficit:** Charles is limiting fat and carbohydrates simultaneously. These are the body's two primary fuel sources. Restricting both at the same time will lead to significant fatigue, making it very difficult to cope with the demands of his job, let alone have the energy to start an exercise program.
2.  **Sustainability is Key:** A diet that limits three major food groups (animal protein, fat, carbs) is extremely difficult to follow, especially for someone who travels and likely eats out. This approach sets him up for failure and frustration. Long-term success comes from sustainable habits, not extreme deprivation.
3.  **Establish a Foundation First:** Before adding a new stressor like exercise, Charles needs to establish a stable and energizing nutritional foundation. His current diet is a source of struggle, not a source of strength.

His first adjustment should be to create a more balanced and less restrictive eating plan. Instead of eliminating food groups, he could focus on the quality of his foodâ€”choosing complex carbohydrates (like quinoa, oats, sweet potatoes), lean proteins (plant-based or lean animal sources), and healthy fats (like avocado, nuts, olive oil). This will provide the energy he needs for his job and will create a sustainable platform for successfully incorporating exercise in the future.""")
