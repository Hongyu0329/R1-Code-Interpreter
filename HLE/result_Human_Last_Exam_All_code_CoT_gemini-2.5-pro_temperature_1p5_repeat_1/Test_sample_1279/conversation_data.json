    "In this problem, we need to find all the connected second-order vacuum bubble Feynman diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory, calculate their respective symmetry factors, and then sum these factors.\n\n### My thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:**\n    *   The theory is $\\phi^4$, meaning each interaction vertex has four lines (or legs).\n    *   \"Second-order\" means the diagrams have two such vertices.\n    *   \"Vacuum bubble\" means there are no external lines; all lines are internal propagators connecting the vertices.\n    *   We need to find all *connected* graphs with 2 vertices, where each vertex has a degree of 4.\n    *   Let the vertices be V1 and V2. A line can either be a self-loop (connecting a vertex to itself) or connect V1 to V2.\n    *   Let $n_{11}$ be the number of loops on V1, $n_{22}$ be the number of loops on V2, and $n_{12}$ be the number of propagators between V1 and V2. The degree of a vertex is twice the number of its self-loops plus the number of lines connecting to other vertices.\n        *   Degree(V1): $2n_{11} + n_{12} = 4$\n        *   Degree(V2): $2n_{22} + n_{12} = 4$\n    *   We explore integer solutions for $(n_{11}, n_{22}, n_{12})$ where $n_{12} > 0$ for connectivity:\n        *   If $n_{12} = 4$: $2n_{11}=0 \\implies n_{11}=0$. This forces $2n_{22}=0 \\implies n_{22}=0$. This gives the **\"Melon\" diagram**: 0 loops on each vertex, 4 propagators between them.\n        *   If $n_{12} = 2$: $2n_{11}=2 \\implies n_{11}=1$. This forces $2n_{22}=2 \\implies n_{22}=1$. This gives the **\"Spectacles\" diagram**: 1 loop on each vertex, 2 propagators between them.\n        *   Other integer values for $n_{12}$ (1 or 3) don't yield integer solutions for $n_{11}$ and $n_{22}$. If $n_{12}=0$, the diagram is disconnected.\n    *   Thus, there are exactly two distinct topologies for connected second-order vacuum bubbles.\n\n2.  **Calculate Symmetry Factors (S):**\n    The symmetry factor is the order of the automorphism group of the diagram, which counts the number of ways to permute lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n    *   **Diagram 1: \"Melon\" Diagram**\n        *   **Description:** Two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n        *   **Symmetries:**\n            1.  We can swap the two identical vertices: factor of 2.\n            2.  We can permute the four identical propagators connecting the vertices in any way: factor of $4! = 24$.\n        *   **Calculation:** $S_1 = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n    *   **Diagram 2: \"Spectacles\" Diagram**\n        *   **Description:** Two vertices, each with a single self-loop, are connected by two identical propagators.\n        *   **Symmetries:**\n            1.  We can swap the two identical vertices (the loop from V1 moves to V2 and vice-versa, which is fine): factor of 2.\n            2.  We can swap the two identical propagators that connect V1 and V2: factor of 2.\n            3.  Each self-loop is a propagator that starts and ends at the same vertex. We can \"flip\" it (swap its two ends at the vertex): factor of 2 for the loop on V1.\n            4.  Similarly, we can flip the self-loop on V2: factor of 2.\n        *   **Calculation:** $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n3.  **Sum the Factors:**\n    *   The final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams.\n    *   Total Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to present these calculations.\n    *   The script will first describe each diagram.\n    *   It will then show the calculation for each symmetry factor step-by-step.\n    *   Finally, it will print the sum of the factors in the format \"S1 + S2 = Total\".\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In phi^4 theory, there are two distinct connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\")\n    print(\"We will calculate the symmetry factor for each and then sum them.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Melon\" Diagram ---\n    print(\"Diagram 1: The 'Melon' Diagram\")\n    print(\"Description: Two vertices connected directly by four identical propagators.\")\n    \n    # Symmetries of the Melon diagram\n    vert_perms = 2  # Swapping the two identical vertices\n    prop_perms = math.factorial(4) # Permuting the four identical propagators\n    \n    s1 = vert_perms * prop_perms\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculation of symmetry factor S1:\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {vert_perms} from swapping the two identical vertices.\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {prop_perms} (which is 4!) from permuting the four identical propagators.\")\n    print(f\"S1 = (vertex permutations) * (propagator permutations)\")\n    print(f\"S1 = {vert_perms} * {prop_perms} = {s1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Diagram 2: The \"Spectacles\" Diagram ---\n    print(\"Diagram 2: The 'Spectacles' Diagram\")\n    print(\"Description: Two vertices, each with one self-loop, connected by two propagators.\")\n\n    # Symmetries of the Spectacles diagram\n    vert_swap = 2       # Swapping the two identical vertices\n    prop_swap = 2       # Swapping the two propagators connecting the vertices\n    loop1_flip = 2      # Flipping the direction of the first self-loop\n    loop2_flip = 2      # Flipping the direction of the second self-loop\n\n    s2 = vert_swap * prop_swap * loop1_flip * loop2_flip\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculation of symmetry factor S2:\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {vert_swap} from swapping the two identical vertices.\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {prop_swap} from swapping the two identical propagators connecting the vertices.\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {loop1_flip} from flipping the self-loop on the first vertex.\")\n    print(f\" - A factor of {loop2_flip} from flipping the self-loop on the second vertex.\")\n    print(f\"S2 = (vertex swap) * (propagator swap) * (loop 1 flip) * (loop 2 flip)\")\n    print(f\"S2 = {vert_swap} * {prop_swap} * {loop1_flip} * {loop2_flip} = {s2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # --- Summation ---\n    total_sum = s1 + s2\n    \n    print(\"Sum of all symmetry factors:\")\n    # The final equation with each number explicitly printed\n    print(f\"{s1} + {s2} = {total_sum}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_symmetry_factors()\n```\n<<<64>>>"
