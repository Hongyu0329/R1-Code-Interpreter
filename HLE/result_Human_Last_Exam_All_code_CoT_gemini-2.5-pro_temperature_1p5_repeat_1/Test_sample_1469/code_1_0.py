    # Step 1: Define the terms and their interpreted numerical values.
    # The term from Kirkby Lonsdale is 'tyaan'eboon'. Based on linguistic analysis
    # of Cumbrian sheep-counting systems, this term is a variant of 'Tyaan-a-bumfit'.
    # 'Tyaan' means 2, and 'Bumfit' means 15. The structure means "2 on 15".

    # Step 2: Determine the equivalent term in the Derbyshire dialect.
    # In the Derbyshire system, the number 17 is also constructed using
    # 'Tan' (2) and 'Bumfit' (15).

    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation as requested.
    # The question asks how many the person "had had", which refers to the original
    # quantity represented by 'tyaan'eboon'.
