    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph theory and analysis.\n2.  The `networkx` library provides a \"graph atlas,\" which is a pre-computed list of all small, simple, nonisomorphic graphs.\n3.  I will load this atlas and filter it to get only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices. According to graph theory resources, there are 34 such graphs.\n4.  Then, I will iterate through each of these 34 graphs.\n5.  For each graph, I will check if it is \"2-vertex-connected.\" A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected even after removing any single vertex. `networkx` has a function, `nx.node_connectivity()`, which calculates this property. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is 2 or greater.\n6.  I will keep a count of all the graphs that meet this criterion.\n7.  Finally, I will print the total count, which is the answer to the user's question.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    It uses the networkx graph atlas to get all nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices\n    and then checks each one for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The networkx graph atlas contains all nonisomorphic simple graphs up to 7 vertices.\n    all_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    \n    # Filter the list to get only graphs with exactly 5 vertices.\n    graphs_with_5_vertices = [g for g in all_graphs if g.number_of_nodes() == 5]\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the 2-vertex-connected graphs.\n    biconnected_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each 5-vertex graph and check its connectivity.\n    for g in graphs_with_5_vertices:\n        # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is at least 2.\n        # nx.node_connectivity(g) returns the minimum number of nodes that must be removed\n        # to disconnect the graph.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(g) >= 2:\n            biconnected_count += 1\n            \n    total_graphs_n5 = len(graphs_with_5_vertices)\n    \n    print(f\"Total number of simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices: {total_graphs_n5}\")\n    print(f\"Number of these graphs that are 2-vertex-connected: {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result.\ncount_biconnected_graphs()\n```\n<<<21>>>"
