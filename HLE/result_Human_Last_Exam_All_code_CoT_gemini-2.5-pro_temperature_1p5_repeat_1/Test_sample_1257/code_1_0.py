# The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of colors used to construct
# an x,y plane with the smallest number of colors.

# Let's analyze the possibilities for the number of colors in the plane.

# Possibility 1: Cardinality = 1 (A plane of a single color)
# - A plane of only Blue cubes is impossible, as they need a White or Orange cube in the same plane to be placed.
# - A plane of only Orange cubes is impossible, as they need a White cube in the z-direction to be placed.
# - A plane of only White cubes requires an Orange cube in the z-direction for each White cube (as it can't be placed next to two different colors). This requires an entire Orange scaffolding plane, which in turn requires a White scaffolding plane, and so on. This vertical construction does not allow for horizontal expansion from a single starting cube.
# Conclusion: Cardinality 1 is not possible.

# Possibility 2: Cardinality = 2 (A plane of two colors)
# Let's consider a plane made of Blue and Orange cubes.
# - For Blue cubes to exist, they must be adjacent to an Orange or White cube in the same plane. If the plane is {Blue, Orange}, this is satisfied as they can be adjacent to Orange cubes.
# - For Orange cubes to exist, they must be adjacent to a White cube in the z-direction.
# This means a {Blue, Orange} plane can be constructed if we can first build a scaffolding of White cubes in the z-level above or below it.
# The problem statement implies construction is possible. A two-color plane, like {Blue, Orange}, is the simplest configuration that isn't immediately impossible by the rules. It requires external scaffolding, but it is a valid potential configuration for the plane itself.

# Since a 1-color plane is impossible, the smallest possible number of colors is 2.
