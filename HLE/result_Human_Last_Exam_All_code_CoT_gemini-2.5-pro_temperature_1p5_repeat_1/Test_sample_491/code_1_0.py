# Part 1: Player 1's optimal payoff against the specific Player 2
# Player 2's decision is based on comparing accept payoff (1-x) with
# a simulated reject payoff. The simulated reject payoff for P2 is d*V, where V
# is the value of the random game: V = 1/(4-2d).
# P2 accepts if 1-x >= d/(4-2d).
# P1 offers x such that 1-x = d/(4-2d), so P1's payoff is x = 1 - d/(4-2d).

# The answer corresponds to the calculated sum.

# A=3, B=4, ..., K=13, L=14.
# So the answer is L.
# But per instructions, I should output <<<answer content>>> directly.
# <<<14>>>
