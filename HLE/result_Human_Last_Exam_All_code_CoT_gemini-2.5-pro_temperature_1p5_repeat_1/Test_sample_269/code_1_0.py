# This Python code will print the final output generated by the Scheme code.
# The Scheme code's execution flow is non-linear due to the use of call/cc (call-with-current-continuation),
# causing it to jump back and re-execute parts of the code with a different state.
# The trace of the execution results in the following sequence of numbers being printed.

print(1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4)
