    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the user's query to identify the key elements of the movie scene in question. The key elements are: a Hollywood feature film, a major film studio, a teenager, a pink bike, and an oncoming car.\n2.  I will search my knowledge base for films that match this specific and memorable scene.\n3.  The film that prominently features this scene is \"Napoleon Dynamite\" (2004), where the character Pedro SÃ¡nchez rides his bike.\n4.  I will then verify that the film was produced by a major studio. \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures and produced in association with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films, which are major players in the industry.\n5.  Finally, I will create a simple Python script to print the name of the movie as the answer, fulfilling the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the movie based on the described scene.\n\n# The film is the 2004 cult classic.\nmovie_title = \"Napoleon Dynamite\"\n\n# Print the name of the movie.\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<Napoleon Dynamite>>>"
