    Solves for the bounds of t based on the problem's constraints.

    The problem requires that for any s0 in the set of sums S = [-2, 2t],
    1/s0 must also be in S. This means the set of reciprocals of S must
    be a subset of S.
    Let S = [A, B] where A=-2 and B=2t. Since t must be negative (to avoid
    s0=0), A and B are negative.
    The set of reciprocals is [1/B, 1/A].
    The subset condition [1/B, 1/A] subset [A, B] leads to two inequalities:
    1) A <= 1/B  =>  A*B >= 1 (since B is negative)
    2) 1/A <= B  =>  1 >= A*B (since A is negative)
    These combine to require A*B = 1.
    Substituting A=-2 and B=2t gives:
    (-2) * (2t) = 1
    -4t = 1
    t = -1/4
