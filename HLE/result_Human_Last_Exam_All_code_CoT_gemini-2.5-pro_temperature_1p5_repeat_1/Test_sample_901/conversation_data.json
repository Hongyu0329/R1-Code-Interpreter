    "The user wants me to identify the major product of an organic chemistry reaction and present the solution in a Python code block.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:** The starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, sterically hindered base.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** The conditions (alkyl halide + strong, bulky base) strongly favor an E2 elimination mechanism.\n3.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** For an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-hydrogen to be removed must be in an anti-periplanar conformation. This means they both must be in axial positions (one pointing up, one pointing down).\n4.  **Evaluate Chair Conformations:**\n    *   The given stereochemistry (1S,2R) means the Bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n    *   For a 1,2-cis substituted cyclohexane, one group must be axial and the other equatorial.\n    *   **Conformer A:** Axial Bromo, Equatorial Methyl.\n    *   **Conformer B:** Equatorial Bromo, Axial Methyl.\n    *   The methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is sterically larger than the bromo group (A-value ≈ 0.5 kcal/mol). The more stable conformer will have the larger group (methyl) in the equatorial position.\n    *   Therefore, **Conformer A (axial Br, equatorial CH3) is the more stable and populated conformer.**\n5.  **Identify Possible Products:**\n    *   The reaction will proceed through the more stable conformer, Conformer A, which conveniently has the bromine in the required axial position.\n    *   We look for axial beta-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Path 1 (at C2):** The hydrogen at C2 is axial (since the methyl group is equatorial). Removing this hydrogen yields **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted alkene (trisubstituted), known as the **Zaitsev product**.\n    *   **Path 2 (at C6):** There is an axial hydrogen at C6. Removing this hydrogen yields **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (disubstituted), known as the **Hofmann product**.\n6.  **Apply Selectivity Rules:**\n    *   The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is very bulky.\n    *   Bulky bases have difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons. The axial proton at C2 is more hindered (due to the nearby equatorial methyl group) than the axial proton at C6.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky base will preferentially remove the proton from C6, leading to the formation of the Hofmann product.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n8.  **Code Implementation:** I will create a Python script that prints this reasoning and outputs the final product name.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the reactants and reaction conditions.\n    starting_material = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 Elimination\"\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the mechanism and stereochemical requirements.\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\n    The reaction of {starting_material} with {reagent} is an {reaction_type}.\n    This reaction mechanism requires an anti-periplanar geometry, meaning the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H on an adjacent carbon) must both be in axial positions on the cyclohexane chair.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the chair conformations of the starting material.\n    explanation += \"\"\"\n    The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has the bromo and methyl groups cis to each other. This leads to two possible chair conformations in equilibrium:\n    Conformer A: Axial Bromo, Equatorial Methyl\n    Conformer B: Equatorial Bromo, Axial Methyl\n\n    The methyl group is bulkier than the bromo group. To minimize steric strain, the bulkier group prefers the equatorial position. Therefore, Conformer A is the more stable and predominant conformer. The reaction proceeds primarily through Conformer A.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 4: Identify possible products based on the reactive conformer.\n    explanation += \"\"\"\n    In Conformer A, the bromo group is axial, which is required for the E2 reaction. We now look for axial beta-hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n\n    1. Elimination at C2: The H on C2 is axial. Removing this H gives the Zaitsev product: 1-methylcyclohexene.\n       (Product 1 Name: 1-methylcyclohexene)\n\n    2. Elimination at C6: The H on C6 is also axial. Removing this H gives the Hofmann product: 3-methylcyclohexene.\n       (Product 2 Name: 3-methylcyclohexene)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the major product based on the bulky base.\n    explanation += \"\"\"\n    Potassium tert-butoxide is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. Bulky bases preferentially remove the less sterically hindered proton. The proton on C6 is more accessible than the proton on C2 (which is shielded by the methyl group).\n\n    Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the less substituted alkene, the Hofmann product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Final conclusion\n    final_product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    conclusion = f\"\\nThe major product of the reaction is {final_product_name}.\"\n\n    # Print the step-by-step explanation and the final answer.\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation))\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(\"CONCLUSION\")\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(conclusion)\n\n# Execute the function to find the answer\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
