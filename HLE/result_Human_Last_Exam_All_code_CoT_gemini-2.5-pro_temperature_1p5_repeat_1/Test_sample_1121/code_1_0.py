    Calculates the approximate number of non-Clifford T gates for two scenarios
    in topological quantum computing based on the 2D surface code.

    The calculation makes the following standard assumptions:
    1. The faulty gate error rate 'p' is 0.1% (0.001), as the specified 1% is
       at or above the threshold of the surface code, making fault-tolerance impossible.
    2. The method for implementing non-Clifford T gates is magic state distillation.
    3. The distillation protocol is the '15-to-1' scheme, where p_out = 35 * p_in^3.
    4. The error contribution from the Clifford gates in the distillation circuit
       is considered negligible, which is the condition that a sufficiently large
       code distance (like d=5) is meant to achieve.
