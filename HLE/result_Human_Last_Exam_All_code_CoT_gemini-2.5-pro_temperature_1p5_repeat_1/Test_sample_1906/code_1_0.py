    This function explains through a step-by-step deduction why a
    cartesian closed abelian category must be trivial.

    The proof relies on showing that the endomorphism ring of any object
    is the zero ring, where 1 = 0.

    print("--- Proof: A Cartesian Closed Abelian Category is Trivial ---")
    print("\nStep 1: Define the key properties.")
    print("  - An Abelian Category has a 'zero object' (0), which is both initial and terminal.")
    print("    - Initial: Hom(0, Y) is a singleton set for any object Y.")
    print("    - Terminal: Hom(X, 0) is a singleton set for any object X.")
    print("  - A Cartesian Closed Category has a 'terminal object' (1) and 'exponentials' (Y^X).")
    print("    - This implies Hom(A x X, Y) is isomorphic to Hom(A, Y^X).")

    print("\nStep 2: Combine the properties.")
    print("  - In any category with a zero object and a terminal object, they must be isomorphic.")
    print("  - Therefore, in our category, the terminal object 1 is the zero object 0.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the endomorphisms of an arbitrary object X.")
    print("  - Start with the exponential isomorphism: Hom(A x X, Y) \u2245 Hom(A, Y^X).")
    print("  - Let's choose A=1, and Y=X. We get: Hom(1 x X, X) \u2245 Hom(1, X^X).")
    print("  - In any cartesian category, 1 x X \u2245 X. So, Hom(1 x X, X) \u2245 Hom(X, X).")
    print("  - Combining these gives the crucial isomorphism: Hom(X, X) \u2245 Hom(1, X^X).")

    print("\nStep 4: Use the fact that 1 is the zero object.")
    print("  - We substitute 0 for 1 in our isomorphism: Hom(X, X) \u2245 Hom(0, X^X).")
    print("  - Since 0 is the initial object, Hom(0, X^X) is a singleton set.")
    print("  - Therefore, Hom(X, X) must also be a singleton set.")

    print("\nStep 5: The final conclusion.")
    print("  - An abelian category requires Hom(X, X) to be a ring with an additive identity (0_X) and a multiplicative identity (id_X).")
    print("  - For this ring to be a singleton, the two identities must be the same.")
    print("  - This leads to the fundamental equation in the endomorphism ring:")

    multiplicative_identity = 1
    additive_identity = 0
    
    print(f"\n  Equation: {multiplicative_identity} = {additive_identity}\n")

    print("  - If id_X = 0_X for an object X, then X must be a zero object.")
    print("  - Since this holds for *any* object X, the entire category is trivial.")

    print("\n--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---")
    print("The proof shows the category is trivial. This means it is NOT non-trivial.")
    print("This contradicts option D.")
    print("However, if the question is a logic puzzle about a 'non-trivial cartesian closed abelian category', no such object exists.")
    print("In logic, any statement about the members of an empty set is 'vacuously true'.")
    print("Under this interpretation, the statement 'It is non-trivial' is vacuously true.")
