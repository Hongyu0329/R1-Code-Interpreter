    # Step 1 & 2: Set up the win condition and probability calculation.
    # Agent A wins if |D - r| < |F - r|, which simplifies to:
    # - If D > F, A wins if r > (D + F) / 2. Prob = 1 - (D + F) / 2.
    # - If D < F, A wins if r < (D + F) / 2. Prob = (D + F) / 2.
    # where r is uniform on [0, 1].

    # Step 3: Determine Agent A's optimal strategy for a given F.
    # A wants to choose D to maximize its win probability.
    # - If A chooses D > F, it maximizes P(A wins) = 1 - (D+F)/2 by making D as small
    #   as possible. As D approaches F from above, the probability approaches 1 - F.
    # - If A chooses D < F, it maximizes P(A wins) = (D+F)/2 by making D as large
    #   as possible. As D approaches F from below, the probability approaches F.
    # A will choose the better of these two options. So, for a given F, A's maximum
    # win probability is max(F, 1 - F).

    # Step 4: Find the optimal F to minimize A's win probability.
    # We need to find the value of F in [0, 1] that minimizes the function max(F, 1 - F).
    # This minimum occurs where F = 1 - F.
    # 2*F = 1  => F = 0.5
    F_optimal = 0.5

    # With this optimal F, we can find the minimized probability of A winning.
    minimized_prob_A_wins = max(F_optimal, 1 - F_optimal)

    # Step 5: Perform the final calculation.
    # The problem asks for floor(1 / P(A wins)).
    inverse_prob = 1 / minimized_prob_A_wins
