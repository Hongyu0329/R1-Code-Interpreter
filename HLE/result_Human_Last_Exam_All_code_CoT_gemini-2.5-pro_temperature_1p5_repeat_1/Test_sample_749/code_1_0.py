    This function demonstrates that the probability bound for the event E_0
    vanishes as h -> 0.

    The probability of infinite visits, P(E_0), is bounded by the probability P(M_E > 1).
    This in turn requires the random sum S_R to be larger than a value of order 1/h.
    The tail probability P(S_R > t) ~ t^{-alpha(h)}, where alpha(h) is a positive exponent.
    So, P(M_E > 1) is roughly (1/h)^{-alpha(h)}.
    We show that this expression goes to 0 as h -> 0.
