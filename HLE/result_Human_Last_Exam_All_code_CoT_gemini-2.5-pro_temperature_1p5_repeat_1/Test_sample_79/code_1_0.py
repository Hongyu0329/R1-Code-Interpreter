    # --- Statement 1 Analysis ---
    # The problem explicitly states that the phenotype has "no bearing on fitness"
    # and "all genotypes have equal fitness".
    # This is the definition of no natural selection acting on the trait.
    statement_1_must_be_true = True
    print("Statement 1: 'There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.'")
    print("Verdict: Must be true.")
    print("Reasoning: The problem description explicitly states that the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and that 'all genotypes have equal fitness'. This directly means there is no selection.\n")

    # --- Statement 2 Analysis ---
    # The problem states the population has "discrete and non-overlapping generations".
    # This is a standard term in population genetics meaning that the parental
    # generation dies before the offspring generation becomes reproductively mature.
    # Therefore, parents cannot be present to raise their offspring.
    statement_2_must_be_true = True
    print("Statement 2: 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
    print("Verdict: Must be true.")
    print("Reasoning: The term 'non-overlapping generations' implies that individuals of the parent generation are no longer alive when the offspring generation matures. This precludes parents from raising their offspring.\n")

    # --- Statement 3 Analysis ---
    # Speciation is an evolutionary process that results in new, distinct species.
    # The fundamental mechanisms that drive evolution and speciation are mutation,
    # selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. The problem states that NONE of these
    # mechanisms are at work in this population. Without any mechanism for evolutionary
    # change, the population cannot diverge or speciate.
    statement_3_must_be_true = True
    print("Statement 3: 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
    print("Verdict: Must be true.")
    print("Reasoning: The problem systematically removes all recognized mechanisms of evolution: mutation, selection, genetic drift (infinite population), and gene flow. As speciation is a product of evolution, it cannot occur if the underlying mechanisms are absent.\n")

    # --- Statement 4 Analysis ---
    # The phenotype (P) is a result of genotype (G) and environment (E). The
    # broad-sense heritability (H^2) is V_G / V_P = 0.7. This means that 30% of
    # the phenotypic variance is attributable to environmental variance (V_E).
    # The problem does not state that the environment is uniform across the entire
    # region. It is possible for the western and eastern halves to have different
    # environmental conditions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, soil). Such a systematic
    # environmental difference could lead to a substantial difference in the average
    # phenotype between the two groups, even if their genetic makeup is identical.
    statement_4_must_be_true = False
    print("Statement 4: 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.'")
    print("Verdict: Not necessarily true.")
    print("Reasoning: Since heritability is 0.7, the environment accounts for 30% of the variance in the phenotype. The problem does not guarantee a uniform environment across the region. A systematic environmental difference between the west and east could cause a substantial phenotypic difference between the two groups.\n")
