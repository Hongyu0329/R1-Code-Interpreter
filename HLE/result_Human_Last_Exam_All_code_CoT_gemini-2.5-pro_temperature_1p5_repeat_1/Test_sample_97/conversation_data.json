    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we must account for two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of solid Al(OH)3 into its ions and the subsequent formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion from the aluminum ion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Define Solubility (S):** The total molar solubility, S, is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution. In this case:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n2.  **Establish Equilibrium Relationships:** We will use the given equilibrium constants to relate the concentrations of the species to the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻].\n    *   From the K_sp expression, Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq):\n        [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   From the K_f expression, Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq):\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n        Substituting the expression for [Al³⁺], we get:\n        [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n\n3.  **Apply Charge Balance:** For the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges. The ions present are H⁺, OH⁻, Al³⁺, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Charge Balance: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\n4.  **Create and Solve the Master Equation:** We will substitute the relationships from step 2 and the water autoionization constant ([H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]) into the charge balance equation. This creates a single equation with [OH⁻] as the only unknown.\n    3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]) + [OH⁻]\n    This equation can be rearranged into a polynomial and solved for [OH⁻].\n\n5.  **Calculate Final Solubility:** Once [OH⁻] is found, we can calculate the concentrations of [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The sum of these concentrations gives the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the precise solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, considering both\n    simple dissolution and complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27  # Solubility product of Al(OH)3\n    K_f = 1.1e31   # Formation constant of Al(OH)4-\n    K_w = 1.0e-14  # Ion product of water\n\n    # The governing equation for the system is derived from the charge balance:\n    # 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH-] + [Al(OH)4-]\n    # Substituting equilibrium expressions leads to a polynomial in [OH-]:\n    # (1 + K_sp*K_f)*[OH-]^4 - K_w*[OH-]^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n    # This is a quadratic equation in y = [OH-]^2, of the form ay^2 + by + c = 0.\n\n    # Coefficients of the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n    a = 1 + K_sp * K_f\n    b = -K_w\n    c = -3 * K_sp\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for y.
