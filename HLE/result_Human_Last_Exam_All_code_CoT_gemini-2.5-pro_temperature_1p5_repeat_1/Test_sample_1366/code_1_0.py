    # Part (a): Analysis of the decomposition's existence.
    # This part is theoretical. The conclusion is based on the properties of
    # rational Vertex Operator Algebras. L_k(sl_2) at the given level is rational,
    # meaning it has a finite number of simple modules. The proposed decomposition
    # is an infinite sum, which presents a contradiction. Therefore, the decomposition
    # in this exact form is not possible. However, decompositions of other forms
    # (e.g., a finite sum with modules for a coset algebra) do exist for VOA modules.

    # Part (b): Top-level dimension of L(p)_n.
    # By definition in the problem statement, the top-level of the module L(p)_n
    # is the sl_2-module rho_n, whose dimension is n+1.

    # Part (c): Minimal conformal weight for p = 2.
    # The formula for the conformal weight of the top level of L(p)_n is h_n = p*n*(n+2)/4.
    # The minimal non-zero conformal weight corresponds to the n=1 term.
    # For n=1, the formula simplifies to h = 3*p/4.
    # We now calculate this value for p = 2.
