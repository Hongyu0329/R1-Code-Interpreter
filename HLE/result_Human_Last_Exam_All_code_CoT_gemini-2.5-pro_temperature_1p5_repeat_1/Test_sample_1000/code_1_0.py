    Calculates the smallest possible number of elements in a subset Y.
    The problem is to find the smallest size m of a set Y of k-dimensional
    subspaces of an n-dimensional space E, such that for any k-dimensional
    subspace V, the sum of intersections of V with elements of Y spans V.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    Let n be the dimension of the space E, and k be the dimension of the subspaces in X.
    n = 2023
    k = 2000
    
    The condition is Sum_{W in Y} (V intersect W) = V for any V in X.
    This condition fails if and only if there exist a V in X and a hyperplane H in V
    (dim(H) = k-1) such that V intersect W is a subspace of H for all W in Y.

    We can construct such a failing case if the size of Y, say m, is less than or
    equal to n-k.
    The construction needs finding m+1 linearly independent vectors in a space of dimension
    n-k+1. This is possible if m+1 <= n-k+1, i.e., m <= n-k.
    
    For this problem, n-k = 2023-2000=3. So, for m <= 3, we can construct a
    counterexample.
    This implies that the minimal required size m must be at least (n-k)+1.

    The minimal size is therefore n - k + 1.
