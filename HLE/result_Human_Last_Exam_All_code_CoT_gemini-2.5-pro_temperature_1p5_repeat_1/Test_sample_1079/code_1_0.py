# The goal is to find the number of elements in the reflection group H3
# that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.

# Step 1: Define the properties of the reflection group H3.
# The group H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron.
# The order of the group H3, denoted as |H3|, is 120.
order_H3 = 120

# The Coxeter number of H3, denoted as h, is 10.
coxeter_number_H3 = 10

# Step 2: Apply the relevant mathematical theory.
# A theorem by Springer (1974) states that an element 'w' of a finite Coxeter group W
# has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order d if and only if 'w' is
# conjugate to a Coxeter element of order d.
# In our case, the group is H3 and the eigenvalue has order 10, which is the
# Coxeter number of H3. Thus, the elements we seek are exactly those in the
# conjugacy class of a Coxeter element of H3.

# Step 3: Calculate the size of this conjugacy class.
# The size of the Coxeter conjugacy class is given by the formula: |W| / h,
# where |W| is the order of the group and h is the Coxeter number.
num_elements = order_H3 / coxeter_number_H3

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.
print("The problem asks for the number of elements in the reflection group H3 with a specific property.")
print("This property (having a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10) defines the Coxeter conjugacy class.")
print(f"The order of the group H3 is: {order_H3}")
print(f"The Coxeter number for H3 is: {coxeter_number_H3}")
print("The number of such elements is the order of the group divided by the Coxeter number.")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"{order_H3} / {coxeter_number_H3} = {int(num_elements)}")
