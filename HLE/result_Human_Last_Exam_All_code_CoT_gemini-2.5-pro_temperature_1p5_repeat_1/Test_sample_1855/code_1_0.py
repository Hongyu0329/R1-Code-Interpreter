# Step 1: Define constants and given values
# Physical constants are rounded to three decimal places as requested.
# All other calculations retain full precision based on these constants.

# Given masses in GeV
m_delta = 1.233  # Delta baryon mass
m_p = 0.938      # Proton mass (PDG value ~0.938272 GeV, rounded)

# Temperature values in Kelvin
T = 2.73   # Current CMB temperature
T_0 = 2.7    # Base temperature for perturbation

# Boltzmann's constant in GeV/K, rounded to three decimal places
# The full value is k â‰ˆ 8.617333 x 10^-14 GeV/K
k = 8.617e-14  # GeV/K

# Coefficients for photon energy calculation from the problem description
c1_coeff = 2.71       # Coefficient for the linear term
c2_coeff = 1.0e-10    # Coefficient for the perturbative term [GeV/K^2]
