    "To solve the given infinite product, I will find its closed-form expression in terms of known mathematical functions. The variable `z` is treated as a complex variable for which the product converges.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Factor the general term:** The term inside the product, $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$, will be factored using the formula for the difference of cubes and the complex cube roots of unity.\n2.  **Relate to the Gamma function:** The resulting factors will be used to construct infinite products that are related to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. The identity $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)}$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, will be established.\n3.  **Adjust the starting index:** The given product starts from $n=3$, not $n=1$. I will adjust the result from the previous step by dividing out the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n4.  **Final Expression and Code:** I will combine the results to get the final closed-form expression. A Python script will be provided to print this result, clearly displaying the final equation and all the numbers involved, as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Factorization:**\n    The term inside the product is $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$. We can write this as $\\frac{n^3 - z^3}{n^3}$. The numerator $n^3 - z^3$ can be factored using the cube roots of unity, $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$.\n    The factorization is $n^3 - z^3 = (n-z)(n-z\\omega)(n-z\\omega^2)$.\n    So, the term becomes:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\frac{(n-z)(n-z\\omega)(n-z\\omega^2)}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Relating to the Gamma Function:**\n    The infinite product can be expressed as:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right) \\cdot \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n    We use the product representation of the Gamma function, which comes from the Weierstrass product:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1-x)} $$\n    The product $\\prod (1-z^3/n^3)$ converges since $\\sum 1/n^3$ converges. We can relate it to the Gamma function product by noting that the convergence factors $e^{z/n}, e^{z\\omega/n}, e^{z\\omega^2/n}$ multiply to $e^{z(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)/n} = e^0 = 1$.\n    This leads to the identity:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjusting the Starting Index:**\n    The product in the question starts at $n=3$. We can find it by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing by the first two terms ($n=1$ and $n=2$):\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Final Expression:**\n    Substituting the expression for the product from $n=1$, we get:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\nThe following Python code prints the final equation, showing each number involved.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the closed-form expression for the\n    infinite product prod_{n=3 to inf}(1 - z^3/n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the final equation to explicitly show all numbers.\n    n_start = 3\n    power = 3\n\n    # Left-hand side of the equation\n    lhs = f\"Product_{{n={n_start} to inf}}(1 - z^{power}/n^{power})\"\n\n    # Right-hand side components\n    term_n1 = f\"(1 - z^{power}/{1**power})\"\n    term_n2 = f\"(1 - z^{power}/{2**power})\"\n    gamma_product = f\"Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w^2)\"\n\n    # Right-hand side of the equation\n    rhs = f\"1 / ({term_n1} * {term_n2} * {gamma_product})\"\n    \n    # Explanation of symbols used\n    explanation = (\"where w = e^(2*pi*i/3) is the primitive cube root of unity,\"\n                   \" and Gamma is the Gamma function.\")\n\n    # Print the full result\n    print(f\"{lhs} =\")\n    print(rhs)\n    print()\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_and_print_product_formula()\n```\n<<<1/((1 - z**3)*(1 - z**3/8)*Gamma(1 - z)*Gamma(1 - z*w)*Gamma(1 - z*w**2)), where w = e^(2*pi*i/3)>>>"
