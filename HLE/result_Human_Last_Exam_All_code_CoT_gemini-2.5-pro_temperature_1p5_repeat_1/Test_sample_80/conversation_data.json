    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Number of Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The inner area, which is a 6x6 board, contains 36 squares. The number of edge squares is the total number of squares minus the inner squares (64 - 36 = 28).\n\n2.  **Separate by Color:** A key property of bishops is that they always remain on squares of the same color. This allows us to solve the problem for white edge squares and black edge squares independently. Of the 28 edge squares, 14 are white and 14 are black.\n\n3.  **Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares:** We need to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the 14 white edge squares without any of them attacking each other. By analyzing the diagonals, we can find a configuration. For instance, placing bishops on all the white squares of the 'a' file and 'h' file (`a2, a4, a6, h1, h3, h5, h7`) is a valid arrangement of 7 non-attacking bishops. It can be shown that it's not possible to place more than 7.\n\n4.  **Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares:** By symmetry, the same logic applies to the 14 black edge squares. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is also 7.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Bishops:** Since bishops on white squares can never attack bishops on black squares, we can simply add the results from the two color groups. The total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge is 7 (white) + 7 (black) = 14.\n\n6.  **Calculate Empty Edge Squares:** The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops. This is the total number of edge squares minus the total number of bishops we placed. So, 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    total_squares = board_size * board_size\n    inner_board_size = board_size - 2\n    inner_squares = inner_board_size * inner_board_size\n    total_edge_squares = total_squares - inner_squares\n\n    # Step 2: Note the number of squares per color (not strictly needed for the calculation\n    # but good for understanding). Total edge squares are split evenly.\n    white_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n    black_edge_squares = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Steps 3 & 4: The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the\n    # 14 white edge squares is 7. By symmetry, it's also 7 for the 14 black edge squares.\n    max_bishops_on_white_edges = 7\n    max_bishops_on_black_edges = 7\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the total number of bishops that can be placed.\n    total_bishops_placed = max_bishops_on_white_edges + max_bishops_on_black_edges\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the number of edge squares lacking bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - total_bishops_placed\n\n    print(\"Problem: How many edge squares would lack bishops if the maximum number of non-attacking bishops are placed on them?\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
