# Plan:
# 1. Model the topological space by simplifying it to a graph. A pair of pants
#    can be simplified (deformation retracted) to a Y-shaped graph.
# 2. Count the vertices (V) and edges (E) of the graph that results from
#    sewing and identifying the two pant-graphs as described.
# 3. Use the formula for the fundamental group of a graph, which is the free
#    group on k generators where k = E - V + 1.

# Define the number of vertices and edges of the final graph.
# After simplification, our space is represented by a graph with:
# - 2 central vertices (one from each Y-graph)
# - 3 junction vertices (one for the identified waistbands, two for the
#   identified pairs of leg openings)
# Total vertices V = 2 + 3 = 5.
num_vertices = 5

# The graph has edges connecting each of the 2 central vertices to each of the
# 3 junction vertices.
# Total edges E = 2 * 3 = 6.
num_edges = 6

# For a connected graph, the rank of its fundamental group (the number of
# generators) is calculated with the formula: rank = E - V + 1.
rank = num_edges - num_vertices + 1

# Print the step-by-step calculation and the result.
