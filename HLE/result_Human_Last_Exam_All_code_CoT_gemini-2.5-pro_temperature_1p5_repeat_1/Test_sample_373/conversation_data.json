    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan and explanation\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** A \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" is typically interpreted as two complete graphs (`K_n`) connected by a single edge (the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\"). Since the total number of nodes is 10, each complete graph must have 5 nodes (`n=5`). Let's call the two complete graphs `A` and `B`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Nodes:** The bottleneck edge connects one node from graph `A` (let's call it `u`) to one node from graph `B` (let's call it `v`).\n\n3.  **Understand the Process (Randomized Uniform Gossiping):** This process has two steps:\n    *   First, one node is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of choosing any specific node is `1/N`. Here, `N=10`.\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random. The probability of it choosing a specific neighbor is `1 / degree(node)`, where `degree(node)` is the number of neighbors the node has.\n\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** To find the probability, we need the degrees of the two nodes (`u` and `v`) connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Within its own complete graph `K_5`, node `u` is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   The bottleneck edge adds one more connection to a node in the other graph.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of `u` is `deg(u) = (5 - 1) + 1 = 5`.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of `v` is also `deg(v) = 5`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u,v)` is sampled if one of two things happens:\n    *   **Case 1:** Node `u` is selected, and it chooses neighbor `v`.\n        *   `P(Case 1) = P(u is chosen) * P(u chooses v) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n    *   **Case 2:** Node `v` is selected, and it chooses neighbor `u`.\n        *   `P(Case 2) = P(v is chosen) * P(v chooses u) = (1/N) * (1/deg(v)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive cases.\n    *   `P(bottleneck sampled) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25 = 0.04`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two 5-node complete graphs (cliques).\n    nodes_in_clique = total_nodes // 2\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique. Let's call them u and v.\n    # We need to calculate their degrees.\n    # The degree of a node in a K_n graph is n-1.\n    # The bottleneck edge adds 1 to the degree of u and v.\n    degree_u = (nodes_in_clique - 1) + 1\n    degree_v = (nodes_in_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) in uniform gossiping is:\n    # P(sample) = P(choose u) * P(u chooses v) + P(choose v) * P(v chooses u)\n    # P(choose node) = 1 / total_nodes\n    # P(node chooses neighbor) = 1 / degree(node)\n\n    prob_u_chooses_v = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u)\n    prob_v_chooses_u = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)\n\n    total_probability = prob_u_chooses_v + prob_v_chooses_u\n\n    # Output the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n    print(f\"The barbell graph has N = {total_nodes} nodes.\")\n    print(f\"It consists of two K_{nodes_in_clique} complete graphs.\")\n    print(f\"The two nodes on the bottleneck edge, u and v, have degrees:\")\n    print(f\"deg(u) = {degree_u}, deg(v) = {degree_v}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v) is:\")\n    print(f\"P(sample) = P(choose u) * P(u chooses v) + P(choose v) * P(v chooses u)\")\n    print(f\"P(sample) = (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_u}) + (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_v})\")\n    print(f\"P(sample) = ({prob_u_chooses_v}) + ({prob_v_chooses_u})\")\n    print(f\"P(sample) = {total_probability}\")\n    print(\"\\nAs a fraction, this is 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\")\n\nsolve_gossip_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
