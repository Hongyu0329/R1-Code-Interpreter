    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to answer your question. First, I will research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, focusing on significant changes made around the mid-20th century. My research indicates that a specific transportation feature was removed around that time as part of a city-wide modernization effort. I will then create a Python script to present this information to you. The script will store the name of the feature in a variable and then print it out in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the unique feature removed from\n    Piazza della Rotonda around 1950.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The feature in question was part of Rome's public transport system.\n    feature_removed = \"The tram tracks\"\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n    year_of_removal = 1950\n\n    print(f\"The unique feature removed from the {location} around {year_of_removal} was: {feature_removed}.\")\n    print(\"Their removal was part of a post-WWII plan to modernize the city's traffic flow, favoring buses and cars.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<The tram tracks>>>"
