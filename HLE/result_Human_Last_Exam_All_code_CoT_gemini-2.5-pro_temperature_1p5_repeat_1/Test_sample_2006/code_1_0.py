# The riddle describes the coefficients of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

# Line 1: "An August tempest" -> 'August' is the 8th month.
a = 8

# Line 3: "A divine one yields" -> A 'divine one' is a common clue for 9.
c = 9

# Line 2: "Twice fifteen brings winds of change" -> Interpreted as -(2 + 15).
# "Twice" -> 2, "fifteen" -> 15. "brings" -> +. "winds of change" -> negative.
b = -(2 + 15)

# The full equation is 8x^2 - 17x + 9 = 0.
# The code will print out each component of the equation.
print(f"The haiku describes a quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0")
print(f"Based on the clues:")
print(f"  a = {a} (from 'August')")
print(f"  b = {b} (from '-(Twice + fifteen)')")
print(f"  c = {c} (from 'a divine one')")
print(f"\nThe final equation is: {a}x^2 + ({b})x + {c} = 0")

# Solving the equation to find the two answers:
# (8x - 9)(x - 1) = 0
# The roots are x = 9/8 and x = 1.
# To find the final answer, we sort the English words for the roots:
# "nine-eighths" and "one".
# Alphabetically, "nine-eighths" comes before "one".
# The final answer is the numerical value 9/8.
final_answer = "9/8"
# The puzzle does not require code to solve the final answer, but to present the equation.
# The final answer is determined by reasoning outside the code.
