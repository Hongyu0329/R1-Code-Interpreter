    "To design a deadbeat observer, we aim to place the eigenvalues of the observer error matrix, `A - LC`, at the origin of the complex plane (i.e., all eigenvalues are zero). This ensures that the observation error `e(k)` converges to zero in a finite number of steps, at most `n` steps, where `n` is the order of the system (here, `n=4`).\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. We can solve it by leveraging the principle of duality between observability and controllability. The eigenvalues of `A - LC` are identical to the eigenvalues of its transpose, `(A - LC)^T = A^T - C^T L^T`.\n\nThis transformed problem is equivalent to designing a state-feedback controller for a \"dual\" system with system matrix `A_dual = A^T` and input matrix `B_dual = C^T`. We want to find a controller gain `K = L^T` such that the closed-loop system `A_dual - B_dual * K` has all its eigenvalues at zero.\n\nThis is possible if the dual system `(A^T, C^T)` is controllable, which is true if and only if the original system `(A, C)` is observable. For the given matrices, the system is indeed observable.\n\nThe following Python script implements this method using the `scipy` library to perform the pole placement calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import signal\n\ndef solve_observer_gain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer by placing poles at the origin using the dual system approach.\n    \"\"\"\n    # System matrices from the problem description\n    A = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1], \n                  [1, 0, 0, 2], \n                  [0, 1, 0, -1], \n                  [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n    \n    C = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], \n                  [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n    # The state dimension\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all desired poles are at the origin.\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # The dual system for pole placement\n    A_dual = A.T\n    B_dual = C.T\n\n    # First, verify that the system is observable (which means the dual is controllable)\n    observability_matrix = signal.obsv(A, C)\n    if np.linalg.matrix_rank(observability_matrix) < n:\n        print(\"System is not observable. A deadbeat observer cannot be designed to control all states.\")\n        return\n\n    # Use scipy's pole placement function to find the controller gain K for the dual system.\n    # The gain K is such that the eigenvalues of (A_dual - B_dual @ K) are the desired_poles.\n    place_poles_result = signal.place_poles(A_dual, B_dual, desired_poles, method='YT')\n    K = place_poles_result.gain_matrix\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the controller gain K.\n    L = K.T\n    \n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    # We use a loop to print the matrix nicely, fulfilling the \"output each number\" instruction.\n    # We round to a few decimal places to avoid printing floating-point noise.\n    for row in L:\n        print(\" \".join(f\"{num:9.4f}\" for num in row))\n\n    # Verification of the result (optional)\n    # The eigenvalues of (A - L @ C) should be at the origin.\n    # A_obs = A - L @ C\n    # computed_poles = np.linalg.eigvals(A_obs)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: Computed eigenvalues of (A - LC):\")\n    # print(np.round(computed_poles, 4))\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_observer_gain()\n```\n<<<[[ -2.  -1.]\n [  0.   1.]\n [  1.  -1.]\n [ -1.   3.]]>>>"
