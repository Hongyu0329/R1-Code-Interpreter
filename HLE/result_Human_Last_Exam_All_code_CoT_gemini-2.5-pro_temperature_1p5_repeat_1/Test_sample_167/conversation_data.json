    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Alon-Tarsi Number**: I will start by explaining what the Alon-Tarsi number of a graph is. For a graph G, it is the smallest integer `k` for which there is an orientation D of G satisfying two conditions:\n    a) The out-degree of every vertex is at most `k-1`.\n    b) A technical condition about Eulerian subgraphs holds (the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd ones).\n2.  **Specialize to K_n,n**: For a complete bipartite graph with partitions of equal size, like $K_{1000,1000}$, the second condition is known to always be true. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the smallest `k` that satisfies the first condition.\n3.  **Find the Optimal Orientation**: I will find the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree over all possible orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$. This value, let's call it `m_min`, will determine the Alon-Tarsi number.\n    *   I'll establish a lower bound on `m_min` by calculating the average out-degree of the graph. The maximum out-degree must be at least the average.\n    *   I'll then show how to construct an orientation that achieves this lower bound, proving that it is indeed the minimum. This involves decomposing the graph into perfect matchings.\n4.  **Calculate the Final Number**: Once `m_min` is found, the Alon-Tarsi number `k` is simply `m_min + 1`. The python code will perform this calculation step-by-step for $n=1000$ and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the Alon-Tarsi number of K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 1000\n\n    print(f\"Finding the Alon-Tarsi number for the complete bipartite graph G = K_n,n, where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Explain the core concept for this specific graph\n    print(\"The Alon-Tarsi number, k, for a balanced bipartite graph like K_n,n is determined by the minimum possible maximum out-degree (m_min) over all orientations of the graph.\")\n    print(\"The relationship is k = m_min + 1.\")\n    print(\"\\nOur task is to find m_min for K_1000,1000.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the average out-degree to find a lower bound for m_min\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the average out-degree of the graph.\")\n    num_vertices = 2 * n\n    num_edges = n * n\n    avg_out_degree = num_edges / num_vertices\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is 2 * {n} = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of edges is {n} * {n} = {num_edges}.\")\n    print(\"The sum of out-degrees in any orientation equals the number of edges.\")\n    print(f\"The average out-degree is (Total Edges) / (Total Vertices) = {num_edges} / {num_vertices} = {int(avg_out_degree)}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum out-degree in any orientation must be at least {int(avg_out_degree)}.\")\n    print(f\"This gives us a lower bound: m_min >= {int(avg_out_degree)}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 2: Construct an orientation that meets this bound\n    print(\"Step 2: Construct an optimal orientation.\")\n    print(f\"The graph K_{n},{n} is an {n}-regular graph.
