A)[Let \(k\) be the largest odd divisor of \(\ell\). The cardinality of \(U_\ell\) is given by \(|U_\ell| = \sum_{d|k} 2^{\omega(d)}\) if \(\ell\) is odd, and \(|U_\ell| = 2 \sum_{d|k} 2^{\omega(d)}\) if \(\ell\) is even, where \(\omega(d)\) is the number of distinct prime factors of \(d\).] B)[Let the prime factorization of \(\ell\) be \(p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_s^{e_s}\). The cardinality of \(T_\ell\) is given by \(|T_\ell| = 1\) if \(\ell=1\) (which corresponds to \(s=0\)). If \(\ell > 1\) (which corresponds to \(s > 0\)), the cardinality is \(|T_\ell| = \left(\prod_{i=1}^s (1+2e_i)\right) - 1\).]
