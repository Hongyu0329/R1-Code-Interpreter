    "Of course. Here is the explanation and the Python code to find the leading-order expression for the fixed-point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Beta Function**: The core of this problem is the renormalization group (RG) flow of the coupling constant, which is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u)$. In $\\phi^4$ theory in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, the one-loop beta function is given by a well-known expression.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the RG flow stops, meaning the coupling constant does not change with the energy scale. Mathematically, this corresponds to the condition $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point**: I will set the beta function to zero and solve the resulting algebraic equation for $u^*$. This equation will have a trivial solution ($u^*=0$, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one.\n4.  **Extract the Leading Order Expression**: The non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, will give the leading-order expression for $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n5.  **Present the solution using Python**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to define the symbols and solve the equation, then print out the steps and the final result clearly, showing how each numerical part contributes to the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the leading order expression for the fixed point\n    coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions (d=4-epsilon).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the symbols for our equation\n    u_star = sympy.Symbol('u*')\n    epsilon = sympy.Symbol('ε')\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Beta Function for ϕ⁴ Theory\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"In d = 4 - ε dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the coupling u is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ε*u + (3 / (16*π²)) * u²\\n\")\n\n    # Define the beta function expression using sympy\n    # The coefficients are standard results from quantum field theory.\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u_star + (3 / (16 * pi**2)) * u_star**2\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Fixed Point Condition\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A fixed point u* is found where the beta function is zero:\")\n    print(\"β(u*) = 0\")\n    print(f\"{sympy.pretty(beta_function)} = 0\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Solving for the Fixed Point u*\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    # Solve the equation beta(u*) = 0 for u*\n    solutions = sympy.solve(beta_function, u_star)\n\n    # We are interested in the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point\n    wilson_fisher_fp = None\n    for sol in solutions:\n        if sol != 0:\n            wilson_fisher_fp = sol\n            break\n\n    print(\"The equation has two solutions:\")\n    print(f\"  1.
