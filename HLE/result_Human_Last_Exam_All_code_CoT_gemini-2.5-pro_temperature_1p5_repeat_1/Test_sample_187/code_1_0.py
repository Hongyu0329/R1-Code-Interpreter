    The errors are:
    1. Use of `^` for exponentiation, which is XOR in standard Python. This affects lines 11, 29, 30, 31.
    2. Use of `/` for division of integers, which results in floating-point numbers in Python 3,
       violating the "precise arithmetic" requirement. This affects lines 22, 23.
