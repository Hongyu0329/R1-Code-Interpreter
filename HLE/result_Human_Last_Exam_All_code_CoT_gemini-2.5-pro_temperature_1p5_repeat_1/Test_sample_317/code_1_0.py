    explanation = """
In Kenneth Burke's framework, a crucial distinction is made between the realms of 'motion' and 'action'.

1.  **Realm of Motion:** This is the non-symbolic, physical world. It includes everything that happens without intention or symbolic meaning, such as the falling of a stone or the growth of a plant. It is the realm of physics and biology. Things in this realm are sensory or abstract physical principles.

2.  **Realm of Action:** This is the uniquely human sphere of symbols, language, motive, and choice. For Burke, the defining characteristic of this realm is the invention of the 'Negative'. Nature is only positive; it only 'is'. There are trees, but there are no 'not-trees' in the physical world. The concept of 'not' is a symbolic creation of humanity.

3.  **The "Tribal No":** This concept refers to the foundational prohibitions and commandments of a culture ("Thou shalt not..."). It is the basis of morality, law, and social order.

4.  **Conclusion:** The "Tribal No" is fundamentally a system of negatives. It is not a physical object or a natural process; you cannot see or touch a 'prohibition'. It exists entirely within the symbolic system of a language and a culture. Because it is symbolic and defined by the Negative, it resides squarely in the realm of **action**. The term **imaginal** is apt because these prohibitions are products of the human imaginationâ€”ideas that structure social reality even though they have no physical substance. Thus, the "Tribal No" is a function of action because it is imaginal.
