    "To answer your question, I will first identify the specific genus of the bacterium based on established scientific knowledge. Then, to adhere to the request for a coding solution, I will write a simple Python script. This script will store the name of the genus in a variable and then print it as the answer to the question.\n\n```python\n# The question asks for the genus of a bacterium that produces a triboluminescent compound.\n# Triboluminescence is light produced when a material is mechanically stressed.\n# The bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens produces a protein called luciferase.\n# When crystals of this luciferase are crushed or broken, they emit light, which is a form of triboluminescence.\n# Therefore, the genus is Photorhabdus.\n\n# Storing the answer in a variable\ngenus_name = \"Photorhabdus\"\n\n# Printing the final answer\nprint(\"The genus of bacterium that produces a chemical compound exhibiting triboluminescent properties is:\")\nprint(genus_name)\n```\n<<<Photorhabdus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What genus of bacterium produces a chemical compound that exhibits triboluminescent properties?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
