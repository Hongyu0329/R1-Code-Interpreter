    This problem asks for the asymptotic lower bound of the hidden dimension 'm'
    for a fully connected network that approximates the q-sparse average (qSA) function.

    Here's a breakdown of the derivation:
    1.  The network is of the form f(x) = g(Wx), where x is the flattened input matrix X,
        W is the weight matrix of size m x Nd, and g is an arbitrary function.
        The network must epsilon-approximate qSA with epsilon = 1/(2q).

    2.  The core idea is to construct a set of inputs {X_k} for which the qSA outputs
        are far apart. The approximation condition implies that the network's hidden
        representations {Wx_k} must also be distinct.

    3.  This means that the linear transformation W must be injective on this set of inputs.
        If V is the vector space spanned by the differences of these input vectors
        (e.g., V = span{x_k - x_1}), then the dimension of V provides a lower bound
        on the rank of W, and thus on m. So, m >= dim(V).

    4.  The construction is as follows:
        a. Let n = N/2. We divide the N input rows into n "source" rows and n "destination" rows.
        b. We partition the n source rows into K = floor(n/q) = floor(N/(2q)) disjoint blocks
           of indices, B_1, ..., B_K, each of size q.
        c. We also partition the n destination rows into K blocks, D_1, ..., D_K.
        d. We can define K! different "routing" tasks, specified by a permutation pi
           of {1, ..., K}. For each permutation pi, we create an input X_pi where for each
           destination block D_j, the y-vectors of its rows point to the source block B_{pi(j)}.
        e. We set the z-vectors of the source rows to be orthonormal vectors.

    5.  Analysis of the construction:
        a. The qSA outputs for these different inputs can be shown to be well-separated,
           forcing the hidden representations Wx_pi to be distinct for each permutation pi.
        b. The flattened input vectors {x_pi} differ only in their y-components for the
           destination rows.
        c. The set of difference vectors {x_pi - x_rho} spans a vector space whose
           dimension is related to the number of permutations. A careful analysis shows
           that this construction forces the dimension of V to be at least K-1.

    6.  The resulting lower bound is m >= K-1 = floor(N/(2q)) - 1.

    7.  Asymptotically, as N grows, this lower bound is Omega(N/q).
