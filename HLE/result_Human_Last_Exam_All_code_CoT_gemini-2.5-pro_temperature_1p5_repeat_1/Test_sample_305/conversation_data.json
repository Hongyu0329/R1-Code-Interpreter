    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we can perform a systematic search. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: We are given a set with 3 elements, let's call it $S = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$. We need to find the number of binary operations `*` on this set that satisfy two properties: commutativity and associativity.\n\n2.  **Commutativity**: A binary operation is commutative if for any two elements `x` and `y` in $S$, `x * y = y * x`. This property implies that the operation's multiplication table (Cayley table) is symmetric across its main diagonal. To define a commutative operation on a set of size `n=3`, we only need to specify the results for pairs `(i, j)` where `i <= j`. For `n=3`, there are `n * (n+1) / 2 = 3 * 4 / 2 = 6` such pairs: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, and `(2,2)`. Since the result of each of these operations can be any of the 3 elements in $S$, the total number of distinct commutative operations is $3^6 = 729$.\n\n3.  **Associativity**: A binary operation is associative if for any three elements `x`, `y`, and `z` in $S`, `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`. Unlike commutativity, there is no simple formula to count the number of associative operations.\n\n4.  **Computational Approach**: The plan is to iterate through all 729 possible commutative operations. For each operation, we will test if it also satisfies the associative property. A counter will track how many operations pass this test. The final count will be our answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will print the numbers used in the setup and the final calculated result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations \n    on a set of a given size by iterating through all possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n\n    # A commutative operation on a set of size n is determined by the values\n    # for pairs (i, j) where i <= j.
