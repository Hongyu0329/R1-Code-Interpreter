        'Analysis of CD80/CD86': "CD80 and CD86 are crucial co-stimulatory molecules that provide a 'second signal' for T cell activation, but they do not present the antigen itself. They support the APC function but are not the primary presenting receptor.",
        'Analysis of TIM-4': "TIM-4 is involved in recognizing and clearing apoptotic cells, a process called efferocytosis. It is not the primary receptor for presenting antigens to activate T cells.",
        'Analysis of MHC class II': "MHC class II is the key molecule that defines professional APCs. Engineering a T cell to express MHC class II would grant it the ability to present external antigens to helper T cells, effectively making it function as an APC."
