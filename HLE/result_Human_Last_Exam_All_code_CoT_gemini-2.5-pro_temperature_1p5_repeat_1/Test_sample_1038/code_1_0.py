    # --- Analysis ---
    # In subthreshold, the current (I_sub) is approximated by:
    # I_sub = I_0 * exp( (Vgs - Vt) / (n * Ut) )
    # With a fixed gate voltage (Vg) and a varying source voltage (Vs),
    # Vgs = Vg - Vs. As Vs varies by +/- v_offset, Vgs also varies by +/- v_offset.
    # The ratio of the maximum current to the minimum current shows the instability.
    # Ratio = I_max / I_min = exp( (Vgs_nominal + v_offset) / (n*Ut) ) / exp( (Vgs_nominal - v_offset) / (n*Ut) )
    # This simplifies to: exp( 2 * v_offset / (n * Ut) )
