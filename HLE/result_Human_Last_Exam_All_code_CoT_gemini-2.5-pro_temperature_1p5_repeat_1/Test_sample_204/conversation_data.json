    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use a topological argument based on the structure of the field.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the vector field.** The field `(nx, ny, nz)` is expressed in spherical coordinates where the polar angle is `G` and the azimuthal angle is `f`. This structure is known as an axially symmetric ansatz.\n2.  **Identify topological winding numbers.** For such fields, the Hopf charge `Q` is the product of two integer winding numbers: `Q = k * m`.\n    *   `k` is the azimuthal winding number, determined by how the field wraps around the z-axis. This is given by the function `f = atan2(y,x)`. As we circle the z-axis in the xy-plane, `f` goes from `0` to `2*PI`, meaning the field wraps around once. So, `k = 1`.\n    *   `m` is the poloidal winding number, determined by the profile function `G` in any half-plane containing the z-axis (the `(rho, z)` plane, where `rho = sqrt(x^2+y^2)`).\n3.  **Determine the poloidal winding number `m`.** The function `G` is defined as `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`.\n    *   The value of `G` is maximized when `r2` is minimized. `r2 = sqrt((rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2)` is zero at `rho=sqrt(0.5)` and `z=0`. At this point (which is a circle in 3D), `G = PI`.\n    *   The value of `G` is minimized when `r2` goes to infinity. This happens as the distance from the core circle goes to infinity. In this limit, `G = 0`.\n    *   The function `G` smoothly interpolates from `PI` at the core to `0` at infinity. In topology, such a map from a plane (`(rho,z)` plane) to a sphere (defined by the angle `G`) that covers the sphere from the south pole (`G=PI`) to the north pole (`G=0`) has a poloidal winding number `m = 1`.\n4.  **Calculate the Hopf Charge.** With `k=1` and `m=1`, the Hopf charge is `Q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nAn alternative way to think about this is by calculating the linking number between the preimages of two points on the sphere `S^2`. Let's calculate the linking number between the core of the soliton (preimage of the South Pole) and a field line (preimage of a regular point like the one on the equator). This is a common method in physics.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this linking number calculation, which confirms the non-trivial topology of the field. The magnitude of the linking number is the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_linking_number_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the properties needed to determine the linking number\n    between the pre-image of the South Pole and the pre-image of a point on the equator.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The pre-image of the South Pole (G=PI) is the circle C_S:\n    # x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0.\n    # We consider the disk D_S bounded by this circle.\n    radius_squared_CS = 0.5\n    print(f\"The core of the soliton is a circle C_S in the z=0 plane with radius^2 = {radius_squared_CS}.\")\n    \n    # The pre-image of a regular point, e.g. P=(1,0,0) (f=0, G=PI/2), is a curve C_P.\n    # For this point, G=PI/2, which means exp(-10*r2) = 0.5.\n    # This leads to -10*r2 = ln(0.5) = -ln(2).\n    # So, r2 = ln(2)/10.\n    # The equation for the curve C_P is (rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2, where R = ln(2)/10.\n    R = math.log(2) / 10.0\n    R_squared = R**2\n    print(f\"The equation for the field line curve C_P is (rho^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = R^2, with R = ln(2)/10 ~ {R:.4f}.\")\n\n    # To find the linking number, we find where C_P pierces the disk D_S.\n    # C_P lies in the y=0 plane.
