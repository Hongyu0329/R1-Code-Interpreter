# Step 1: Determine n1 and n2
# Based on the theory of Picard-Fuchs equations for hyperelliptic curves, the order u_r(n) for a potential V(q) ~ q^2 - q^n
# is reduced from the standard n-1 to n/2 - 1 if and only if n is an even integer (>2).
# The conditions u_r(n-1) = n-2 and u_r(n+1) = n hold for these even n because n-1 and n+1 are odd,
# for which the standard order formula applies.
# We need the 1st and 2nd smallest positive integers n satisfying these conditions.
# The smallest positive even integer n > 2 is 4. The second smallest is 6.
n1 = 4
n2 = 6

print(f"The first smallest integer is n1 = {n1}")

# Step 2: Calculate alpha
# alpha is defined as (n1-1)/n2
alpha = (n1 - 1) / n2

# Step 3: Formulate and simplify the Hamiltonian
# H(p, q) = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - C * q^(n1/2))

n1_over_2 = n1 / 2

C = (2 / n1) * math.sqrt(C_sqrt_arg)
n1_power = n1 / 2

print(f"The power of q is n1/2 = {n1_power}")
print(f"So, H = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - {C}*q^{n1_power}) = 1/2 * (p^2 + 1/2 * q^2)")
print("This simplifies to H = p^2/2 + 1/4 * q^2")
print("This is the Hamiltonian for a simple harmonic oscillator with potential V(q) = 1/4 * q^2.")

# Step 4: Calculate the period T(alpha)
# The period of a harmonic oscillator H = p^2/(2m) + 1/2 * k * q^2 is T = 2*pi*sqrt(m/k).
# In our case, m=1 and 1/2 * k * q^2 = 1/4 * q^2, which means k = 1/2.
m = 1
k = 0.5
print(f"The period is calculated using the formula T = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k) with m={m} and k={k}.")
print("The function T(alpha) is the period of this Hamiltonian.")
print("Since the period is a constant for any energy, its value is independent of alpha.")
print("The final equation is T = 2 * pi * sqrt(2).")

# Output each number in the final equation
factor1 = 2
factor2 = math.pi
factor3 = math.sqrt(2)
result = factor1 * factor2 * factor3

print(f"Component 1: 2")
print(f"Component 2 (pi): {factor2}")
print(f"Component 3 (sqrt(2)): {factor3}")
print(f"The final result T({alpha}) is 2 * {factor2} * {factor3} = {result}")
