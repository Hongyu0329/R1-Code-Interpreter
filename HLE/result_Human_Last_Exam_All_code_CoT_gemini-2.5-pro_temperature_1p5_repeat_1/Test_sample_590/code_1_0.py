    This function calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.

    The stability operator is given by:
    L = (1/(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * ∂_ρ(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|**(-1)∂_ρ) + (1/<ρ>**2) * Δ_S + n(n-1)/<ρ>**(2n)

    Our method is based on the spectral theory of differential operators.

    1.  **Separation of Variables**: We decompose the eigenproblem `L u = λ u` using eigenfunctions of the form u(ρ, θ) = f(ρ)Y_k(θ), where Y_k are spherical harmonics, eigenfunctions of the spherical Laplacian Δ_S with eigenvalues -k(k+n-2). This results in a family of 1D radial operators L_k.

        L_k f = (1/(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|)) * d/dρ(<ρ>**(n-1)|F_ρ|**(-1)df/dρ) - (k(k+n-2)/<ρ>**2) * f + (n(n-1)/<ρ>**(2n)) * f = λ f

    2.  **Asymptotic Analysis**: We examine the behavior of the operator L_k as ρ → ∞. The potential-like terms are:
        V_k(ρ) = -k(k+n-2)/<ρ>**2 + n(n-1)/<ρ>**(2n)
        As ρ → ∞, <ρ> = sqrt(ρ**2 + 1) behaves like |ρ|. Both terms in V_k(ρ) go to 0.

    3.  **Continuous Spectrum**: Because the potential V_k(ρ) vanishes at infinity, the continuous (or essential) spectrum of each radial operator L_k starts at 0 and extends to +∞. The spectrum of the full operator L is the union of the spectra of all L_k, so its continuous spectrum is also [0, ∞).

    4.  **Discrete Spectrum**: According to a fundamental result in spectral theory, discrete eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator lie outside its continuous spectrum. For our operator, this means any discrete eigenvalues must be less than 0. Strictly positive eigenvalues would have to be embedded within the continuous spectrum, which is not possible for this class of operators.

    5.  **Conclusion**: There are no positive discrete eigenvalues for the operator L.
