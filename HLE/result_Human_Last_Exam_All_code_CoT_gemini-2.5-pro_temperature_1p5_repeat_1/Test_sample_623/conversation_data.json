    "Of course. Here is a Python script that traces the labeled carbons through the metabolic pathway to determine the result.\n\nFirst, let's outline the plan. This problem requires us to trace the fate of specific carbon atoms from a glucose molecule as it is broken down. The key steps where carbon dioxide (CO2) is released are the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) reaction and the Citric Acid (TCA) Cycle. Glycolysis itself does not release CO2.\n\n1.  **Starting Molecule**: We begin with 1,4-¹³C glucose, meaning the carbons at positions 1 and 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C.\n2.  **Glycolysis**: We will map how the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   One pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is formed from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose.\n3.  **Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC)**: This step converts each pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and releases one molecule of CO2. The CO2 comes from the carboxyl carbon of pyruvate. We will check if this carbon was one of the original ¹³C labels.\n4.  **TCA Cycle**: We will check the fate of any remaining labels that enter the TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA. In the first turn of the cycle, the two CO2 molecules released originate from the oxaloacetate molecule, not the incoming acetyl-CoA.\n5.  **Final Count**: We will sum the number of ¹³CO2 molecules released.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this process.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and the\n    Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) reaction to determine the number\n    of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Tracing 13C in the Catabolism of 1,4-13C Glucose ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the starting glucose molecule.\n    # The dictionary represents the 6 carbons of glucose, with labels at C1 and C4.\n    glucose = {\n        1: '13C', 2: '12C', 3: '12C',\n        4: '13C', 5: '12C', 6: '12C'\n    }\n    print(f\"\\n1.
