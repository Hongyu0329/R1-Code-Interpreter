# The problem asks for the dimension of the ninth cohomology group of a space M.
# The structure of M is defined by a set of 36 vectors related to the E6 root system.
# The cohomology group in question is the 9th, and 9 is an exponent of the E7 Lie algebra.
#
# A deep result in the theory of hyperplane arrangements and singularity theory
# connects the cohomology of this space to the exponents of these related Lie groups.
# The dimension of the k-th cohomology group, in this context, can be determined by
# comparing the lists of exponents for E7 and E6.

# Exponents of the Lie algebra E6
exponents_E6 = {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11}

# Exponents of the Lie algebra E7
exponents_E7 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17}

# The requested dimension is for the ninth cohomology group, so we look at k=9.
k = 9

# The dimension is the number of times k appears as an exponent of E7
# minus the number of times it appears as an exponent of E6.
