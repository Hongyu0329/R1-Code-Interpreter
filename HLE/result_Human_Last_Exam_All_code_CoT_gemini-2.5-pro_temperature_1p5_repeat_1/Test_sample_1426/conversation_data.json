    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n\n1.  **Locate the Score**: I will find a public domain version of the full orchestral score for Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\". The International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP) is the ideal source for this.\n2.  **Analyze the Music**: I will navigate to the very end of the final movement (IV. Finale: Allegro con fuoco) and locate the part for the first violins (\"Violino I\").\n3.  **Identify the Notes**: By reading the final measure of the first violin part, I will identify the last three notes written. The score indicates the section plays a three-note chord, with the players divided among the notes. These notes are D5, F5, and B♭5.\n4.  **Determine the Lowest Note**: I will compare the pitches of these three notes to determine which one is the lowest.\n5.  **Generate Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that represents these notes and uses a `min()` function to programmatically find and print the lowest one, along with the other notes for context.\n\n```python\ndef find_lowest_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the lowest of the final three notes played by the \n    first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n    The final bar for the first violins contains a single chord played 'divisi'\n    (divided). The three notes that make up this chord are D5, F5, and B-flat5.\n    To programmatically find the lowest note, we can assign them their MIDI\n    pitch values, where a lower number corresponds to a lower pitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The notes of the final chord and their MIDI values\n    final_notes = {\n        \"D5\": 74,\n        \"F5\": 77,\n        \"B-flat5\": 82\n    }\n\n    # Identify the note with the lowest MIDI value\n    lowest_note = min(final_notes, key=final_notes.get)\n\n    print(\"The final three notes for the first violin are in a single chord:\")\n    for note in final_notes:\n        print(f\"- {note}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nOf these notes, the lowest one is:\")\n    print(lowest_note)\n\nfind_lowest_note()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
