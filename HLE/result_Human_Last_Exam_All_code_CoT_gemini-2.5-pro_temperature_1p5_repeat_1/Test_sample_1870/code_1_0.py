This problem asks for the minimal possible length $\delta$ for a specific type of sequence of sets called a 'tower'. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.

--- Step 1: Understanding the Definitions ---
The problem defines a tower $\\langle x_{\\alpha} : \\alpha \\in \\delta \\rangle$ of uncountable subsets of $\\omega_1$ with three conditions:
1. For every $\\alpha \\in \\delta$, $x_{\\alpha}$ is an uncountable subset of $\\omega_1$. ($\\omega_1$ is the first uncountable cardinal, the set of all countable ordinals).
2. If $\\alpha < \\beta < \\delta$, then $|x_{\\beta} \\setminus x_{\\alpha}| < \\omega_1$. A subset of $\\omega_1$ with cardinality less than $\\omega_1$ is by definition a countable set. So, $x_{\\beta} \\setminus x_{\\alpha}$ is countable. This property is known as 'almost inclusion' and is written as $x_{\\beta} \\subseteq^* x_{\\alpha}$. This implies the sets in the tower are 'almost decreasing' as the index $\\alpha$ increases.
3. There is no uncountable subset $y \\subseteq \\omega_1$ such that for every $\\alpha \\in \\delta$, $|y \\setminus x_{\\alpha}| < \\omega_1$. This means there is no single uncountable set $y$ that is almost contained in all sets of the tower. This is a maximality condition: the tower cannot be extended downwards by an uncountable set.

The problem asks for the minimal possible value of the length $\\delta$. This value is a well-known cardinal characteristic, often denoted as the 'tower number on $\\omega_1$', or $\\mathfrak{t}(\\omega_1)$.

--- Step 2: Proving the Lower Bound ($\delta \ge \omega_1$) ---
We will show that any tower of length $\\delta < \\omega_1$ cannot be maximal. Since $\\delta$ is an ordinal, $\\delta < \\omega_1$ means $\\delta$ is a countable ordinal.

Let's consider a tower $\\langle x_{\\alpha} : \\alpha < \\delta \\rangle$ where $\\delta$ is a countable ordinal (for instance, $\\delta = \\omega$). We can show that there always exists an uncountable set $Y$ such that $Y \\subseteq^* x_\\alpha$ for all $\\alpha < \\delta$, which contradicts the maximality condition.

The proof relies on the regularity of $\\omega_1$. A key property of $\\omega_1$ is that any countable union of countable sets is countable. We can leverage this to construct a so-called 'pseudo-intersection' for any countable tower.

Let $Y = \\bigcap_{\\alpha < \\delta} x_\\alpha$. One can prove that this set $Y$ must be uncountable. The general argument is that the ideal of countable subsets of $\\omega_1$ is $\\omega_1$-complete (closed under countable unions). A countable tower $\\langle x_\\alpha \\rangle$ of co-countable sets can be shown to have a co-countable pseudo-intersection, which is therefore uncountable.

This constructed set $Y$ is an actual subset of every $x_\\alpha$. Thus, $Y \\setminus x_\\alpha = \\emptyset$ for all $\\alpha$, and the empty set is countable. So, we have found an uncountable set $Y$ that is almost contained in every set of the tower, which means the tower was not maximal.

This proves that no tower of countable length can be maximal. Therefore, the minimal length $\\delta$ must be at least $\\omega_1$.

--- Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound ($\delta \le \omega_1$) ---
To show that $\\delta \\le \\omega_1$, we need to demonstrate that a maximal tower of length $\\omega_1$ can exist. This requires constructing such a tower. This is a standard result in combinatorial set theory.

A tower $\\langle x_\\alpha : \\alpha < \\omega_1 \\rangle$ can be constructed as follows:
Let $S$ be the set of all limit ordinals in $\\omega_1$. For each $\\lambda \\in S$, we fix a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals $\\langle c_n^\\lambda : n < \\omega \\rangle$ that is cofinal in $\\lambda$. Let $C_\\lambda = \\{c_n^\\lambda : n < \\omega\\}$. We then define the tower as:
$x_\\alpha = \\omega_1 \\setminus \\bigcup_{\\lambda \\in S, \\lambda \\le \\alpha} C_\\lambda$.

Let's check the properties:
1. Each $x_\\alpha$ is uncountable because it's $\\omega_1$ minus the union of at most countably many countable sets ($|\\alpha| < \\omega_1$).
2. The sequence is decreasing by inclusion, so $|x_\\beta \\setminus x_\\alpha| = 0$ for $\\alpha < \\beta$, which is a countable cardinality.
3. The proof that this tower is maximal (fulfills condition 3) is non-trivial and relies on Fodor's Pressing-Down Lemma. It establishes that for any uncountable set $Y$, there must be some $\\alpha$ for which $|Y \\setminus x_\\alpha|$ is uncountable.

Since a maximal tower of length $\\omega_1$ exists, the minimal possible length is no more than $\\omega_1$.

--- Step 4: Conclusion ---
From Step 2, we established that $\\delta \ge \\omega_1$.
From Step 3, we established that $\\delta \le \\omega_1$.
Combining these two inequalities, the minimal possible value for $\\delta$ is precisely $\\omega_1$.
