    "This is a question of cephalopod neuroanatomy. The brain of a cuttlefish is doughnut-shaped, organized into a supraesophageal mass and a subesophageal mass surrounding the esophagus. The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass, which is the most posterior (caudal) part of the entire brain.\n\nMy plan is to identify the lobes that are located in the same posterior region and are most accurately described as being adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n1.  The palliovisceral lobe itself is one of the most posterior structures in the cuttlefish brain, controlling the mantle, fins, and internal organs.\n2.  Lying on the dorsal and posterior surface of the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, which control the color-changing cells on the body.\n3.  Also located in this same posterior-most complex are the **vasomotor lobes**, which control blood pressure.\n\nTherefore, the brain regions adjacent and just posterior/dorsal to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the vasomotor lobes. I will write a python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n    to the palliovisceral lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass and is one of\n    # the most caudal (posterior) parts of the cuttlefish brain.\n    # The regions located on its dorsal-posterior surface are considered its neighbors in this direction.\n    \n    region1 = \"Posterior chromatophore lobes\"\n    region2 = \"Vasomotor lobes\"\n    \n    # These lobes, along with the palliovisceral lobe, form the most posterior complex of the brain mass.\n    \n    print(f\"The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly (or dorsal-posteriorly) to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    print(f\"- {region1}\")\n    print(f\"- {region2}\")\n\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly (or dorsal-posteriorly) to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
