    print(f"   - The peak at {alpha_helix_peak} cm^-1 indicates the presence of alpha-helices.")
    print(f"   - The pair of peaks at {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm^-1 and {beta_sheet_high_peak} cm^-1 is a clear signature of antiparallel beta-sheets.")

    print("\n2. Concentration Titration (Gelation Process):")
    print(f"   - As concentration increases, the gel forms.")
    print(f"   - The experiment shows a 'dual increase' in the peaks at {alpha_helix_peak} cm^-1 (alpha-helix) and {beta_sheet_low_peak} cm^-1 (beta-sheet).")
    print("   - Conclusion: This means that as the disordered proteins come together to form the gel, they fold into BOTH alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures.")

    print("\n3. Heating Experiment (Confirmation):")
    print(f"   - Upon heating, the gel breaks down.")
    print(f"   - The beta-sheet peaks ({beta_sheet_low_peak} cm^-1 and {beta_sheet_high_peak} cm^-1) disappear, while the disordered peak ({disordered_peak} cm^-1) grows stronger.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This confirms that the ordered structures (beta-sheets) unfold back into a disordered state, breaking the gel network.")

    print("\n4. Final Conclusion:")
    print("   - The evidence strongly supports that gelation is a process where initially disordered proteins fold into a complex structure containing both alpha-helices and beta-sheets.")
