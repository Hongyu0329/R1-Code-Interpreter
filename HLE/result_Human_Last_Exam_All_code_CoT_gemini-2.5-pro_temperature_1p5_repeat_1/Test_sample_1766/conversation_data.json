    "To solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, we first need to determine the relevant quantum numbers.\n\n**1. Identify Quantum Numbers:**\n*   A **p-electron** has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$.\n*   An **electron** has a spin angular momentum quantum number $s=1/2$.\n\n**2. Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):**\n*   The total angular momentum operator is $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$.\n*   The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, are determined by the rule: $|l-s| \\le j \\le l+s$.\n*   Plugging in our values: $|1 - 1/2| \\le j \\le 1 + 1/2$, which simplifies to $1/2 \\le j \\le 3/2$.\n*   Since $j$ changes in integer steps, the possible values are $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$.\n\n**3. Determine Magnetic Quantum Numbers (m_j):**\n*   For each value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n*   For $j=3/2$, the possible $m_j$ values are: $-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2$.\n*   For $j=1/2$, the possible $m_j$ values are: $-1/2, 1/2$.\n\n**4. Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n*   The states $|j, m_j\\rangle$ are common eigenstates of both $J^2$ and $J_z$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n*   The eigenvalue of $J_z$ is $\\hbar m_j$.\n\nThe following Python code will systematically calculate and print all the possible common eigenvalues for each state.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, the spin quantum number is s=1/2.\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l={l} and s={s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number j ranges from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1.0)\n\n    # We will list the eigenvalues for each possible state |j, m_j>.\n    # The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)hbar^2\n    # The eigenvalue of J_z is m_j*hbar\n    \n    print(\"The common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z are determined for each state |j, m_j>:\\n\")\n\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2 for the current j\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        # The magnetic quantum number m_j ranges from -j to +j in steps of 1.\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        \n        for mj in mj_values:\n            print(f\"For the state with quantum numbers j = {j} and m_j = {mj}:\")\n            # The eigenvalue of J^2 is printed showing the calculation\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J^2 = j(j+1)hbar^2 = {j}({j}+1)hbar^2 = {j2_eigenvalue:.2f} hbar^2\")\n            # The eigenvalue of J_z is printed showing the calculation\n            print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J_z = m_j*hbar = {mj} hbar\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n\n```\n<<<Pairs of ($J^2$ eigenvalue / $\\hbar^2$, $J_z$ eigenvalue / $\\hbar$): (3.75, 1.5), (3.75, 0.5), (3.75, -0.5), (3.75, -1.5), (0.75, 0.5), (0.75, -0.5)>>>"
