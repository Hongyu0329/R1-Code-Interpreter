    # 1: 'Aristotelian mimicry' is not a standard biological term.
    # 2: Automimicry involves a single species, not two different ones.
    # 4: The second species is incorrect; Passiflora mimicry involves Heliconius butterflies, not Myrmecia ants.
    # 6: The second species, Asclepias, is not a crop weed and does not exhibit Vavilovian mimicry.
    # 7: The second species, the Viceroy butterfly, is a famous example of mimicry (conspicuous coloration), not camouflage.

    # Explanation for Triplet #3
    print("Triplet 3: Batesian, Eristalini - color, Melipotini - color")
    print(" - Rationale: This is correct. Batesian mimicry occurs when a harmless species mimics a harmful one.")
    print("   - Eristalini (hoverflies) are a classic example, as these harmless flies mimic the color of stinging bees and wasps.")
    print("   - Certain species in the Melipotini moth tribe are also well-documented Batesian mimics, using their color patterns to imitate toxic moths.")
    print("")

    # Explanation for Triplet #5
    print("Triplet 5: Müllerian, Heliconiini - color, Melipotini - color")
    print(" - Rationale: This is correct. Müllerian mimicry is a form of mutualistic mimicry where two or more unpalatable species share a similar warning signal.")
    print("   - Heliconiini butterflies are the textbook case, with different toxic species converging on the same warning color patterns.")
    print("   - It is also established that some unpalatable moth species, including those related to the Melipotini tribe, engage in Müllerian mimicry using color.")
    print("")

    # Explanation for Triplet #8
    print("Triplet 8: Aposematism, Danaus plexipus - wing, Cycnia tenera - tymbal")
    print(" - Rationale: This is correct. Aposematism is the use of a warning signal to advertise danger or unpalatability.")
    print("   - The Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) famously uses the conspicuous orange and black color of its wings as a visual warning of its toxicity.")
    print("   - The tiger moth (Cycnia tenera) warns bats of its toxicity by producing ultrasonic clicks with a specialized sound-producing organ, the tymbal (acoustic aposematism).")
