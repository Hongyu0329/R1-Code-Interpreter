    Explains the reasoning behind the correct choice for spectral expansion

    """
    explanation = """
In toroidal systems, such as tokamaks used in fusion research, physical quantities are described using a coordinate system where one of the coordinates is the poloidal angle. This angle represents the position along the "short way" around the torus.

A key feature of the poloidal angle is that it is periodic. A full rotation of 2-pi radians (360 degrees) brings you back to your starting point. When representing a function that depends on a periodic variable, the most natural and efficient spectral expansion technique is a Fourier series.

A Fourier series decomposes a periodic function into a sum of simple sine and cosine waves of different frequencies (called poloidal harmonics or modes). This method is standard in plasma physics for analyzing stability, waves, and transport in toroidal confinement devices.

Let's consider the other options:
- Spherical Harmonics (B, F) are the natural choice for spherical geometry, not toroidal geometry.
- Polynomial-based expansions like Legendre (I), Chebyshev (E), Jacobi (H), and Gegenbauer (A) are best suited for functions on finite, non-periodic intervals (like [-1, 1]).
- B-splines (C) are typically used for local, finite-element style representations, not global spectral expansions for periodic coordinates.

Therefore, the correct technique adapted for poloidal dependence in toroidal systems is the Fourier series.
