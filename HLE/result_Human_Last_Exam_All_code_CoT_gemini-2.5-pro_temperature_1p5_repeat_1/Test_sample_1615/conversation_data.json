    "To solve this problem, I will determine the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with the given properties. My plan involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: I'll use the fact that the graph `G` is not a complete graph to establish a simple and tight upper bound on its chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$. If a graph on `n` vertices is not complete, it must have at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices, which means we can color it with fewer than `n` colors.\n\n2.  **Show the Bound is Achievable**: I will demonstrate that this upper bound is tight by providing an example of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not complete and whose chromatic number is exactly this upper bound. A graph made of a complete subgraph ($K_{n-1}$) and one isolated vertex is a good candidate.\n\n3.  **Final Calculation**: I will then write a Python script that uses the number of vertices (`n = 12345`) to calculate the final answer based on the logic above. The script will print the reasoning and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph G with n vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    n = 12345\n\n    # Step 1: Establish an upper bound for the chromatic number, chi(G).\n    # A graph with n vertices requires at most n colors. This happens when the graph\n    # is a complete graph (K_n), where every vertex needs a unique color.\n    # The problem states that G is NOT a complete graph. This implies there is at\n    # least one pair of vertices, say u and v, that are not connected by an edge.\n    # Since u and v are not adjacent, they can legally be assigned the same color.\n    #\n    # A valid coloring with n-1 colors can always be constructed. For example:\n    # Color the n-2 vertices in V(G) \\ {u, v} with n-2 unique colors.\n    # Then, assign a new, (n-1)-th color to both u and v.\n    # This is a proper coloring using n-1 colors. Therefore, the minimum number of\n    # colors needed, chi(G), must be less than or equal to n-1.\n    # So, chi(G) <= n - 1.\n\n    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    # We need to construct a graph G on n vertices which is not complete and has\n    # a chromatic number of exactly n-1.\n    # Consider the graph G formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on n-1\n    # vertices (K_{n-1}) and a single isolated vertex (K_1).\n    # - This graph has (n-1) + 1 = n vertices.\n    # - It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any\n    #   other vertices.\n    # - The subgraph K_{n-1} requires n-1 distinct colors for a proper coloring.\n    #   Thus, the chromatic number of the entire graph G must be at least n-1.\n    #   So, chi(G) >= n - 1.\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude and calculate.\n    # From Step 1 (chi(G) <= n-1) and Step 2 (chi(G) >= n-1 for some G), we can\n    # conclude that the maximum number of colors required is exactly n-1.\n    \n    maximum_colors = n - 1\n    \n    # Print the final result as an equation.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"For a graph G on n vertices that is not complete, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n-1.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achieved by a graph such as a K_{n-1} clique with one isolated vertex.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximum number of colours needed is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {n} - 1 = {maximum_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
