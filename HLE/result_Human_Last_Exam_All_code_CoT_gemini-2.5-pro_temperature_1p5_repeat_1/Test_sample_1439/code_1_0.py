    # In the perturbative framework of the renormalization group, the critical
    # exponent nu is derived from the anomalous dimension of the phi^2 operator,
    # which we denote as gamma_t(u).
    #
    # The equation relating them is:
    # 1 / nu = 2 - gamma_t(u)
    #
    # The mean-field result is nu = 1/2. This is recovered when gamma_t(u) = 0.
    # Therefore, any correction to the mean-field value of nu comes from a
    # non-zero gamma_t(u).

    # The function gamma_t(u) is calculated as a power series in the coupling 'u'.
    # One-loop calculations in the epsilon-expansion show that the series starts
    # at order u^1.
    # gamma_t(u) = C1 * u^1 + C2 * u^2 + ...
    # where C1, C2, etc., are constants.

    # The initial non-vanishing contribution to nu is determined by the lowest-order
    # term in this expansion.
