    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Set of Numbers**: The problem asks for sums of distinct numbers from the set `S` defined by the formula `a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1` for `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`. The first few numbers in this set are 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, and so on.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem**: We need to find the smallest number `N` such that every integer greater than or equal to `N` is a sum of distinct elements from `S`. This is equivalent to finding the largest number `g` that *cannot* be represented as such a sum. The number `N` will then be `g + 1`.\n\n3.  **Choose the Right Algorithm**: A simple boolean array (like in the standard knapsack problem) is not suitable here because it doesn't easily enforce the use of *distinct* numbers. A more direct and correct approach is to build the set of all possible reachable sums iteratively.\n\n4.  **Execution Plan**:\n    *   I will start with a set of reachable sums containing only `0` (representing an empty sum).\n    *   I will generate the terms of the sequence `a_n` one by one.\n    *   For each new term `s`, I will add `s` to every sum already in my set of reachable sums and add these new values back into the set. This correctly generates all possible sums using distinct terms.\n    *   To know when to stop, I'll use a stability check: After using the first `k` terms, I'll find the largest unreachable number `g_k`. If `g_k` is smaller than the next term `s_{k+1}`, then `g_k` is the final answer for the largest unreachable number, because no subsequent (larger) term can help form `g_k`.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: Once the largest unreachable number `g` is found, the answer is `N = g + 1`. The code will print this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any number >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2+3n+1.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Generate the first few terms of the sequence a_n = 2n^2 + 3n + 1.\n    # We need enough terms to find a stable result.
