    "Here is my plan to solve the puzzle:\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I will first analyze the provided input-output pairs (A and B) to understand the rule governing the transformation. The inputs are grids of numbers represented as comma-separated strings.\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** By comparing the input and output grids, I will look for a consistent pattern. The key seems to be the location of the character '2'. My initial hypothesis will be that the '2' moves its position, changing its original cell to a '0'. The direction of this \"move\" needs to be determined.\n3.  **Verify the Hypothesis:** I'll check if the rule holds true for both example A and example B. The rule should explain how the '2' at `(r, c)` moves to a new location `(r_new, c_new)`. I will test the idea that the movement vector `(dr, dc)` depends on the coordinates of the '2', specifically the parity of its column index.\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Final Case:** Once the rule is confirmed, I will apply it to `Input_C` to calculate the `MISSING` output.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements the discovered logic. The script will parse the input string, locate the '2', calculate its new position, update the grid, and print the final result as a comma-separated string.\n\n**Here are my thinking steps for deriving the rule:**\n*   In `Input_A`, a '2' at `(1,1)` moves to `(0,0)`. The '2' becomes a '0', and the original '0' at `(0,0)` becomes a '2'. The movement vector is `dr=-1, dc=-1`.\n*   In `Input_B`, a '2' at `(3,6)` moves to `(2,7)`. The '2' becomes a '0', and the original '0' at `(2,7)` becomes a '2'. The movement vector is `dr=-1, dc=+1`.\n*   In both cases, the row index decreases by 1 (`dr = -1`).\n*   The column index change (`dc`) appears to depend on the column of the '2'. For `A`, the column `c=1` is odd, and `dc=-1`. For `B`, the column `c=6` is even, and `dc=+1`.\n*   This leads to the rule: Find the '2' at `(r, c)`. It moves to `(r-1, c-1)` if `c` is odd, and to `(r-1, c+1)` if `c` is even. The original cell `(r,c)` becomes '0'.\n\nNow, I will apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the input string based on a derived rule.\n    The rule involves moving the character '2' in a grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_str = '000000,011120,111111'\n\n    # 1.
