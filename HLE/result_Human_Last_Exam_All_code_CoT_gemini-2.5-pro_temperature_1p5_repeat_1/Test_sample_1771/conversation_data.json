    "Of course. Here is the plan and the Python code to trace the etymological development of the given Proto-Indo-European root.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input:** The starting point is the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`. I will identify its root (`*seh₂g-`) and meaning.\n2.  **Trace to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):** I will note that the common Germanic verb for 'to seek' derives not from the given e-grade PIE form, but from a related o-grade causative form, `*soh₂géyeti`. I will explain the regular sound changes that transform this into the Proto-Germanic 3rd person singular form `*sōkiþi`. This includes:\n    *   Vowel change `*oH` > `*ō`.\n    *   Grimm's Law, which shifts `*g` to `*k`.\n    *   Changes to the verbal ending.\n3.  **Trace from PGmc to Daughter Languages:** I will then take the reconstructed Proto-Germanic form `*sōkiþi` and trace its development into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German, explaining the key sound laws for each language.\n    *   **Old Norse (ON):** I will apply i-umlaut (`*ō` > `œ`) and the characteristic change of the 3rd person ending to `-r`.\n    *   **Old English (OE):** I will apply i-umlaut (`*ō` > `ē`), palatalization (`*k` > `ċ`), and the regular development of the verbal ending to `-eþ`.\n    *   **Old High German (OHG):** I will apply the High German Diphthongization (`*ō` > `uo`), the Second Sound Shift (`*k` > `hh`), and the shift of the verbal ending to `-it`.\n4.  **Final Output:** The Python code will print this entire derivation process, showing each stage of the \"equation\" and explaining the rules applied, culminating in the final forms for each requested language.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the etymology of a PIE root through Germanic languages\n    and prints the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pie_meaning = \"'(s)he’s giving a sign'\"\n\n    # While the prompt gives the e-grade *seh₂gieti, the common Germanic verb 'to seek'\n    # descends from the related o-grade causative PIE form, *soh₂géyeti 'to cause to track, to seek'.\n    # We will trace this latter form, as it leads to the attested words.\n    pie_causative = \"*soh₂géyeti\"\n    pgmc_form = \"*sōkiþi\"\n\n    # Stage 1: Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic\n    print(f\"Tracing the development from PIE {pie_form} ({pie_meaning}).\")\n    print(\"The attested Germanic verb 'to seek' derives from the related PIE causative form.\\n\")\n    print(\"1.
