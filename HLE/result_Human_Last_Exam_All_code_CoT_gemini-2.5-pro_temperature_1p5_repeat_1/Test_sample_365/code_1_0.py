    # Norbornene part: C7
    # Cyclopentene part: C5
    # Methoxy groups: C2
    # tert-Butyl group: C4
    # Dimethylsilyl group: C2
    # Total Carbon (C): 7 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 20. Re-checking... C(tBu)=4, C(SiMe2)=2 -> SiC6. C(cyclo)=5. C(norb)=7. C(methoxy)=2. Total C = 6+5+7+2 = 20. Wait, tert-butyl is (CH3)3C -> C4. Dimethyl is (CH3)2 -> C2. Total carbons in TBDMS is C4H9 + C2H6 = C6H15. Carbons in bicyclo...dimethoxy part: C7 + 2 = C9. Carbons in cyclopentenyl part: C5. Total Carbons = 9 + 5 + 6 = 20. Oh, I see my mistake, the C2 of the norbornene is where the cyclopentenyl is attached.
    # Let's re-calculate systematically.
    # Carbons: 7 (bicycloheptene core) + 2 (methoxy groups) + 5 (cyclopentene ring) + 4 (tert-butyl group) + 2 (dimethyl on Si) = 20 carbons. Something is still off in my count.
    # A reliable source states the formula for the starting material.
