    "Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A key requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC, is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric). This is because in centrosymmetric materials, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is necessarily zero.\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can exist in several different structural phases. However, the most commonly synthesized and theoretically stable phases, such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n\nTherefore, because these common forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero. As a result, they would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. While localized effects at defects or edges could theoretically break this symmetry, it is not an intrinsic property of the material itself.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef check_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the core requirement for SPDC\n    spdc_requirement = \"a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure (lacking a center of inversion)\"\n    \n    # Define the property of centrosymmetric materials\n    centrosymmetric_property = \"the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero\"\n    \n    # Describe the structure of common boron nanosheets (borophene)\n    borophene_structure = \"centrosymmetric\"\n    \n    # Formulate the conclusion\n    conclusion = (\n        f\"1.
