        'B': "This shear force is caused by the plasma jet flowing across the surface. It consistently pushes the fluid OUTWARD from the center, which contradicts the observation.",
        'C': "This is a downward pressure that is strongest at the center. It depresses the pool surface but does not primarily drive the observed radial surface flow.",
        'D': "This force squeezes the fluid inwards and downwards under the arc. While it causes stirring, the distinct surface flow from the edge to the center is the primary signature of the Marangoni effect.",
        'E': "This force arises from density differences due to heat. It is generally a much weaker contributor to weld pool convection compared to other forces."
