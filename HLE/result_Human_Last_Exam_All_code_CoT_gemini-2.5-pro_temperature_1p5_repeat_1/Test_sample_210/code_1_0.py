# Step 1 & 2: Define the number of settlers by 1823.
# Research shows that by 1823, the population of the Talbot Settlement had grown significantly.
settlers_by_1823 = 20000

# Step 3: Define the size of the original land grant in acres.
# Colonel Thomas Talbot's initial grant in 1803 was for 5,000 acres.
initial_grant_acres = 5000

# Step 4: Define the total acreage Colonel Talbot eventually administered.
# Through his unique settlement scheme, he eventually controlled a vast area.
final_claimed_acres = 650000

# Step 5: Calculate the difference in acreage.
acreage_difference = final_claimed_acres - initial_grant_acres

# Print the final answers in a clear format.
