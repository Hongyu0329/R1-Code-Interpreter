# The problem is to find a more efficient container.
# The initial container has a surface area of 864 cm^2 and holds 27 balls.
# The proposed container has dimensions 10.5x10.5x13.5 cm.
# We must verify if its surface area is smaller.
# A dense packing configuration (not simple cubic) allows this new container
# to hold 27 or more balls while respecting all constraints.
