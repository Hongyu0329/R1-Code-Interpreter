    "This is a problem in the field of algebraic and combinatorial topology. To solve it, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical formula:** I will use a known theorem from combinatorial topology that provides a formula for counting the number of non-collapsing rooted forests in a simplicial complex. This number is given by the determinant of a specific combinatorial Laplacian matrix.\n2.  **Connect the formula to homology:** I will use another fundamental theorem that relates the determinant of the Laplacian to the Betti numbers of the simplicial complex. A non-zero Betti number implies a zero determinant for the corresponding Laplacian.\n3.  **Find the Betti numbers of the Möbius band:** The Möbius band is a well-understood topological space, and its Betti numbers are known.\n4.  **Compute the final result:** By combining these pieces, I will calculate the determinant, which gives the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this chain of reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_mobius_forest_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the number of higher dimensional rooted forests\n    of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to simplicially collapse onto the root.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"This problem can be solved by applying two key theorems from algebraic topology.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: State the formula for the number of non-collapsing forests.\n    print(\"Step 1: The Formula for the Number of Non-Collapsing Forests\")\n    print(\"Let K be a d-dimensional simplicial complex.
