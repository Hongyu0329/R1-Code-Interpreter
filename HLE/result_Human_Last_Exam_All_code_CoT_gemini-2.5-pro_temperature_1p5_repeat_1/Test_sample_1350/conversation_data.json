    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must have a connection to a Roman city and describe a religious practice that clearly alludes to the founding myth of Rome, specifically the story of Romulus and Remus.\n2.  **Recall Book Knowledge:** I will access my knowledge base regarding the plot and characters of *The House of the Wolfings*. The story involves the Goths (the Wolfings) and their interactions with the Romans. A key character with Roman ties is the Hall-Sun, the foster-daughter of the protagonist, Thiodolf.\n3.  **Identify the Specific Scene:** I will recall the scene where the Hall-Sun reveals parts of her origin. She tells a story about her native city, which was founded by a \"Wolf-suckled King.\" This is a direct and unambiguous reference to Romulus, who, along with his brother Remus, was said to have been suckled by a she-wolf.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** Since this is a literary analysis question rather than a computational one, I will write a Python script that stores the character's name in a variable and then uses the `print()` function to present the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    who alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in question is the Hall-Sun. She is of Roman origin\n    # and was taken in by the Wolfings as a child.\n    character_name = \"The Hall-Sun\"\n    \n    # In the book, she recounts the history of her people, describing\n    # their city's founder as a \"Wolf-suckled King.\" This is a clear\n    # reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus.\n    \n    print(f\"The character in William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings' who describes her ancestral city's religion in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is:\")\n    print(character_name)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<The Hall-Sun>>>"
