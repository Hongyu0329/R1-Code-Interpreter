# Step 1: Define the properties of the two metric spaces.

# Space X: The interval [0, 1]
min_val_interval = 0.0
max_val_interval = 1.0
diam_interval = max_val_interval - min_val_interval

# Space Y: The unit circle (assumed to have circumference 1 for fair comparison)
circumference_circle = 1.0
# The diameter of a circle is half its circumference.
diam_circle = circumference_circle / 2.0

# Step 2: Calculate the lower bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.
# The formula is: d_GH(X, Y) >= 0.5 * |diam(X) - diam(Y)|
lower_bound = 0.5 * abs(diam_interval - diam_circle)

# Step 3: Calculate the upper bound for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance.
# We find an upper bound by embedding the interval into the circle as a semicircle
# and calculating the Hausdorff distance of this embedding.
#
# Let's map the interval X = [0, 1] to a semicircle in Y. This image, f(X), covers half the circle.
# The Hausdorff distance d_H(f(X), Y) is the maximum distance from any point in Y to the set f(X).
# This distance is maximized for the point on the circle that is furthest from the semicircle f(X),
# which is the point diametrically opposite the semicircle's midpoint.
#
# A semicircle on a circle of circumference 1 has a length of 0.5.
# Its midpoint is at arc length 0.25 from an endpoint.
# The diametrically opposite point is at 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75.
# The distance from this point (0.75) to the semicircle [0, 0.5] is the distance to its closest endpoint,
# which is min(distance(0.75, 0), distance(0.75, 0.5)).
# distance(0.75, 0) = 0.25.
# distance(0.75, 0.5) = 0.25.
# Thus, the maximum distance (and the Hausdorff distance for this embedding) is 0.25.
upper_bound = 0.25

print("Step 3: Calculate the upper bound.")
print("The upper bound is found via a specific embedding to be 0.25.")
print(f"Upper bound = {upper_bound}")
print("-" * 30)


# Step 4: Conclude the final result.
# Since the lower bound and the upper bound are equal, we have the exact distance.
result = lower_bound

print("The lower and upper bounds are equal.")
print(f"The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is {result}.")
