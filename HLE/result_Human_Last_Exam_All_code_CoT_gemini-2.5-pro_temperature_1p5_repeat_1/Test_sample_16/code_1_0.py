    """
    Calculates the minimum number of prototypes required to guarantee correct 
    classification of class centroids under the specified conditions.

    The problem describes C disjoint, contiguous, unimodal classes. We need to
    classify the C class centroids correctly using a distance-weighted soft-label
    kNN classifier fit on a set of prototypes.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. To guarantee that a class centroid (e.g., Centroid_i) can be correctly
       classified as its own class (Class_i), there must be at least one
       prototype that "represents" Class_i. If all available prototypes were
       more strongly associated with other classes, Centroid_i would be
       misclassified.
    2. By this logic, each of the C classes requires its own representative
       prototype. Imagine you have only C-1 prototypes. By the pigeonhole
       principle, at least one class would have no prototype primarily
       associated with it, making it impossible to guarantee the classification
       of its centroid.
    3. Therefore, you need at least C prototypes.
    4. A setup with exactly C prototypes is sufficient. We can place one
       prototype at each of the C class centroids and assign it a "pure" soft
       label (e.g., [1, 0, ..., 0] for the first prototype). This setup will
       guarantee perfect classification for all centroids.

    Thus, the minimum number of prototypes required is equal to the number of classes, C.
