    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script that prints the final expression for the partition function.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition:** The grand canonical partition function, Z, is defined as the trace (Tr) over the exponential of the grand canonical Hamiltonian (H' = H - μN) weighted by the inverse temperature β.\n    *   Z = Tr[e^(-β(H - μN))]\n\n2.  **Introduce Path Integrals:** To evaluate this trace, we switch from an operator-based quantum mechanics formalism to the path integral formalism. This involves a \"Wick rotation\" to imaginary time, τ = it, where τ ranges from 0 to βħ. In this formalism, the trace becomes a functional integral over all possible configurations of a field, ψ(x, τ), that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in the imaginary time dimension.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Action:** The path integral takes the form Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S), where S is the Euclidean action. The action S is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian, L_E, over imaginary time.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Expression:** The Euclidean Lagrangian for a system described by a Hamiltonian H and number operator N is constructed by adding a \"kinetic\" term in imaginary time, `ψ*ħ∂_τψ`, to the grand canonical Hamiltonian density `H - μN`.\n\n5.  **Final Result:** Combining these elements gives the full path integral representation of the partition function Z.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this final, detailed equation.\n\n```python\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the path integral representation of the grand\n    canonical partition function Z for a Hamiltonian H' = H - μN.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the final equation as strings\n    partition_function_symbol = \"Z\"\n    equals = \"=\"\n    integral_measure = \"∫ D[ψ*, ψ]\"\n    exponential_term = \"exp\"\n    \n    # Define the Action S\n    action_symbol = \"S\"\n    action_definition = \"∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx [ ψ*(x,τ)ħ∂_τψ(x,τ) + H(ψ*,ψ) - μN(ψ*,ψ) ]\"\n    \n    # Header\n    print(\"The grand canonical partition function Z is given by the path integral:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Print the general form\n    print(\"General form: Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] * exp(-S)\")\n    print(\"Where S is the Euclidean action.\\n\")\n\n    # Print the detailed final equation\n    print(\"The full expression for the partition function Z is:\")\n    \n    # This line constructs and prints the final equation, showing each symbolic component.\n    final_equation = (\n        f\"{partition_function_symbol} {equals} {integral_measure} \"\n        f\"{exponential_term}{{ -{action_definition} }}\"\n    )\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Explanation of terms\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  Z      : The grand canonical partition function.\")\n    print(\"  ∫D[ψ*,ψ]: The functional (path) integral over all field configurations.\")\n    print(\"  ψ, ψ*  : The fields (Grassmann variables for fermions, complex for bosons).\")\n    print(\"  β      : Inverse temperature (1 / k_B T).\")\n    print(\"  ħ      : The reduced Planck constant.\")\n    print(\"  τ      : Imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β.\")\n    print(\"  x, dᵈx : Position vector and volume element in d spatial dimensions.\")\n    print(\"  ∂_τ    : The partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\")\n    print(\"  H(ψ*,ψ): The Hamiltonian written as a function of the fields.\")\n    print(\"  μ      : The chemical potential.\")\n    print(\"  N(ψ*,ψ): The particle number operator written as a function of the fields.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe fields ψ must satisfy periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) boundary conditions in imaginary time: ψ(x, 0) = ±ψ(x, β).\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp{ -∫₀^β dτ ∫ dᵈx [ ψ*(x,τ)ħ∂_τψ(x,τ) + H(ψ*,ψ) - μN(ψ*,ψ) ] }>>>"
