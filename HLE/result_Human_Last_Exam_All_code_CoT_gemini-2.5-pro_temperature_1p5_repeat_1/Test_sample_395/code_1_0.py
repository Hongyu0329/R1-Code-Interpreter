def calculate_union_size():

    Calculates the size of the union based on the problem's parameters,
    assuming a sunflower configuration.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest possible value of the size of the union
    of 2024 sets, A_i, where |A_i| = 45 and |A_i intersect A_j| = 1 for i != j.
    
    This problem can be analyzed using the dual of the de Bruijn-Erdos theorem.
    This leads to two main structural possibilities for the sets:
    
    1. A "sunflower" configuration: All sets share one common central element.
       Let the number of sets be n = 2024 and the size of each set be k = 45.
       The union consists of the central element plus n * (k-1) unique "petal" elements.
       Size = 1 + n * (k-1)
    
    2. A "non-sunflower" configuration: No element is common to all sets.
       In this case, the size of the union must be at least the number of sets,
       i.e., |Union(A_i)| >= n. For the given parameters, it can be shown
       that this case requires strong combinatorial conditions that are likely
       not met or would lead to a much larger union size.
    
    The sunflower configuration provides a concrete, valid construction. We will
    calculate the size for this case, which is the most plausible candidate for
    the minimum value.
