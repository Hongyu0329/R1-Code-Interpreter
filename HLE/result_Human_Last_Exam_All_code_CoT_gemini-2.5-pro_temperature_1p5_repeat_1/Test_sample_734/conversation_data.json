    "My plan is to answer the user's question by first identifying the key elements of the query. The user is looking for a specific Christian theologian known for creating a specialized vocabulary to discuss modifications to natural law. This framework must apply to two distinct events: the virgin birth of Jesus and the potential changes to nature resulting from the Fall of Man.\n\n1.  **Analyze the requirements:**\n    *   **Christian Theologian:** This narrows the search to historical figures within Christian thought.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** This points to a systematic thinker who didn't just discuss these ideas but coined terms or created specific distinctions to explain them.\n    *   **Changes in Laws of Nature:** This involves the philosophy of miracles and divine action.\n    *   **Application to Virgin Birth & the Fall:** The theologian's framework must be broad enough to encompass both a specific miraculous event and a general shift in the state of the natural world.\n\n2.  **Identify the Theologian:** Based on these criteria, the most fitting figure is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\n3.  **Justify the choice:**\n    *   Augustine wrote extensively on God's relationship to the natural order, which he called the *ordo naturae* or *cursus naturae*.\n    *   He developed the crucial distinction that miracles are not *contra naturam* (against nature), but *contra quam est nota natura* (against nature *as it is known to us*). This is the \"specialized terminology\" the question refers to. In his view, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of natural law by an outside force; rather, it's an act by the very Author of nature, who is not bound by the rules He established for its ordinary operation.\n    *   He also applied his thought to the Fall, arguing that it introduced corruption, decay, and futility into the created order (referencing Romans 8). This represents a fundamental alteration in the functioning of the natural world from its original, pre-Fall state.\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** As per the instructions, I will provide the answer within a Python code block using a `print()` statement.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    for changes in natural law, applicable to both the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
