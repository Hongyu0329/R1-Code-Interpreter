    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The problem provides a 3x3 matrix, `A`, and asks for its determinant. The reference to the Markov quiver and `m_{1/2} = 13` is context for the origin of the matrix, but this information is not needed for the calculation itself.\n2.  I will use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  The Python script will define the matrix, substitute its elements into the formula, and perform the calculation step-by-step.\n4.  The script will print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested, to show how the result is derived.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The matrix A is given as:\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The adjacency matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # For a 3x3 matrix:\n    # [[a, b, c],\n    #  [d, e, f],\n    #  [g, h, i]]\n    # The determinant is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Calculate the determinant\n    determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n    # To satisfy the output requirement, we show the calculation.\n    print(\"The determinant calculation is as follows:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Show the formula with substituted values\n    calc_str1 = f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\n    print(calc_str1)\n\n    # Step 2: Show the result of the cofactor calculations\n    term1 = e*i - f*h\n    term2 = d*i - f*g\n    term3 = d*h - e*g\n    calc_str2 = f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({term1}) - ({b}) * ({term2}) + ({c}) * ({term3})\"\n    print(calc_str2)\n\n    # Step 3: Show the multiplied terms\n    final_term1 = a * term1\n    final_term2 = -b * term2\n    final_term3 = c * term3\n    calc_str3 = f\"det(A) = {final_term1} + ({final_term2}) + ({final_term3})\"\n    print(calc_str3)\n\n    # Step 4: Show the final result\n    print(f\"det(A) = {final_term1 + final_term2 + final_term3}\")\n    \n    # Using integer for clean output as determinant is an integer.\n    print(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix is: {int(determinant)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
