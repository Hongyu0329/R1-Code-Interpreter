    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan to find the index of the boundary-value problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Problem**: I'll first interpret the given boundary-value problem `x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)`. The \"index\" of a linear boundary-value problem is the number of linearly independent solutions to the corresponding homogeneous problem, i.e., where `I(t)=0` and the boundary conditions are set to zero.\n\n2.  **Determine System Dimension**: The state vector is explicitly defined as `x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_2024(t))`. This sets the dimension of our system to `n = 2024`. The larger dimensions mentioned in the definitions of `A` and `I(t)` seem to be distractors, as the problem dynamics are ultimately determined by the `x` vector.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Index Calculation**: The solution to the homogeneous equation `x'(t) = Ax(t)` can be written as `x(t) = e^{At}x(0)`. Substituting this into the boundary conditions `Bx(0) + Cx(T) = 0` leads to a single matrix equation for the initial state `x(0)`: `(B + Ce^{AT})x(0) = 0`. The matrix `Q = B + Ce^{AT}` is known as the characteristic matrix. The index of the problem is the dimension of the null space of `Q`, which can be calculated as `n - rank(Q)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions**: The problem lists six boundary conditions. I will examine them to find how many are linearly independent.\n    *   `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0`, which is 5 times the previous condition.\n    *   `100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0`, which is 100 times the second condition.\n    *   `1000 x_2(0) - 1000 x_2(T) = 0`, which is -1000 times the second condition.\n    *   `100x_2024(T) - 100x_2024(0) = 0`, which is an independent condition on `x_2024`.\n    It appears there are only 3 linearly independent constraints among the 6 given.\n\n5.  **Compute the Rank**: Based on the analysis, the rank of the characteristic matrix `Q` should be 3. The exact values in the diagonal matrix `A` (and thus `e^{AT}`) do not affect the rank, as long as `e^{-T/R_i}` is not equal to 1 (which is a reasonable assumption for physical resistances `R_i > 0` and time `T > 0`).\n\n6.  **Calculate the Index and Generate Code**: With `n = 2024` and `rank(Q) = 3`, the index is `2024 - 3 = 2021`. I will write a Python script using the `numpy` library to formally construct the matrices, compute the rank, and print the final calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bvp_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
