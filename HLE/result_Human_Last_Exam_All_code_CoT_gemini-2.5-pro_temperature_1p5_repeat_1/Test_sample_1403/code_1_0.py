# The problem asks for the difference in the guaranteed number of correct guesses between two scenarios.

# Scenario 1: N - Simultaneous Guessing
# In this scenario, all nine individuals guess their hat color at the same time.
# A common group strategy involves using parity. The group agrees beforehand to assume the total
# number of one type of hat (e.g., "black and yellow") is even.
# Each individual then guesses their own hat color to make this assumption true based on the other 8 hats they see.
# However, this strategy has a critical flaw for guaranteeing correct guesses:
# - If the actual number of "black and yellow" hats is even, everyone's guess is correct.
# - If the actual number is odd, everyone's guess is incorrect.
# Since the strategy must work for ANY hat distribution, the guaranteed minimum number of correct
# guesses (N) is 0, as we must account for the worst-case scenario.
N = 0

# Scenario 2: M - Sequential Guessing
# In this scenario, one individual (the 'leader') guesses first, and the other eight ('followers')
# hear the leader's guess before making their own simultaneous guess.
# The leader's guess can be used to convey information. The strategy is as follows:
# 1. The leader counts the number of "black and yellow" hats on the 8 followers.
# 2. The leader's guess encodes the parity of this count. For example, they say "blue and white" for an even count
#    and "black and yellow" for an odd count.
# 3. Each follower hears this announced parity. They also see the other 7 followers' hats.
# 4. By comparing the parity of the 7 hats they see with the announced parity of all 8 followers,
#    each follower can deduce their own hat color with complete certainty.
# This means all 8 followers are guaranteed to be correct. The leader's guess is not guaranteed.
# Therefore, the guaranteed number of correct guesses (M) is 8.
M = 8

# The final question is to find the difference M - N.
difference = M - N
