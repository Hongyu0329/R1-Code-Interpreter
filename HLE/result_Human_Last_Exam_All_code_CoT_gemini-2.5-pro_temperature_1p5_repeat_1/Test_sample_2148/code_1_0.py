# Step 1: Define the coupling constants for massless neutrinos as given in the problem.
c_V = 0.5
c_A = 0.5

# Step 2: Calculate the term (c_V^2 + c_A^2).
# This term appears in the expressions for both X1 and X2.
cv2_plus_ca2 = c_V**2 + c_A**2

# Step 3: Determine the expressions for X1 and X2 based on the problem statement.
#
# For X2:
# We are given two equations for the decay rate Gamma for neutrinos:
# (a) Gamma = X2 * G_F * m_Z^3
# (b) Gamma = (G_F * m_Z^3 / (12*sqrt(2)*pi)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
# By comparing (a) and (b), we find:
# X2 = (1 / (12*sqrt(2)*pi)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
#
# For X1:
# We use the standard relation between the decay rate (Gamma) and the spin-averaged
# squared amplitude (|M|^2) for a spin-1 particle decaying to two massless fermions:
# Gamma = |M|^2 / (16*pi*m_Z) => |M|^2 = 16*pi*m_Z * Gamma
# Substituting equation (b) for Gamma:
# |M|^2 = 16*pi*m_Z * [ (G_F * m_Z^3 / (12*sqrt(2)*pi)) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2) ]
# Simplifying this gives:
# |M|^2 = (16 / (12*sqrt(2))) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
# |M|^2 = (2*sqrt(2) / 3) * G_F * m_Z^4 * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)
# The problem defines |M|^2 = X1 * G_F * m_Z^4. Comparing these gives:
# X1 = (2*sqrt(2) / 3) * (c_V^2 + c_A^2)

# Step 4: Calculate the product X1 * X2 symbolically.
# X1 * X2 = [ (2*sqrt(2)/3) * (c_V^2+c_A^2) ] * [ (1/(12*sqrt(2)*pi)) * (c_V^2+c_A^2) ]
# X1 * X2 = (2*sqrt(2) / (3 * 12*sqrt(2)*pi)) * (c_V^2+c_A^2)^2
# X1 * X2 = (2 / (36*pi)) * (c_V^2+c_A^2)^2
# X1 * X2 = (1 / (18*pi)) * (c_V^2+c_A^2)^2
#
# Now substitute the value of (c_V^2+c_A^2) which is 0.5:
# X1 * X2 = (1 / (18*pi)) * (0.5)^2 = (1 / (18*pi)) * 0.25 = 1 / (72*pi)

# Step 5: Calculate the inverse (X1 * X2)^-1.
# (X1 * X2)^-1 = (1 / (72*pi))^-1 = 72 * pi

# The final equation is: result = 72 * pi.
# We output the numbers in this final equation.
factor1 = 72
factor2 = math.pi
result = factor1 * factor2
