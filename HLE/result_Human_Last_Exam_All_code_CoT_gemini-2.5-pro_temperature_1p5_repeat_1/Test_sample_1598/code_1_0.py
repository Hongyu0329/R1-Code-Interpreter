    Calculates the global labeling number for the graph K_1,100.
    
    The graph K_1,n is a star graph with one central vertex and n leaf vertices.
    The problem defines a global labeling as an assignment of positive integer labels 
    to edges such that for any orientation of the edges, the sum of incoming edge 
    labels is different for any two adjacent vertices.

    For K_1,n, let the central vertex be 'c' and the leaf vertices be l_1, ..., l_n.
    The edges are (c, l_i), with corresponding labels w_i.
    The condition must hold for pairs (c, l_i).

    Let's consider an edge (c, l_i) with label w_i.
    If we orient it as c -> l_i, the incoming sum for l_i is w_i.
    The incoming sum for c is the sum of some subset of {w_j | j != i}.
    To satisfy the condition, w_i cannot be equal to any sum of a subset of other labels.
    
    If we orient it as l_i -> c, the incoming sum for l_i is 0.
    The incoming sum for c is w_i plus some sum of a subset of {w_j | j != i}.
    This sum will always be positive (since labels are positive), so it can't equal 0.

    So, the core condition on the set of labels {w_1, ..., w_n} is:
    For any i, w_i cannot be expressed as a sum of a subset of {w_j | j != i}.

    To find the minimum possible maximum label (the global labeling number), we should
    construct the set of n=100 labels greedily, making them as small as possible.
    Let the labels be ordered w_1 < w_2 < ... < w_n.
    
    The condition simplifies: For any i > 1, w_i cannot be a sum of a subset of {w_1, ..., w_{i-1}}.
    
    Let's construct the sequence:
    - w_1 = 1
    - w_2 > 1 and w_2 != 1. Smallest choice: w_2 = 2.
    - w_3 > 2 and w_3 is not in {1, 2, 1+2=3}. Smallest choice: w_3 = 4.
    - w_4 > 4 and w_4 is not in {1, 2, 4, 1+2=3, 1+4=5, 2+4=6, 1+2+4=7}. Smallest choice: w_4 = 8.

    This pattern reveals that the optimal set of labels is the powers of two:
    w_i = 2^(i-1) for i = 1, ..., n.
    For n=100, the labels are {2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^99}.
    The global labeling number is the maximum label, w_100.
