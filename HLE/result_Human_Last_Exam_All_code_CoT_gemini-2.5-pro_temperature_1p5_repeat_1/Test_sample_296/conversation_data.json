    "Answering this question requires applying group theory concepts to the specific properties of the Grigorchuk group. We need to count the number of subgroups of index 4.\n\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` with index `n` corresponds to a homomorphism `φ` from `G` into the symmetric group `S_n`, where the image `φ(G)` is a transitive subgroup. In our case, `n=4`, so we are interested in homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group `G` to `S_4`.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to calculate the number of such subgroups:\n1.  Identify the relevant target groups. The Grigorchuk group `G` is a 2-group (every element has an order that is a power of 2). This means the image of any homomorphism from `G` must also be a 2-group. We need to find the transitive subgroups of `S_4` that are 2-groups. These are the Klein four-group `V_4` (order 4), the cyclic group `C_4` (order 4), and the dihedral group `D_4` (order 8).\n2.  Count the subgroups corresponding to each possible image group `T`.\n    *   **Normal Subgroups:** If a subgroup `H` is normal, the quotient group `G/H` is well-defined and has order 4. Thus `G/H` is isomorphic to `C_4` or `V_4`. We can count these by counting the surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from `G` onto `C_4` and `V_4`. The number of such normal subgroups is given by `|Epi(G, T)| / |Aut(T)|`.\n    *   **Non-normal Subgroups:** These subgroups arise from surjective homomorphisms from `G` to `D_4`.\n3.  To perform the calculations for normal subgroups, we will use the known fact that the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group is `G/[G,G] ≅ (Z/2Z)^3`. Any homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization.\n4.  For non-normal subgroups, it's a known (but non-trivial) result that there are no surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to `D_4`.\n5.  Sum the counts from all cases to get the total number of subgroups of index 4.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grigorchuk_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify possible quotient structures for subgroups of index 4.\")\n    print(\"A subgroup of index 4 corresponds to a transitive action on 4 elements, defining a homomorphism G -> S4.\")\n    print(\"Since the Grigorchuk group G is a 2-group, the image of this homomorphism must be a transitive 2-subgroup of S4.\")\n    print(\"The transitive 2-subgroups of S4 are C4 (cyclic), V4 (Klein-four), and D4 (dihedral).\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: Normal subgroups (quotient is C4 or V4)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the number of normal subgroups of index 4.\")\n    print(\"These correspond to epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) from G to C4 or V4.\")\n\n    # Subcase 2a: Quotient C4\n    print(\"\\n--- Analyzing quotient C4 ---\")\n    print(\"Homomorphisms from G to an abelian group like C4 factor through G's abelianization, G_ab = (Z/2Z)^3.\")\n    print(\"Thus, Hom(G, C4) is equivalent to Hom((Z/2Z)^3, C4).\")\n    print(\"The image of any element from (Z/2Z)^3 must have order dividing 2.\")\n    print(\"However, C4 has elements of order 4.
