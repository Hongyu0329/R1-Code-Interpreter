# Determined values for the constants
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# Based on the problem statement expanding the function f(x)=1,
# we assume K=1.
K = 1

# Calculate the product
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Print the final equation and the result
print(f"The calculation is: {K} * {K1} * {K2} * {K3} * {K4} = {product}")
