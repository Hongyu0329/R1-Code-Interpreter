For n=1, the value is λ = 1.
For n=2, the values are λ = -6 - 4*sqrt(3) and λ = -6 + 4*sqrt(3).
For n=3, the values are the roots of 720*λ**3 + 4320*λ**2 + 5670*λ - 3600 = 0, which do not have a simple form.
There is no simple closed-form expression for λ in terms of n. The provided Python script can calculate these values for any given n.
