    "To find the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Transform the integral equation into a system of linear equations.**\n    The kernel of the integral `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` can be written as a sum `∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`. This shows it's a degenerate (or separable) kernel.\n    The equation becomes `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} c_k`, where `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. This implies that any solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`.\n    Substituting the form of `u(x)` back into the definitions for `c_k`, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` constants `c₀, c₁, ..., c_{n-1}`. This system can be written in matrix form as:\n    `(I - λA)c = b`\n    where `I` is the `n x n` identity matrix, `c` is the column vector of `c_k`, and\n    -   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{k,l} = 1 / (k + n - l)` for `k,l ∈ {0, ..., n-1}`.\n    -   `b` is a column vector with elements `b_k = 1 / (k + 1)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fredholm Alternative Theorem.**\n    This theorem tells us about the solutions of `(I - λA)c = b`:\n    -   If the matrix `(I - λA)` is non-singular (i.e., `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`), a unique solution for `c` exists, and therefore a unique solution `u(x)` exists.\n    -   If the matrix `(I - λA)` is singular (i.e., `det(I - λA) = 0`), a solution exists only if the vector `b` is in the column space of `(I - λA)`. If `b` is not in the column space, there is **no solution**.\n\n3.  **Find the critical values of λ.**\n    The values of `λ` for which `det(I - λA) = 0` are the characteristic values. Let `M = I - λA`. We need to find the roots of the polynomial equation `det(M) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Check the condition for no solution.**\n    For each characteristic value `λ`, we must check if `b` lies in the column space of `M`. A straightforward way to do this is using Cramer's rule. If `det(M) = 0`, a solution can only exist if `det(M_i) = 0` for all `i`, where `M_i` is the matrix `M` with its `i`-th column replaced by `b`. If we find even one `i` for which `det(M_i) ≠ 0`, we can conclude that for that `λ`, no solution exists.\n\nSince the problem is stated for a general integer `n`, and a simple closed-form solution is not apparent, the following Python code will solve the problem for a specific value of `n` (e.g., `n=3`).\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution\n    for a specific integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Solving for n = {n}\")\n\n    lam = sympy.symbols('lam')\n\n    # 1.
