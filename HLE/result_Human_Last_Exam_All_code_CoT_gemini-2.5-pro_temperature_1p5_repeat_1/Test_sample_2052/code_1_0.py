def solve_superintegrability_question():
    """
    Solves the two-part question about the superintegrability of a matrix model.

    Question (a) asks if superintegrability holds for n=3.
    Based on the theory of matrix models, the character expansion provided for Z_{-n}(t)
    is a defining feature of superintegrability. This property is known to hold for all n >= 2.
    Therefore, the model is superintegrable for n=3.

    Question (b) asks if the operator W_{-4} is necessary for n=4.
    The n=3 model is known to be equivalent to the n=2 (Gaussian) model, meaning
    it can be described by the simpler Virasoro algebra without new operators.
    This equivalence does not extend to n=4. The quartic potential term introduces
    fundamentally new dynamics that require a W_4 algebra operator, which cannot be
    decomposed into simpler operators from W_2 or W_3 algebras.
    Therefore, the operator W_{-4} is necessary for the n=4 model.
