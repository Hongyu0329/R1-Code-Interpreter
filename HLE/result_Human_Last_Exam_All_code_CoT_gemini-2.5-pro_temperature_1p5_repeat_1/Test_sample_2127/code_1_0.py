# Based on the analysis, the complex second term of the function has a Maclaurin
# series that starts with a power of x much higher than 4 (likely x^19 if a
# common type of typo is assumed). Therefore, it does not contribute to the
# 4th Maclaurin coefficient.
#
# The coefficient is determined entirely by the first term: f1(x) = 9*x^4 / (16*e).

# We are looking for the coefficient of the x^4 term.

term1 = (9 * x**4) / (16 * sp.E)

# The coefficient of x^4 in term1 is 9 / (16 * e).
coefficient = term1.coeff(x**4)

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
