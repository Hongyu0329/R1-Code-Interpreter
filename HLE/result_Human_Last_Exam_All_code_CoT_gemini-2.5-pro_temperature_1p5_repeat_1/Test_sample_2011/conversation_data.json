    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question:** The most straightforward interpretation of the question (\"number of different clique sizes\") would lead to a trivial answer (128, for a complete graph K_128). A more meaningful and standard interpretation in graph theory is to find the maximum number of different sizes of **maximal cliques**. A maximal clique is one that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. This interpretation leads to a non-trivial and interesting result. I will proceed with this interpretation.\n2.  **Apply a key theorem:** There is a theorem in graph theory that provides an upper bound on the number of distinct maximal clique sizes. For a graph `G` with `n` vertices, clique number `w(G)` (the size of the largest clique), and `m` distinct maximal clique sizes, the theorem states: `m + w(G) <= n + 1`.\n3.  **Derive a tighter bound:** In a graph with `m` distinct maximal clique sizes, the largest of these sizes, `w(G)`, must be at least `m`. By substituting this (`w(G) >= m`) into the theorem, we can derive a direct inequality for `m`: `2 * m <= n + 1`.\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** Using the derived inequality and the given `n = 128`, I will calculate the maximum possible integer value for `m`. This bound is known to be achievable by specific graph constructions.\n5.  **Write the code:** I will provide a Python script that carries out this calculation, explaining the logical steps as it goes.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the answer:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of different clique sizes for n=128 vertices\n    based on the maximal cliques interpretation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"This solution interprets the problem as finding the maximum number of different sizes of *maximal* cliques.\")\n    print(\"Let 'n' be the number of vertices and 'm' be the number of different maximal clique sizes.\")\n    print(f\"Given n = {n}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: State the relevant theorem\n    print(\"Step 1: A theorem in graph theory states that for any graph G with n vertices,\")\n    print(\"m + w(G) <= n + 1, where w(G) is the size of the largest clique in G.\")\n    print(f\"m + w(G) <= {n} + 1\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Relate w(G) to m\n    print(\"Step 2: For there to be 'm' *different* maximal clique sizes, the largest among them, w(G),\")\n    print(\"must be at least 'm'.
