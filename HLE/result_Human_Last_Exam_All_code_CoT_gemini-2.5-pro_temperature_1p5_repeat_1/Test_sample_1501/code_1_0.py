  # (a) True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
  # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.
  #
  # This question asks for the degree of a vertex in the graph of ND-pairs.
  # In standard doubling constructions, the graph of ND-pairs in the resulting SQS(2v)
  # consists of all pairs except for vertical pairs of the form {(x,0), (x,1)}.
  # Let's find the number of ND-partners for a point, say p = (x, 0).
  # Its partners will be all other points in the 2v-point set, except for (x,1).
  # The partners are:
  # 1. All points (y, 0) where y != x. There are v-1 such points.
  # 2. All points (y, 1) where y != x. There are v-1 such points.
  # The total number of ND-partners is (v-1) + (v-1) = 2v - 2.
  # The statement claims the number is v-1.
  # For v >= 4 (the condition for an SQS), 2v - 2 is not equal to v - 1.
  # Thus, the statement is False.

  # (b) What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in the resulting
  # nested SQS(2v) if the pair {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?
  #
  # An ND-pair like {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is formed from a block of the type
  # {(x, 0), (y, 0), (z, 1), (w, 1)}. This block type is created if and only if
  # {x, y, z, w} is a block in the original SQS(v) that is nested with the
  # pairs {x, y} and {z, w}.
  # By definition, the multiplicity mu of {x, y} in the SQS(v) is the number of
  # such blocks. Each of these original blocks generates exactly one block in the
  # SQS(2v) that contributes to the multiplicity of {(x, 0), (y, 0)}.
  # Therefore, the new multiplicity is equal to the original multiplicity, mu.
  answer_b = "μ"
  
  # (c) Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed SQS(2v)?
  #
  # In any SQS on u points, the maximum number of blocks that can contain a given
  # pair of points is (u-2)/2. The multiplicity of an ND-pair is the number of
  # these blocks in which the pair is nested, so it cannot exceed this value.
  # In our constructed SQS(2v), we set u = 2v.
  # The maximum possible multiplicity for any ND-pair is (2v - 2) / 2 = v - 1.
  # Since v >= 4, the maximum multiplicity is v-1, which is strictly less than v.
  # Therefore, it is impossible for an ND-pair to have a multiplicity of exactly v.

  # We use print() to output the final answer string.
