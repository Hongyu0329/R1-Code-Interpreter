# Number of equations corresponding to the positive eigenvalue th(t) in A(t)
num_unstable_equations = 2024

# For each of these equations, the homogeneous solution is unbounded.
# This leads to two conditions for a bounded solution to the boundary value problem to exist:
# 1. A condition on the forcing term f_i(t) to ensure a bounded solution to the DE exists.
# 2. A condition relating f_i(t) and alpha_i to satisfy the boundary condition.
conditions_per_unstable_equation = 2

# For the remaining infinite number of equations, the homogeneous part is stable.
# This allows the free constant in the general solution to be used to satisfy
# the boundary condition for any f_i(t) and alpha_i.
conditions_per_stable_equation = 0

# The total number of solvability conditions is the sum over all components.
# The infinitely many stable equations do not contribute any conditions.
total_conditions = num_unstable_equations * conditions_per_unstable_equation
