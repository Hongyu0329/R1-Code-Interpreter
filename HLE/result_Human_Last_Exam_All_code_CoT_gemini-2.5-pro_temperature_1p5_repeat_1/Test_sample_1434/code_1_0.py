# The problem asks for the sum of 1/4^n over a set S of pairs (n, m).
# Based on the analysis, the set S consists of pairs (n, m) where n >= 1
# and m can be one of two values for each n: 0 or K_n, where K_n is the size of the set S_p.
# This means for each n, there are two pairs in S that contribute to the sum.
# The total sum is Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4^n + 1/4^n) which simplifies to:
# 2 * Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n

# This is a geometric series.
# The sum of an infinite geometric series Sum_{n=1 to infinity} ar^(n-1) is a / (1-r).
# Our series is Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n.
# The first term is a = 1/4.
# The common ratio is r = 1/4.
# The sum of the series is (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

# The problem's sum is 2 times this value.
