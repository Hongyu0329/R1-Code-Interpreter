    print("   - The subscript '_i' indicates they refer to the same entity.")
    print("   - The subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("   - Because the R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-referential pronoun 'She_i', it is considered 'bound'.")
    print("   - This directly violates Binding Principle C. Therefore, this sentence is ungrammatical for this reason.")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("\nB. 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical, but not because of a binding principle.")
    print("   - It violates the Left Branch Condition, a constraint on movement in syntax.")
