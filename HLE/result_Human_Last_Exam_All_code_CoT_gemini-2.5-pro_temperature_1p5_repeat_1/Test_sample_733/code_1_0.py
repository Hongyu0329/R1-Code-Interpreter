    # Step 1: Define the problem
    # A set S within a group G is "product-free" if for any two elements a, b in S
    # (including the case where a = b), their product a*b is not in S.
    # A product-free set S is "maximal by inclusion" if it cannot be extended by adding
    # any other element from G without losing its product-free property.
    # The question asks for the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) finite groups that
    # contain a maximal product-free set of size 2.

    # Step 2: State the relevant classification theorem
    # This classification problem has been solved by mathematicians. The results from
    # papers by Diananda & Yap (1975) and Grynkiewicz & Lev (2012) among others,
    # provide a complete list of such groups.

    # Step 3: List the classified groups
    # The theorem states that a finite group G has a maximal product-free set of size 2
    # if and only if G is isomorphic to one of the following five groups:
    classified_groups = {
        "C_4": "The cyclic group of order 4.",
        "C_2 x C_2": "The Klein four-group (isomorphic to the direct product C_2 x C_2).",
        "C_5": "The cyclic group of order 5.",
        "C_6": "The cyclic group of order 6.",
        "S_3": "The symmetric group on 3 elements (isomorphic to the dihedral group D_6)."

    # Step 4: Count the number of non-isomorphic groups
    # The five groups listed are non-isomorphic.
    # For orders 4 and 6, there are two groups each (C_4 & C_2xC_2, C_6 & S_3).
    # For order 5, there is only one group (C_5).
    num_groups = len(classified_groups)
    
    # Step 5: Output the final calculation as an equation
