    "This is a mathematical question about group theory. A computational approach to check all finite groups is not possible. Instead, I will rely on established classification theorems from the mathematical literature.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the properties**: Clearly state the definitions of a product-free set and a maximal by inclusion product-free set in a group.\n2.  **Consult mathematical literature**: The problem of classifying finite groups with maximal product-free sets of a certain size is a known problem in combinatorial group theory. I will use the classification theorem established by mathematicians V. F. Lev, A. Street, D. Whitehead, and others.\n3.  **List the groups**: Based on the theorems, I will list the specific non-isomorphic finite groups that satisfy the condition of having a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n4.  **Count the groups**: I will count the number of groups in the list to get the final answer.\n5.  **Present the solution**: I will present this reasoning and the final answer in a Python script, as requested. The script will print the names of the groups and the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the question about the number of finite groups\n    with maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n    The solution is based on established mathematical theorems, not direct computation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem\n    # A set S within a group G is \"product-free\" if for any two elements a, b in S\n    # (including the case where a = b), their product a*b is not in S.\n    # A product-free set S is \"maximal by inclusion\" if it cannot be extended by adding\n    # any other element from G without losing its product-free property.\n    # The question asks for the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) finite groups that\n    # contain a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant classification theorem\n    # This classification problem has been solved by mathematicians.
