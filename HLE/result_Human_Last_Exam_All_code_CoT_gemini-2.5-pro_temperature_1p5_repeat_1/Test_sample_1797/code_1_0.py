# The user wants to identify the incorrect statements about attack graph analysis.
# Let's review each option:
# A. This statement correctly describes attack graphs as directed graphs and lists common analysis techniques like pathfinding and cut-set analysis. This is a fundamental concept and is correct.
# B. This statement correctly identifies the state explosion problem, noting the exponential growth (O(2^N)) of the graph size relative to the system size. This is a well-known challenge and is correct.
# C. This statement claims that the "attack graph generation problem" is NP-hard. In formal complexity theory, NP-hard problems are decision problems (yes/no answer). Generating a graph is a construction problem, not a decision problem. While decision problems related to attack graphs (like reachability) are indeed NP-hard or even PSPACE-complete, and the generation takes exponential time due to the graph's size, the generation problem itself is not technically classified as NP-hard. Therefore, this statement is formally incorrect.
# D. This statement correctly points out that systems are dynamic and attack graphs need to be updated. It mentions incremental updates as an efficient technique for this, which is an active area of research and practice. This is correct.
# E. This statement correctly identifies the use of attack graphs with formal methods like model checking to verify security properties. This is a primary application of logical attack graphs. This is correct.
#
# Based on the analysis, the only clearly incorrect statement is C.
