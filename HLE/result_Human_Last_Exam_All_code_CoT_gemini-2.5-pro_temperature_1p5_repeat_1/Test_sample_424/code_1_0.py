# Plan:
# 1. Identify the special points (vertices) in the given planar set S.
#    These are endpoints of the line segments and intersection points of the curves.
# 2. For each special point, determine how removing it affects the number of connected components of the complement.
# 3. The initial number of components of the complement is 7.
# 4. We count the points p for which the number of components of the complement of S\{p} is 3 or more.
# 5. Group the points based on their properties and count the number of points in each group.

# Group 1: Dangling endpoints (degree 1 vertices bordering one region).
# Points: (0, 3/2), (-3/2, 0), (-1/2, 1), (1/2, 1)
# Number of components after removal: 7. (7 >= 3)
group1_count = 4

# Group 2: Inner endpoints (degree 1 vertices bordering three regions).
# Points: (0, 1/2), (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), (0, -1/2)
# Number of components after removal: 7 - (3 - 1) = 5. (5 >= 3)
group2_count = 4

# Group 3: Outer junction points (degree 2 vertices bordering two regions).
# Points: (3/2, 0), (0, -3/2)
# Number of components after removal: 7 - (2 - 1) = 6. (6 >= 3)
group3_count = 2

# Group 4: Intersection points on the unit circle (vertices of degree > 2).
# Points: (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)
# All result in 4 or 5 components, which is >= 3.
group4_count = 4

# Total number of points is the sum of counts from all groups.
total_points = group1_count + group2_count + group3_count + group4_count

print(f"{group1_count} + {group2_count} + {group3_count} + {group4_count} = {total_points}")

# The final answer is the total number of such points.
# The calculation has been performed above.
final_answer = total_points
# print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
