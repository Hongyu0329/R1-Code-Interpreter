    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the problem:** The core of the task is to find the minimum area of a convex set `K` that has a non-empty intersection with every line of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n2.  **Test candidate shapes:** I will consider a few simple convex shapes centered at the origin, such as a circle, a square, and a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees). For each shape, I will:\n    a.  Determine the condition under which it intersects the line `px + qy = 1`. This often involves finding the maximum and minimum values of the expression `px + qy` over the shape.\n    b.  Verify if this condition holds for all coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`.\n    c.  Calculate the area of the shape.\n3.  **Establish a lower bound:** Based on the areas of the shapes that satisfy the condition, I can find an upper bound for the minimal area. The mathematical proof for the sharp lower bound (that the area must be at least 2) is quite involved, relying on concepts like polar duality and Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies. My code will not reproduce this proof but will empirically support its result.\n4.  **Develop a Python script:** I will create a Python script that implements the tests for the candidate shapes. The script will:\n    a.  Generate a large number of coprime integer pairs `(p, q)` to test against.\n    b.  For each candidate shape (diamond, circle, square), it will check if it intersects all the generated lines.\n    c.  It will print the area of each shape and whether it is a valid solution (based on the test).\n    d.  This comparison will strongly suggest which shape has the minimal area. Finally, the script will print the known minimal area.\n\nThis approach uses a computational exploration to make the abstract mathematical problem more concrete and to justify the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_intersection(shape, p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if the line px + qy = 1 intersects a given shape.\n    This is done by checking if the value 1 is within the range\n    [min(px+qy), max(px+qy)] over the shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    if p == 0 and q == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    if shape == 'diamond':\n        # For the diamond |x|+|y|<=1, the vertices are (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1).\n        # The extreme values of px+qy are max(|p|, |q|) and -max(|p|, |q|).\n        # The line intersects if 1 <= max(|p|, |q|).\n        # This holds for all coprime pairs since they can't be (0,0).\n        return 1 <= max(abs(p), abs(q))\n        \n    elif shape == 'circle':\n        # For the unit circle x^2+y^2<=1, intersection occurs if the distance\n        # from the origin to the line is <= 1.\n        # The distance is 1 / sqrt(p^2 + q^2).\n        return 1.0 / math.sqrt(p**2 + q**2) <= 1.0\n\n    elif shape == 'square':\n        # For the square |x|<=1, |y|<=1, the vertices are (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1).\n        # The extreme values of px+qy are |p|+|q| and -(|p|+|q|).\n        # The line intersects if 1 <= |p|+|q|.\n        # This holds for all coprime pairs.\n        return 1 <= abs(p) + abs(q)\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Investigates the minimal area problem by testing candidate shapes\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    limit = 100\n    coprime_pairs = []\n    for p in range(-limit, limit + 1):\n        for q in range(-limit, limit + 1):\n            if p == 0 and q == 0:\n                continue\n            if math.gcd(p, q) == 1:\n                coprime_pairs.append((p, q))\n\n    print(\"Investigating candidate convex domains...\\n\")\n    \n    candidates = {\n        'Diamond (|x|+|y|<=1)': {'shape': 'diamond', 'area': 2.0},\n        'Unit Circle (x^2+y^2<=1)': {'shape': 'circle', 'area': math.pi},\n        'Square (|x|<=1, |y|<=1)': {'shape': 'square', 'area': 4.0}\n    }\n\n    results = []\n    for name, data in candidates.items():\n        is_valid = all(check_intersection(data['shape'], p, q) for p, q in coprime_pairs)\n        if is_valid:\n            results.append((data['area'], name))\n    \n    # Sort results by area to find the minimum\n    results.sort()\n\n    print(\"Testing which shapes intersect all lines px+qy=1 for coprime (p,q):\")\n    for area, name in results:\n        print(f\"- {name}: Area = {area:.4f}.
