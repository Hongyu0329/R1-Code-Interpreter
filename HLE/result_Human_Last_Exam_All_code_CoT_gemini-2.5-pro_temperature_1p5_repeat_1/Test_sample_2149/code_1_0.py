# Step 1: Define the values based on the clues.
# Y1 from Clue 1: Edwin Drake's first oil well in 1859.
Y1 = 1859

# Hall value for the calculation: Charles Martin Hall's patent year.
Hall = 1886

# Y4 from Clue 2: Victor Hugo (Гюго) -> Yugo -> ISO code for Yugoslavia.
Y4 = 891

# Y3 and Y2 from Clue 3: Reactants in the Heck reaction.
# The formulas are Y1=X1X2X3X4, Y2=X5X6X2X7X6, Y3=X3X4X8X6
# Y1=1859 -> X2=8, X3=5, X4=9
# Y3 must be 59X8X6. The CAS registry number for Iodobenzene is 591-50-4.
# We derive the index Y3 = 5915 from it.
Y3 = 5915
# This means X6=5. Y2 must be of the form X5X6X2X7X6 -> _58_5.
# 15815 is a value consistent with the constraints.
Y2 = 15815

# Step 2: Calculate the final result.
# The expression "Y4 to the Y1-Hall" suggests a ratio.
result = Y4 / (Y1 - Hall)

# Step 3: Print the full equation and the final answer.
