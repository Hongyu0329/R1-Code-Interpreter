    "To determine the most suitable technique for synthesizing your peptide, I will analyze the specific challenges it presentsâ€”its length (100 amino acids) and the inclusion of an unnatural amino acid (azido phenylalanine). I will evaluate three primary synthesis methodologies:\n1.  **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** The standard for short peptides.\n2.  **Recombinant Protein Expression:** Using cellular machinery.\n3.  **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** A hybrid approach combining chemical synthesis of fragments and then joining them.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through the pros and cons of each method for your specific case and print a final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_peptide_synthesis_methods():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and recommends a synthesis method for a long peptide\n    containing an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_amino_acid = \"azido phenylalanine\"\n\n    print(\"--- Peptide Synthesis Strategy Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Target: A peptide of {peptide_length} amino acids.\")\n    print(f\"Special Feature: Contains an unnatural amino acid ('X' = {unnatural_amino_acid}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n    print(\"\\n[Option A] Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\")\n    print(\"   - Description: Stepwise addition of amino acids to a chain growing on a solid support.\")\n    print(\"   - Assessment:\")\n    print(f\"     - At {peptide_length}aa, the cumulative yield would be extremely low due to small inefficiencies at each coupling step.\")\n    print(\"     - Long peptide chains are prone to aggregation on the resin, hindering synthesis.\")\n    print(\"   - Verdict: Inefficient and high-risk for a peptide of this length.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[Option B] Recombinant Protein Expression\")\n    print(\"   - Description: Using a host organism (e.g., E. coli) to produce the peptide from a genetic template.\")\n    print(\"   - Assessment:\")\n    print(\"     - Standard biological systems cannot incorporate unnatural amino acids like azido phenylalanine.\")\n    print(\"     - Requires advanced and complex 'genetic code expansion' techniques, which are highly specialized.\")\n    print(\"   - Verdict: Feasible but technically demanding and not a routine method.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[Option C] Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\")\n    print(\"   - Description: Chemically joining two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments to form a larger one.\")\n    print(\"   - Strategy for this target:\")\n    print(\"     1.
