    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integrand:** The core of the problem is the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This form is the result of the chain rule applied to `ln(F₃(x))`. Specifically, the derivative of `ln(f(x))` is `f'(x)/f(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** Therefore, the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln(F₃(x))`. To evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we will use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: `∫[a, b] g'(x) dx = g(b) - g(a)`. In our case, `g(x) = ln(F₃(x))`, `a=0`, and `b=1`. The value of the integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n3.  **Calculate the Values:** The next step is to compute `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` based on the given function definitions.\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   For x=1: `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   For x=0: `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Compute the Final Result:** After calculating `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, I will multiply it by 10000 and find the closest integer as requested.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` module and print out the components of the calculation before giving the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef F3(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the value of F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).\n  \"\"\"\n  f0_x = x\n  f1_x = math.sin(f0_x)\n  f2_x = math.exp(f1_x)\n  f3_x = math.log(1 + f2_x)\n  return f3_x\n\n# The integral of F3'(x)/F3(x) is ln(F3(x)).\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n# V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\n\n# Calculate the values for the final equation\nF3_at_1 = F3(1)\nF3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The value of the integral V\nV = math.log(F3_at_1) - math.log(F3_at_0)\n\n# The target value is 10000 * V\ntarget_value = 10000 * V\n\n# The closest integer to the target value\nresult = round(target_value)\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate the terms F3(1) and F3(0)\")\nprint(f\"F3(1) = ln(1 + e^sin(1)) = {F3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F3(0) = ln(1 + e^sin(0)) = {F3_at_0}\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the value of the integral V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0))\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({F3_at_1}) - ln({F3_at_0}) = {V}\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the final value, which is the closest integer to 10000 * V\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = 10000 * {V} = {target_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
