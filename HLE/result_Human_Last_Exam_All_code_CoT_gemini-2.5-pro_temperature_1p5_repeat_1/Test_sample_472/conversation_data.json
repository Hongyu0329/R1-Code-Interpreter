    "This is a famous line from Catullus (73.6) and is notoriously difficult to scan because the transmitted text does not seem to fit the rules of dactylic hexameter perfectly. The second half of the line is a well-known crux (a point of textual difficulty).\n\nMy plan is to reconstruct the scansion based on the most common scholarly interpretation. This requires assuming a few things:\n1.  **Vowel Quantities by Nature:** We must know that in `bēne` (well), the first `e` is long. In `ēsse` (to be) or its alternate form `ēssē`, the first `e` is long. To resolve a major problem in the middle of the line, we'll assume Catullus used the form `ēssē`, where both vowels are long. In `sōlī` (alone), the `o` is long.\n2.  **Elision:** The phrase `bēne ēssē` undergoes elision, where the final `-e` of `bēne` is dropped before the initial `ē-` of `ēssē`. It becomes `bēn' ēssē`.\n3.  **Poetic License:** To make the fourth foot scan correctly as a dactyl, many scholars assume an archaic poetic license where the final `-m` in `quom` does not make the syllable long by position.\n\nEven with these assumptions, the fifth foot (`sibi sit...`) remains problematic with the given text. However, the overall pattern is generally agreed upon. I will construct the code to print this standard scansion foot by foot.\n\n```python\ndef scan_catullus_73_6():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n    This line is famously difficult, and this solution follows a common scholarly reconstruction\n    that requires assuming certain vowel quantities and poetic licenses.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The line is composed of 6 feet in dactylic hexameter.\n    # Feet are either a Dactyl (L S S) or a Spondee (L L).\n    # Foot 5 is almost always a Dactyl, and Foot 6 is a Spondee or Trochee.\n\n    # Foot 1: \"et tibi\"\n    # \"et\" is long by position (followed by two 't's: et tibi). \"ti\" and \"bi\" are short.\n    foot1_syllables = [\"et\", \"ti\", \"bi\"]\n    foot1_scan = [\"L\", \"S\", \"S\"]\n\n    # Foot 2: \"bene esse\" (part 1) -> bēn' ēs-\n    # This assumes elision: bēn(e) ēssē.\n    # 'bēne' and 'ēssē' both have naturally long first 'e's.\n    foot2_syllables = [\"bēn'\", \"ēs\"]\n    foot2_scan = [\"L\", \"L\"]\n\n    # Foot 3: \"bene esse\" (part 2) and \"soli\" (part 1) -> -sē sō-\n    # This requires assuming the form ēssē (long e at the end).\n    # The 'o' in sōlī is naturally long.\n    foot3_syllables = [\"sē\", \"sō\"]\n    foot3_scan = [\"L\", \"L\"]\n\n    # Foot 4: \"soli\" (part 2) and \"quom sibi\" (part 1) -> -lī quom si-\n    # The final 'i' in 'soli' is treated as long (a \"common\" vowel).\n    # 'quom' is treated as short (poetic license, ignoring 'm' for position).\n    # 'si' is short.\n    foot4_syllables = [\"lī\", \"quom\", \"si\"]\n    foot4_scan = [\"L\", \"S\", \"S\"]\n    \n    # Foot 5: \"sibi\" (part 2) and \"sit\" -> -bi sit ma-\n    # This is the main problem (crux) of the line.
