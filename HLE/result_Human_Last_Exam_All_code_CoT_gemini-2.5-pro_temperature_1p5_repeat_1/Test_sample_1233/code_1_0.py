        "Case Summary": "A lab failed to isolate the causative agent of bloody diarrhea, likely Campylobacter, despite using the correct media and incubation conditions. A second lab succeeded with the same protocol.",
        "Target Organism Characteristics": "Campylobacter species are known to be fragile and lose viability quickly, especially with delays in processing.",
        "Inferred Mistake": "The most probable error by the first lab was a delay in processing the sample, leading to a decrease in viable Campylobacter organisms below the limit of detection.",
        "Evaluation of Options": {
            "A. Obtain a fresh sample": "A corrective action for the patient, but does not address how the first lab could have salvaged their original test run.",
            "B. Decrease sample processing time": "This directly counteracts the organism's fragility by plating it while more cells are still viable, which is the most likely root cause of the failure.",
            "C. Used Fresh Campylobacter plates": "This is a standard practice and less likely to be the single point of failure compared to the known sensitivity of the organism to processing delays.",
            "D. Incubated the sample for longer": "This would likely worsen the problem by allowing the observed contaminant (Bacillus) to overgrow the plate, further masking any potential Campylobacter growth.",
            "E. Increase the number of plates": "This is less effective than addressing the core problem, which is the low concentration of viable organisms in the inoculum."
        },
        "Conclusion": "The most logical way the first laboratory could have improved its chances of isolating the fragile organism is by minimizing the time between sample receipt and plating."
