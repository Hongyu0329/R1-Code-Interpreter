    Evaluates the correctness of the problem formulation.

    The problem asks if the formulation is correct. If it is, we should solve it.
    If not, we should return 0.

    Analysis of the formulation reveals a flaw in the non-overlapping constraints
    for the T1 cubes.

    The constraint for two T1 cubes is `min(|x_i-x_j|, |y_i-y_j|, |z_i-z_j|) >= 2`.
    This implies that the distance between the centers of any two cubes must be at least 2 units
    (1 cm) in ALL THREE axes simultaneously.

    Let's test this with a valid physical arrangement: two 1cm cubes placed side-by-side.
    In the problem's 0.5cm grid, their centers could be at c1 = (1, 1, 1) and c2 = (3, 1, 1).
    These cubes would occupy x-ranges [0, 2] and [2, 4] respectively, touching but not overlapping.
    However, for these centers:
    - |x1 - x2| = 2
    - |y1 - y2| = 0
    - |z1 - z2| = 0
    The constraint min(2, 0, 0) >= 2 is false.

    Since the formulation forbids valid, non-overlapping configurations, it is an
    incorrect model of the physical problem.

    As per the user's instruction to answer 0 if the formulation is incorrect,
    the function returns 0.
