    "Based on the principles of crystallography and optics, a crystal's ability to exhibit optical activity is fundamentally linked to its chirality. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Define Optical Activity:** Optical activity is the phenomenon where a substance rotates the plane of linearly polarized light. For this to occur in a crystal, the crystal structure must be chiral.\n2.  **Define Chirality:** A crystal structure (and its corresponding point group) is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. From a symmetry perspective, this means the point group must not contain any improper rotation axes (Sₙ). This explicitly excludes a center of inversion (i, which is S₂) and mirror planes (m, which is S₁).\n3.  **Define Achirality:** A crystal is achiral if it is *not* chiral. This means its point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (i.e., a center of inversion or a mirror plane).\n4.  **Identify the Contradiction:** The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the correct symmetry for **optical activity**.\n    *   Condition for optical activity: Must be **chiral**.\n    *   Condition from the question: Must be **achiral**.\n    These two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. Therefore, no such crystal classes exist.\n5.  **Role of the \"Non-polar\" Condition:** A crystal class is polar if it has a unique vector direction that is not repeated by symmetry. All polar classes lack a center of inversion. The question also specifies the class must be non-polar. While some chiral classes are non-polar (e.g., point group 432), the primary contradiction between \"achiral\" and \"optically active\" makes this condition secondary.\n6.  **Formulate a Script:** To fulfill the request for a code-based answer, I will write a Python script that programmatically searches for a crystal class meeting these contradictory criteria. The script will define the 32 crystal classes and their properties (chiral, polar) and then filter them. As expected, the search will yield no results, demonstrating the logical impossibility of the request.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal point groups to find which are achiral, non-polar,\n    and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for the 32 crystal point groups.\n    # A class is optically active if it is Chiral.\n    # An achiral class is one where Chiral is False.\n    data = \"\"\"\n    System,Class,H-M,Chiral,Polar\n    Triclinic,1,1,True,True\n    Triclinic,-1,-1,False,False\n    Monoclinic,2,2,True,True\n    Monoclinic,m,m,False,True\n    Monoclinic,2/m,2/m,False,False\n    Orthorhombic,222,222,True,True\n    Orthorhombic,mm2,mm2,False,True\n    Orthorhombic,mmm,mmm,False,False\n    Tetragonal,4,4,True,True\n    Tetragonal,-4,-4,False,True\n    Tetragonal,4/m,4/m,False,False\n    Tetragonal,422,422,True,True\n    Tetragonal,4mm,4mm,False,True\n    Tetragonal,-42m,-42m,False,True\n    Tetragonal,4/mmm,4/mmm,False,False\n    Trigonal,3,3,True,True\n    Trigonal,-3,-3,False,False\n    Trigonal,32,32,True,True\n    Trigonal,3m,3m,False,True\n    Trigonal,-3m,-3m,False,False\n    Hexagonal,6,6,True,True\n    Hexagonal,-6,-6,False,True\n    Hexagonal,6/m,6/m,False,False\n    Hexagonal,622,622,True,True\n    Hexagonal,6mm,6mm,False,True\n    Hexagonal,-6m2,-6m2,False,True\n    Hexagonal,6/mmm,6/mmm,False,False\n    Cubic,23,23,True,True\n    Cubic,m-3,m-3,False,False\n    Cubic,432,432,True,False\n    Cubic,-43m,-43m,False,True\n    Cubic,m-3m,m-3m,False,False\n    \"\"\"\n\n    df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(data))\n\n    # The conditions from the question are:\n    # 1.
