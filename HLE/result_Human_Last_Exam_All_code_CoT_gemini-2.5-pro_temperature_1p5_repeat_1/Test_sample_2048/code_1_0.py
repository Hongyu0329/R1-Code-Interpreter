    Calculates the value of l(k) based on a logical analysis of the problem.

    The problem statement contains a contradiction in the definition of the probability
    density function, which makes it ill-posed. A standard way to resolve such
    paradoxical problems is to assume a simple, non-informative distribution for
    the output variable z, such as the uniform distribution U[0, 1].

    Under this assumption:
    - The PDF p_k(z) is 1 for z in [0, 1]. So, p_k(1) = 1.
    - The differential entropy d_k is log(1-0) = 0.
    
    This leads to a constant value for l(k).
