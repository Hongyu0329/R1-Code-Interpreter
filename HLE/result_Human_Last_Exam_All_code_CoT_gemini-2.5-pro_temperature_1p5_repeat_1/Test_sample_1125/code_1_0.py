    This puzzle is a logic problem about cooperative reasoning and game theory.
    The solution doesn't require complex calculations, but a logical strategy.

    The optimal strategy for the team is to partition themselves into two groups:
    a group of 10 (G10) and a group of 2 (G2). Let's call the members of G2
    'Alex' and 'Ben'.

    The strategy proceeds as follows:
    1. Every one of the 10 members in G10 pairs up with Alex.
    2. Every one of the 10 members in G10 pairs up with Ben.

    This results in 20 pairings. Here's the reasoning for why this works:

    - For the 2 members in G2 (Alex and Ben): Their situation is perfectly
      symmetrical. Any argument Alex could make about his hat number, Ben could
      make as well. An adversarial leader will exploit this symmetry to keep
      them guessing.

    - For the 10 members in G10: Let's consider one member, 'Charlie', from G10.
      When Charlie pairs with Alex, the leader must reveal either Charlie's number
      or Alex's number. To keep Alex's number a secret (and thus maximize
      uncertainty), the leader is forced to reveal Charlie's number.
      Similarly, when Charlie pairs with Ben, the leader is forced to reveal
      Charlie's number to keep Ben's number a secret.

    - The "Convincing Explanation": Charlie can stand up and say, "My hat number is X.
      I know this because when I paired with Alex and Ben, the number X was revealed
      both times. The leader, in an effort to keep Alex and Ben's numbers ambiguous,
      had no choice but to reveal my number in each case. Therefore, I am certain
      my number is X."

    This logic applies to all 10 members of G10. They will all be able to determine
    their numbers with certainty.

    Alex and Ben will know their numbers are the last two remaining numbers from the
    set {1, ..., 12}, but they won't know who has which one.

    Therefore, the maximum number of people (N) who are guaranteed to determine
    their number is 10.

    print("Every member of G10 pairs with each member of G2.")
    print("The 10 members of G10 can deduce their numbers because the leader, to maintain ambiguity for G2, is forced to reveal the numbers of the G10 members.")
    print("The 2 members of G2 will know the two remaining numbers but cannot determine who has which.")
