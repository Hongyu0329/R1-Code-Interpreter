# The reasoning for selecting the best option for co-expression is based on biological principles
# of plasmid compatibility and selection, not on a calculation.
#
# Principles:
# 1. Plasmid Compatibility: To maintain two plasmids in one E. coli cell, they must have
#    different origins of replication (ori).
#    - pET, pGEX, pASK, and pGEM plasmids have a ColE1-type origin.
#    - pCDF plasmids have a CDF (CloDF13) origin.
#    - Therefore, a pCDF plasmid is compatible with a pET plasmid, but two pET plasmids are not compatible.
#
# 2. Selectable Markers: Each plasmid must confer resistance to a different antibiotic
#    to select for cells that contain both.
#
# Evaluation of the best option (C):
# - Plasmid 1: pCDFDuet-1
#   - Origin: CDF
#   - Resistance: Spectinomycin
#
# - Plasmid 2: pET-28a(+)
#   - Origin: ColE1
#   - Resistance: Kanamycin
#
# Analysis:
# - The origins (CDF and ColE1) are different, so the plasmids are compatible.
# - The antibiotic resistances (Spectinomycin and Kanamycin) are different, allowing for dual selection.
# - The pCDFDuet-1 vector is specifically designed for co-expression (containing two expression sites),
#   making this combination a state-of-the-art and highly effective system.
#
# This makes it the superior choice among the given options.
