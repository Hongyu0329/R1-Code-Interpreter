    "This is a problem in the mathematical field of topology, specifically continuum theory. I will outline the logical steps to arrive at the answer and then present a Python script that explains this reasoning.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the key terms**: I will start by defining an \"indecomposable continuum\" and a \"composant.\"\n2.  **Establish a lower bound**: Using the definitions, I'll explain why an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant, which means the minimum possible number is at least 2.\n3.  **Provide an existence proof**: I'll reference a known mathematical construction and a related theorem to show that an indecomposable continuum with exactly 2 composants can, in fact, exist. This is typically done using a \"Lakes of Wada\" type construction.\n4.  **Conclude the answer**: Since the number of composants must be at least 2, and an example with exactly 2 exists, the smallest possible number is 2.\n5.  **Final Code**: The python script will print this explanation step-by-step and then output the final answer, including the numbers used in the reasoning as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the smallest number of composants\n    an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the key mathematical terms.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"- A 'continuum' is a non-empty, compact, and connected space.\")\n    print(\"- A continuum is 'indecomposable' if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its own proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"- A 'composant' of a point x in a continuum is the set of all points y such that there is a proper subcontinuum containing both x and y.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the number of composants.\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A key theorem in continuum theory states that for an indecomposable continuum:\")\n    print(\"1.
