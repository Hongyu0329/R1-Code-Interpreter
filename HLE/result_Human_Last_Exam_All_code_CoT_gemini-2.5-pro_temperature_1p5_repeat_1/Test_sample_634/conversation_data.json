    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm. This involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Construct a stacked matrix**: We form a larger matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n2.  **Perform row reduction**: We apply elementary row operations to this stacked matrix `M` to transform it into its row-reduced echelon form (RREF). These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying `M` by a unimodular matrix.\n3.  **Extract the GCRD**: The GCRD of `P1` and `P2` is given by the non-zero rows of the resulting RREF matrix.\n\nI will use the `sympy` library in Python to carry out these symbolic matrix operations. The code will define the matrices, construct the stacked matrix, compute the RREF, and then print the resulting GCRD in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define 's' as a symbolic variable\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2 as given in the problem\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                    [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                    [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # To find the GCRD, we stack P1 and P2 vertically to form a single matrix M\n    M = sp.Matrix.vstack(P1, P2)\n\n    # We then compute the row-reduced echelon form (RREF) of M.\n    # The `rref()` method returns the RREF matrix and the indices of the pivot columns.\n    M_rref, pivot_columns = M.rref()\n\n    # The GCRD is formed by the non-zero rows of the RREF matrix.\n    # The number of non-zero rows is equal to the number of pivot columns.\n    num_gcrd_rows = len(pivot_columns)\n    G = M_rref[:num_gcrd_rows, :]\n\n    # Print the resulting GCRD matrix.\n    # The output is formatted to clearly show the final matrix equation.\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor G(s) is:\")\n    \n    # Build a string representation of the matrix for clean printing\n    matrix_str = \"G(s) = [\"\n    for i in range(G.rows):\n        row_str = \", \".join(map(str, G.row(i)))\n        matrix_str += f\"[{row_str}]\"\n        if i < G.rows - 1:\n            matrix_str += \",\\n        \"\n    matrix_str += \"]\"\n    \n    print(matrix_str)\n\nsolve_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
