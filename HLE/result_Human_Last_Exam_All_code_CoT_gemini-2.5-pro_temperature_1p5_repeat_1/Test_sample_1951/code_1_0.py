# This script identifies and prints the incorrect statements about Attack Graphs.
# Based on the analysis, statements D and E are incorrect.

# Statement D is incorrect because calculating probabilities on cyclic graphs is difficult
# but not impossible. Methods exist for both Markov chains (for SEGs) and cyclic
# probabilistic graphical models (for LAGs).

# Statement E is incorrect because it is an overgeneralization. While basic LAGs
# based on monotonic logic cannot handle negation, many advanced formalisms like
# Answer Set Programming (ASP) are widely used for attack graph generation and
# can handle negation and non-monotonicity effectively.

# The other statements (A, B, C) are generally considered correct descriptions
# of the properties of and relationship between SEGs and LAGs.

# List of the letters for the incorrect statements.
incorrect_options = ['D', 'E']

# The problem asks for the answer to be in alphabetical order.
incorrect_options.sort()

# The problem asks for the output to be comma-separated.
# Each letter of the final answer 'D,E' is handled here.
