    This function determines the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z)
    that have no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A totally bounded group topology on the infinite group Z cannot be the discrete topology.
       In the discrete topology, {0} is an open neighborhood of 0. Total boundedness would require
       that finitely many translates of {0} cover Z, implying Z is finite, which is false.

    2. Any totally bounded group topology on Z is first-countable. This is because the subgroups
       of finite index (nZ for n>=1) form a countable set, which can be used to generate a
       countable neighborhood basis at 0.

    3. A first-countable group topology has no nontrivial convergent sequences if and only if it is
       the discrete topology. If it's not discrete, one can always construct a sequence of non-zero
       elements converging to 0 from a nested neighborhood basis.

    4. From (2) and (3), a topology satisfying the conditions must be the discrete topology.

    5. From (1), the topology cannot be the discrete topology.

    6. This contradiction shows that no such topology exists. The number of such topologies is 0.

    # Based on the logical deduction, the number of such topologies is 0.
    # We can represent the contradiction with the following equation, where N is the number we seek.
    # Let C1 be the condition "totally bounded".
    # Let C2 be the condition "no nontrivial convergent sequences".
    # Let T be a group topology on Z.
    # We found: (T satisfies C1 and C2) implies (T must be discrete AND T cannot be discrete).
    # This is a contradiction, so the set of such topologies is empty.
