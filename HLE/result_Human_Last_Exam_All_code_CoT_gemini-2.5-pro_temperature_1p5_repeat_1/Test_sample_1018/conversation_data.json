    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface.** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, denoted $||\\Sigma_g||$, is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$. This formula applies here since the genera are 31 and 17, both of which are greater than or equal to 2.\n2.  **Use the product formula.** Gromov's product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ is $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{m+n}{m} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$, where $m$ and $n$ are the dimensions of $M$ and $N$, respectively. For surfaces, the dimension is 2.\n3.  **Combine the results.** I will substitute the individual simplicial volumes and the binomial coefficient into the product formula to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the genera and dimensions of the surfaces.\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\ndim1 = 2\ndim2 = 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface using the formula ||S_g|| = 4*(g-1).\nsv_g1 = 4 * (g1 - 1)\nsv_g2 = 4 * (g2 - 1)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient C(dim1+dim2, dim1) for the product formula.\n# C(2+2, 2) = C(4, 2)\nbinomial_coeff = math.comb(dim1 + dim2, dim1)\n\n# Step 4: Apply Gromov's product formula to get the final result.\n# ||S_g1 x S_g2|| = C(4,2) * ||S_g1|| * ||S_g2||\nfinal_volume = binomial_coeff * sv_g1 * sv_g2\n\n# Print the final equation with all the computed values.\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume is calculated using Gromov's product formula:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} \\u00D7 \\u03A3_{g2}|| = C({dim1}+{dim2}, {dim1}) \\u00D7 (4 \\u00D7 ({g1}-1)) \\u00D7 (4 \\u00D7 ({g2}-1))\")\nprint(f\"Result = {binomial_coeff} \\u00D7 {sv_g1} \\u00D7 {sv_g2} = {final_volume}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
