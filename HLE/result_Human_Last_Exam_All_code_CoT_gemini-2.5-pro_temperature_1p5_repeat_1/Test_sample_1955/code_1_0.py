    This script calculates the maximum possible cardinality based on the logical
    deductions from the problem description.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set difference
    max({λ,μ}) \ min({λ,μ}).

    Based on the analysis:
    1. It's provable that μ ≤ λ.
    2. It is consistent with ZFC that μ = λ, which makes the cardinality of the
       set difference 0.
    3. It is also consistent with ZFC that μ < λ, which makes the cardinality of the
       set difference 1.

    This code finds the maximum of these possible outcomes.
