# The variables are defined symbolically based on the problem description.
# C:  Effective average elastic moduli
# Cm: Elasticity tensor of the matrix
# Cf: Elasticity tensor of the fiber
# Vm: Volume fraction of the matrix
# Vf: Volume fraction of the fiber
# A:  Eshelby strain-concentration tensor
# I:  Fourth-order identity tensor

# The script will construct and print the final formula as a string.
# Note: In a real computational context, these variables would be NumPy arrays,
# and the operations would be tensor multiplications and inversions.
# Here, **(-1) is used to denote the tensor inverse.
