    # Step 1: Analyze Meter and Rhyme
    print("\n1. Meter and Rhyme Analysis:")
    print("- Syllable Count: Line 1 has 7 syllables; Line 2 has 6. There is no regular syllable pattern.")
    print("- Rhyme Scheme: 'palaces' and 'road' do not rhyme. This rules out traditional rhyming forms.")
    print("- Stress Pattern: Both lines can be read with three primary stresses ('ALL the STARS are PALaces'; 'the WORLD a HOLlow ROAD'). This is similar to trimeter (a three-beat line) but is not in a strict, repeating foot like iambic.")

    # Step 2: Analyze Style
    print("\n2. Stylistic Analysis:")
    print("- Imagery: The lines use very sharp, direct, and concrete images.")
    print("- Syntax: The language is concise and unconventional (e.g., the use of '&', the implied 'is' in the second line).")
    print("- Conclusion on Style: These features are hallmarks of Modernist poetry, particularly the Imagist movement championed by poets like Ezra Pound.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate Answer Choices
    print("\n3. Evaluating the Choices:")
    print("- A. free verse: Plausible, due to the lack of strict meter and rhyme.")
    print("- B. ballad: Incorrect. Lacks the rhyme and stanza structure of a ballad.")
    print("- C. modernist free verse: The most accurate choice. It captures the 'free verse' nature (no strict rules) while also specifying the distinct style (concise, imagistic) of the Modernist period.")
    print("- D. iambic pentameter: Incorrect. Lines are far too short and do not have 10 syllables.")
    print("- E. trimeter: Partially descriptive due to the three-stress pattern, but 'modernist free verse' is a more complete and precise classification of the overall style.")

    print("\n---Final Determination---")
    print("The form is best described as Modernist Free Verse, which combines a lack of traditional meter with the characteristic imagistic and syntactic style of the Modernist era.")
