    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This technique is designed to capture a three-dimensional 'data cube' (two spatial dimensions, x and y, and one spectral dimension, λ) using a single two-dimensional image from a sensor (like a CCD or CMOS camera).\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n1.  **The Goal:** Reconstruct a full spectral volume `(x, y, λ)` from a single 2D image.\n2.  **The Tool:** Diffraction gratings are used to disperse the light from the scene according to its wavelength. The dispersed light is then captured on the 2D sensor.\n3.  **The Process:** The raw image captured by the sensor contains multiple, overlapping, spectrally-smeared images of the original scene. These are the different diffraction orders created by the grating(s). The central, undispersed image is the \"zero-order,\" and the spectrally-smeared images are the higher orders (+1, -1, etc.).\n4.  **The \"Tomography\" Analogy:** In medical CT, you reconstruct a 3D volume from many 2D X-ray images taken at different angles. In CTIS, the different diffraction orders serve as these different \"projections\" or \"views\" of the data cube.\n5.  **Why One Grating is Insufficient:** A single one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along only one axis. This provides projections along a single line in the frequency domain. This is not enough information to uniquely and robustly solve for the 3D data cube, as different points in the `(x, y, λ)` volume can map to the same point on the 2D sensor. This is analogous to the \"missing cone\" problem in standard tomography.\n6.  **Why Two Gratings are Sufficient:** To solve this problem, we need to spread the information out in two dimensions on the sensor. This can be achieved by using two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly to each other (e.g., one dispersing horizontally, the other vertically). This arrangement, which can be fabricated as a single component called a 2D \"crossed grating,\" creates a 2D array of diffraction orders. These multiple projections provide enough non-redundant information for a tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the original data cube.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of gratings (in terms of providing orthogonal dispersion axes) required is 2.\n\n```python\n# This problem is based on the physics of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n# The goal is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed\n# to reconstruct a 3D data cube (2 spatial + 1 spectral dimension) from a single 2D image.\n\n# Let's analyze the number of gratings. A grating's function is to create\n# spectrally dispersed \"projections\" of the scene onto a sensor.\n\n# Case 1: One diffraction grating\n# A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis.\n# This creates projections along a single line, which is not enough information\n# to uniquely solve for the 3D data cube. The reconstruction problem is ill-posed.\nnum_gratings_insufficient = 1\n\n# Case 2: Two diffraction gratings\n# By using two 1D gratings oriented orthogonally (at 90 degrees to each other),\n# light is dispersed in two dimensions. This creates a 2D array of projections.\n# This provides sufficient, non-redundant information for a tomographic algorithm\n# to reconstruct the full 3D data cube. This is the minimum requirement.\n# Note: These two gratings are often combined into a single optical element called\n# a 2D \"crossed grating,\" but it functions based on two orthogonal dispersion axes.\nminimum_required_gratings = 2\n\n# The reasoning concludes that 1 grating is not enough, and 2 are required.\nprint(f\"Reasoning for the minimum number of diffraction gratings:\")\nprint(f\"Number of gratings if only one dispersion axis is used: {num_gratings_insufficient}.
