# This problem is based on the physics of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).
# The goal is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed
# to reconstruct a 3D data cube (2 spatial + 1 spectral dimension) from a single 2D image.

# Let's analyze the number of gratings. A grating's function is to create
# spectrally dispersed "projections" of the scene onto a sensor.

# Case 1: One diffraction grating
# A single 1D grating disperses light along only one axis.
# This creates projections along a single line, which is not enough information
# to uniquely solve for the 3D data cube. The reconstruction problem is ill-posed.
num_gratings_insufficient = 1

# Case 2: Two diffraction gratings
# By using two 1D gratings oriented orthogonally (at 90 degrees to each other),
# light is dispersed in two dimensions. This creates a 2D array of projections.
# This provides sufficient, non-redundant information for a tomographic algorithm
# to reconstruct the full 3D data cube. This is the minimum requirement.
# Note: These two gratings are often combined into a single optical element called
# a 2D "crossed grating," but it functions based on two orthogonal dispersion axes.
minimum_required_gratings = 2

# The reasoning concludes that 1 grating is not enough, and 2 are required.
