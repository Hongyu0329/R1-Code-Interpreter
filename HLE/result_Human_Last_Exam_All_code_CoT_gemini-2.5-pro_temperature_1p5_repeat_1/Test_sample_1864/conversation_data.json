    "For a multi-color flow cytometry experiment, it is crucial to prepare a comprehensive set of controls to ensure accurate data acquisition and analysis. These controls help set up the cytometer, correct for spectral overlap (compensation), and define positive versus negative populations (gating).\n\nHere is my plan to calculate the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. We need one sample of just the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels to measure their intrinsic autofluorescence.\n2.  **Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral spillover from one channel into another, a single-stained control is required for every fluorochrome in the panel. Since you have five channels with five different fluorochromes, you will need five of these controls.\n3.  **Gating Controls (Fluorescence Minus One - FMO):** For accurately setting gates, especially when trying to identify dim populations or for critical applications like cell sorting, FMO controls are essential. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This helps visualize the spread of all other colors into the empty channel. You will need one FMO control for each of the five fluorochromes.\n\nI will write a Python script to sum these controls and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorochromes/channels in the experiment\n    num_fluorochromes = 5\n    \n    # 1.
