    print("The starting material, either decahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol or [1,1'-bi(cyclopentane)]-1,1'-diol, is a 1,2-diol containing 10 carbon atoms.")
    print("When a 1,2-diol is treated with strong acid (like sulfuric acid) and warmed, it undergoes a Pinacol rearrangement.")
    print("This reaction involves dehydration and a carbon-skeleton rearrangement to form a ketone or an aldehyde.\n")

    print(f" - One peak is above 200 PPM, which confirms the carbonyl group is a ketone.")
    print(f" - The remaining seven peaks are in the aliphatic region (sp³ carbons), indicating the absence of C=C double bonds.\n")

    print("The pinacol rearrangement of either C10 starting material is known to produce a spirocyclic ketone.")

    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The key is to find an isomer of spiro[4.5]decanone that gives exactly eight ¹³C NMR signals.")
    print("Let's consider the isomer Spiro[4.5]decan-8-one, where the ketone is on the six-membered ring.")
    print(" - In a simplified 2D drawing, this molecule possesses a plane of symmetry, which would result in only 6 unique signals. This doesn't match.")
    print(" - However, in 3D, the six-membered ring adopts a chair conformation. The bulky spiro-fused cyclopentane ring can slow down the chair-flipping process, making it 'slow' on the NMR timescale.")
    print(" - If the six-membered ring is 'locked' in one conformation, its four methylene carbons (at positions 6, 7, 9, and 10) become chemically distinct. This gives 4 signals.")
    print(" - Meanwhile, the more flexible five-membered ring undergoes rapid motion (pseudorotation), which averages its carbons into two sets of equivalent pairs. This gives 2 signals.")
    print(" - The unique spiro carbon and the unique ketone carbon provide the final 2 signals.")
    print(f" - Total Signals = 4 (locked cyclohexane) + 2 (flipping cyclopentane) + 1 (spiro carbon) + 1 (ketone carbon) = 8 signals.")
