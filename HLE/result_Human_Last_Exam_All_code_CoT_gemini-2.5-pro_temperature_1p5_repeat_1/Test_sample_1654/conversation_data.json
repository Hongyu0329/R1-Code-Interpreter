    "Based on a literary analysis of Anton Chekov's \"The Chameleon,\" the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is described or used to symbolize a shift in his mentality can be determined by counting the specific scenes where this occurs.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I have analyzed the text of the story to identify every distinct moment where the coat is either described or its state is changed (e.g., taken off, put on). These moments are key symbolic actions.\n2.  I will list these distinct occurrences.\n3.  I will then write a Python script that assigns a count of 1 to each identified occurrence.\n4.  The script will sum these counts and print the final equation and result, showing how the total is derived.\n\n```python\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times Chekov described or used\n    Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his shifting mentality in \"The Chameleon\".\n    The count is based on a literary analysis of the key scenes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Each variable represents a distinct moment in the story where the coat is a key symbol.\n    \n    # 1. The initial description of Otchumyelov wearing his new overcoat.\n    initial_description = 1\n    \n    # 2. He takes his coat off when he thinks the dog is a stray.\n    # \"H'm! Take off my coat, Yeldyrin...\"\n    first_removal = 1\n    \n    # 3. He puts his coat back on upon hearing the dog might belong to the General.\n    # \"H'm! Put my coat on, Yeldyrin, my lad...\"\n    first_donning = 1\n    \n    # 4. He takes his coat off again when told the dog is not the General's.\n    # \"H'm! Take my coat off, Yeldyrin....\"\n    second_removal = 1\n    \n    # 5. He wraps himself in his coat at the end of the story, concluding his \"performance\".\n    # \"...wrapping himself in his greatcoat, goes on his way...\"\n    final_wrapping = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of symbolic descriptions/actions.\n    total = initial_description + first_removal + first_donning + second_removal + final_wrapping\n    \n    print(\"Based on a reading of the story, there are five key moments where the coat's state is described to reflect Otchumyelov's attitude.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation, counting each of these moments, is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation showing each component.\n    print(f\"{initial_description} + {first_removal} + {first_donning} + {second_removal} + {final_wrapping} = {total}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result.\ncount_coat_descriptions()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
