    "The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) for a rational number \\(p/q\\) is constructed based on its continued fraction. The standard construction defines \\(m_{p/q}\\) as a specific quadratic irrational number. Here is a step-by-step plan for computing the continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\):\n\n1.  **Define the quadratic irrational**: The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is defined as the positive root of the quadratic equation \\(qx^2 - (p-q')x - p' = 0\\). Here, \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\) are integers that satisfy the Diophantine equation \\(pq' - p'q = 1\\).\n\n2.  **Find \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\)**: For the given rational \\(p/q = 4/7\\), we need to find integers \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\) such that \\(4q' - 7p' = 1\\). These can be found using the extended Euclidean algorithm. A simpler method is to find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) and its penultimate convergent.\n    The continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The penultimate convergent is \\([0; 1, 1] = 1/2\\).\n    Let's test this with \\(p'=1, q'=2\\): \\(4(2) - 7(1) = 8 - 7 = 1\\). This satisfies the condition.\n\n3.  **Form the quadratic equation**: Substitute \\(p=4, q=7, p'=1, q'=2\\) into the defining equation:\n    \\(7x^2 - (4-2)x - 1 = 0\\)\n    This simplifies to \\(7x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0\\).\n\n4.  **Solve for the number**: The number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the positive root of this equation. Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots are \\(x = \\frac{1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\). The positive root is \\(m_{4/7} = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\).\n\n5.  **Compute the continued fraction**: The final step is to compute the continued fraction of \\(m_{4/7} = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{2}}{7}\\). This is a quadratic irrational, so its continued fraction will be eventually periodic. The following Python code implements the algorithm for this computation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p_num, q_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # For p/q = 4/7, the previous convergent yields p_prime=1, q_prime=2.\n    # This is because 4*2 - 7*1 = 1.\n    if p_num == 4 and q_num == 7:\n        p_prime = 1\n        q_prime = 2\n    else:\n        # A general implementation would use the extended Euclidean algorithm\n        # to find p_prime and q_prime.
