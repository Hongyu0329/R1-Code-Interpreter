    # Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors?
    # - Line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a defined type in XVM. It should be `unsigned long`.
    # - Line 4: `scanf("%d %d %d", ...)` uses `%d` (for `digit`) instead of `%n` (for `unsigned long`).
    # - Line 8: `printf("%d", ...)` uses `%d` (for `digit`) instead of `%n` for the large result.
    # Therefore, there are 3 lines with compiler errors.
    answer1 = 3

    # Question 2: What is the total memory (in D) used for variables in an optimized version?
    # The optimized version uses ceiling division `(x + a - 1) / a` to avoid branching.
    # To minimize memory, we only need three variables to store the inputs n, m, and a.
    # `n` and `m` must be `unsigned long` (12D each) to hold values up to 4*10^9.
    # `a` must also be `unsigned long` (12D) to be used in arithmetic with n and m and for `scanf`.
    # Total memory = 3 variables * 12D/variable = 36D.
    answer2 = 36

    # Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
    # Yes, by using integer arithmetic for ceiling division: `(numerator + denominator - 1) // denominator`.
    answer3 = "Y"

    # Question 4: What is the expected output for n = m = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
    n = 4 * 10**9
    m = 4 * 10**9
    a = 1
    # Number of flagstones for n: ceiling(n/a)
    na = (n + a - 1) // a
    # Number of flagstones for m: ceiling(m/a)
    ma = (m + a - 1) // a
    # Total flagstones = na * ma
    total_flagstones = na * ma
    answer4 = str(total_flagstones)

    # The prompt requests the answer in the format x:y:z where x, y, t, and z are the answers.
    # Assuming the typo means the format is x:y:z:t for the four questions in order.
