    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Knots**: First, we identify all knots (and their mirror images) with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). The unknot and figure-eight knot are amphichiral (identical to their mirror images), but the trefoil knot is not, so we must consider both the right-handed (3_1) and left-handed (3_1*) trefoils.\n\n2.  **Identify Relevant Surgeries**: For a Dehn surgery on a knot to produce a homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose first homology group is trivial), the surgery coefficient must be either +1 or -1. Therefore, for each knot, we will consider both +1 and -1 surgeries.\n\n3.  **Identify Resulting Manifolds**: We use established results from knot theory to identify the 3-manifolds created by these surgeries.\n    *   Surgery on the **unknot (0_1)** with coefficients ±1 both result in the standard 3-sphere, `S^3`, which represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   Surgery on the **right-handed trefoil (3_1)** yields two different manifolds: +1 surgery gives the Brieskorn sphere `Σ(2,3,7)`, while -1 surgery gives the Poincaré homology sphere `Σ(2,3,5)`.\n    *   Surgery on the **left-handed trefoil (3_1*)** yields the orientation-reversed versions of the surgeries on the right-handed trefoil. Specifically, +1 surgery gives `-Σ(2,3,5)` and -1 surgery gives `-Σ(2,3,7)`.\n    *   Surgery on the **figure-eight knot (4_1)** with coefficient +1 gives the Poincaré homology sphere `Σ(2,3,5)`. Since the figure-eight knot is amphichiral, -1 surgery results in the oppositely oriented manifold, `-Σ(2,3,5)`.\n\n4.  **Count Distinct Classes**: We collect all the resulting manifolds and determine how many distinct elements they represent in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   `[S^3]` is the trivial element (the identity).\n    *   The Poincaré sphere `Σ(2,3,5)` is known to have order 2 in the group, meaning `[Σ(2,3,5)] = [-Σ(2,3,5)]`. This class is non-trivial.\n    *   The Brieskorn sphere `Σ(2,3,7)` is known to have infinite order in the group. This means `[Σ(2,3,7)]` and its inverse `[-Σ(2,3,7)]` are distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\nBy tallying these up, we find four distinct elements:\n1.  The trivial element, `[S^3]`.\n2.  The Poincaré sphere class, `[Σ(2,3,5)]`.\n3.  The class `[Σ(2,3,7)]`.\n4.  The inverse class `[-Σ(2,3,7)]`.\n\nThe following Python script systematically lists these knots and surgeries and calculates the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements from surgery\n    on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define knots with at most 4 crossings.\n    # Note: 3_1* is the mirror of 3_1. 0_1 and 4_1 are amphichiral.\n    knots = {\n        '0_1': 'Unknot',\n        '3_1': 'Right-handed Trefoil',\n        '3_1*': 'Left-handed Trefoil',\n        '4_1': 'Figure-eight Knot'\n    }\n    print(\"This program calculates the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group\")\n    print(\"represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Identify resulting manifolds from +/-1 surgery.\n    # Let E = S^3 (trivial element)\n    # Let P = Poincaré homology sphere class, [Σ(2,3,5)]\n    # Let T = [Σ(2,3,7)]\n    # Let -T = [-Σ(2,3,7)]\n    surgery_map = {\n        ('0_1', 1): ('S^3', 'Trivial element'),\n        ('0_1', -1): ('S^3', 'Trivial element'),\n        ('3_1', 1): ('Σ(2,3,7)', 'Σ(2,3,7) class'),\n        ('3_1', -1): ('Σ(2,3,5)', 'Poincaré sphere class'),\n        ('3_1*', 1): ('-Σ(2,3,5)', 'Poincaré sphere class'), # Class has order 2\n        ('3_1*', -1): ('-Σ(2,3,7)', 'Inverse of Σ(2,3,7) class'),\n        ('4_1', 1): ('Σ(2,3,5)', 'Poincaré sphere class'),\n        ('4_1', -1): ('-Σ(2,3,5)', 'Poincaré sphere class'), # Class has order 2\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Surgeries and Resulting Manifolds ---\")\n    distinct_classes = set()\n    for (knot, coeff), (manifold, class_desc) in surgery_map.items():\n        print(f\"Surgery on {knots[knot]:<22} with coefficient {coeff:>2} -> {manifold:<8} (represents: {class_desc})\")\n        distinct_classes.add(class_desc)\n\n    # Step 4: Count the distinct classes.\n    print(\"\\n--- Counting Distinct Classes ---\")\n    print(\"The distinct classes obtained are:\")\n    class_list = sorted(list(distinct_classes))\n    for i, class_name in enumerate(class_list):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {class_name}\")\n\n    count = len(distinct_classes)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    contributions = {\n        \"Trivial element\": \"Unknot\",\n        \"Poincaré sphere class\": \"Trefoil and Figure-eight knots\",\n        \"Σ(2,3,7) class\": \"Right-handed Trefoil\",\n        \"Inverse of Σ(2,3,7) class\": \"Left-handed Trefoil\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The final count is the sum of these unique classes:\")\n    sum_str = \" + \".join([\"1\" for _ in class_list])\n    print(f\"Total = {sum_str} = {count}\")\n    print(\"\\nIn summary:\")\n    for class_name, source in contributions.items():\n        if class_name in class_list:\n            print(f\"- 1 element from {source} ({class_name})\")\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
