    This function explains and presents the theoretical result for the problem.
    The problem asks for an asymptotic ratio of counts of points on an algebraic curve,
    which is a topic in arithmetic geometry. The result is derived from deep theorems
    rather than a direct computation.

    # The problem concerns the statistical distribution of fibers of a map f: C -> P^r
    # associated with the g^r_d. The Galois group of the cover is G.

    # According to the Chebotarev density theorem for function fields, the fibers
    # with specific Galois properties are distributed according to the structure of G.

    # The numerator of the ratio counts a special subset of points.
    # In this context, this corresponds to fibers whose associated Frobenius element
    # is in the conjugacy class of the identity. The size of this class is 1.
    # The relative density of this subset is 1 / |G|.
    numerator = 1

    # The denominator counts all generic (irreducible) points arising from the g^r_d.
    # By Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem, this set has a density of 1.
    # Therefore, the overall ratio of the counts approaches (1/|G|) / 1 = 1/|G|.

    # The final answer is the fraction 1 / |G|.
    # We represent the order of the group G symbolically.
    G_order_symbol = "|G|"

    # The problem asks to output each number/symbol in the final equation.
