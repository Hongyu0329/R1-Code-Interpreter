    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question from the field of continuum theory in topology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the object of study:** The question asks for the number of a specific kind of subset (composants) of a specific topological space (the Stone-Cech remainder). Let's call the remainder `R`.\n2.  **Characterize the remainder `R`:** The first step is to determine the topological properties of `R = Î²(X \\ {x}) \\ (X \\ {x})`. There is a deep theorem in continuum theory that precisely describes this remainder. Specifically, a result by J. Krasinkiewicz and P. Minc (1979) states that if `X` is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, then its Stone-Cech remainder `R` is also a hereditary indecomposable continuum.\n3.  **Count the composants of `R`:** Now that we know `R` is itself a (hereditary) indecomposable continuum, the problem reduces to a standard question in continuum theory: \"How many composants does an indecomposable continuum have?\".\n4.  **State the theorem for composants:** A fundamental theorem states that any non-degenerate indecomposable continuum is the union of its composants, and that it has uncountably many of them. More precisely, the number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum. Each composant is a dense, connected, F-sigma subset, and they are all disjoint.\n5.  **Formulate the code:** The code will not compute a number, as the answer is a transfinite cardinal number (`c`). Instead, the Python script will print out the logical steps of this deduction, leading to the final conclusion, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the maximum number of composants\n    in the Stone-Cech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable continuum\n    with one point removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the spaces involved\n    print(\"Let X be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and x be a point in X.\")\n    print(\"Let Y = X \\\\ {x}.
