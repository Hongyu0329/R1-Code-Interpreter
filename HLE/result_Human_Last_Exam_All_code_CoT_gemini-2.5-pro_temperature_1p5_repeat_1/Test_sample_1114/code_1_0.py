    # 1. Define the properties of the target object.
    # It is a pseudo-tensor, meaning its transformation rule includes a sign change
    # for improper rotations. This property can be introduced by using the
    # Levi-Civita symbol (ε_ijk), which is a rank-3 pseudo-tensor.
    target_rank = 7
    epsilon_rank = 3

    # 2. Determine the rank of the additional tensor needed.
    # To get a rank-7 pseudo-tensor, we can combine the rank-3 Levi-Civita
    # pseudo-tensor with a regular tensor of a specific rank.
    # The ranks add up in a tensor product.
    # rank(pseudo-tensor) + rank(tensor) = rank(resulting pseudo-tensor)
    # 3 + X = 7  =>  X = 4
    required_tensor_rank = target_rank - epsilon_rank

    # 3. Determine how to construct the additional tensor from particle positions.
    # A regular tensor of rank k can be constructed by the tensor product of k vectors.
    # So, we need to construct a rank-4 tensor, which requires 4 vectors.
    # Let these vectors be V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4.
    num_vectors_needed = required_tensor_rank

    # 4. Determine the minimum number of particles (N) to supply these vectors.
    # The vectors V_i are functions of the particle positions (R_1, R_2, ... R_N).
    # The simplest choice for these vectors is the position vectors themselves.
    # Crucially, the vectors V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4 do not need to be distinct from each other.
    # We can therefore choose all four vectors to be the position of the very first particle.
    # V_1 = R_1
    # V_2 = R_1
    # V_3 = R_1
    # V_4 = R_1
    # This construction only requires the existence of one particle, R_1.
    # Therefore, the minimum value for N is 1.
    min_N = 1
