    "To find the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows for coloring the figure eight knot, we need to determine the smallest integer 'n' for which the knot is n-colorable. This value is derived from the knot's determinant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define Knot Coloring**: Explain the rules of Fox n-coloring, where colors are assigned to arcs from a set of 'n' integers {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The rule at each crossing is `2c = a + b (mod n)`, where 'c' is the color of the over-arc and 'a' and 'b' are the colors of the under-arcs.\n2.  **Model the Figure Eight Knot**: Represent the coloring rules for the four crossings of the figure eight knot as a system of linear equations.\n3.  **Use the Coloring Matrix**: Convert this system of equations into a matrix, known as the coloring matrix.\n4.  **Calculate the Knot Determinant**: A knot is n-colorable if and only if 'n' shares a common factor (greater than 1) with the knot determinant. The knot determinant is the absolute value of the determinant of any (k-1)x(k-1) submatrix of the kxk coloring matrix.\n5.  **Find the Smallest 'n'**: The smallest prime factor of the knot determinant gives the smallest integer 'n' for which the knot is colorable. This 'n' is the size of the smallest set of colors, which represents the number of elements in the algebraic structure.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure \n    that allows coloring the figure eight knot.
