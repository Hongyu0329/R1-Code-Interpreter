    "Of course. The number of primitive Gaussians in a basis set depends on the atoms in the molecule. I will explain the calculation by breaking down the `6-311G**` basis set notation and then apply it to a common molecule, methane (CH4), to arrive at a total count.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-311G**):** I'll explain what each part of the name signifies in terms of primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   `6-`: Describes the core electrons.\n    *   `-311`: Describes the valence electrons.\n    *   `**`: Describes the polarization functions added to the atoms.\n2.  **Calculate Primitives per Atom:** I will calculate the number of primitives for a \"heavy atom\" (Carbon) and for a Hydrogen atom based on the notation.\n3.  **Calculate Total for a Molecule:** I'll use the per-atom counts to find the total number of primitives for methane (CH4), a molecule containing both atom types.\n4.  **Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that performs and prints this entire calculation, showing how the final number is derived.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation for Methane (CH4)\n\n*   **Carbon (a heavy atom):**\n    *   **Core (1s electrons):** The `6-` means the single core s-orbital is represented by a contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p electrons):** The `-311` means the valence shell is split into three parts.\n        *   For the 2s orbital: One s-function from 3 primitives, one from 1 primitive, and one from 1 primitive. Total: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitives.\n        *   For the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz): This is applied to each orbital. Total: 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 * 5 = **15** primitives.\n    *   **Polarization (first `*`):** A set of `d`-functions is added. Standard sets use 6 Cartesian d-functions. Total: **6** primitives.\n    *   **Total for Carbon:** 6 (core) + 5 (valence s) + 15 (valence p) + 6 (polarization) = 32 primitives.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:**\n    *   **Core:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n    *   **Valence (1s electron):** The `-311` is applied to the 1s orbital. Total: 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** primitives.\n    *   **Polarization (second `*`):** A set of `p`-functions (px, py, pz) is added. Total: **3** primitives.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen:** 5 (valence s) + 3 (polarization) = 8 primitives.\n\n*   **Total for Methane (CH4):**\n    *   The molecule has 1 Carbon atom and 4 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total = (1 * Primitives for Carbon) + (4 * Primitives for Hydrogen)\n    *   Total = (1 * 32) + (4 * 8) = 32 + 32 = 64 primitives.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for a methane (CH4) molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Calculation for a Heavy Atom (Carbon) ---\n    c_core = 6\n    c_valence_s = 3 + 1 + 1\n    c_valence_p = 3 * (3 + 1 + 1)\n    c_polarization_d = 6\n    total_c = c_core + c_valence_s + c_valence_p + c_polarization_d\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculation for Carbon (C) in 6-311G** ---\")\n    print(f\"Core 1s primitives ('6-'): {c_core}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2s primitives ('-311'): 3 + 1 + 1 = {c_valence_s}\")\n    print(f\"Valence 2p primitives ('-311'): 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = {c_valence_p}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization d-functions ('*'): {c_polarization_d}\")\n    print(f\"Total for Carbon = {c_core} + {c_valence_s} + {c_valence_p} + {c_polarization_d} = {total_c}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Calculation for a Hydrogen Atom ---\n    h_valence_s = 3 + 1 + 1\n    h_polarization_p = 3\n    total_h = h_valence_s + h_polarization_p\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculation for Hydrogen (H) in 6-311G** ---\")\n    print(f\"Valence 1s primitives ('-311'): 3 + 1 + 1 = {h_valence_s}\")\n    print(f\"Polarization p-functions ('**'): {h_polarization_p}\")\n    print(f\"Total for Hydrogen = {h_valence_s} + {h_polarization_p} = {total_h}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # --- Total Calculation for Methane (CH4) ---\n    num_c = 1\n    num_h = 4\n    total_ch4 = (num_c * total_c) + (num_h * total_h)\n\n    print(\"--- Total for Methane (CH4) ---\")\n    print(f\"Equation: ({num_c} * Primitives_C) + ({num_h} * Primitives_H)\")\n    print(f\"Total primitives = ({num_c} * {total_c}) + ({num_h} * {total_h}) = {total_ch4}\")\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_6_311G_star_star_primitives()\n\n# The final answer for a CH4 molecule is 64.\n```\n<<<64>>>"
