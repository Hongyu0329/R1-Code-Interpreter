            "magnetic field before it can reach the inner ferromagnetic core. The entire "
            "structure acts as a magnetic shield, similar to scenario 2, leading to a "

            "dipole's field and will guide the flux just like in scenario 1. It will "
            "concentrate and channel the field to the far end. The inner superconducting "
            "core is shielded by the ferromagnet and has little effect on the outcome. "
