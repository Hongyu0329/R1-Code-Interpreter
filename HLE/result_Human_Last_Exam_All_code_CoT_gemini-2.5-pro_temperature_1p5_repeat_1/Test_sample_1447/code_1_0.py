# The problem asks for the solution to be expressed as a series of Roman numerals
# in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
# The valid options we identified are I, II, and VI.

# Define the individual valid options
option_1 = "I"
option_2 = "II"
option_6 = "VI"

# Create a list of the options, already in ascending order
# I corresponds to 1, II to 2, VI to 6. So the order is correct.
final_options = [option_1, option_2, option_6]

# Join the elements of the list with a hyphen
final_answer = "-".join(final_options)

# Print the final result in the required format
print(final_answer)

# The final equation requested by the prompt is the string concatenation of the identified roman numerals
print("The final answer is constructed from the numerals:", option_1, option_2, option_6)
<<<I-II-VI>>>
