    "An equilibrium of the system is a state $(\\bar{X}_1, \\dots, \\bar{X}_N)$ where $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all $i$. An equilibrium state is defined by the set of species that have positive abundance (coexisting species), while the rest are extinct (zero abundance). Let's denote the set of coexisting species as $C$. For any given set of parameters, there is at most one equilibrium state for each possible set $C$. Therefore, the total number of equilibria is limited by the number of possible subsets of species, which is $2^N$.\n\nThe question is to find the maximum number of equilibria the system can have by varying its parameters. We can demonstrate that it's possible to find a set of parameters for which there are exactly $2^N$ equilibria.\n\nConsider the special case where the parameters $A_i$ are all equal for all species, for example, let $A_i = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The term $(A_i - A_j)$ in the equation becomes $(1 - 1) = 0$. In this case, the complex interaction term vanishes completely:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_i R_j X_i X_j = 0\n$$\n\nThe system of equations then simplifies to $N$ independent logistic growth equations:\n$$\n\\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i (1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i})\n$$\n\nFor each species $i$, this equation has two possible equilibrium solutions:\n1. $\\bar{X}_i = 0$ (extinction)\n2. $1 - \\frac{\\bar{X}_i}{K_i} = 0 \\implies \\bar{X}_i = K_i$ (coexistence at its carrying capacity)\n\nSince the equations for all species are decoupled, any combination of these individual equilibria forms a valid equilibrium for the whole N-species system. We can construct an equilibrium point by choosing for each species whether its abundance is 0 or $K_i$. As there are $N$ species and 2 choices for each, the total number of possible equilibrium states is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($N$ times), which is $2^N$.\n\nEach of these $2^N$ states corresponds to a unique subset of coexisting species, and we have shown that a valid set of parameters ($A_i=1, R_i \\ge 1, K_i \\ge 1, \\Gamma \\ge 1$) exists for which all $2^N$ equilibria are realized. Since the number of equilibria cannot exceed the number of subsets, $2^N$ is the maximum possible number.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this number for a given $N$. Let's use an example, N=10.\n\n```python\n# The user can change this value to the number of species they are interested in.\nN = 10\n\n# In the special case where all A_i are equal, the system has 2^N equilibria.\n# This represents the maximum possible number of equilibria as parameters vary.\nnum_equilibria = 2**N\n\n# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n# The equation is: Number of Equilibria = 2^N\nbase = 2\nexponent = N\nprint(f\"For a system with N = {N} species:\")\nprint(f\"The maximum number of equilibria is given by the equation: {base}^{exponent} = {num_equilibria}\")\n\n```\n<<<2**N>>>"
