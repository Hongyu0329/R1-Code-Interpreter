    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a calculation with very high precision. The number 10^100, known as a googol, is far too large for standard floating-point data types to handle accurately.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the `mpmath` library in Python, which is specifically designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n2.  The tangent function has a period of π. Therefore, `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The core of the problem is to find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π` with extremely high precision. A tiny error in the value of `π` would be multiplied by the large quotient (`~10^99`), leading to a completely wrong result for the remainder.\n3.  The `mpmath.tan()` function has a robust, built-in algorithm for argument reduction that handles large numbers correctly, avoiding the precision pitfalls of a naive manual calculation.\n4.  I will set the precision of `mpmath` to a value significantly greater than 100 digits to ensure the result is accurate.\n5.  Once `tan(10^100)` is calculated, I will convert the result to a string to extract the first three digits following the decimal point.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_tan_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for the calculation. 10^100 has 101 digits,\n    # so we need more decimal places of precision for pi and the calculation.\n    # 110 is a safe value.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n    # Define the number x = 10^100 using mpmath's high-precision float type.\n    x = mpmath.power(10, 100)\n\n    # Calculate tan(10^100). mpmath handles the large argument reduction correctly.\n    result = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n    # For the output, convert the result to a string.\n    result_str = mpmath.nstr(result, 15)\n    \n    # As requested, output the equation with the calculated number.\n    print(f\"The value of tan(10^100) is: {result}\")\n\n    # To find the digits, we isolate the fractional part of the number string.\n    if '.' in result_str:\n        integer_part, fractional_part = result_str.split('.')\n        # Ensure we have at least 3 digits by padding with zeros if necessary.\n        first_three_digits = (fractional_part + \"000\")[:3]\n    else:\n        # This case is for an integer result, where the digits would be '000'.\n        first_three_digits = \"000\"\n\n    print(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tan_digits()\n```\n<<<543>>>"
