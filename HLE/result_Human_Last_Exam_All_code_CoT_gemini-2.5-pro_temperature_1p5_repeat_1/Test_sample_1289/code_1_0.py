    # Step 1: Define the ascending intervals based on Maqam Zanjaran.
    # Maqam Zanjaran is defined here as Jins Zanjaran on C + Jins Hijaz on F.
    # Jins Zanjaran (C to F): Intervals are 1 (C-D), 0.5 (D-Eb), 1 (Eb-F).
    # Jins Hijaz (F to Bb): Intervals are 0.5 (F-Gb), 1.5 (Gb-A), 0.5 (A-Bb).
    # The final interval is from Bb to the octave C', which is a whole tone (1).
    ascending_intervals = [1, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 1]

    # Step 2: Define the descending intervals.
    # The descent uses Jins Nahawand on the 4th degree (F), from the octave (C') to the 4th (F).
    # The notes involved are C', Bb, Ab, G, F.
    # The intervals of Jins Nahawand on F are: F-G (1), G-Ab (0.5), Ab-Bb (1).
    # Interval from octave C' down to Bb is a whole tone (1).
    # Interval from Bb down to Ab is a whole tone (1).
    # Interval from Ab down to G is a semitone (0.5).
    # Interval from G down to F is a whole tone (1).
