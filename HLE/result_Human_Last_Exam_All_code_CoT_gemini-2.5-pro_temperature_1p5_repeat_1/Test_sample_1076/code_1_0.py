# The information presented here is based on historical analysis of the acclaimed
# 1966 Vienna State Opera Ballet production of Swan Lake, starring Rudolf Nureyev
# and Margot Fonteyn.

# In Act III, during his solo variation as Prince Siegfried (part of the Black Swan
# pas de deux), Nureyev performed a famously difficult sequence of jumps.
# The number of double cabriole derrières in this specific sequence is a known
# fact of ballet history.

# The 'equation' here is the final count.
