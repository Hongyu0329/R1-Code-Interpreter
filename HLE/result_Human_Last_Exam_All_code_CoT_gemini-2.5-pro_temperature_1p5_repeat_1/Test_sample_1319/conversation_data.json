    "I will identify the historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, apart from Mount Olympus, and find their respective elevations. Then, I will write a Python script to compare these elevations and determine the tallest among them.\n\n1.  **Mount Ida (Crete):** A significant mountain in Greek mythology, located on the island of Crete. Its highest peak is Timios Stavros on the Psiloritis massif, at 2,456 meters.\n2.  **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in the Iliad. It is a mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. Its highest point is 2,033 meters.\n3.  **Mount Ossa:** Mentioned in relation to the myth of the giants. It is located in Thessaly, Greece. Its highest peak is 1,978 meters.\n4.  **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Also known as Phrygian Ida, this is where Zeus often sat to watch the Trojan War. It is located in modern-day Turkey, near the ruins of Troy. Its highest peak is 1,774 meters.\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** Home of the Centaurs and the source of Achilles' spear. It is located in Thessaly, Greece. Its highest peak is 1,624 meters.\n6.  **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon is said to have watched the war from its peak, Fengari. The peak's elevation is 1,611 meters.\n\nThe following Python script will process this data to find the tallest of these mountains.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    The data is pre-researched and stored in a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Crete)\": 2456,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # Find the mountain with the maximum elevation\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    max_elevation = 0\n    for name, elevation in mountains.items():\n        if elevation > max_elevation:\n            max_elevation = elevation\n            tallest_mountain_name = name\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of historical mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus):\")\n    # Print each mountain and its elevation\n    # The 'equation' here is the comparison of all listed numbers to find the maximum.\n    for name, elevation in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {elevation} meters\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAfter comparing the values:\")\n    print(f\"2456 (Mount Ida, Crete) > 2033 (Mount Athos) > 1978 (Mount Ossa) > 1774 (Mount Ida, Turkey) > 1624 (Mount Pelion) > 1611 (Mount Samothrace)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe tallest mountain is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {max_elevation} meters.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Ida (Crete)>>>"
