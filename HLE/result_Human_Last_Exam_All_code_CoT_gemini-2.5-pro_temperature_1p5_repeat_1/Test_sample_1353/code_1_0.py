    Solves a three-part problem about diagonal harmonic polynomials and sl(2) strings.

    # Part a: Determine the bi-degree of the terminal polynomial.
    #
    # An sl(2) string starts with a polynomial P (lowest weight vector) and ends
    # with a polynomial E^k P (highest weight vector).
    # The operator E changes bi-degree (i, j) to (i-1, j+1).
    # The operator F changes bi-degree (i, j) to (i+1, j-1).
    # For a finite string starting at bi-degree (a, b) where FP=0,
    # the theory of sl(2) representations shows the string is symmetric.
    # The highest weight vector (terminal polynomial) has the degrees swapped.
    # This is because the length of the string k is determined by k = a - b,
    # and the terminal bi-degree is (a-k, b+k) = (a-(a-b), b+(a-b)) = (b, a).
    #
    # Given the starting bi-degree (a, b) = (4, 3):
    start_a = 4
    start_b = 3
    terminal_a = start_b
    terminal_b = start_a
    answer_a = f"({terminal_a}, {terminal_b})"

    # Part b: Provide the condition for a polynomial to be a valid string starter.
    #
    # The problem states a string starter of bi-degree (a, b) is constructed
    # using b indices: r_1, r_2, ..., r_b.
    # The number of indices matches the y-degree 'b'. A natural and simple
    # condition connecting these indices to the bi-degree is that their sum
    # equals the x-degree 'a'. This implies r_i are positive integers.
    # This condition, a = sum(r_i), also ensures that a >= b, which is required
    # for a non-trivial string starter.
    #
    answer_b = "a = sum_{i=1 to b} r_i"

    # Part c: Check if a polynomial of bi-degree (5, 2) can be constructed
    # using operators with r=1, 2.
    #
    # The bi-degree is (a, b) = (5, 2).
    # From our condition in part b, we have b=2 indices (r_1, r_2), and they must sum to a=5.
    # So, r_1 + r_2 = 5.
    # The problem states the construction is limited to using r = 1, 2.
    # We interpret this to mean that the indices r_1 and r_2 must be chosen from the set {1, 2}.
    # We check if there are any two numbers in {1, 2} that sum to 5.
    # Possible sums:
    # 1 + 1 = 2
    # 1 + 2 = 3
    # 2 + 2 = 4
    # The maximum possible sum is 4. It is impossible to get a sum of 5.
    #
    answer_c = "No"
