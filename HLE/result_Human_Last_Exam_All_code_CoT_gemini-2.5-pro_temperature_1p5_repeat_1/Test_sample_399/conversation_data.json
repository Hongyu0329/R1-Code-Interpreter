    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the initial value problem, followed by the Python code to execute the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Separate Variables:** The given differential equation $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a separable equation. I will move all terms involving $x$ to the left side and all terms involving $t$ to the right side, which gives $\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt$.\n2.  **Integrate:** I will integrate both sides of the separated equation. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ with respect to $x$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, and the integral of $(t-1)$ with respect to $t$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$. This results in the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n3.  **Find the Constant of Integration (C):** I will use the initial condition $x(0)=-8$ to find the value of $C$. By substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution, I can solve for $C$.\n4.  **Find the Particular Solution:** With the value of $C$ found, I will write down the particular solution for $x(t)$.\n5.  **Calculate x(1):** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the steps, showing the final equation with all numerical values substituted as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variable and function\nt = sympy.Symbol('t')\nx = sympy.Function('x')\n\n# Define the differential equation\n# x'(t) = (t-1)*x(t)**2\n# This can be written as Eq(x(t).diff(t), (t-1)*x(t)**2)\n# However, for this problem, we will solve it step-by-step arithmetically\n# as the steps are more important for the user to understand.\n\n# Initial conditions\nt0 = 0\nx0 = -8\n\n# Step 1: General solution form from integration\n# -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the constant C using initial conditions\n# -1/x0 = t0^2/2 - t0 + C\n# C = -1/x0 - (t0^2/2 - t0)\nC = -1/x0 - (t0**2 / 2 - t0)\n\n# Step 3: Find x(1)\n# The particular solution is -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n# So, x(t) = -1 / (t^2/2 - t + C)\n# We need to find x(1)\nt_target = 1\ndenominator_part1 = t_target**2 / 2\ndenominator_part2 = -t_target\ndenominator = denominator_part1 + denominator_part2 + C\nresult = -1 / denominator\n\n# Print the process and the final answer\nprint(\"Solving the initial value problem: x'(t) = (t-1)*x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\")\nprint(\"The general solution after integration is: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing the initial condition x(0) = -8 to find C:\")\nprint(f\"-1/({x0}) = ({t0}^2)/2 - {t0} + C\")\nprint(f\"C = {-1/x0}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe particular solution is: x(t) = -1 / (t^2/2 - t + {C})\")\nprint(\"\\nNow, we find x(1) by substituting t=1:\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = -1 / (({t_target}^2)/2 - {t_target} + {C})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {-1} / ({denominator_part1} - {t_target} + {C})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {-1} / ({denominator})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe value of x(1) is: {result}\")\n<<<2.6666666666666665>>>\n```"
