    "My plan is to solve this problem by first identifying the specific 4-polytope that meets the user's criteria.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** The polytope is a 4-dimensional object (a 4-polytope) that is non-simplicial, has 6 vertices (f₀=6), and the maximal number of 2-faces (f₂) possible for such a polytope.\n2.  **Consult Polytope Classification:** The complete classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices is known. There are only three distinct combinatorial types:\n    *   Two of them are *simplicial* (all faces are simplices). The one with the absolute maximum number of 2-faces is the cyclic polytope C₄(6), with f₂=21.\n    *   Only one of them is *non-simplicial*.\n3.  **Identify the Polytope:** Since there is only a single non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices, it must be the one we are looking for. The condition \"maximal number of 2-faces\" is satisfied because it's the only one in its category. This unique polytope is the **pyramid over a square pyramid**.\n4.  **Calculate the f-vector:** I will calculate the f-vector (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃) for the pyramid over a square pyramid. This can be done systematically:\n    *   First, determine the number of vertices, edges, and faces of the base (a 3D square pyramid).\n    *   Then, use the standard formulas for constructing a pyramid over a base polytope to find the f-vector of the resulting 4-polytope.\n    *   The number of k-faces in a pyramid is the sum of the (k)-faces in the base and the (k-1)-faces in the base.\n5.  **Final Output:** The Python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting f-vector and a verification of Euler's formula (f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0) for this polytope.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_f_vector():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the f-vector for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.\n    \n    As per the classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there is only one\n    non-simplicial type: the pyramid over a square pyramid. This automatically means it\n    has the maximal number of 2-faces for its class (non-simplicial, 6 vertices).\n\n    The calculation proceeds by first defining the f-vector of the base (a square pyramid)\n    and then using the pyramid construction formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the properties of the 3D base: a square pyramid.\n    # A square pyramid has a square base (4 vertices, 4 edges) and an apex.\n    f0_base = 4 + 1  # 5 vertices\n    f1_base = 4 + 4  # 8 edges (4 on the base, 4 connecting the base to the apex)\n    f2_base = 1 + 4  # 5 faces (1 square face, 4 triangular faces)\n    \n    # Calculate the f-vector of the 4-polytope, which is a pyramid over the square pyramid base.\n    # The f-vector is a tuple (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃).\n    # f₀: vertices = vertices of base + 1 new apex\n    f0_polytope = f0_base + 1\n    \n    # f₁: edges = edges of base + new edges from each vertex of the base to the new apex\n    f1_polytope = f1_base + f0_base\n    \n    # f₂: 2-faces = 2-faces of base + new 2-faces formed by each edge of the base and the new apex\n    f2_polytope = f2_base + f1_base\n    \n    # f₃: 3-faces (cells) = the base itself is a cell + new cells formed by each 2-face of the base and the new apex\n    f3_polytope = f2_base + 1\n\n    f_vector = (f0_polytope, f1_polytope, f2_polytope, f3_polytope)\n    \n    print(f\"The unique non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is the pyramid over a square pyramid.\")\n    print(f\"Its f-vector (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃) is: {f_vector}\\n\")\n    \n    # Verify the result using Euler's formula for 4-polytopes: f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0\n    euler_sum = f0_polytope - f1_polytope + f2_polytope - f3_polytope\n    \n    print(\"Verifying with Euler's formula for 4-polytopes: f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: {f0_polytope} - {f1_polytope} + {f2_polytope} - {f3_polytope} = {euler_sum}\")\n\n    # Redirect final answer to the specified format\n    # This avoids including the final answer in regular prints for programmatic parsing.\n    sys.stdout = sys.__stderr__\n    print(f\"<<<{f_vector}>>>\")\n\nsolve_f_vector()\n```"
