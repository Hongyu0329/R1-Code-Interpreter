    This script calculates the f-vector for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices.
    
    As per the classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there is only one
    non-simplicial type: the pyramid over a square pyramid. This automatically means it
    has the maximal number of 2-faces for its class (non-simplicial, 6 vertices).

    The calculation proceeds by first defining the f-vector of the base (a square pyramid)
    and then using the pyramid construction formulas.
