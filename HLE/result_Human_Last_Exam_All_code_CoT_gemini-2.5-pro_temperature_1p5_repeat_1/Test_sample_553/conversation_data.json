    "This is a music theory question. My plan is to first identify the correct song based on knowledge of The Beatles' discography and the described chord progression. The progression is from the tonic (the \"home\" chord, or I) to the minor fifth chord (v). This is a somewhat unusual progression, especially in a major key, but it's very characteristic in a minor key (i to v).\n\nI have identified the song as \"Michelle\". The verse of \"Michelle\" is in the key of F minor. The famous opening guitar part starts on an F minor chord (the tonic, 'i') and immediately moves to a C minor chord (the minor fifth, 'v').\n\nI will now create a Python script that states this answer and explains the harmony.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song with a specific chord progression\n    and prints the answer with a music theory explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F minor (i)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    # The opening guitar passage of \"Michelle\" is an arpeggiated progression\n    # moving from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.\n    \n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is: {song_title}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(f\"The song's verse is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The progression jumps from the tonic chord ({tonic_chord}) to the minor fifth chord ({minor_fifth_chord}).\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
