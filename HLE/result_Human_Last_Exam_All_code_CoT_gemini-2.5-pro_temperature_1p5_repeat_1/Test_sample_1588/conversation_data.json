    "This problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This is a classic problem in Lie algebra. The terms of a specific order in the BCH series correspond to the basis elements of a free Lie algebra. The number of such basis elements can be calculated using Witt's formula.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the formula**: We will use Witt's formula to find the dimension of the n-th degree subspace of a free Lie algebra on k generators. The formula is: `L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)`, where `mu` is the Möbius function and the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n2.  **Set the parameters**: For our problem, we are interested in terms of order `n=10`, which are built from two generators, X and Y, so `k=2`.\n3.  **Implement the calculation**: I will write a Python script that:\n    a. Finds all divisors of `n=10`.\n    b. Implements the Möbius function `mu(d)`.\n    c. Applies Witt's formula by iterating through the divisors, calculating each term of the sum, and finding the final result.\n4.  **Display the process**: The script will print out each step of the calculation, including the formula, the values of the divisors, the Möbius function for each divisor, and the intermediate terms, to clearly show how the final answer is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    \n    # Check for squared prime factors\n    for p in prime_factors:\n        if prime_factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    # If no squared prime factors, mu(n) = (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1) ** len(prime_factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_nonzero_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the BCH expansion\n    for k generators using Witt's formula, and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    calculated_terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        k_power_val = k ** power\n        term_val = mu_d * k_power_val\n        calculated_terms.append({\n            'd': d, \n            'mu_d': mu_d, \n            'power': power, \n            'k_power_val': k_power_val, \n            'term_val': term_val\n        })\n        total_sum += term_val\n        \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # --- Printing the explanation and calculation ---\n    print(f\"To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion,\")\n    print(\"we use Witt's formula for the dimension of the n-th graded part of a free Lie algebra on k generators.\")\n    print(\"\\nWitt's formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum over d|n of (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    print(f\"\\nFor this problem, the order is n = {n}, and there are k = 2 generators (X and Y).\")\n    \n    divisors_str = \", \".join(map(str, divisors))\n    print(f\"The positive divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors_str}.\")\n\n    # Build and print the formula expression with symbolic values\n    expr_parts = [f\"mu({term['d']}) * {k}^({n}/{term['d']})\" for term in calculated_terms]\n    print(f\"\\nL_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(expr_parts) + \" )\")\n\n    # Build and print the expression with numeric values substituted\n    calc_parts_str = []\n    for term in calculated_terms:\n        # Show mu(d) * k^power\n        calc_parts_str.append(f\"({term['mu_d']}) * {k}^{term['power']}\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(calc_parts_str) + \" )\")\n    \n    calc_parts_2_str = []\n    for term in calculated_terms:\n        # Show mu(d) * result_of_power\n        calc_parts_2_str.append(f\"({term['mu_d']}) * {term['k_power_val']}\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" + \".join(calc_parts_2_str) + \" )\")\n\n    # Build and print the final sum expression\n    final_sum_parts = []\n    for i, term in enumerate(calculated_terms):\n        val = term['term_val']\n        if i > 0 and val >= 0:\n            final_sum_parts.append(f\"+ {val}\")\n        elif val < 0:\n            final_sum_parts.append(f\"- {abs(val)}\")\n        else:\n            final_sum_parts.append(str(val))\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {' '.join(final_sum_parts)} )\")\n    \n    # Print the sum and final result\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = {total_sum} / {n}\")\n    print(f\"L_{k}({n}) = {result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\n# Set n=10 (order) and k=2 (generators X and Y)\nORDER = 10\nGENERATORS = 2\ncalculate_bch_nonzero_coeffs(ORDER, GENERATORS)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
