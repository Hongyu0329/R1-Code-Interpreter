    print("  - Set S: The set of all real numbers computable by a standard Turing machine.")
    print("  - Number Ω: Defined as 'a real number that cannot be computed by this hypercomputer'.")
    print("\n2. The Core Paradox: Can the hypercomputer compute Ω?")

    print("\n   Let's consider two cases:\n")

    # Case 1: Assume the hypercomputer CAN compute Ω.
    print("   Case A: Assume the hypercomputer CAN compute Ω.")
    print("   - If it computes Ω, it has successfully computed a number.")
    print("   - However, the definition of Ω is that it CANNOT be computed by this hypercomputer.")
    print("   - This creates a direct contradiction: The hypercomputer computed something that, by definition, it cannot compute.")
    print("   - Therefore, this assumption must be false.")

    # Case 2: Assume the hypercomputer CANNOT compute Ω.
    print("\n   Case B: Assume the hypercomputer CANNOT compute Ω.")
    print("   - If the hypercomputer fails to compute Ω, then the defining statement of Ω ('cannot be computed by this hypercomputer') is true.")
    print("   - This means Ω is a valid, well-defined number that accurately describes its own property of being uncomputable by the hypercomputer.")
    print("   - This case does not lead to a logical contradiction. It leads to a conclusion about the hypercomputer's limits.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion about Ω and Set S:")
    print("   - From our analysis, we conclude that Ω is non-computable by the hypercomputer.")
    print("   - The set S contains numbers computable by a standard Turing machine, which is less powerful than a hypercomputer.")
    print("   - If a hypercomputer cannot compute Ω, a standard Turing machine certainly cannot.")
    print("   - Therefore, Ω is a non-computable number and is outside the set S.")

    print("\n4. Explaining the Hypercomputer's Failure:")
    print("   - The hypercomputer halted 'without a definitive answer' because it is caught in this paradox.")
    print("   - It cannot successfully compute Ω (as shown in Case A), so it cannot claim Ω is computable.")
    print("   - Its very failure to compute Ω confirms Ω's nature, but this is a meta-logical conclusion, not a computational result it can output.")
    print("   - The self-referential statement creates a blind spot that the hypercomputer's computational power cannot resolve.")

    print("\n5. Evaluating the Options:")
    print("   - A: Ω is non-computable, outside S, due to a paradox the hypercomputer can't resolve. (Matches our conclusion)")
    print("   - B: Ω is computable. (Contradicts our findings)")
    print("   - C: Set S is not well-defined. (S is well-defined; the problem is with Ω)")
    print("   - D: Mentions oracle machines and new hierarchies. (This is a valid implication, but A is a more direct explanation of the problem as stated)")
    print("   - E: Ω is both inside and outside S. (This is not the standard resolution; the conclusion is that it's simply outside S)")
