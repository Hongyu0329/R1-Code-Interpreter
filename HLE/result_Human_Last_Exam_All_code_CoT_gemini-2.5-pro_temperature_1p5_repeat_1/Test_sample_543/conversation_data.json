    "My plan to determine the IUPAC name of the product is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Conditions:** The reactants are 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent). The reaction is heated to reflux in THF solvent, followed by an aqueous work-up.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Type:** This is a Grignard cross-coupling reaction. The nucleophilic phenyl group from the Grignard reagent will replace the halogen atoms on the starting benzene ring.\n3.  **Analyze Reactivity:** The ease with which a halogen is replaced in this reaction depends on the carbon-halogen bond strength. The reactivity order is I > Br > Cl. Therefore, the iodine atom will be substituted first, followed by the two bromine atoms.\n4.  **Predict the Final Product:** The term \"excess\" phenyl magnesium bromide implies that there is more than enough reagent to react with all three halogen sites. The reflux condition provides the necessary energy to drive the reaction to completion, including the substitution of the less reactive bromine atoms. The final organic product will have all three halogens (one iodine, two bromines) replaced by phenyl groups.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** The resulting structure has a central benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. I will construct the IUPAC name based on this structure.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to explain this chemical reasoning and programmatically construct the final IUPAC name, printing each component of the name as part of the output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction and determines the IUPAC name of the product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
