    (c) is a specific calculation. The formula provided in the prompt is very complex and appears to contain typos when compared to the source literature,
    making a direct computation lead to incorrect, non-integer results. The established value for |D_2(8, 4)| in the mathematical literature on dessins d'enfants is 2.
