    "To find the number of unique grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, we need to follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define a Grid Diagram:** A grid diagram of size *n*x*n* is determined by two permutations, `sigma` (for 'X' markers) and `tau` (for 'O' markers), of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number *n* is 3.\n\n2.  **Generate All Possible Diagrams:** We will generate all possible 3x3 grid diagrams. Since there are 3! = 6 permutations of 3 elements, there are 6 * 6 = 36 possible pairs of (`sigma`, `tau`), and thus 36 possible diagrams.\n\n3.  **Identify the Knot Type:** For each of the 36 diagrams, we need to determine what knot or link it represents. This involves two steps:\n    *   **Count Components:** A diagram represents a single-component knot if the permutation `sigma * tau_inverse` has exactly one cycle.\n    *   **Calculate Writhe:** For the diagrams that represent knots, we calculate their writhe. Minimal grid diagrams of knots are alternating. For such diagrams, a writhe of 0 indicates the unknot, a positive writhe indicates one chirality (e.g., right-handed), and a negative writhe indicates the other (left-handed). For the trefoil knot, minimal diagrams have a writhe of +2 or -2. We will identify diagrams with a writhe of -2 as left-hand trefoils.\n\n4.  **Count Unique Diagrams under Rotation:** After identifying all diagrams for the left-hand trefoil, we must account for rotational symmetry. Diagrams that can be rotated into one another are considered equivalent. We can count the number of unique diagrams (orbits) using Burnside's Lemma, which states:\n    Number of orbits = (1/|G|) * Î£ |X^g| for each g in G.\n    *   `G` is the group of 90, 180, and 270-degree rotations, plus the 0-degree identity rotation. So, |G|=4.\n    *   `X` is the set of all left-hand trefoil diagrams.\n    *   `X^g` is the subset of diagrams in `X` that remain unchanged after applying the rotation `g`.\n\n    The final equation will be:\n    Number of unique diagrams = (1/4) * (|X| + |X^r90| + |X^r180| + |X^r270|)\n    where `rN` denotes rotation by N degrees.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan to find the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef invert_permutation(p):\n    \"\"\"Inverts a permutation tuple.\"\"\"\n    inverse = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inverse[val] = i\n    return tuple(inverse)\n\ndef compose_permutations(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Composes two permutation tuples (p1 o p2).\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p1)))\n\ndef count_cycles(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of cycles in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    seen = [False] * n\n    cycles = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not seen[i]:\n            cycles += 1\n            j = i\n            while not seen[j]:\n                seen[j] = True\n                j = p[j]\n    return cycles\n\ndef sign(x):\n    \"\"\"Sign function.\"\"\"\n    if x > 0: return 1\n    if x < 0: return -1\n    return 0\n\ndef calculate_writhe(sigma, tau):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the writhe of a grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    n = len(sigma)\n    # Turaev's formula for writhe\n    w_v = sum(sign(t -
