    "To solve this problem, we will find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Irreducible Representations and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For this problem, $n=25$.\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. The formula states that the dimension $d_\\lambda$ is $n!$ divided by the product of the hook lengths of all the cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n3.  **Algorithm:**\n    *   First, we will generate all possible integer partitions of 25.\n    *   For each partition, we will construct its Young diagram and calculate the hook length for every cell.\n    *   Using the hook-length formula, we will compute the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation.\n    *   We will then check if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    *   Finally, we will count how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will list all the partitions and their dimensions that meet the criteria, and then print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_s25_irreps_below_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of irreducible representations of S_25 with a dimension\n    strictly less than a given limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 25\n    limit = 500000\n\n    def generate_partitions(n, max_val=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Generates all integer partitions of n in lexicographical order.\n        \"\"\"\n        if max_val is None:\n            max_val = n\n        \n        if n == 0:\n            yield []\n            return\n        \n        # We generate partitions where the parts are in descending order.\n        # 'i' will be the first part of the partition.\n        for i in range(min(max_val, n), 0, -1):\n            # Recursively find partitions for the remainder (n-i).\n            # The next part cannot be larger than the current part 'i'.\n            for sub_partition in generate_partitions(n - i, i):\n                yield [i] + sub_partition\n\n    # Pre-calculate n! to avoid repeated computations.\n    # Python's integers have arbitrary precision, so overflow is not an issue.\n    try:\n        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(f\"Error: n must be a non-negative integer.
