    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will establish the definition of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) and define its rank. The rank of a Pauli channel is determined by the number of its constituent Pauli operators that have non-zero probabilities.\n\nSecond, I will determine the maximum possible rank for such a Pauli channel. This corresponds to the case where all possible generalized Pauli operators are included in the channel's definition, each with a non-zero probability.\n\nThird, I will use the properties of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$. I will show that for any Pauli channel, the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of the original channel. This is a key result that stems from the orthogonality of the generalized Pauli operators.\n\nFinally, by combining these insights, I will deduce the maximal rank of the complementary channel of $\\Lambda$, expressing it in terms of the dimension $d$. I will then present a Python script that uses the symbolic math library `sympy` to formalize this reasoning and calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_complementary_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel\n    on a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define d as a mathematical symbol for the dimension of the system.\n    d = sympy.symbols('d', integer=True, positive=True)\n\n    print(f\"The analysis is for a qudit, a quantum system of dimension d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the number of generalized Pauli operators.\n    # For a d-dimensional system, the generalized Pauli operators are of the form X^j Z^k,\n    # where j and k can each take d values (from 0 to d-1).\n    num_choices_j = d\n    num_choices_k = d\n    num_pauli_operators = num_choices_j * num_choices_k\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the total number of generalized Pauli operators.\")\n    print(f\"The operators are of the form X^j Z^k, where j, k are in {{0, ..., d-1}}.\")\n    print(f\"Number of choices for exponent j = {num_choices_j}\")\n    print(f\"Number of choices for exponent k = {num_choices_k}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of Pauli operators = {num_choices_j} * {num_choices_k} = {num_pauli_operators}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximal rank of the Pauli channel itself.\n    # The rank of a Pauli channel is the number of non-zero probability coefficients in its definition.\n    # The channel is given by Lambda(rho) = sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} X^j Z^k * rho * (X^j Z^k)^dagger.\n    # The rank is the number of non-zero p_{j,k}.\n    # To maximize the rank, we assume all p_{j,k} can be non-zero.\n    max_rank_lambda = num_pauli_operators\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the maximal rank of the Pauli channel Lambda.\")\n    print(\"The rank of a Pauli channel is the number of its constituent Pauli operators that appear with non-zero probability.\")\n    print(f\"To maximize the rank, all {num_pauli_operators} Pauli operators must be included.\")\n    print(f\"Maximal rank of Lambda = {max_rank_lambda}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 3: Relate the rank of the complementary channel to the original channel.\n    # For a Pauli channel, it can be proven that the rank of the complementary channel\n    # is equal to the rank of the original channel.\n    # Rank(Lambda^c) = Rank(Lambda).\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Relate the rank of the complementary channel to the original channel.\")\n    print(\"For the specific case of Pauli channels, a key theorem states that the rank of the complementary channel is equal to the rank of the original channel.\")\n    print(\"Rank(Lambda^c) = Rank(Lambda)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude the maximal rank of the complementary channel.\n    max_rank_lambda_c = max_rank_lambda\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Conclude the maximal rank of the complementary channel.\")\n    print(\"Combining the findings from the previous steps:\")\n    print(f\"Maximal Rank(Lambda^c) = Maximal Rank(Lambda) = {max_rank_lambda_c}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nsolve_complementary_channel_rank()\n```\n<<<d**2>>>"
