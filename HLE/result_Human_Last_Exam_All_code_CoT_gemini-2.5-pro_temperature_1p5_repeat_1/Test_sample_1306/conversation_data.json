    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Context**: The problem is about the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. The key objects are the *indecomposable* and *irreducible* representations.\n2.  **Identify the Key Parameter**: For a primitive $n$-th root of unity $q$, the structure of the representation category is governed by the integer $l$, which is the order of $q^2$. Since $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $q^3=1$ and $q \\neq 1$), $q^2$ is also a primitive third root of unity. Therefore, the parameter for our case is $l=3$.\n3.  **Count the Irreducible Objects**: According to the classification of representations for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ at a root of unity, the representations are grouped into \"blocks\". The structure of each block is identical. For a given block, the number of non-isomorphic irreducible (or simple) objects is $l-1$.\n4.  **Count All Indecomposable Objects**: In each block, the complete set of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects consists of the irreducible objects and their projective covers. Since there is one projective cover for each irreducible object, the total number of indecomposable objects is $2 \\times (l-1)$.\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage**: The percentage of irreducible objects among the indecomposable ones is the ratio of these counts, multiplied by 100.\n    Percentage = (Number of Irreducibles / Number of Indecomposables) * 100.\n6.  **Write the Code**: I will write a Python script that defines $l=3$, calculates the number of irreducible and indecomposable objects based on the formulas from steps 3 and 4, and then computes the final percentage, printing all the steps of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the key parameter 'l'.\n# q is a primitive third root of unity. The theory of representations of u_q(sl2)\n# at a root of unity depends on l, the order of q^2.\n# If q = exp(2*pi*i/3), then q^2 = exp(4*pi*i/3), and the order of q^2 is 3.\n# So, l = 3.\nl = 3\n\n# Step 2: Count the number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects in a block of the category.\n# For a given block, the number of irreducibles is l - 1.\nnum_irreducible = l - 1\n\n# Step 3: Count the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects in a block.\n# This consists of the irreducible objects and their projective covers.\n# So, the total is 2 * (l - 1).\nnum_indecomposable = 2 * (l - 1)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.\n# The percentage of objects that are irreducible is the ratio of the two counts.\npercentage = (num_irreducible / num_indecomposable) * 100\n\n# Step 5: Print the results in a clear format, including the final equation.\nprint(f\"The parameter 'l' for q being a primitive third root of unity is {l}.\")\nprint(\"Within any representative block of the category C:\")\nprint(f\"The number of irreducible objects is l - 1 = {l} - 1 = {num_irreducible}.\")\nprint(f\"The total number of indecomposable objects is 2 * (l - 1) = 2 * ({l} - 1) = {num_indecomposable}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe percentage of indecomposable objects that are irreducible is therefore:\")\nprint(f\"Percentage = ({num_irreducible} / {num_indecomposable}) * 100 = {percentage:.0f}%\")\n\n```\n<<<50>>>"
