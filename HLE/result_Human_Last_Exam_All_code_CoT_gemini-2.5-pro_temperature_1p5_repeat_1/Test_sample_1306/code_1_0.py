# Step 1: Define the key parameter 'l'.
# q is a primitive third root of unity. The theory of representations of u_q(sl2)
# at a root of unity depends on l, the order of q^2.
# If q = exp(2*pi*i/3), then q^2 = exp(4*pi*i/3), and the order of q^2 is 3.
# So, l = 3.
l = 3

# Step 2: Count the number of non-isomorphic irreducible objects in a block of the category.
# For a given block, the number of irreducibles is l - 1.
num_irreducible = l - 1

# Step 3: Count the total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable objects in a block.
# This consists of the irreducible objects and their projective covers.
# So, the total is 2 * (l - 1).
num_indecomposable = 2 * (l - 1)

# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.
# The percentage of objects that are irreducible is the ratio of the two counts.
percentage = (num_irreducible / num_indecomposable) * 100

# Step 5: Print the results in a clear format, including the final equation.
