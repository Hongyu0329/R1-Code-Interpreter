# Define the given constant c1
c1 = 10**4

# Define the components of l1 and calculate its value
l1_base = 1 + 10**5
l1_exponent = 5
l1 = l1_base**l1_exponent

# Based on the matrix equation analysis, the formula for u1 is:
# u1 = (l1 - 1) / c1
# Since l1 = (10^5+1)^5, we know that l1-1 is divisible by (10^5+1)-1 = 10^5.
# As c1 = 10^4, the result of the division is an exact integer.
# We use integer division // for precision.
numerator = l1 - 1
u1 = numerator // c1

# As per the instruction, we output the numbers in the final equation.
