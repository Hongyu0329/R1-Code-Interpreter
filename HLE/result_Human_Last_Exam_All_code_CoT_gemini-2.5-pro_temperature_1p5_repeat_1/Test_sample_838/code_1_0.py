    # Step 1: E2 Elimination (Hofmann)
    print("Step 1: Formation of Product A")

    print("The starting material is [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, which is systematically named (S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane.")
    print("This compound is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in a 60/40 cyclohexane/diethyl ether mixture.")
    print("t-BuOK is a strong, sterically bulky base. In an elimination reaction, it preferentially removes the most accessible proton, leading to the least substituted alkene. This is known as Hofmann elimination.")
    print("The reaction forms a double bond between C3 and C4, destroying the stereocenter.")
    print("Product A is: 4-phenylbut-1-ene.")

    print("This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which adds water (as H and OH) across the double bond.")
    print("The reaction follows anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, meaning the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C4).")

    print("\nChirality Explanation:")
    print("The molecule 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph) is achiral. A chiral molecule must have a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups). In this product, no carbon atom fits this description, so the molecule has no stereocenters and is achiral.")
