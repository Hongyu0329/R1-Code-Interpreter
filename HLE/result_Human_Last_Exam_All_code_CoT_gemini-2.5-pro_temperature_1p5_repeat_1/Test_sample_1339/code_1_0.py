  # Part (a): Existence and Uniqueness of the minimal group hat(G).
  # The group described, G, is a solvable group with specific properties
  # on the factors of its subnormal series (p'-torsion-free abelian).
  # For such groups, the theory of group localization guarantees the
  # existence of a unique minimal group, hat(G) (the p-localization),
  # where p-nonsingular systems are solvable.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # Part (b): Maximum possible derived length of hat(G).
  # The derived length of a group is the length of its derived series.
  # 1. From the subnormal series G = G_1 ... G_{n+1}={1}, we can deduce that
  #    the derived length of G is at most n, i.e., dl(G) <= n.
  # 2. The localization process does not increase the derived length,
  #    so dl(hat(G)) <= dl(G) <= n.
  # 3. This maximum is achievable. For instance, the iterated wreath product
  #    of n copies of the cyclic group C_p has a derived length of n and
  #    satisfies the problem's premises.
  # Thus, the maximum possible derived length of hat(G) is n. The variable 'n'
  # is defined in the problem as the length of the subnormal series.
