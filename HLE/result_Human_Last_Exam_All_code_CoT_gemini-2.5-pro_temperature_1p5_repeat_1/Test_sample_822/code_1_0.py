    # Diagnostic Reasoning
    print("Diagnostic Reasoning:")
    print("1. The patient is immunocompromised due to steroid treatment, making him highly susceptible to opportunistic infections.")
    print("2. The clinical picture of a disseminated infection involving the lungs (nodules, pneumonia), skin (lesions), and central nervous system (confusion) is present.")
    print("3. Nocardia is a bacterium that classically causes such a disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts.")
    print("4. The most significant clue is the failure of aminoglycoside therapy. Nocardiosis does not typically respond to aminoglycosides and requires treatment with specific antibiotics like sulfonamides (e.g., TMP-SMX). This treatment failure strongly points away from more common bacterial pathogens.")
