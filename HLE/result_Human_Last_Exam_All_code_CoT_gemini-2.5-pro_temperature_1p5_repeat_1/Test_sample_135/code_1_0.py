    # Statement A Analysis
    print("Statement A: Experienced teachers often overestimate students' academic achievement.")
    print("Analysis: Research often shows a leniency effect where teachers tend to overestimate student performance. This statement is consistent with findings.\n")

    # Statement B Analysis
    print("Statement B: Experienced teacher judgment accuracy correlates with students' achievement around r = .6.")
    print("Analysis: A major meta-analysis by Südkamp, Kaiser, and Möller (2012) found a mean correlation of r = .63. Therefore, 'around r = .6' is accurate. This statement is correct.\n")

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("Statement C: Experienced teachers have more difficulty accurately judging low-performing students.")
    print("Analysis: This is contrary to evidence. The same Südkamp et al. (2012) meta-analysis found that judgment accuracy was HIGHER for low-achieving students (r = .70) than for the overall sample. This statement is NOT correct.\n")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("Statement D: Experienced teachers are typically more accurate in assessing student performance than student teachers.")
    print("Analysis: Research supports this, showing that experienced teachers (mean r = .63) are more accurate than student teachers (mean r = .43). This statement is correct.\n")

    # Statement E Analysis
    print("Statement E: Experienced teachers’ judgement accuracy on students achievement is higher than on students motivation.")
    print("Analysis: Judgments on concrete, observable outcomes like achievement are generally more accurate than judgments on internal constructs like motivation. This statement is correct.\n")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion: The only statement not supported by empirical research is C.")
