# Plan:
# 1. Define the input parameters c and b.
# 2. Model the FAIR components f, a, i, r based on a plausible interpretation of the problem.
#    - Findability (f) is limited by the identifier resolution consistency (c).
#    - Accessibility (a) is assumed to be ideal (1.0) in a "best implementation".
#    - Interoperability (i) is inversely affected by the branching factor (b), representing fragmentation.
#    - Reusability (r) is dependent on both reliable identifiers (c) and non-fragmented versions (1/b).
# 3. Define the overall FAIR score R as the average of the four components.
# 4. Calculate the values and print the final equation and result step-by-step.

# Step 1: Define parameters
c = 0.95  # Identifier resolution consistency
b = 3     # Semantic versioning branching factor

# Step 2: Model FAIR components (on a scale of 0 to 1)
# Findability is limited by identifier consistency.
f = c
# Accessibility is assumed to be perfect in a 'best implementation'.
a = 1.0
# Interoperability is inversely proportional to the branching factor.
i = 1 / b
# Reusability depends on both identifier consistency and version clarity.
r = c / b

# Step 3: Calculate the overall FAIR score R
sum_components = f + a + i + r
R = sum_components / 4

# Step 4: Print the results and the calculation steps
