    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This can be determined using the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Polynomial and its Galois Group:** The given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. This is a known polynomial in algebraic number theory. Its splitting field is a cyclic extension of the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 7. Consequently, the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the cyclic group of order 7, denoted as $G = C_7$.\n2.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** The theorem connects the density of primes with certain splitting properties to the structure of the Galois group. A prime $p$ is one for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$, $\\text{Frob}_p$, is a generator of the Galois group $G$.\n3.  **Count the Generators:** The group $G = C_7$ is cyclic of order $n=7$. The number of generators of a cyclic group $C_n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$. Since 7 is a prime number, the number of generators is $\\phi(7) = 7-1 = 6$. These are all the elements of $C_7$ except for the identity element.\n4.  **Calculate the Density:** The natural density of these primes is the ratio of the number of generators to the total number of elements in the group.\n    Density = (Number of generators) / |G| = $\\phi(7) / 7$.\n5.  **Code the Calculation:** A Python script will be provided to perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef euler_totient(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function, phi(n), which counts the positive\n    integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\n# The degree of the polynomial f(x) determines the order of its cyclic Galois group.\ndegree = 7\ngroup_order = degree\n\n# The number of generators of the cyclic group C_n is phi(n).\nnum_generators = euler_totient(group_order)\n\n# The density of primes p for which f(x) remains irreducible mod p\n# is the ratio of the number of generators to the group order.\ndensity_numerator = num_generators\ndensity_denominator = group_order\n\nprint(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22.\")\nprint(f\"The Galois group of this polynomial is the cyclic group C_{degree}.\")\nprint(f\"The order of the Galois group is {group_order}.\")\nprint(f\"For f(x) to be irreducible modulo a prime p, the Frobenius element Frob_p must be a generator of the Galois group.\")\nprint(f\"The number of generators of C_{group_order} is given by Euler's totient function, phi({group_order}).\")\nprint(f\"phi({group_order}) = {num_generators}.\")\nprint(f\"The density is the ratio of the number of generators to the order of the group.\")\nprint(f\"Density = {density_numerator} / {density_denominator}\")\nresult_fraction = f\"{density_numerator}/{density_denominator}\"\nprint(f\"The final answer is {result_fraction}.\")\n\n```\n<<<6/7>>>"
