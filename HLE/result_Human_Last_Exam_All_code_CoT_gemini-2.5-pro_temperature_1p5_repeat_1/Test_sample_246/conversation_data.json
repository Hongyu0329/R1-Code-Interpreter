    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the specific 4-manifold in question based on the description provided. This involves understanding the terms \"trefoil knot\", \"5-twist-spun knot\", and \"double branched cover\".\n2.  Next, I will determine the fundamental group of this 4-manifold using established theorems from knot theory and topology. The group turns out to be a direct product of two simpler, well-known groups.\n3.  Finally, I will calculate the minimal number of generators for this resulting group. This involves analyzing the group's structure and its abelianization. A key part of the argument is establishing both a lower and an upper bound for the number of generators.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps, explaining the logic and using the `sympy` library to aid in the computation of the group's abelianization, which is crucial for finding the lower bound on the number of generators.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the\n    double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of a specific 4-manifold.\")\n    print(\"The manifold is the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Determine the fundamental group ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the fundamental group of the manifold.\")\n    \n    knot_name = \"trefoil\"\n    n_twist = 5\n    n_cover = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The construction starts with the {knot_name} knot.
