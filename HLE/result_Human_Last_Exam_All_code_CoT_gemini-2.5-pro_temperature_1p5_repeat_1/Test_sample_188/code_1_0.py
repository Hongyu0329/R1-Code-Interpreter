# Number of symbols in the book Ching, which is the carrier of the secret message.
num_ching_symbols = 9999

# The number of unique characters from the book Shu used for the message alphabet.
num_shu_characters = 120

# The other details, like character recognition time and computation time, are not
# relevant to the maximum length of the message.

# Assuming each symbol in the Ching is used to encode one character of the secret message,
# the maximum possible length of the message is equal to the number of symbols in the Ching.
max_length = num_ching_symbols

# The final equation is: max_length = 9999
# As requested, we print the number from the final equation.
