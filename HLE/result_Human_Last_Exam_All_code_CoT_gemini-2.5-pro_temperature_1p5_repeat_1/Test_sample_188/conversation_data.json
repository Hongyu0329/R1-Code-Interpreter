  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem is a riddle that tests our ability to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant details. The core of the problem is about information capacity.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Carrier of Information**: The problem states that the secret message is encrypted *with* the Ching's symbols. The Ching contains 9999 symbols. These symbols are the fundamental units used to store the encrypted message.\n2.  **Identify the Alphabet of the Message**: The message is written using 120 common characters from the Shu. This set of 120 characters is the \"alphabet\" for the decrypted message. The number of characters in the alphabet (120) is much smaller than the number of available symbols (9999), meaning there are more than enough symbols to represent every possible character.\n3.  **Determine the Message Length**: The most straightforward way to encode the message is to have each symbol in the Ching correspond to one character in the secret message. Since there are 9999 symbols in the Ching, we can encode a message that is 9999 characters long.\n4.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information**: The computation times (10 ns, 30 ns) and the character recognition time (12 ms) are related to processing speed, not the storage capacity or length of the message itself. They are red herrings designed to be distractive.\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the message is simply the number of symbols available in the Ching.\n\n```python\n# Number of symbols in the book Ching, which is the carrier of the secret message.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n\n# The number of unique characters from the book Shu used for the message alphabet.\nnum_shu_characters = 120\n\n# The other details, like character recognition time and computation time, are not\n# relevant to the maximum length of the message.\n\n# Assuming each symbol in the Ching is used to encode one character of the secret message,\n# the maximum possible length of the message is equal to the number of symbols in the Ching.\nmax_length = num_ching_symbols\n\n# The final equation is: max_length = 9999\n# As requested, we print the number from the final equation.\nprint(max_length)\n```\n<<<9999>>>"
