    This function analyzes the stable reduction of the given curve above p=2
    to find the number of double points.

    The process is as follows:
    1. Define the initial curve equation and show its reduction mod 2 is "bad".
    2. Apply the transformation Y = (y-x)/2 by substituting y = 2Y+x to find a better model.
    3. Simplify the new equation.
    4. Reduce the new model's equation modulo 2 to get the special fiber.
    5. Argue that the special fiber is the stable reduction and count its double points.
