    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in the stable reduction of the given curve modulo 2.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the curve's equation: $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\n2.  Analyze its reduction modulo 2. The equation becomes $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod 2$. This represents a \"double line\" in the affine plane over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, which is a singular reduction (often called \"bad reduction\").\n3.  To find a better model, we can perform a coordinate transformation. Since the singularity in the reduction is of the form $y^2=x^2$, we can try to \"separate\" these two components. We define a new coordinate $Y = (y-x)/2$. This transformation is valid over the 2-adic integers ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$) because the original equation implies $y^2-x^2 = (y-x)(y+x) = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$, which is divisible by 4. This divisibility ensures that $y-x$ is always an even 2-adic integer for any point $(x,y)$ on the curve, so $Y$ is a 2-adic integer.\n4.  We substitute $y = 2Y+x$ into the original equation and simplify to get a new equation in terms of $x$ and $Y$. This new equation represents a different model of the same curve.\n5.  We then reduce this new model's equation modulo 2. This reduced curve is the \"special fiber\" of our new model.\n6.  We analyze the singularities of this special fiber. We will find that it has a single singular point. By examining the lowest degree terms of the equation at this point, we can classify the singularity. It turns out to be an ordinary double point, or a node.\n7.  A model whose special fiber has only nodes as singularities is called a semi-stable model. In this case, the special fiber is an irreducible rational curve with one node. This is a stable configuration, meaning it represents the stable reduction of the curve.\n8.  The number of double points in this stable reduction is therefore the number of nodes we found, which is 1.\n\nThe following Python code carries out the necessary algebraic manipulations to demonstrate these steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the stable reduction of the given curve above p=2\n    to find the number of double points.\n\n    The process is as follows:\n    1. Define the initial curve equation and show its reduction mod 2 is \"bad\".\n    2. Apply the transformation Y = (y-x)/2 by substituting y = 2Y+x to find a better model.\n    3. Simplify the new equation.\n    4. Reduce the new model's equation modulo 2 to get the special fiber.\n    5.
