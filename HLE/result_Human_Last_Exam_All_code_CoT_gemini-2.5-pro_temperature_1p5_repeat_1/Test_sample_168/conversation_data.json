    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we first need to establish the frequency range of sound produced by muscle contractions. These sounds, known as mechanomyograms (MMG), are very low-frequency, typically falling within the 5 to 25 Hz range.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to compare this frequency range with the known hearing ranges of each animal listed in the options. The script will:\n1.  Store the hearing range (minimum and maximum frequency in Hz) for each animal.\n2.  Define the frequency range for a human muscle twitch.\n3.  Iterate through each animal and check if its hearing range overlaps with the muscle twitch frequency range.\n4.  To satisfy the prompt's requirement, for each animal, I will print the \"equation\" used for the overlap check, showing the specific frequency numbers involved. An overlap exists if the highest of the two lower bounds is less than or equal to the lowest of the two upper bounds.\n5.  Finally, the script will output a conclusion based on which animals have a hearing range that overlaps with the sound of a muscle twitch.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer to check if it's empty\nfrom io import StringIO\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the hearing ranges of various animals to the frequency of a human muscle twitch\n    to determine which animal might be able to hear it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data Sources:\n    # - Muscle Twitch (Mechanomyogram/MMG): Typically 5-25 Hz.\n    # - Hearing Ranges: Based on various scientific and academic sources.\n    #   Note: These are approximate ranges and can vary between individuals and specific species.\n\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        \"Dog\": (67, 45000),\n        \"Bat\": (2000, 110000),\n        \"Herring\": (1, 4000), # Some clupeids (herring family) can hear down to <1 Hz.\n        \"Whale\": (7, 35000),  # Representative of Baleen whales, which specialize in low frequencies.\n        \"Human\": (20, 20000)\n    }\n\n    twitch_low, twitch_high = 5, 25\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing which animal can hear a human muscle twitch ({twitch_low}-{twitch_high} Hz)...\\n\")\n\n    possible_candidates = []\n\n    for animal, (animal_low, animal_high) in animal_hearing_ranges.items():\n        print(f\"--- Checking: {animal} ---\")\n        print(f\"Hearing Range: {animal_low} Hz - {animal_high} Hz\")\n\n        # The condition for overlap between two ranges [a, b] and [c, d] is max(a, c) <= min(b, d)\n        overlap_check_result = max(animal_low, twitch_low) <= min(animal_high, twitch_high)\n\n        # To satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement,\n        # we will print the comparison logic with the actual numbers.\n        print(\"Equation for Overlap Check:\")\n        # This is the \"equation\" part of the prompt\n        print(f\"max({animal_low}, {twitch_low}) <= min({animal_high}, {twitch_high})\")\n        print(f\"Resulting check: {max(animal_low, twitch_low)} <= {min(animal_high, twitch_high)}\")\n\n        if overlap_check_result:\n            print(\"Conclusion: Overlap exists.
