    "My plan is to determine the extents of the figure in the x and y directions.\n\n1.  **Find the range of x-values:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)` for the entire interval `t` in `[0, 2pi]`. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1. Therefore, the minimum x-value is -1 and the maximum x-value is 1. The total width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\n2.  **Find the range of y-values:** The y-coordinate is defined in two parts.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, pi]`, `y = sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. So, the y-values are in `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(pi, 2pi)`, `y = 5*sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from -1 to 0. Therefore, `5*sin(t)` ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining these two parts, the overall range for y is `[-5, 1]`. The minimum y-value is -5 and the maximum y-value is 1. The total height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Determine the enclosing square:** The figure fits within a bounding box of width 2 and height 6. To encircle this figure with a square, the side length of the square must be at least as large as the longest dimension of the bounding box. Therefore, the side length of the smallest enclosing square is `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the area:** The area of a square with a side length of 6 is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the boundaries for x and y\n# For x = cos(t), the range over [0, 2*pi] is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\n\n# For y, we have two pieces.\n# For t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). The range is [0, 1].\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). The range is [-5, 0).\n# The total range for y is the union of these two, which is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 3: The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_of_square = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_of_square * side_of_square\n\n# Step 5: Print the results, including the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The figure's width is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The figure's height is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\nprint(f\"The side of the smallest enclosing square must be at least {side_of_square}.\")\nprint(f\"The area of the smallest square is {side_of_square} * {side_of_square} = {area}.\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
