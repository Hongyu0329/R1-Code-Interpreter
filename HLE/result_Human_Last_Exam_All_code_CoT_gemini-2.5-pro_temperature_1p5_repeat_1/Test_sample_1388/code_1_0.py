# The problem is to determine the explicit form of H(t) in the L2 energy estimate.
# Based on the derivation, H(t) is a constant.

# Define the variable t, although in this case H(t) is constant.
t = sympy.Symbol('t')

# The explicit form of H(t)
H_t = 1

# Print the final result.
# The instruction says "output each number in the final equation!".
# For H(t)=1, we print the number 1.
