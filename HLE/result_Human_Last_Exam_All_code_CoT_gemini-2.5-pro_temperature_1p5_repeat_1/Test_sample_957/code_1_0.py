# The problem asks for the correct expressions for the overall reflection and transmission coefficients.
# Based on the step-by-step derivation, option D provides the correct expression for the transmission coefficient tau.
# Although the expression for the reflection coefficient rho in option D appears to have a typo,
# the correctness of tau makes D the most plausible answer among the choices.

# Let's define the variables symbolically for clarity.
tau_m = "τ_m"
rho_m = "ρ_m"
k0d = "k₀d"

# The expressions from option D are:
transmission_coeff = f"({tau_m}^2 * exp(i*{k0d})) / (1 - {rho_m}^2 * exp(i*2*{k0d}))"
reflection_coeff = f"(1 - ({rho_m} - {tau_m}^2) * exp(i*2*{k0d}) * {rho_m}) / (1 - {rho_m}^2 * exp(i*2*{k0d}))"

print("The derived transmission coefficient is:")
print(f"τ = {transmission_coeff}")
print("\nThe reflection coefficient from the chosen option D is:")
print(f"ρ = {reflection_coeff}")
