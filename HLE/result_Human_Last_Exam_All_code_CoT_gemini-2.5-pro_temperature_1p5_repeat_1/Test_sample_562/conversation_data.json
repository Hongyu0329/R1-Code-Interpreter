    "Here is my plan to identify the radical of the character 謄:\n1.  First, I will break down the kanji character 謄 into its components.\n2.  The character 謄 can be separated into a left part and a right part: 言 and 朕.\n3.  In the structure of kanji, the component on the left side is often the radical (部首, bushu) and is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n4.  The radical for 謄 is the left part, which is 言.\n5.  I need to find the Japanese name for this radical when it appears on the left side of a character. The radical 言 is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん). \"Gon\" is from the reading of the character 言, and \"ben\" (a voiced version of \"hen\") means \"left side\".\n6.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef get_kanji_radical_info(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the radical of a given Kanji character.\n    This function uses a pre-defined dictionary for lookup as radical\n    identification is a linguistic task, not a purely computational one.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_radicals = {\n        '謄': {\n            'radical_char': '言',\n            'radical_name_hepburn': 'Gonben'\n        },\n        '媛': {\n            'radical_char': '女',\n            'radical_name_hepburn': 'Onnahen'\n        }\n        # Add more kanji info here as needed\n    }\n\n    if character in kanji_radicals:\n        info = kanji_radicals[character]\n        print(f\"The bushu/radical for the character '{character}' is '{info['radical_name_hepburn']}'.\")\n        return info['radical_name_hepburn']\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, information for the character '{character}' is not available.\")\n        return None\n\n# The character in question\ntarget_character = '謄'\n\n# Get and print the radical's name\nradical_name = get_kanji_radical_info(target_character)\n\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
