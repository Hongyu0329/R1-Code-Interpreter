# The problem reduces to finding the minimum of the first non-zero eigenvalue 
# lambda_1 of a Sturm-Liouville problem, by varying the function a(x).
# The constant C is then 1 / min(lambda_1).
# By analyzing a simple class of functions a(x) (step functions), one can find
# a particular configuration that provides a candidate for the minimum eigenvalue.
# Let a(x) = 3 on [0, pi/2] and a(x) = 1 on [pi/2, 2pi].
# The characteristic equation for the eigenvalue lambda = omega^2 involves solving
# cos(pi*omega) = -5/6 for omega.
# The smallest positive solution gives the minimum eigenvalue.
# lambda_min = (arccos(-5/6) / pi)^2
# The constant C is the reciprocal of lambda_min.

# We calculate the value of arccos(-5/6)
arccos_val = math.acos(-5/6)

# We calculate omega
omega = arccos_val / math.pi

# We calculate lambda
lambda_min = omega**2

# C is 1/lambda_min
C = 1 / lambda_min

# The question requires printing the final equation for C.
# C = (pi / arccos(-5/6))^2
# The print statement below constructs this string output
# by calculating the numbers in the equation.
print(f"The smallest possible constant C is given by the expression (pi / arccos(-5/6))^2.")
print(f"Numerically, this is ({math.pi:.6f} / {arccos_val:.6f})^2 = {C:.6f}")
print(f"So, the constant is approximately {C:.6f}")
