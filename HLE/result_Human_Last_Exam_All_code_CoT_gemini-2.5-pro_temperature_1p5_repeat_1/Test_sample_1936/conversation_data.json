    "To find the smallest number `n` for which a set of `n` elements with a binary operation can fail to be a group, I will proceed with the following plan:\n\n1.  First, I will clearly state the definition of a group, which is a non-empty set G combined with a binary operation that must satisfy the axioms of Closure, Associativity, Identity, and Inverse. The non-empty condition implies that `n` must be at least 1.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the case for the smallest possible non-empty set, where `n = 1`. I will demonstrate that any set of one element under the only possible binary operation inevitably fulfills all the group axioms. Therefore, it is impossible for a set of size 1 not to be a group.\n3.  Then, I will move to the next integer, `n = 2`. For this case, I will construct a concrete example of a set with two elements and define a binary operation on it. I will then show that this structure fails at least one of the group axioms (specifically, the identity axiom), proving that it is not a group.\n4.  Based on these findings—that `n=1` must always form a group and that a non-group structure is possible for `n=2`—I will conclude that the smallest such `n` is 2. The Python script below will articulate this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest number n\n    such that a set G of n elements with a binary operation can fail\n    to be a group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the smallest number n such that there exists a set G of n elements and a binary operation · for which (G, ·) is not a group, we will analyze the smallest possible values of n.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Definition of a Group ---\")\n    print(\"A group (G, ·) is a set G with a binary operation '·' that satisfies four properties:\")\n    print(\"1.
