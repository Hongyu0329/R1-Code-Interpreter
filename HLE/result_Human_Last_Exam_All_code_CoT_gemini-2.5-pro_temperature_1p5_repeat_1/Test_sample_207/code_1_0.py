    The provided C code produces unstable output because of how the `printf` function is called. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue and the fix:

    1.  In `main`, an `unsigned long long` variable `n` is declared.
    2.  The `process` function is called with the address of `n`. It writes the byte values 37 and 100 into the first two bytes of `n`. In ASCII, 37 is the '%' character and 100 is the 'd' character. Since the next byte in `n` is zero, this effectively creates the string "%d" at the memory location of `n`.
    3.  The `print` function is then called, also with the address of `n`. The pointer `s` now holds this address and points to the string "%d".
    4.  The line `printf(s, s);` becomes `printf("%d", s);`. This instructs `printf` to print the value of the pointer `s` (which is the memory address of `n`) as a decimal integer. Due to modern operating system security features like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), this address changes on each execution, causing the unstable output.

    The fix is to add a single character to the source code to prevent `printf` from interpreting an unstable value. The most elegant solution is to change the data so it's no longer a format string.

    By adding a single '+' character to the line `*p = 37;` in the `process` function, it becomes:

        *p = 3+7;

    This changes the C code's behavior significantly:
    - The value assigned to the first byte of `n` is no longer 37, but the result of the expression 3 + 7.
    - The string at `s` now starts with the character for ASCII value 10 (a newline, '\\n') instead of 37 ('%').
    - The `printf(s, s)` call now effectively becomes `printf("\\nd", s)`. Since this format string does not contain any format specifiers like '%d', `printf` simply prints the string literally and ignores the second argument.
    - The program's output becomes a newline character followed by 'd', which is completely stable.

    This solution is minimal (1 character added) and directly addresses the root cause. It also perfectly aligns with the prompt's hint to "output each number in the final equation".
