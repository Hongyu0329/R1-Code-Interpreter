    # Analysis results for each statement:
    # 1. D - Morrison Fm. position in foreland basin (foredeep vs. back-bulge) is debated.
    # 2. D - Cause of core complexes (slab window vs. other mechanisms) is debated.
    # 3. D - Existence/extent of the "Nevadaplano" plateau is debated.
    # 4. D - Existence/mechanism of the "Arizonaplano" plateau is debated.
    # 5. C - Spatial relationship between Sevier (outboard) and Laramide (inboard) structures is consensus.
    # 6. C - Origin of Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths from Cordilleran arc is consensus.
    # 7. C - Southwestward propagation of Yellowstone hotspot volcanism is consensus.
    # 8. D - Timing of Colorado Plateau uplift is a major, classic debate.
    # 9. D - Modern Cascade elevation is mostly young (Pliocene-Holocene), not Oligocene.
    # 10. D - Cause of Laramide flat slab (Shatsky conjugate) is a specific, debated hypothesis.
