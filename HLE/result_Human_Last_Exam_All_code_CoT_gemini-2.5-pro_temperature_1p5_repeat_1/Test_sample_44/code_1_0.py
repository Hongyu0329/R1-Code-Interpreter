    # Analysis of correctness:
    # 1. Architectural Style: This is a mainstream academic view. The large, circular
    #    tumulus design is widely understood to be inspired by Hellenistic (Eastern Greek)
    #    royal tombs, serving as a powerful statement of monarchical power.
    # 2. Res Gestae Inscription: This is a documented fact. In the epilogue of the Res
    #    Gestae itself, Augustus specifies that he wished for the text to be engraved
    #    on bronze pillars and set up at the entrance to his Mausoleum. This is direct
    #    primary source evidence.

    # Conclusion: Both parts of statement F are strongly supported by historical and
    # archaeological evidence, making it the most accurate choice.
