    Solves the user's puzzle about boolean statements on parenthesis strings.

    The method analyzes six statements comparing functions of length L(x) and depth D(x) for all parenthesis pairs x in a string.

    Let's denote the statements as S1 to S6.

    S1: sum(log L(x)) = O(sum(log D(x)))
    S2: sum(loglog L(x)) = O(sum(loglog D(x)))
    S3: sum(log^5 L(x)) = O(sum(log^5 D(x)))
    S4: sum(2^sqrt(log L(x))) = O(sum(2^sqrt(log D(x)))) (interpreted)
    S5: sum(L(x)^0.1) = O(sum(D(x)^0.11))
    S6: sum(sqrt[4]{L(x)}) = O(sum(sqrt{D(x)}))

    A common technique to find counterexamples for such "for all strings" statements is to test families of strings with extreme structures.
    1.  Nested strings: N_k = "((...()))" (k pairs). These have pairs with L proportional to D.
    2.  Wide strings: W_k = "(()()...())" (k inner "()" pairs). These feature a root pair with large L but small D.

    The key insight comes from the wide string family W_k for k -> infinity.
    For W_k = "(()()...())", there's one outer pair (x_root) and k inner pairs (y_i).
    - x_root: L = 2k+2, D = 2
    - y_i: L = 2, D = 1

    Assuming log is natural log (ln) and sums are over well-defined terms:
    - For S1, S3, S4: RHS sum (over D) is constant for W_k since ln(1)=0 and only one term ln(2) remains. The LHS sum grows with k. Thus, LHS is not O(1). So S1, S3, S4 are False.
    - For S2: The condition loglog(D) being defined (D>e) is not met for any pair in W_k, so RHS sum is 0. LHS has a term for x_root if k is large enough. So LHS is not O(1). False.
    - For S5, S6: The powers are well-defined. Both W_k and N_k families satisfy the O-notation. For W_k, both sums are Theta(k). For N_k, sum(L^p) is O(sum(D^q)) if p < q, which holds for S5 (0.1<0.11) and S6 (0.25<0.5). These are True.
