    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of the $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ molecule with the 6-31G** basis set, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Count the total number of electrons ($N_e$)**: We sum the electrons from each atom in the molecule ($\\mathrm{C, H, Si, F}$).\n2.  **Count the total number of basis functions/spatial orbitals ($N_{orb}$)**: We determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set and sum them up.\n3.  **Set the total spin ($S$)**: For a typical closed-shell molecule like $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$, the ground state is a singlet, so the total spin quantum number $S=0$.\n4.  **Calculate the number of CSFs**: We will use the Weyl-Robinson formula, which provides the number of CSFs for a given number of electrons, orbitals, and a specific spin state.\n\nThe formula for the number of singlet ($S=0$) CSFs is:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{N_{orb}+1} \\binom{N_{orb}+1}{N_e/2} \\binom{N_{orb}+1}{N_e/2 + 1}$\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_csf_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of CSFs for a full CI calculation of CH2SiHF\n    with the 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define molecule composition and count total electrons (Ne).\n    # The molecule is CH2SiHF, which has 1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens, 1 Silicon, and 1 Fluorine.\n    composition = {'C': 1, 'H': 3, 'Si': 1, 'F': 1}\n    electron_counts = {'H': 1, 'C': 6, 'Si': 14, 'F': 9}\n    \n    n_electrons = 0\n    for atom, count in composition.items():\n        n_electrons += count * electron_counts[atom]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of basis functions (orbitals) for the 6-31G** basis set.\n    # 6-31G** implies 6-31G(d,p): 'd' functions on heavy atoms, 'p' functions on Hydrogens.\n    # Using standard counts with Cartesian d-functions (6) and p-functions (3).\n    # H: 5 functions (1s split-valence, 1 set of p-functions)\n    # C, F (2nd row atoms): 15 functions (9 from 6-31G, 1 set of d-functions)\n    # Si (3rd row atom): 19 functions (13 from 6-31G, 1 set of d-functions)\n    basis_functions = {'H': 5, 'C': 15, 'F': 15, 'Si': 19}\n    \n    n_orbitals = 0\n    for atom, count in composition.items():\n        n_orbitals += count * basis_functions[atom]\n\n    # Step 3: Define the spin state.
