    "To answer this question, I will write a Python script that first outlines the logical steps to find the correct movie and then prints the name of that movie.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other is in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Second, I will search the chronological list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners to find films set in either of these locations.\n3.  No Best Picture winner appears to feature the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt. Therefore, the search focuses on the obelisk in Paris.\n4.  I will evaluate early Best Picture winners set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) and *Casablanca* (1943). A review of key scenes and montages in these films shows they feature other Parisian landmarks but not the Place de la Concorde.\n5.  The first Best Picture winner to clearly depict the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde is *An American in Paris*, which features the landmark in its famous final ballet sequence.\n\nThe script will now execute this plan and provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the first Best Picture winner\n    to feature a Luxor Obelisk and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks.\n    obelisk_location_1 = \"Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt\"\n    obelisk_location_2 = \"Place de la Concorde in Paris, France\"\n\n    # Step 2: Define the film and its winning year.\n    film_title = \"An American in Paris\"\n    award_year_for_film = 1951\n\n    # Step 3: Print the reasoning for the answer.\n    print(\"Finding the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1. There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in {obelisk_location_1} and one in {obelisk_location_2}.\")\n    print(\"2. The search of Best Picture winners reveals no films that depict the obelisk in Luxor, Egypt.\")\n    print(\"3. The search therefore focuses on the obelisk in Paris.\")\n    print(\"4. Early Best Picture winners set in Paris, like 'Casablanca' (1943), do not feature the Place de la Concorde.\")\n    print(f\"5. The film '{film_title}', which won Best Picture for the year {award_year_for_film}, prominently features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk in the famous final ballet sequence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was: {film_title}\")\n\nfind_first_best_picture_with_luxor_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
