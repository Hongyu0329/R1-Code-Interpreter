    # --- Analysis of Scenarios and Mapping to Parameter Groups ---

    # Variation (1): 'sul ponticello' (playing near the bridge)
    # Physical Effect: This bowing technique emphasizes high-frequency harmonics, creating a sharper, more brilliant sound.
    # Parameter Mapping: The parameter 'ν' (nu) in the term exp(-n/ν) controls the damping of higher harmonics (where 'n' is the harmonic index).
    # A brighter sound means higher harmonics are less damped, which corresponds to a larger value of 'ν'.
    # This variation primarily affects Group ii.
    variation_1_group = 'ii'

    # Variation (2): with a bridge mute
    # Physical Effect: A mute adds mass to the bridge. The bridge transmits the string's vibration to the violin body. Adding mass
    # lowers the natural resonant frequencies of a mechanical system.
    # Parameter Mapping: The group (a₁, f₁) represents the main body resonance. The mute will lower the frequency of this resonance, 'f₁'.
    # This variation primarily affects Group iii.
    variation_2_group = 'iii'

    # Variation (3): in a room filled with helium
    # Physical Effect: The air inside the violin's body is replaced by helium. The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times that in air.
    # The frequency of the air resonance (Helmholtz resonance) is directly proportional to the speed of sound in the gas.
    # Parameter Mapping: The group (μ, a₂, f₂) likely represents secondary resonances, with 'f₂' being the main air resonance. This frequency will increase significantly.
    # The wood resonance 'f₁' is unaffected.
    # This variation primarily affects Group iv.
    variation_3_group = 'iv'

    # Variation (4): on the E string (instead of the A string)
    # Physical Effect: Changing from the A string to the E string means using a string with a different fundamental frequency.
    # Parameter Mapping: The parameter 'F' is the fundamental frequency of the open string. This is a direct change of 'F'.
    # This variation primarily affects Group i.
    variation_4_group = 'i'

    # --- Determine Direction of Change for Variation (2) ---
    # The group for variation (2) is 'iii' (a₁, f₁). The last listed member is 'f₁'.
    # As explained, adding mass (the mute) to the bridge lowers the system's resonant frequency.
    # Therefore, f₁ goes 'down'.
    direction_for_2 = 'down'

    # --- Format and Print the Final Answer ---
    # The required format is a comma-separated string: group1,group2,group3,group4,direction
