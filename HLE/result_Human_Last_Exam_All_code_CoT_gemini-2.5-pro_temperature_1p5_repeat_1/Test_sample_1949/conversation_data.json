    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  First, I will create a list of the major rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate current-day length of each of these rivers.\n3.  I will then store this data in a Python dictionary, with the river names as keys and their lengths as values.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to sort these rivers by length in descending order and print the top three, which are the longest ones.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    It uses a predefined dictionary of rivers and their lengths, sorts them,\n    and prints the top three.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their modern lengths in kilometers.\n    # The list includes major rivers whose lengths are significant.\n    rivers_in_aeneid = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube (Ister)\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2704,\n        \"Rhine (Rhenus)\": 1233,\n        \"Eridanus (Po)\": 652,\n        \"Tiber\": 406,\n        \"Hebrus (Maritsa)\": 480\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary by river length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
