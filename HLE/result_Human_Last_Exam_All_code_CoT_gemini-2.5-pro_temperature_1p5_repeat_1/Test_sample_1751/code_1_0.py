    Explains which lipid will have a lower surface area in a monolayer

1.  **Analyze the Structures:**
    *   **C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0):** This lipid has two long, fully saturated hydrocarbon chains (an 18-carbon chain and a 16-carbon chain). Saturated chains are straight and flexible, allowing them to align parallel to each other very effectively.
    *   **C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0):** This lipid has one saturated 16-carbon chain and one 18-carbon chain that contains a trans double bond (d18:1). This double bond introduces a rigid kink into the hydrocarbon chain.

2.  **Relate Structure to Packing:**
    *   The straight, saturated chains of **C16-dihydroceramide** can pack together very tightly and efficiently. This allows for strong van der Waals interactions between the chains, leading to the "highly ordered domains" mentioned in the problem description.
    *   The kink in the chain of **C16-ceramide** disrupts this tight packing. The molecules cannot get as close to each other, resulting in more space between them. This leads to the "less ordered domains."

3.  **Connect Packing to Surface Area:**
    *   When molecules pack more tightly, each molecule occupies a smaller cross-sectional area.
    *   Conversely, when packing is less efficient, each molecule takes up more space.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Because C16-dihydroceramide molecules can pack more tightly than C16-ceramide molecules, they will occupy a smaller area per molecule.
    *   Therefore, when compressed in a monolayer, C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower total surface area.
