    This function analyzes the experimental setup to determine the correct control.

    1.  **Goal of the experiment:** To show that the binding of an anti-TN-MUC1 antibody is specifically inhibited by free N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).
    2.  **The potential problem (confounder):** The high concentration of the inhibitor (500 mM GalNAc) might have side effects on the cells. Specifically, it could cause stress that leads to the cells internalizing or shedding the MUC1 protein from their surface.
    3.  **The incorrect conclusion:** If MUC1 surface expression decreases due to the 500 mM GalNAc treatment, the observed decrease in antibody binding would be because the target is gone, not because of specific competition. The experiment's conclusion would be invalid.
    4.  **The necessary control:** We need to measure the total amount of MUC1 protein on the cell surface, independent of its glycosylation status, to ensure it doesn't change between the control and treated conditions. The MUC1 construct has a FLAG tag for this exact purpose.
    5.  **How the control works:** An anti-FLAG antibody binds to the FLAG tag on the protein. This binding is not affected by the sugars (TN antigen) or the free GalNAc inhibitor. Thus, the anti-FLAG signal is a direct measure of the amount of MUC1 on the surface.
    6.  **Correct experimental step:** The anti-FLAG antibody is a primary antibody. It should be added at the same time as the main experimental primary antibody (the anti-TN-MUC1 antibody).

    Conclusion: The anti-FLAG antibody is essential. It must be added with the primary antibodies to verify that the 500 mM GalNAc treatment has not altered the surface expression of the MUC1 protein. This matches option C.
    """
    
    explanation = """
    The conclusion of the experiment is that free GalNAc (at 500 mM) competitively inhibits the antibody's binding to the glycosylated MUC1 protein. This conclusion is only valid if the amount of MUC1 protein on the cell surface remains constant between the control (PBS) and the GalNAc-treated samples.

    A high concentration of a solute like 500 mM GalNAc can cause osmotic stress or other off-target effects on cells, potentially causing them to alter their surface protein levels.

    The FLAG tag provides a way to control for this. An anti-FLAG antibody binds to the MUC1 protein backbone, independent of its glycosylation. By using an anti-FLAG antibody, you can measure the total MUC1 surface expression. If the anti-FLAG signal is the same in both the control and GalNAc-treated cells, you can confidently attribute any decrease in the anti-TN-MUC1 antibody signal to competitive inhibition.

    As a primary antibody, the anti-FLAG antibody should be added during the primary antibody incubation step.

    Therefore, the correct choice is the one that identifies the right reason (verifying surface expression) and the right timing (with primary antibodies).
