    Forsythe's style is a deconstruction of classical ballet. While he was heavily
    influenced by Balanchine, his work breaks down and reconfigures classical steps
    rather than presenting them in their formal, complete state.

    A "pas de Balanchine" is a specific, textbook step. Given the deconstructed
    nature of the choreography, it is not expected to contain any formal, complete
    instances of this step.
