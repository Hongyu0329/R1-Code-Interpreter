    "My plan is to first identify the technical name for the function the user is asking about. The \"generalized pair correlation function\" in nuclear criticality describes the statistical correlation of neutron detection events in space and time. Its double Fourier transform, with respect to both space and time, is a fundamental quantity in the field of reactor noise analysis.\n\nAfter identifying the name, I will find a common mathematical expression for this function, typically derived from neutron diffusion theory. This will allow me to fulfill the user's request to provide code that outputs an equation.\n\nThe Python code I will write will:\n1.  Print the common name for this transformed function.\n2.  Display a representative mathematical formula for the function, which is often called the Power Spectral Density (PSD).\n3.  Explain each of the physical constants and variables used in the formula.\n4.  To satisfy the constraint of outputting \"each number in the final equation\", I will explicitly list the numerical exponents that appear in the formula.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_function_name_and_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name and a common formula for the space-time,\n    double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\n    in nuclear criticality.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function commonly called in the nuclear criticality community? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
