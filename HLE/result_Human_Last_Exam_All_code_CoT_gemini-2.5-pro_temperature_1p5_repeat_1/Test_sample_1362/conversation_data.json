    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2, we must first check which curves have *good reduction* for all primes p > 2.\n\nA hyperelliptic curve given by the equation `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at a prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. For a curve to have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`, the prime factors of its discriminant must not include any odd primes. In other words, the absolute value of the discriminant must be a power of 2.\n\nThe plan is to compute the discriminant for each polynomial `f(x)` from the given options and examine its prime factors. The one whose discriminant only has 2 as a prime factor is our answer. The condition of \"ordinary\" reduction is a further property, but checking for \"good reduction\" is sufficient to eliminate the incorrect options.\n\nI will use Python's `sympy` library to perform the discriminant calculation and prime factorization.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_curve_with_good_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of curves to find which one has good reduction for all primes p > 2.\n    This is determined by checking if the discriminant of the defining polynomial\n    f(x) in z^2 = f(x) has only 2 as a prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    curves = {\n        \"A\": \"x**5 + 3\",\n        \"B\": \"x**5 - 1\",\n        \"C\": \"x**6 - 1\",\n        \"D\": \"2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1\",\n        \"E\": \"4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing curves to find which has good reduction for all primes p > 2...\\n\")\n\n    correct_choice = None\n    final_equation = \"\"\n\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n\n    for label, f_str in curves.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing Curve {label} ---\")\n        full_equation = f\"z^2 = {f_str}\"\n        print(full_equation)\n        \n        # Create a sympy polynomial object\n        f_poly = sympy.Poly(sympy.sympify(f_str), x)\n        \n        # Calculate the discriminant\n        disc = sympy.discriminant(f_poly)\n        print(f\"  - Discriminant: {disc}\")\n        \n        # Find prime factors of the absolute value of the discriminant\n        if disc != 0:\n            factors = sympy.factorint(abs(disc))\n            odd_factors = [p for p in factors.keys() if p != 2]\n            print(f\"  - Prime factors of |Discriminant|: {list(factors.keys())}\")\n            \n            if not odd_factors:\n                print(\"  - Verdict: Good reduction for all primes p > 2.\")\n                correct_choice = label\n                # Let's rebuild the equation string to highlight the coefficients as requested.\n                # Example: 4*x**5 becomes 4*x**5. x**2 becomes 1*x**2\n                final_equation_terms = []\n                for term in sympy.Add.make_args(f_poly.as_expr()):\n                    coeff, monom = term.as_coeff_mul()\n                    if not monom: # a constant\n                         final_equation_terms.append(str(coeff))\n                    else:\n                        power_part = '*'.join([f\"{var}**{exp}\" for var, exp in monom[0].as_powers_dict().items()])\n                        final_equation_terms.append(f\"{coeff}*{power_part}\")\n                \n                final_equation = \"z^2 = \" + \" + \".join(final_equation_terms)\n\n            else:\n                print(f\"  - Verdict: Bad reduction at odd prime(s) {odd_factors}.
