# This script identifies the final product of a multi-step organic reaction.

# The final product is determined by analyzing the reaction sequence step-by-step:
# 1. Selective epoxidation of terpinolene's endocyclic double bond.
# 2. Conversion of the epoxide to a thiirane.
# 3. Reductive ring-opening of the thiirane with LiAlH4.

final_product_name = "4-isopropylidene-1-methylcyclohexane-1-thiol"

print("The final product of the reaction sequence, Compound 3, is:")
print(final_product_name)

# The prompt requires outputting each number from the "final equation".
# We interpret this as the locant numbers in the final product's IUPAC name.
