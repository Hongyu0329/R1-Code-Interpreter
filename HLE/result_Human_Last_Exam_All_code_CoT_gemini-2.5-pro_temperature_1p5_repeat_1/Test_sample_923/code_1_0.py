import json

# This script simulates the final output by printing the determined error message.
# The error analysis is as follows:
# 1. The GDScript code attempts to use a function `list(json_data)`.
# 2. GDScript (in Godot 4.x) does not have a built-in `list()` function for casting.
# 3. The Godot parser will not recognize `list` as a valid function, class, or variable.
# 4. This results in a parse error for an undeclared identifier.
# 5. The exact error message for this in the Godot 4.3 IDE is being printed below.

error_message = "The identifier \"list\" isn't declared in the current scope."
