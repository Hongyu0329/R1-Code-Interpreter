    print("\n1. Transitivity (A) and Similarity of Effect Modifiers (D):")
    print("   - Transitivity is the logical foundation: Can we indirectly compare A and C through B?")
    print("   - This requires that the trials being compared are similar in all important ways (effect modifiers).")
    print("   - This is NECESSARY, but NOT SUFFICIENT. Even if the network is theoretically sound, the statistical evidence from studies might still show significant disagreement (inconsistency) or variability (heterogeneity).")

    print("\n2. Consistency (B):")
    print("   - This is a statistical check: Does the direct evidence (from A vs. C trials) agree with the indirect evidence (from A vs. B + B vs. C trials)?")
    print("   - This is NECESSARY, but NOT SUFFICIENT. A network might be consistent by chance even if the transitivity assumption is clinically violated. Also, consistency does not speak to the quality of the individual studies.")
    
    print("\n3. Homogeneity (C):")
    print("   - This assumes that within a single comparison (e.g., A vs. B), all studies are estimating the exact same true effect.")
    print("   - This is often NOT NECESSARY, as random-effects NMAs are specifically designed to handle heterogeneity (lack of homogeneity). Therefore, it cannot be sufficient for validity.")
    
    print("\n4. Exchangeability of treatment contrasts (F):")
    print("   - This is a more formal statistical assumption, deeply linked to transitivity and consistency. It's a core modeling principle, not a standalone check that guarantees overall validity against all other issues like study bias.")
    print("   - Like the others, it is NECESSARY for the statistical model, but NOT SUFFICIENT to ensure the entire analysis is valid.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The validity of an NMA is a multi-faceted issue. It requires:")
    print("  - A sensible network structure (Transitivity)")
    print("  - Statistical agreement between evidence sources (Consistency)")
    print("  - Proper accounting for variability between studies (Heterogeneity)")
