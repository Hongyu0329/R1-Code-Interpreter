    "The user is asking to identify a set of crystal classes with three specific properties:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the crystal's point group must contain a mirror plane (m) or a roto-inversion axis (-1, -3, -4, -6).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique direction, meaning it lacks a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm. Our target classes must not be in this list.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The material can rotate the plane of polarized light. This property fundamentally requires a chiral structure.\n\nThere is a contradiction in the user's request: a crystal cannot be both achiral and optically active in the standard sense. However, the question is likely referring to a more subtle phenomenon. While achiral crystals cannot show optical activity in general directions, a specific subset of them can exhibit what is sometimes called gyrotropy (or optical activity in a \"wider sense\") for light traveling along specific crystallographic directions.\n\nThe criteria for this to occur are:\n*   The crystal must be **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion, -1). This allows for gyrotropy.\n*   The crystal must be **achiral** (as requested).\n*   The crystal must be **non-polar** (as requested).\n*   Symmetry must not force all components of the gyration tensor (`g_ij`) to be zero.\n\nLet's use a Python script to systematically filter the 32 crystal classes to find the ones that meet all these criteria.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Create a dictionary containing all 32 crystal classes and their key properties (chiral, polar, centrosymmetric).\n2.  Add information about whether the class allows gyrotropy. Based on advanced tensor analysis, the achiral non-centrosymmetric classes `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`, and `-6` forbid gyrotropy because their symmetry forces the gyration tensor to be zero.\n3.  Filter this list to find classes that are simultaneously:\n    *   Achiral (`chiral` is `False`)\n    *   Non-polar (`polar` is `False`)\n    *   Allow gyrotropy (`allows_gyrotropy` is `True`)\n4.  Print the resulting list of crystal classes.\n5.  Evaluate the given multiple-choice options against this generated list.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity (gyrotropy).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 32 crystal classes (point groups) with their properties.\n    # The 'allows_gyrotropy' property for achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes is based on\n    # tensor symmetry rules.
