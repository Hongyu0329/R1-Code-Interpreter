    "To determine the number of regions created by the folds of a standard origami crane, we can model the unfolded paper and its creases as a planar graph. The number of regions (faces) in this graph can then be calculated using Euler's formula for planar graphs.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Crease Pattern**: I will define the standard origami crane crease pattern as a set of line segments on a unit square. This pattern, often called the \"petal fold base,\" consists of 12 primary creases. I will also include the 4 boundary edges of the paper.\n2.  **Identify Vertices (V)**: The vertices of our graph are the points where crease lines intersect each other or the paper's edges. This includes the paper's corners, crease endpoints, and all intersection points. I will write code to find all these points systematically.\n3.  **Identify Edges (E)**: An edge is a segment of a crease line that runs between two vertices. I will programmatically segment each crease line by the vertices that lie upon it to get a complete count of all edges.\n4.  **Calculate Regions (F)**: Using Euler's formula for a connected planar graph, `V - E + F = 1`, we can find the number of regions (faces) with the formula `F = E - V + 1`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for precise geometric calculations. It will compute the number of vertices and edges, then use them to find the final number of regions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef solve_crane_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of regions in a standard origami crane crease pattern\n    using Euler's formula for planar graphs (F = E - V + 1).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use a small tolerance for floating point comparisons, though Fraction-based\n    # points should be exact.\n    EPS = 1e-9\n\n    def get_canonical_point(p):\n        \"\"\"Return a hashable representation of a SymPy Point2D.\"\"\"\n        return (p.x, p.y)\n\n    # 1.
