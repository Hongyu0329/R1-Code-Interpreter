# Based on the analysis, the equation for the radius R of the sphere of valid initial conditions is:
# R^2 = 0.5 * (e^T + 1) * e^T
# We are given T = ln(10^34), so e^T = 10^34.

# Step 1: Define the value of e^T
eT = 10.0**34

# Step 2: Identify the numerical values in the final equation for R^2
# The equation is R^2 = factor1 * factor2 * factor3
factor1 = 0.5
factor2 = eT + 1
factor3 = eT

print("The final equation is R^2 = factor1 * factor2 * factor3")
print("The values of the numbers in this equation are:")
print(f"factor1 = {factor1}")
# We print factor2 and factor3 in scientific notation for readability
print(f"factor2 = e^T + 1 = {factor2:.1e}")
print(f"factor3 = e^T = {factor3:.1e}")

# Step 3: Calculate R^2 and then R
# Python's integers have arbitrary precision, so calculating R^2 is exact.
# math.sqrt will then convert it to a standard float.
R_squared = factor1 * factor2 * factor3
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

print("\nThe final result for R is:")
