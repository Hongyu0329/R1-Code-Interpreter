    # --- Analysis of the `generate_chemistry` function ---
    # The function is called separately for the 'control' group and the 'water_stress' group.
    
    # 1. A single call to `generate_chemistry` does the following:
    #    a. Generates `n_specimens` with random peak data.
    #    b. Creates a *single* random `baseline` vector. This baseline is the same for the entire duration of the function call.
    #    c. Subtracts this *same* `baseline` vector from *every* specimen generated in that call.

    # --- Control Group Analysis ---
    # The `controls` object is created with a single call: `generate_chemistry(360, 340, 'control')`.
    # Because all 360 control specimens have the same baseline subtracted, they are all variations
    # of a single chemical profile. They are designed to form a single cluster.
    expected_chemotypes_control = 1

    # --- Water-Stressed Group Analysis ---
    # The `water_stress` object is created with a second, separate call: `generate_chemistry(510, 340, 'water_stress')`.
    # During this call, a new, single baseline is generated and subtracted from all 510 specimens.
    # As with the control group, all specimens within this group are treated uniformly and are
    # variations of a single profile.
    expected_chemotypes_water_stress = 1
    
    # --- Conclusion ---
    # The question asks how many chemotypes to expect in the control group and the water-stressed group, respectively.
    # Based on the simulation's design, each group represents a single chemotype.
