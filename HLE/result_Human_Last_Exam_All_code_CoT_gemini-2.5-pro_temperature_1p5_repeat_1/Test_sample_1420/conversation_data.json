    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters**: We are given the spatial dimension `d=3`. In renormalization group theory, for models like the Ising or Heisenberg models (part of the general O(N) universality class), the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4. This is the dimension above which mean-field theory becomes exact.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ)**: The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method that uses the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d` as a small expansion parameter. We will calculate its value.\n3.  **Use the Epsilon Expansion Formula**: The critical exponents can be expressed as a power series in `ϵ`. For the specific heat exponent α in the O(N) model, the formula to the first order in `ϵ` is:\n    `α = (4 - N) / (2 * (N + 8)) * ϵ`\n    Here, `N` is the number of components of the order parameter. We will use the canonical Ising model as our example, for which `N=1`.\n4.  **Calculate α**: We will substitute the values of `N` and `ϵ` into the formula to find the value of `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: The Python script will perform these calculations and print out each step of the process, including the final equation with all the numbers substituted in.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α) using the\n    first-order epsilon expansion in renormalization group theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
