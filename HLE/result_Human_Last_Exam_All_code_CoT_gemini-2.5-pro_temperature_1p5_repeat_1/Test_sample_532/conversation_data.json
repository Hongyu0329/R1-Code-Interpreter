    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically in group theory. The solution relies on a known classification theorem. I will first explain the concepts involved and then state the theorem. The Python code will serve to clearly present this classification.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the key terms:** I will start by defining a \"product-free set,\" a \"maximal product-free set,\" and a \"filled group\" to ensure the context is clear. I will also briefly define a \"nilpotent group.\"\n2.  **State the classification theorem:** The core of the answer is a theorem from group theory that precisely characterizes finite filled nilpotent groups. This theorem states that such a group is defined by the existence of certain types of quotient groups.\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically states this theorem and lists the specific groups involved in the classification. This will satisfy the request for code and clearly present the numbers involved (2, 3, and 8) from the names of the classifying groups (`C2 x C2`, `C3 x C3`, `D8`).\n\n```python\ndef filled_nilpotent_group_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and presents the classification of finite filled nilpotent groups based on a known theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- The Classification of Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\")\n    print(\"1.
