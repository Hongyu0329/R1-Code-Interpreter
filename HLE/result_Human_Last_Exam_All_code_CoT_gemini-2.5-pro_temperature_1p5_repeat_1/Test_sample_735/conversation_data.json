    "This is an interesting problem from abstract algebra. Finding all finite groups that have a maximal product-free set of size 3 requires a classification theorem from group theory, as a brute-force search is not feasible.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, I'll clarify the definitions of a \"product-free set\" and a \"maximal by inclusion\" set within a group.\n2.  This classification problem was solved by G. L. Walls in a 2007 paper. I will present the list of groups from that paper.\n3.  The Python code below will list these groups and print the final count, as requested.\n\nA **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset of `G` where for any two elements `a` and `b` in `S` (including `a=b`), their product `a*b` is not in `S`.\n\nSuch a set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing the product-free property. That is, for any element `g` in `G` but not in `S`, the new set `S âˆª {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\nThe code below will present the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of finite groups containing maximal by\n    inclusion product-free sets of size 3, based on a known classification theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a 'maximal by inclusion product-free set' of size 3.\")\n    print(\"This is a known classification problem in group theory, solved by G.
