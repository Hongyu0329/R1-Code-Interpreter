    """
    Calculates the minimum cost for computing 2A - 3B on a twisted Edwards curve.

    The cost is measured in the number of field multiplications (M), assuming
    squaring has the same cost (S=M). Points A and B are initially in affine
    coordinates, and the result is in extended coordinates.

    The strategy used is 2A - 3B = 2(A-B) - B.
