    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus, we will use a fundamental result from Morse theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the relevant mathematical theory:** The number of critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold is related to the manifold's topological properties, specifically its Betti numbers.\n2.  **State the Morse inequalities:** A key result states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold $M$, the total number of critical points is at least the sum of its Betti numbers, $\\sum_k b_k(M)$.\n3.  **Provide the Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of one-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of two-dimensional \"voids\" or \"cavities\".\n4.  **Calculate the sum:** Sum the Betti numbers to find the lower bound on the number of critical points.\n5.  **Confirm the bound is sharp:** Note that this lower bound is indeed the minimum because a function can be constructed on the torus with exactly this number of critical points (e.g., $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$ on the flat torus $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$).\n6.  **Write a Python script:** The script will perform the calculation and print the explanation along with the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThis problem can be solved using a result from Morse theory, which connects the topology of a manifold to the properties of smooth functions defined on it.\n\nA fundamental theorem in this area states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold, the total number of critical points must be greater than or equal to the sum of its Betti numbers. Betti numbers are topological invariants that, roughly speaking, count the number of 'holes' of different dimensions in a space.\n\nFor the 2-torus (T^2), the Betti numbers are:\n- b_0 = 1 (the torus is one connected piece)\n- b_1 = 2 (the torus has two independent loops, one 'around' the donut and one 'through' the hole)\n- b_2 = 1 (the torus encloses one 2D 'void')\n\nThe minimal number of critical points is therefore the sum of these Betti numbers. This bound is known to be sharp, as there exist functions on the torus that have exactly this many critical points.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\n    # Betti numbers for the 2-torus\n    b_0 = 1\n    b_1 = 2\n    b_2 = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the minimal number of critical points by summing the Betti numbers\n    min_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    \n    # Output the final calculation as an equation\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Number of Critical Points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = {b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_points}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
