# The user wants to identify the source of Dilp2 that drives neural stem cell reactivation
# based on the provided biological text.

# Step 1: Analyze the key experimental results.

# Experiment 1: Overexpressing Imp-L2 (a Dilp2-binding protein) in the fat body.
# This "soaks up" Dilp2 in the hemolymph.
# Result 1: Neural stem cells FAIL to reactivate.
# Conclusion 1: Dilp2 from the hemolymph is NECESSARY for reactivation. If it's removed from the blood, reactivation stops.

# Experiment 2: Inhibiting DRN (Dorsal Raphe Neurons) activity.
# Dilp2 is transported from IPCs to DRNs.
# Result 2: Neural stem cell reactivation is DELAYED.
# Conclusion 2: The DRN pathway is involved in the TIMING of reactivation, but is not the primary trigger. A delay is not a complete failure, unlike in Experiment 1.

# Step 2: Compare the conclusions.
# The evidence from Experiment 1 is stronger for identifying the direct source. Removing hemolymph Dilp2 prevents reactivation entirely.
# The evidence from Experiment 2 suggests the DRN pathway is modulatory rather than the primary source.

# Step 3: Formulate the final answer.
# The source of Dilp2 that drives reactivation is the one secreted into the hemolymph.

print("Based on the evidence, the correct answer is B.")
print("The crucial evidence is that sequestering Dilp2 specifically in the hemolymph (using Imp-L2 expression in the fat body) is sufficient to prevent neural stem cell reactivation.")
print("This indicates that the systemic pool of Dilp2, secreted into the hemolymph, is the essential source that reaches and activates the neural stem cells.")
