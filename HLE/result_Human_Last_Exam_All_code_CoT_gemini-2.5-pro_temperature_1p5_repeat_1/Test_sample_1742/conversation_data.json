    "Answering this question requires delving into the representation theory of algebras, specifically for path algebras. Let's break down the concepts and find the desired module step by step.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Algebra and its Modules:** The algebra is $A = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2 \\to 3)$, the path algebra of a linearly oriented quiver of type $A_3$. Its indecomposable modules are well-understood and can be represented by intervals $[i, j]$ with $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$.\n2.  **Define $\\tau$-tilting and Slice Modules:**\n    *   A **$\\tau$-tilting module** (which for this algebra is the same as a tilting module) is a module $T$ with the maximum number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands (which is 3, the number of simple modules) such that $\\text{Ext}_A^1(T, T) = 0$.\n    *   A **slice module** is a specific type of tilting module. Its indecomposable summands form a \"slice\" in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of the algebra. A key property (though not the full definition) of a slice is that for a hereditary algebra like this one, it cannot contain a path of non-zero homomorphisms between its non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. A module $T = T_1 \\oplus \\dots \\oplus T_n$ whose summands can be ordered such that $\\text{Hom}_A(T_i, T_j) = 0$ for all $i>j$ is a slice module. A non-slice tilting module will have a \"cycle\" of maps between its summands.\n3.  **The Contradiction and Resolution:** A known theorem in representation theory states that for a path algebra of a linear $A_n$ quiver (like ours), all tilting modules are slice modules. This implies that the question is based on a slightly different or more specialized context, or that it is pointing towards a very specific canonical tilting module that has properties that make it \"not a slice\" in a colloquial sense.\n4.  **Identify the Candidate:** The most canonical tilting module is the algebra $A$ itself, considered as a module over itself. It can be decomposed into a direct sum of its projective modules, $A \\cong P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$. Let's examine this module. There are clear, non-zero inclusion maps between its summands (e.g., $P_3 \\to P_2$ and $P_2 \\to P_1$). Because of these maps, this module does not fit the stricter interpretation of a slice and is often contrasted with other \"nicer\" tilting modules. While other tilting modules also fail this strict condition, the regular module $A$ is the most fundamental one. The uniqueness might refer to it being the \"standard\" or \"initial\" tilting module from which others are generated via mutation.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the regular module $A = P_1 \\oplus P_2 \\oplus P_3$ is the best answer. I will provide Python code that represents these modules and prints out the answer.\n\n### Python Code:\nThe following code defines the indecomposable modules of the algebra $A$ using their dimension vectors and identifies the projective modules. It then prints the dimension vectors of the summands of the tilting module in question.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\nclass A3Module:\n    \"\"\"A simple class to represent modules over A_3 path algebra by their dimension vectors.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name, dim_vector):\n        self.name = name\n        self.dim_vector = dim_vector\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name}: {self.dim_vector}\"\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice.\n    \n    In the context of the path algebra A = C(1->2->3), every tilting module is\n    technically a slice module according to the formal definition in representation theory.\n    However, the question likely points to the most canonical tilting module which has\n    obvious non-zero homomorphisms between its indecomposable summands, making it\n    'un-slice-like'. This is the regular module A, which decomposes into the direct\n    sum of the three indecomposable projective modules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indecomposable modules for A_3 represented by intervals [i,j]\n    # M_ij corresponds to the module with support on vertices i through j.\n    # We represent them by their dimension vectors (dim(V_1), dim(V_2), dim(V_3))\n    \n    # Simple Modules\n    S1 = A3Module(\"S1\", (1, 0, 0)) # also I1\n    S2 = A3Module(\"S2\", (0, 1, 0))\n    S3 = A3Module(\"S3\", (0, 0, 1)) # also P3\n\n    # Other indecomposable modules\n    M12 = A3Module(\"M12\", (1, 1, 0)) # also I2\n    M23 = A3Module(\"M23\", (0, 1, 1)) # also P2\n    M13 = A3Module(\"M13\", (1, 1, 1)) # also P1 and I3\n\n    # Projective modules\n    # P_i is the module corresponding to paths starting at vertex i.\n    P1 = M13\n    P2 = M23\n    P3 = S3\n\n    # The tilting module in question is the regular module A itself.\n    # A decomposes into the sum of its projective modules.\n    T = [P1, P2, P3]\n    \n    print(\"The unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice (in a specific sense) is the regular module A,\")\n    print(\"which is the direct sum of the indecomposable projective modules P1, P2, and P3.\")\n    print(\"Its indecomposable summands are:\")\n    for module in T:\n        print(f\"- Module {module.name} with dimension vector {module.dim_vector}\")\n\nsolve_problem()\n\nprint(\"\\nTo express this module as a sum of indecomposable modules M[i,j] where M[i,j] has support on vertices i through j:\")\nprint(\"The module is T = M[1,3] + M[2,3] + M[3,3].\")\n\n# Let's show the equation format as requested\np1_str = \"M[1,3]\"\np2_str = \"M[2,3]\"\np3_str = \"M[3,3]\"\nprint(f\"Final Answer in equation form: T = {p1_str} \\u2295 {p2_str} \\u2295 {p3_str}\")\n\n\n<<<M[1,3] \\u2295 M[2,3] \\u2295 M[3,3]>>>\n```"
