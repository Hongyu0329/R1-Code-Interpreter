    "To find the optimal moves for 'O' to win as fast as possible, we will analyze the game state by considering moves that lead to a victory in the minimum number of turns.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Board**: First, we'll represent the given Connect 4 board state in a 2D array (a list of lists in Python) to make it easy to work with. The board is a 6x7 grid.\n2.  **Check for Immediate Wins (Win in 1 turn)**: The fastest way to win is on the very next move. We will examine each valid move for player 'O'. For each potential move, we'll check if placing an 'O' in that column results in forming a line of four 'O's (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If such a move exists, it is an optimal move.\n3.  **Check for Forced Wins (Win in 2 turns)**: If no immediate win is found, we'll look for a move that guarantees a win on 'O's following turn. This typically involves creating a \"double threat\" â€“ a situation where 'O' forms two separate lines of three, both of which could be completed to four on the next turn. The opponent, 'X', can only block one of these threats, allowing 'O' to win by completing the other.\n4.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   Iterate through each valid move for 'O'. Let's call a candidate move `M1`.\n    *   For each `M1`, temporarily update the board.\n    *   Then, consider all possible counter-moves by 'X'.\n    *   For each of 'X's counter-moves, check if 'O' now has a winning move.\n    *   If 'O' has a winning move available regardless of which counter-move 'X' makes, then the initial move `M1` is a forced win and thus an optimal move.\n5.  **Output**: Collect all such optimal moves and format them as requested (e.g., f4).\n\nApplying this plan to the board:\n*   There are no immediate one-move wins for 'O'.\n*   By analyzing the possible moves, we find that placing a piece in column 'f' creates a horizontal line of three 'O's at `d4`, `e4`, and `f4`. This creates a double threat, as 'O' can win on the next turn by playing in either column 'c' (to make `c4,d4,e4,f4`) or column 'g' (to make `d4,e4,f4,g4`). Since 'X' can only block one of these two spots, 'O' is guaranteed to win. No other move creates such an unblockable threat.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find all such optimal moves.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the optimal moves for 'O' in the given Connect 4 game state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board representation: 6 rows, 7 columns\n    # 0,0 is top-left\n    # Rows 0-5 correspond to board rows 1-6\n    # Cols 0-6 correspond to board columns a-g\n    board = [\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n        ['.', '.', '.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n        ['O', '.', 'X', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n        ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X', 'X', 'O', 'X']\n    ]\n    rows = 6\n    cols = 7\n    player = 'O'\n    opponent = 'X'\n\n    def get_valid_moves(current_board):\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of columns that are not full.\"\"\"\n        return [c for c in range(cols) if current_board[0][c] == '.']\n\n    def get_next_open_row(current_board, col):\n        \"\"\"Returns the row an object would fall to in a given column.\"\"\"\n        for r in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):\n            if current_board[r][col] == '.':\n                return r\n        return -1\n\n    def check_win(current_board, p):\n        \"\"\"Checks if player p has won.\"\"\"\n        # Check horizontal\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r][c + i] == p for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check vertical\n        for c in range(cols):\n            for r in range(rows - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r + i][c] == p for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal \\\n        for r in range(rows - 3):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r + i][c + i] == p for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        # Check diagonal /\n        for r in range(3, rows):\n            for c in range(cols - 3):\n                if all(current_board[r - i][c + i] == p for i in range(4)):\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    def col_to_char(c):\n        return chr(ord('a') + c)\n        \n    def row_to_char(r):\n        return str(r + 1)\n\n    # --- Main Logic ---\n\n    # Level 1: Find any win in 1 move.\n    win_in_1_moves = []\n    for move_col in get_valid_moves(board):\n        temp_board = copy.deepcopy(board)\n        row = get_next_open_row(temp_board, move_col)\n        temp_board[row][move_col] = player\n        if check_win(temp_board, player):\n            win_in_1_moves.append(f\"{col_to_char(move_col)}{row_to_char(row)}\")\n    \n    if win_in_1_moves:\n        print(', '.join(sorted(win_in_1_moves)))\n        return\n\n    # Level 2: Find any win in 2 moves (forced win).\n    win_in_2_moves = []\n    for move_col in get_valid_moves(board):\n        board_after_O1 = copy.deepcopy(board)\n        row1 = get_next_open_row(board_after_O1, move_col)\n        board_after_O1[row1][move_col] = player\n\n        is_forced_win = True\n        opponent_moves = get_valid_moves(board_after_O1)\n        \n        # If board is full after O's move, it's a draw, not a win.\n        if not opponent_moves:\n            is_forced_win = False\n            \n        for opp_move_col in opponent_moves:\n            board_after_X = copy.deepcopy(board_after_O1)\n            row_x = get_next_open_row(board_after_X, opp_move_col)\n            board_after_X[row_x][opp_move_col] = opponent\n\n            can_O_win_now = False\n            for move2_col in get_valid_moves(board_after_X):\n                board_after_O2 = copy.deepcopy(board_after_X)\n                row2 = get_next_open_row(board_after_O2, move2_col)\n                board_after_O2[row2][move2_col] = player\n                if check_win(board_after_O2, player):\n                    can_O_win_now = True\n                    break\n            \n            if not can_O_win_now:\n                is_forced_win = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_forced_win:\n            win_in_2_moves.append(f\"{col_to_char(move_col)}{row_to_char(row1)}\")\n\n    if win_in_2_moves:\n        print(', '.join(sorted(win_in_2_moves)))\n    else:\n        # Fallback if no quick wins are found\n        print(\"No optimal winning moves found in 1 or 2 turns.\")\n\n\nsolve_connect4()\n```\n<<<f4>>>"
