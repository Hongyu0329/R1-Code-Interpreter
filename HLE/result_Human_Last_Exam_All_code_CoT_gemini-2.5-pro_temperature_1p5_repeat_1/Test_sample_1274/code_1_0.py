# The user wants the final answer in a specific format.
# No code execution is needed to determine the answers to these theoretical questions.
# The thinking process above leads to the following conclusions:
# (a) Yes. The conjugacy closure of a rational subset in a free group is rational, and rational subsets are context-free.
# (b) Yes. The set of geodesics of a context-free subset of a free group is the intersection of a CFL and a regular language, which is a CFL.
# (c) No. The property of a subset's geodesic language being context-free is not invariant under a change of basis for the free group. A counterexample can be constructed.

# The user requests the answer in the format: (a) [Yes/No]; (b) [Yes/No]; (c) [Yes/No].
# Followed by <<<answer content>>>. The content should be just the response string.
