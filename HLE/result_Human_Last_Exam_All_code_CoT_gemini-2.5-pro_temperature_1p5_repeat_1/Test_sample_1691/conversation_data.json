    "For a small positive $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is dominated by the region where the denominator is smallest. The function $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is non-negative on the interval of integration and is zero only at $x=0$. Therefore, the integrand is largest near $x=0$.\n\nThis allows us to approximate the integral by considering the behavior of $f(x)$ for small $x$. The leading term of $f(x)$ as $x \\to 0$ is $9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Approximate the denominator by its dominant behavior near the singularity: $\\epsilon + f(x) \\approx \\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n2.  Approximate the integral by $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}} dx$.\n3.  Extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$. This simplification is justified because the contribution from the tail of the integral is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$.\n4.  The approximate integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}} dx$.\n5.  Evaluate this integral. We can use the substitution $u^5 = \\frac{9.0 x^5}{\\epsilon}$ to transform it into a standard form. The general result for an integral of this type, $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon+ax^n}$, is $\\frac{\\pi}{n a^{1/n} \\sin(\\pi/n)} \\epsilon^{-(n-1)/n}$.\n6.  Use Python to calculate the numerical constants in this formula. The final result will be an analytical approximation of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the resulting formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function develops and prints an analytical formula that approximates\n    the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx.\n    # For small x, the denominator is dominated by epsilon + a*x^n.\n    a = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n    \n    # The general approximation for small epsilon is I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon^p, where\n    # p = -(n-1)/n\n    # C = pi / (n * a^(1/n) * sin(pi/n))\n    \n    # Calculate the power p\n    p = -(n - 1.0) / n\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient C\n    C = np.pi / (n * np.power(a, 1.0/n) * np.sin(np.pi/n))\n    \n    print(\"For small epsilon, the integral I(epsilon) can be approximated by the formula:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) ≈ C * ε^p\\n\")\n    print(\"This approximation is derived by considering the dominant term in the denominator near x=0, which is 9.0 * x^5.0.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The power 'p' is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"p = -(n - 1) / n = -({n:.1f} - 1.0) / {n:.1f} = {p:.1f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe coefficient 'C' is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"C = π / (n * a^(1/n) * sin(π/n))\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the values n=5.0 and a=9.0:\")\n    print(f\"C = π / ({n:.1f} * {a:.1f}^(1/{n:.1f}) * sin(π/{n:.1f}))\")\n    print(f\"C ≈ {np.pi:.6f} / ({n:.1f} * {np.power(a, 1.0/n):.6f} * {np.sin(np.pi/n):.6f})\")\n    print(f\"C ≈ {C:.6f}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Therefore, the final analytical approximation is:\")\n    # Using 'ε' for epsilon for better readability\n    print(f\"I(ε) ≈ {C:.6f} * ε^({p:.1f})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<0.688841>>>"
