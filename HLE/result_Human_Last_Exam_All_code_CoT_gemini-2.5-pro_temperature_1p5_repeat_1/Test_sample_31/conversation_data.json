    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of sticker observations required to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL cases is present. This is a problem of information: we need to gather enough data to distinguish between all possible permutations of the last layer's edges and corners.\n\n### My plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the pieces:** The last layer has 8 pieces to permute: 4 corners and 4 edges. The non-top-facing stickers are the ones on the side faces of this layer. There are 4 edge stickers and 8 corner stickers (2 per corner), for a total of 12 side stickers.\n2.  **Information required:** To identify the permutation, we need to know where each piece moves. This means we need to identify the edge permutation (`Pe`) and the corner permutation (`Pc`).\n3.  **Use a crucial shortcut (Parity):** On a Rubik's Cube, any legal permutation of pieces has a special property: the parity of the corner permutation must match the parity of the edge permutation. An even number of swaps among corners implies an even number of swaps among edges, and an odd number of swaps among corners implies an odd number of swaps among edges. This rule gives us information without needing to look at more stickers.\n4.  **Devise a minimal observation strategy:** I'll determine the minimum number of stickers needed to find the edge permutation, then the minimum number needed to find the corner permutation, making use of the parity rule to save us from observing extra stickers.\n5.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of stickers will be the sum of stickers needed for each step of the strategy. I will create a Python script to explain this logic and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the Edge Permutation (Pe)\n    # The last layer has 4 edge pieces.

Corner 3 is in position 4, and corner 4 is in position 3 (a swap).\n    #\n    # These two possibilities for the full corner permutation have opposite parity.\n    # Crucially, the parity of the corner permutation MUST match the parity of the\n    # edge permutation, which we already determined in Step 1.\n    # Therefore, we can deduce which of the two possibilities is the correct one\n    # without looking at any more stickers.\n    stickers_for_remaining_corners = 0\n    print(f\"Stickers for the remaining two corners (using parity rule): {stickers_for_remaining_corners}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total minimum number of stickers.\n    total_stickers = stickers_for_edges + stickers_for_corner_1 + stickers_for_corner_2 + stickers_for_remaining_corners\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Stickers = {stickers_for_edges} (edges) + {stickers_for_corner_1} (corner 1) + {stickers_for_corner_2} (corner 2) + {stickers_for_remaining_corners} (parity) = {total_stickers}\")\n\nsolve_pll_sticker_puzzle()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
