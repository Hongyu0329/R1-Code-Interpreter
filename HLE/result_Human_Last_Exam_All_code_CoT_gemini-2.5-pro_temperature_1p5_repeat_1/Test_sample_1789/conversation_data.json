    "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of the largest possible set that is a union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of `N = 823564528378596`.\n\n### My thinking process:\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure:** The problem deals with a partially ordered set (poset) where the elements are the divisors of `N`, and the order is defined by divisibility.\n2.  **Antichains and Ranks:** An antichain is a set of divisors where no element divides another. A natural way to form antichains is to group divisors by their \"rank\". The rank of a divisor `d`, denoted `Ω(d)`, is the number of its prime factors, counted with multiplicity. For example, `Ω(12) = Ω(2^2 * 3^1) = 2 + 1 = 3`. All divisors with the same rank form an antichain.\n3.  **Partitioning the Poset:** The entire set of divisors of `N` can be partitioned into disjoint antichains based on their rank. The possible ranks range from `Ω(1) = 0` to `Ω(N)`. The total number of such antichains is `Ω(N) + 1`.\n4.  **The k-Sperner Property:** A crucial result by Erdős and Sperner states that for the divisor poset, the largest union of `k` antichains is achieved by taking the union of the `k` largest rank levels.\n5.  **Develop a Strategy:**\n    *   First, I will find the prime factorization of `N = 823564528378596`.\n    *   From the factorization `N = p₁ᵃ¹ * p₂ᵃ² * ...`, I will calculate `Ω(N) = a₁ + a₂ + ...`.\n    *   The total number of rank levels (which partition the entire set of divisors) is `Ω(N) + 1`.\n    *   The problem allows us to take a union of `k = 20` antichains.\n    *   If `k` is greater than or equal to the total number of rank levels, we can simply take all the rank levels. Their union is the entire set of divisors of `N`.\n    *   If this condition holds, the answer is the total number of divisors of `N`, which is calculated as `τ(N) = (a₁ + 1) * (a₂ + 1) * ...`.\n6.  **Execution:**\n    *   Factoring `N` yields: `2² * 3² * 7¹ * 11¹ * 13¹ * 17¹ * 19¹ * 23¹ * 29¹ * 31¹ * 37¹ * 41¹ * 43¹ * 47¹`.\n    *   `Ω(N) = 2 + 2 + 1*12 = 16`.\n    *   The total number of rank levels is `16 + 1 = 17`.\n    *   Since we can use `k=20` antichains and there are only 17 rank levels, `20 > 17`. We can cover all divisors.\n    *   The size of the union is the total number of divisors: `τ(N) = (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)¹² = 3 * 3 * 2¹² = 9 * 4096 = 36864`.\n\nThe following Python code will automate this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factorization of a number.\n    Returns a dictionary of {prime: exponent}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    # Handle factor 2\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1\n        num //= 2\n    # Handle odd factors\n    d = 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the remaining number\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(num))\n    while d <= limit:\n        while (num % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            num //= d\n            # Update the limit as num gets smaller\n            limit = int(math.sqrt(num))\n        d += 2\n    # If there's a number left, it's a prime factor\n    if num > 1:\n       factors[num] = factors.get(num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of k antichains in the divisor poset of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 823564528378596\n    k = 20\n\n    # 1.
