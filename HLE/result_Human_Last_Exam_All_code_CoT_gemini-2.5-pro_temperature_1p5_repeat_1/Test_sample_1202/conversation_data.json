    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to identify the most probable molecular mechanism responsible for two outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n    *   **Retention:** The new gene copy is kept in the genome over evolutionary time, rather than being deleted or silenced.\n    *   **Divergence:** The new gene copy changes in its DNA sequence and, consequently, its function, becoming distinct from the original gene.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. This process works *against* divergence, so it's not the correct mechanism.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene, where one copy accumulates mutations and becomes non-functional. While this involves divergence, it represents a *failure* of retention for a functional gene, so it's not the mechanism we're looking for.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy retains the original function, while the other acquires mutations that give it a new, beneficial function. This successfully explains both retention (both copies are now useful for different reasons) and divergence (the second copy changes to gain a new function). This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the original ancestral gene had multiple functions (or complex regulation). After duplication, each copy loses complementary sub-functions through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to perform the full set of original functions. This also successfully explains both retention and divergence. This is another strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This describes the rapid evolution of multiple species from a single ancestor to fill different ecological niches. It's a macroevolutionary pattern, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.\n\n3.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization):** The choice is between C and D. To determine which is \"most likely,\" we must consider the probability of the events required for each mechanism.\n    *   A newly duplicated gene is initially redundant. Without selective pressure to keep it, it will most likely accumulate random disabling mutations and become a pseudogene (Choice B).\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a relatively *rare* event: a mutation that bestows a new, useful function must occur before the gene is silenced by more common, random mutations.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization** provides a more passive and probable pathway. It only requires *common* loss-of-function mutations to occur in different parts of the two gene copies (e.g., in different regulatory elements). This process, known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, makes both copies necessary to maintain the original overall function.\n    *   Because Subfunctionalization relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) rather than rarer ones (gain-of-function), many evolutionary biologists consider it a more likely *initial* mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost. This preservation allows them to persist over long evolutionary timescales, during which they can diverge further.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Subfunctionalization is arguably the most likely mechanism that provides a stable path for both retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the possible fates of duplicated genes and identifies the most likely mechanism\n    for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    # The correct answer key\n    correct_answer_key = 'D'\n\n    # Explanation for the choice\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe fates of duplicate genes are primarily:\n1.  **Pseudogenization (Loss):** One copy becomes non-functional. This is the most common fate but fails to retain a functional duplicate.\n2.  **Neofunctionalization:** One copy evolves a new function while the other retains the original one. This explains retention and divergence but requires a rare gain-of-function mutation.\n3.  **Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions. The two copies specialize by losing complementary functions, so both are needed to fulfill the original role. This also explains retention and divergence.\n\nThe key to the question is \"most likely\". Subfunctionalization provides a more probable pathway for the initial retention of the duplicate gene because it relies on common, passive loss-of-function mutations. By making both copies necessary to retain the full ancestral function, it protects the duplicate gene from being silenced, providing a stable intermediate stage for further evolutionary divergence. Therefore, it is considered the most likely mechanism.\n\"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Question:\", question)\n    print(\"\\nAnswer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in choices.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(explanation.strip())\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The most likely mechanism is: {correct_answer_key}. {choices[correct_answer_key]}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_gene_duplication_question()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
