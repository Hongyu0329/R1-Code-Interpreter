    explanation = """
The fates of duplicate genes are primarily:
1.  **Pseudogenization (Loss):** One copy becomes non-functional. This is the most common fate but fails to retain a functional duplicate.
2.  **Neofunctionalization:** One copy evolves a new function while the other retains the original one. This explains retention and divergence but requires a rare gain-of-function mutation.
3.  **Subfunctionalization:** The ancestral gene had multiple functions. The two copies specialize by losing complementary functions, so both are needed to fulfill the original role. This also explains retention and divergence.

The key to the question is "most likely". Subfunctionalization provides a more probable pathway for the initial retention of the duplicate gene because it relies on common, passive loss-of-function mutations. By making both copies necessary to retain the full ancestral function, it protects the duplicate gene from being silenced, providing a stable intermediate stage for further evolutionary divergence. Therefore, it is considered the most likely mechanism.
