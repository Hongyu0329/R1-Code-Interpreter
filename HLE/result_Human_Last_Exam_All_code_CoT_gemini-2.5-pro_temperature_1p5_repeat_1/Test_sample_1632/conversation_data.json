    "To find a(10), which is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, we can use a computational approach. The problem can be solved by exploring all possible paths of length 10 from a starting point and counting only those that never visit the same location twice.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Algorithm Choice**: I will use a recursive backtracking algorithm. This is a natural fit for path-finding and counting problems on a grid.\n2.  **State Representation**: The state of our walk at any point can be defined by the current coordinates `(x, y)` and the number of steps left to take.\n3.  **Self-Avoidance**: To ensure the walk is self-avoiding, we need to keep track of every point visited in the current path. A `set` is an ideal data structure for this, as it provides fast checks for whether a point has been visited.\n4.  **Recursive Function**: I will create a function, `count_walks(x, y, steps_left)`, which will calculate the number of valid self-avoiding paths from the current point `(x, y)` with a given number of `steps_left`.\n    *   **Base Case**: If `steps_left` is 0, it means we have successfully constructed a complete 10-step walk. The function will return 1 to count this path.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: The function will iterate through the four neighbors of the current point `(x, y)`. For each neighbor that has *not* been visited yet:\n        1.  Add the neighbor to the `path` set.\n        2.  Recursively call `count_walks` from the neighbor's position with `steps_left - 1`.\n        3.  Add the result of this recursive call to a running total.\n        4.  **Backtrack**: Remove the neighbor from the `path` set. This is crucial as it allows other recursive branches to explore paths containing this point.\n5.  **Initial Call**: The process starts from the origin `(0, 0)`, with `n=10` steps to take. The initial `path` set will contain just the origin `(0, 0)`.\n\nThis method will systematically count every possible 10-step self-avoiding walk.\n\n```python\ndef solve_self_avoiding_walks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks\n    on a 2D Manhattan (square) lattice, for n=10.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of steps for the walk\n    n = 10\n\n    # A set to keep track of visited coordinates in the current path.\n    # The walk starts at the origin, so it's the first point in our path.\n    path = {(0, 0)}\n\n    def count_walks(x, y, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of valid self-avoiding walks starting\n        from position (x, y) with a given number of steps remaining.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            \n        Returns:\n            int: The total count of valid walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete valid path.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks_from_here = 0\n        \n        # Explore the four neighbors on the Manhattan lattice (up, down, left, right)\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the next point is self-avoiding (not already in the path)\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in path:\n                # 1.
