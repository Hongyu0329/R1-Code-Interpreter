    "Based on my research, it appears there is a misunderstanding in the question. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different prominent Nigerian statesman, who served as the first President of Nigeria.\n\nTherefore, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" because it is not part of his name. I will provide a Python script to clarify this.\n\n```python\ndef clarify_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    \"\"\"\n    name_goodluck = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_azikiwe = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The user's question contains a factual inaccuracy.\\n\"\n        f\"The former President of Nigeria's full name is {name_goodluck}.\\n\"\n        f\"He does not have the middle name 'Azikiwe'.\\n\"\n        f\"{name_azikiwe} was the first President of Nigeria, a different political figure.\\n\"\n        f\"Therefore, there is no record or year of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as 'Azikiwe'.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nclarify_name()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe, as that is not part of his name. The user is likely confusing him with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
