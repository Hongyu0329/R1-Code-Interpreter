    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will address the expression inside the large parentheses, which is the difference of two integrals, let's call it $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n2.  The two integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, have a similar structure in their denominators. I will use the integration property $\\int_0^a f(x)dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x)dx$ with $a=1$ to transform both integrals. This will result in them having a common denominator, which allows for simplification.\n3.  After simplification, I will obtain a single, more manageable integral expression for $I$.\n4.  The crucial step is to find the antiderivative of the new integrand. By observing the structure of the integrand, I will find an antiderivative function, let's call it $F(x)$.\n5.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I$ by computing $F(1) - F(0)$.\n6.  Finally, I will take the value of $I$, raise it to the 4th power, and multiply by $(12)^4$ to get the final answer.\n7.  The entire process will be presented in a Python script, which will also print the final equation showing all the numbers involved as requested.\n\n```python\n# No special libraries are needed for this calculation.\n\n# The problem is to compute the value of the expression:\n# (12)^4 * (I1 - I2)^4\n# where I1 and I2 are the two given integrals.\n\n# Step 1: Simplify the integral term I = I1 - I2\n# I1 = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n# I2 = integral from 0 to 1 of x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4) dx\n#\n# We use the property: integral from 0 to 1 of f(x) dx = integral from 0 to 1 of f(1-x) dx.\n# Applying this to I1, with f(x) = the integrand of I1:\n# f(1-x) = (x^9 - x^5 + 1) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4)\n# Applying this to I2, with g(x) = the integrand of I2:\n# g(1-x) = (1-x) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4)\n#\n# Now, I = I1 - I2 becomes the integral of f(1-x) - g(1-x) from 0 to 1.\n# The new integrand is [(x^9 - x^5 + 1) - (1-x)] / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4)\n# which simplifies to (x^9 - x^5 + x) / (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(3/4).\n\n# Step 2: Find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand.\n# The key to this problem is finding the antiderivative F(x) for the integrand.\n# The correct antiderivative is:\n# F(x) = (x^2 / 12) * (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^(1/4)\n# One can verify this by differentiating F(x) with respect to x.
