    print("\n  - A. Conceptual metaphor: This is the name of the overall theory, not a specific type. Too general.")
    print("  - C. Orientational metaphor: This relates to spatial orientation (e.g., HAPPY IS UP). The phrase has no spatial dimension. Incorrect.")
    
    print("\n  - The core of the metaphor is treating 'love' as an object. This is technically an 'Ontological Metaphor'.")

    print("\n  - D. Structural metaphor: This is when one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another.")
    print("  - In this case, the abstract concept of LOVE is being structured in terms of the more concrete concept of a POSSESSABLE OBJECT.")
    print("  - This structuring allows us to 'possess' love, 'give' it, or have a 'lot' of it. This fits the definition well and is the best choice among the options.")
