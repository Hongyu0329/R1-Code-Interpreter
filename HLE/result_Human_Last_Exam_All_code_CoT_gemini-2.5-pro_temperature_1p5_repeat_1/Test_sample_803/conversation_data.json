    "This is a question from abstract algebra, specifically group theory. The solution relies on a specific characterization of filled groups and an analysis of the structure of groups of order $2q^m$. I will provide a Python script that walks through the mathematical deduction step-by-step to arrive at the answer. The script itself does not perform a brute-force search but rather explains the theoretical proof.\n\nThe key theorem we will use is a result by V. A. Belonogov, which states that a finite group $G$ is filled if and only if for every non-trivial, proper, normal subgroup $N$, the quotient group $G/N$ is an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., a group isomorphic to a direct product of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\n\n```python\ndef find_filled_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logical steps to determine the nonabelian filled groups\n    of order 2*q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"We want to find all nonabelian 'filled' groups G of order 2*q^m, where q is an odd prime and m >= 1.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"A group G is filled if and only if for every non-trivial, proper, normal subgroup N of G,\")\n    print(\"the quotient group G/N is an elementary abelian 2-group (isomorphic to (Z_2)^k for some k).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the structure of G.\")\n    print(\"Let |G| = 2*q^m. The number of Sylow q-subgroups, n_q, must divide 2 and satisfy n_q = 1 (mod q).\")\n    print(\"Since q is an odd prime (q >= 3), n_q = 2 is not possible (as 2 != 1 mod q).\")\n    print(\"Thus, n_q must be 1.
