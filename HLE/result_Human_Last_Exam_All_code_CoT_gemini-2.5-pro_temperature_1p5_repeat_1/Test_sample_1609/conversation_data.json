    "The problem asks for the value of a(4), where a(n) represents the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Sequence:** The function a(n) corresponds to a known integer sequence in the field of combinatorics and computer science. This sequence is well-established, but its calculation is non-trivial, and no simple closed-form formula is known.\n2.  **Find Known Values:** I will find the first few terms of this sequence from reliable sources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and academic papers on the topic. The sequence is OEIS A000373, and its known values are a(0)=1, a(1)=2, a(2)=6, a(3)=20, a(4)=78.\n3.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script that stores these known values. The script will then look up and print the value for n=4. This approach is practical because deriving the value from first principles (e.g., by iterating through all 2^16 Boolean functions of 4 variables and calculating their prime implicants) is computationally intensive and complex.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The code will print an explanatory equation as requested, showing the numbers involved in the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_a4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n    The function a(n) represents a known, non-trivial integer sequence.

The values are determined from\n    established research in Boolean logic and combinatorics.\n\n    The first few terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n    a(0) = 1\n    a(1) = 2\n    a(2) = 6\n    a(3) = 20\n    a(4) = 78\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The sequence of maximal prime implicants for n variables.\n    # This is a known sequence from research, OEIS A000373.\n    a_sequence = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 2,\n        2: 6,\n        3: 20,\n        4: 78\n    }\n\n    n = 4\n    \n    # We look up the value for n=4 from the known sequence.\n    result = a_sequence.get(n)\n\n    # Print the final equation as requested.\n    if result is not None:\n        print(f\"The maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, a(n), is given by a known sequence.\")\n        print(f\"We are looking for the value of a({n}).\")\n        print(f\"Based on the sequence, the equation is:\")\n        # The final equation output shows each number\n        print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not available in the pre-computed sequence.\")\n\nsolve_a4()\n```\n<<<78>>>"
