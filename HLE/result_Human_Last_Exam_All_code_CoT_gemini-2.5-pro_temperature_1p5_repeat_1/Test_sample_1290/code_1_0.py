    Solves the mathematical problem about the maximum number of poles in a simple dessin d'enfant.
    The derivation is based on the properties of the Belyi function and the definition of a simple dessin.
    
    1.  From the problem's conditions on a "simple dessin with respect to J=]0,1[", we deduce key parameters:
        - The multiplicity 'm' for all vertices in ]0,1[ and all non-real vertices is m=2.
        - The ramification indices at the interval endpoints, alpha and beta, are also alpha=2 and beta=2.
        This comes from interpreting "non-special nodes" to include the endpoints 0 and 1, which must have valency 4 (ramification index 2).

    2.  For a real Belyi function on [0,1] starting and ending at 0, with all interior critical points being extrema
        (since m=2 is even), the number of interior q-vertices (maxima, N_q), p-vertices (minima, N_p),
        and r-vertices (poles, N_r) are related by: N_q = N_p + N_r + 1.

    3.  The degree 'd' of the rational function phi(x) provides a constraint. The total number of roots
        of phi(x)-1=0, counting multiplicities, cannot exceed 'd'. Since all q-vertices are double roots (m=2),
        we have 2 * N_q <= d.

    4.  Combining these, we get the inequality: 2 * (N_p + N_r + 1) <= d.

    5.  The degree d is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and denominator.
        - Numerator degree: alpha + beta + m*N_p = 2 + 2 + 2*N_p = 4 + 2*N_p
        - Denominator degree: m*N_r = 2*N_r
        - So, d = max(4 + 2*N_p, 2*N_r)

    6.  The inequality becomes: 2*N_p + 2*N_r + 2 <= max(4 + 2*N_p, 2*N_r).
        - This inequality must hold for all possible numbers of interior zeros (N_p >= 0).
        - If we assume the maximum is 2*N_r (i.e., 2*N_r > 4 + 2*N_p), we get 2*N_p + 2*N_r + 2 <= 2*N_r, which simplifies to 2*N_p + 2 <= 0. This is impossible since N_p >= 0.
        - Therefore, the maximum must be 4 + 2*N_p. The inequality is 2*N_p + 2*N_r + 2 <= 4 + 2*N_p.

    7.  Solving the final inequality:
        2*N_r + 2 <= 4
        2*N_r <= 2
        N_r <= 1
        
    The maximum number of vertices labeled 'r' within ]0,1[ is 1.

    # Let N_r be the number of r-vertices (poles)
    # The final inequality derived from the problem's conditions is:
    inequality_lhs_coeff_Nr = 2
    inequality_rhs = 2
    
    # We are solving 2*N_r <= 2, which is N_r <= 1
