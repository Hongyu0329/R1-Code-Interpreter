    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj. The protagonist is Adam Zamoyski.\n2.  Then, I will recall from the plot of the novel who Adam Zamoyski marries. He marries an Incarnation (Inkarnacja) of a woman named Angelina.\n3.  Finally, I will create a simple Python script that will store this name in a variable and then print the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\n# The name of the character the protagonist marries.\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\n# Print the answer to the user's question.\nprint(f\"The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość', Adam Zamoyski, marries an Incarnation (Inkarnacja) of a character named: {character_name}\")\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
