The security is based on the assumption that the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) is computationally hard.

Any scheme that is existentially unforgeable under a chosen-message attack (the standard model) must also be secure against this weaker attack. Therefore, for any secure scheme, the probability of succeeding in such an attack must be negligible. While one could design an insecure scheme where this is true, it is not a property of the family of secure schemes to which ECDSA belongs.")
