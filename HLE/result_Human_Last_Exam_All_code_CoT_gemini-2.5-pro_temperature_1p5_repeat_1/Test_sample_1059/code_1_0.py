    Analyzes which of the given sets are necessarily closepact and prints the result.

    The logic proceeds as follows:
    1.  The problem defines "closepactness", which is equivalent to the topological
        property of being H-closed.
    2.  For metric spaces (which all the given examples are), a space is H-closed
        (closepact) if and only if it is compact.
    3.  Therefore, the task is to identify which of the sets are compact.
    4.  A subset of R or C is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
    5.  Each option is analyzed based on this criterion.
