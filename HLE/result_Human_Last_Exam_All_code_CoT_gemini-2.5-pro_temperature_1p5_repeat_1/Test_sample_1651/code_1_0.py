def solve_fixed_points_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Stone-Cech fixed point problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of the
    Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f from R to R, where the fixed points
    are in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    Based on the analysis:
    1. The number of fixed points can be 0 (e.g., for f(x) = -x).
    2. The number of fixed points can be 2 (e.g., for f(x) = x + 1, the fixed points
       in the remainder are the points at positive and negative infinity, p_+ and p_-).
    3. Mathematical theorems suggest that it is not possible to have exactly one
       fixed point. For the large class of functions that are autohomeomorphisms
       of R, the number of fixed points is either 0 or at least 2.

    Therefore, the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points is 2.
