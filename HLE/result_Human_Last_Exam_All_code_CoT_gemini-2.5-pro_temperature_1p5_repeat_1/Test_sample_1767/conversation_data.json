    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and for a system composed of multiple non-interacting or weakly coupled subsystems, the total Chern number is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual parts.\n\nIn this case, you have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. When they are connected laterally to form a single larger system (the junction), the Chern number of this new system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate this.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
