    "This is a fascinating historical riddle. Let's break down the clues to find the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the clues**:\n    *   The person is a \"joy-discovering sailor\" according to the poet Andrei Voznesensky. This suggests an explorer or navigator.\n    *   Voznesensky's poem asks about the location of his grave, indicating it was lost or unknown for a long time.\n    *   The location of the grave was found in the late 1980s.\n2.  **Connect the clues**: The combination of Voznesensky and a Russian navigator immediately brings to mind the famous rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" for which Voznesensky wrote the libretto. The protagonist of this story is the real-life historical figure Nikolai Rezanov, a diplomat and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company.\n3.  **Verify the facts**:\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk while returning from his expedition.\n    *   His tomb was destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s, and its exact location was lost.\n    *   Fueled by the immense popularity of the rock opera in the 1980s, historical interest in Rezanov surged. A search for his grave was initiated, and while the original tomb was gone forever, a symbolic grave marker was placed at the presumed site in Krasnoyarsk. This matches the \"answer emerged in the late 1980s\" clue.\n4.  **Construct the code**: I will write a simple Python script that prints the identified last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on historical facts.\n    \n    Clue 1: Andrei Voznesensky called this man \"a joy-discovering sailor\".\n    Analysis 1: This refers to Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n\n    Clue 2: Voznesensky wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n    Analysis 2: Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed during the Soviet era and its location was lost.\n    \n    Clue 3: The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\n    Analysis 3: Due to the popularity of the rock opera, interest in Rezanov peaked.\n    In the 1980s, efforts were made to locate his resting place, leading to the installation of a new monument.\n    \n    Conclusion: The man's last name is Rezanov.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(\"The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov.\")\n    print(f\"His last name is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
