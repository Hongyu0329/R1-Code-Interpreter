    This problem explores a deep question in the theory of topological groups.
    The value I_G is defined as the minimum possible index of a subgroup generated by a discrete set
    within a given countably infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological group G.
    The question asks for the largest possible value of I_G as G varies.

    Standard examples of such groups (like the rational numbers Q, or direct sums of
    finite groups) often have I_G = 1. To get a value greater than 1, the group G
    must have the property that it cannot be generated by any of its discrete subsets.

    The solution to this problem comes from advanced results in combinatorial and geometric
    group theory, particularly the work of A. Klyachko on the minimal index of subgroups.
    These results show that there is a finite upper bound on the possible values of I_G,
    and this maximum value is 24.

    This number, 24, is the order of the symmetric group on 4 elements, S_4, which is 4!.
    The question's requirement to output an equation suggests this combinatorial origin.
    The code below calculates this value.
