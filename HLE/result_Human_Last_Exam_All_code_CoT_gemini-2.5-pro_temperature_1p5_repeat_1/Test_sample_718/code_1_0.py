    print("\nStep 1: Define the key concepts")
    print(" - J is an upper semilattice: A partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements x and y, their least upper bound (or join, denoted x V y) exists.")
    print(" - f: J -> Vect_K is a functor: This is a representation of the poset J, assigning a vector space F(j) to each element j in J and a linear map F(j -> k) to each relation j <= k.")
    print(" - Functor f is 'n-resolvable': This means that f has a projective dimension of at most n (pd(f) <= n). In other words, there exists a projective resolution of f with length at most n: 0 -> P_n -> ... -> P_1 -> P_0 -> f -> 0.")
    print(" - Functor f is 'tame': This relates to the classification of the indecomposable representations of J. Tame representation type lies between finite (very structured) and wild (chaotic) types.")

    print("\nStep 2: Reframe the question in homological terms")
    print("The question 'for what n is any tame functor n-resolvable?' asks for the smallest integer n that is an upper bound for the projective dimension of all tame functors f on J.")
    print("This value is, in turn, bounded by the global dimension of the entire category of functors Func(J, Vect_K).")

    print("\nStep 3: Connect the functor category to a module category")
    print("The category of functors Func(J, Vect_K) is equivalent to the category of right modules over the category algebra, KJ.")
    print("Therefore, the global dimension of Func(J, Vect_K) is equal to the global dimension of the algebra KJ, denoted gl.dim(KJ).")

    print("\nStep 4: Apply a core theorem about poset algebras")
    print("A fundamental result in representation theory states that for a poset P, its category algebra KP is hereditary (i.e., gl.dim(KP) <= 1) if and only if P is a lower semilattice.")
    print("(A lower semilattice is a poset where every pair of elements has a greatest lower bound, or meet).")
    print("If J is an upper semilattice, its opposite poset, J^op, is a lower semilattice.")
    print("The global dimension of KJ is the same as that of K(J^op).")
    print("Since J^op is a lower semilattice, the theorem tells us that gl.dim(K(J^op)) <= 1.")
    print("Thus, if J is an upper semilattice, gl.dim(KJ) <= 1.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclude the value of n")
    print("Because gl.dim(KJ) <= 1, the projective dimension of ANY functor f: J -> Vect_K must be at most 1. This includes all tame functors.")
    print("So, any tame functor f has pd(f) <= 1, which means it is 1-resolvable. This implies n >= 1.")
    print("Can n be 0? If n=0, all tame functors would be projective. This would mean gl.dim(KJ) = 0. This occurs only if J is an antichain (a poset with no order relations).")
    print("However, an antichain with more than one element is not an upper semilattice. A one-element poset is an upper semilattice but its representation type is finite, not tame. Therefore, non-projective functors exist, and n cannot be 0.")

    final_n = 1
    print(f"Conclusion: The properties of an upper semilattice force the global dimension to be at most 1. The 'tame' condition ensures the case is not trivial (gl.dim != 0).")
    print(f"Therefore, any tame functor is n-resolvable for n = {final_n}.")
