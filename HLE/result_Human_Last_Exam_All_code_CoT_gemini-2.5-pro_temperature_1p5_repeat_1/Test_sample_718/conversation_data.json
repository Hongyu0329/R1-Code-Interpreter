    "Answering this question involves concepts from the representation theory of posets and homological algebra. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:** Clarify the definitions of \"upper semilattice\", \"tame functor\", and \"n-resolvable\".\n2.  **Translate the problem:** Rephrase the question in terms of the projective dimension of functors and the global dimension of the associated functor category.\n3.  **Apply a key theorem:** Use a known result from the representation theory of posets that connects the structure of a poset (specifically, being a semilattice) to the global dimension of its category algebra.\n4.  **Synthesize and conclude:** Combine the results to determine the value of `n`. The \"tame\" property will be considered to ensure the case is non-trivial.\n5.  **Format the answer:** Present the reasoning and the final answer in a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step explanation to find the value of n\n    for which a tame functor on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the key concepts\")\n    print(\" - J is an upper semilattice: A partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements x and y, their least upper bound (or join, denoted x V y) exists.\")\n    print(\" - f: J -> Vect_K is a functor: This is a representation of the poset J, assigning a vector space F(j) to each element j in J and a linear map F(j -> k) to each relation j <= k.\")\n    print(\" - Functor f is 'n-resolvable': This means that f has a projective dimension of at most n (pd(f) <= n).
