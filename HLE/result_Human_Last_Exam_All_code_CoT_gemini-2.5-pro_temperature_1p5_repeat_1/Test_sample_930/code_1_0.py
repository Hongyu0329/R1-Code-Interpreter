    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.
    A mutualistic relationship is where both organisms benefit.
    
    1) Danaus plexipus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
    2) Megachile frigidus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
    3) Formica rufa (Adult): Defender -> Mutualist.
    4) Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
    5) Pepsis thisbe (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
    6) Megachile ericetorum (Adult): Pollinator -> Mutualist.
    7) Danaus plexipus (Larva): Herbivore -> Not a mutualist.
    8-12) Other larvae: Do not interact with the plant in a mutualistic way.
    
    The code will list the indices of the identified mutualists.
