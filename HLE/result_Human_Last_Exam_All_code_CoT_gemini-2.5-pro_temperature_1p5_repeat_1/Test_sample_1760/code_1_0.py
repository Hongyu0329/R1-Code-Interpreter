    Analyzes the properties of different edit distance metrics and identifies the true statements.
    
    The properties analyzed are:
    A) Triangle inequality for Levenshtein (L)
    B) A specific formula relating Levenshtein with Transposition (LT) and L
    C) Symmetry property for all three distances (L, LT, Rotational Levenshtein - RL)
    D) Potential for LT to violate the triangle inequality
    E) Relationship between RL and L (RL <= L)
    F) Asymptotic difference between L and LT
    G) Triangle inequality for RL
    H) Time complexity for computing LT
    I) Classification of LT as a pseudometric
    J) Specific distance calculation for RL("rat", "tar")
    K) Metric properties of all three distances on fixed-length strings
    L) Necessary equality between at least two of the three distances
    M) A specific upper bound on LT for strings related by k transpositions
    N) Boundedness of the ratio L/LT
    O) Equality of RL and LT under certain conditions

    Based on a step-by-step analysis, the following statements were determined to be true.
    """
    
    # A) L(x,y) ≤ L(x,z) + L(z,y) always holds (triangle inequality) -> True. L is a metric.
    # C) All three distances (L, LT, RL) satisfy symmetry: d(x,y) = d(y,x) -> True. All ops are reversible.
    # D) LT can violate triangle inequality -> True. The common OSA variant of D-L is not a metric.
    # E) For any strings x,y: RL(x,y) ≤ L(x,y) -> True. RL adds an operation, can only reduce the min cost.
    # F) There exist strings where LT distance differs from L by Θ(n) -> True. e.g., x=a1b1.., y=b1a1.. gives L=n, LT=n/2.
    # H) For strings x,y of length n, computing LT(x,y) requires Ω(n²) time -> True. Standard lower bound for edit distance.
