    "I will use a Python script to find the small molecules that interact with the specified chemical target.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will use the `chembl_webresource_client` library, which is the official Python client for accessing the ChEMBL database.\n2.  I will search for biological activity data related to the target ID `CHEMBL4803817`.\n3.  To identify significant interactions, I will filter the results to include only those with a pChEMBL value of 5 or greater. The pChEMBL value is a measure of potency (`-log10` of the molar IC50, Ki, etc.), so a value of 5 corresponds to an activity of 10,000 nM (or 10 ÂµM) or better. This ensures we are looking at reasonably strong interactions.\n4.  Finally, I will iterate through the search results and print the ChEMBL ID of each interacting small molecule, along with the type and value of the measured interaction.\n\n```python\n# First, please make sure you have the ChEMBL web resource client installed.\n# If not, run the following command in your terminal:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules that interact with a given ChEMBL target ID.\n\n    This function queries the ChEMBL database for activities associated with the\n    target ID, filtering for potent interactions (pChEMBL >= 5), and then prints\n    the details of each interacting molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        activity = new_client.activity\n        # Query for activities with a pChEMBL value of 5 or greater.\n        # This corresponds to a potency of 10 uM or less (e.g., IC50, Ki).\n        # We also filter for common standard types to get quantitative data.\n        results = activity.filter(\n            target_chembl_id=target_id, \n            pchembl_value__gte=5,\n            standard_type__in=['IC50', 'Ki', 'Kd', 'EC50']\n        ).only([\n            'molecule_chembl_id', \n            'standard_type', \n            'standard_value', \n            'standard_units'\n        ])\n\n        if not results:\n            print(f\"No interacting small molecules found for ChEMBL ID: {target_id} with the specified criteria (pChEMBL >= 5).\")\n            return\n\n        print(f\"Found interacting small molecules for target {target_id}:\")\n        \n        # Use a set to avoid printing duplicate molecule IDs if they have multiple activity entries\n        processed_molecules = set()\n        \n        for interaction in results:\n            molecule_id = interaction.get('molecule_chembl_id')\n            if molecule_id and molecule_id not in processed_molecules:\n                activity_type = interaction.get('standard_type', 'N/A')\n                value = interaction.get('standard_value', 'N/A')\n                units = interaction.get('standard_units', '')\n                \n                print(f\"- Molecule: {molecule_id}, Interaction Type: {activity_type}, Value: {value} {units}\")\n                processed_molecules.add(molecule_id)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please check your internet connection and ensure the 'chembl_webresource_client' library is correctly installed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The ChEMBL ID for the target of interest\n    target_chembl_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id)\n```"
