def solve_turing_machine_limit():
    """
    This function explains the reasoning and prints the solution to the limit problem.

    The problem asks for the limit: L = lim_{k -> infinity} [f(k+1) - f(k)],
    where f(k) is the minimum number of states for a Turing machine that recognizes
    the language L_k = {w in {0,1}* : |w|_1 is divisible by k}.

    Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

    1.  Determine the growth rate of f(k):
        A Turing Machine recognizing L_k can use its tape to store the count of 1s.
        This is much more efficient than a DFA, which needs k states. The dominant
        part of the complexity comes from checking if the final count is divisible
        by k, where k is hard-coded into the machine's states. The number of states
        needed for this is known to be proportional to the description length of k,
        which is log(k). Thus, the state complexity f(k) has a growth rate of
        Theta(log k).

    2.  Evaluate the limit of f(k)/k:
        Since f(k) grows as log(k), the limit of the ratio f(k)/k as k approaches
        infinity is 0.
        lim_{k -> infinity} f(k)/k = lim_{k -> infinity} Theta(log k)/k = 0.

    3.  Apply the Cesaro-Stolz Theorem:
        A key piece of information is that the limit L = lim_{k -> infinity} [f(k+1) - f(k)] exists.
        The Cesaro-Stolz theorem states that if this limit exists, it must be equal
        to the limit of f(k)/k.
        So, L = lim_{k -> infinity} f(k)/k.

    4.  Combine the results:
        From steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that L = 0.

    5.  Final Answer:
        The problem asks for the answer as a single integer. Our derived limit is 0.
