    This function solves the problem based on the provided logic.
    Let k be a positive integer.
    Let G and H be graphs such that:
    1. G and H are indistinguishable by k-dim WL (G \equiv_k H).
    2. G and H are distinguishable by (k+1)-dim WL (G \not\equiv_{k+1} H).

    The question asks for the maximum integer l such that G^l and H^l are
    indistinguishable by k-dim WL (G^l \equiv_k H^l).

    The reasoning is based on results from finite model theory regarding the
    logical expressiveness on tensor products of graphs.
    - A property requiring m variables on a graph G can be expressed using
      m-1 variables on the l-fold tensor product G^l, provided l is large enough.
    - The number of factors l required to save one variable (from m to m-1) is l=m-1.

    In our case:
    - G and H are distinguished by (k+1)-dim WL, which corresponds to logic with k+2 variables (C^{k+2}).
    - We want to know when G^l and H^l can be distinguished by k-dim WL, which corresponds to C^{k+1}.
    - This means we want to know for which l a C^{k+2} property on G can be reduced to a C^{k+1} property on G^l.
    - This is a reduction by one variable (from k+2 to k+1).
    - Applying the rule, the number of factors needed is l = (k+2) - 1 = k+1.
    - So, for l = k+1, G^{k+1} and H^{k+1} may become distinguishable by k-dim WL.
    - Therefore, the maximum l for which indistinguishability is guaranteed is k.
