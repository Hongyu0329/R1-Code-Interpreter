# Step 1: Define the number of components for the unknot.
# The unknot is a polygon that can be untangled to lie flat.
# Its stick number (minimum edges) is 3. With 6 edges, we can easily form an unknot.
# All unknotted polygons belong to a single connected component.
unknot_components = 1

# Step 2: Define the number of components for the trefoil knot.
# The trefoil knot's stick number is 6, so it can be formed with a 6-sided polygon.
# The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it has two distinct, non-deformable mirror-image forms
# (left-handed and right-handed). Each form corresponds to a separate connected component.
trefoil_knot_components = 2

# Step 3: Consider other knots.
# The next simplest knot, the figure-eight knot, has a stick number of 7.
# Since we only have 6 edges, no more complex knots can be formed.
other_knot_components = 0

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of connected components.
total_components = unknot_components + trefoil_knot_components + other_knot_components

# Print the final result as an equation
