As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the edges of the image are first smoothed out, with sharp corners becoming rounded. Then, driven by local curvature, the edges move in a process analogous to mean curvature flow. This causes convex shapes to shrink and concave regions to be filled in. Eventually, all closed boundaries vanish, and the image converges to a final state with no edges, i.e., an image that is entirely one color (either all black or all white).
