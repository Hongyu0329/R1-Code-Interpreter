    Calculates and prints the components of the theoretical lower bound on SQ queries
    for learning a two-layer ReLU network.
    
    The question asks for the minimum number of queries for any SQ algorithm 
    learning a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network over N(0,I_d) to a 
    squared loss of 1/poly(d), with non-negligible query tolerance.
    
    Theoretical results show that for a superlinear number of neurons (e.g., k = d^2),
    this lower bound is super-polynomial, specifically d^Ω(d).
