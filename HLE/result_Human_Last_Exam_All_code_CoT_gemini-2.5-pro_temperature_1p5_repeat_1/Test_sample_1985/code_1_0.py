# The problem is overdetermined, and the provided function f(t) leads to a contradiction
# with the boundary conditions. We assume the problem is well-posed and the intended
# solution is derived from the boundary conditions, which are consistent with each other.

# The index of the non-zero component
# k = 2**2024, which is a very large number.

# From the boundary conditions, we found the value of the non-zero component x_k(1):
# x_k(1) = -1/2 * exp(2^k)

# The squared l2-norm ||x(1)||^2 is |x_k(1)|^2, as all other components are zero.
# ||x(1)||^2 = (-1/2 * exp(2^k))^2 = 1/4 * exp(2 * 2^k) = 1/4 * exp(2^(k+1))
# Substituting k = 2^2024, we get:
# ||x(1)||^2 = 1/4 * exp(2^(2^2024 + 1))

# The numbers in the final equation are:
c = 0.25
base1 = 2
base2 = 2
exponent = 2024
addend = 1

# We print the final formula using these numbers, as the value is too large to compute.
print(f"The final expression for the squared norm is:")
