# The final answers for each part are:
# (A) The story is "The Priory School" and the faked tracks were made by a horse. This is option 7.
part_a = 7
# (B) The flawed allusion to the master of deduction highlights the theme of "the impossibility of reliable inference". This is option 6.
part_b = 6
# (C) The narrative of "The Real Life of Sebastian Knight" is a hunt for clues that metaphorically "pointed back". This is option 3.
