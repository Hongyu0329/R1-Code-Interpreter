    print("\nChoice E suggests a positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and the Barkovich score.")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, meaning its levels often rise in response to injury and inflammation.")
    print("2. The Barkovich score is a widely used MRI scoring system to assess the pattern and severity of brain injury in newborns. A higher score indicates more severe injury.")
    print("3. Multiple clinical studies have found a direct, positive correlation: higher levels of GM-CSF measured in newborns with encephalopathy are associated with higher (worse) Barkovich scores on their brain MRIs.")
    print("4. This indicates that a stronger inflammatory response, as marked by GM-CSF, is linked to more extensive brain damage.")
    print("\nThis makes the positive linear relationship between GM-CSF and the Barkovich score the correct association among the choices.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice: E")
