# Plan:
# The smallest Kripke countermodel for the given formula can be constructed systematically.
# Let the formula be F = ((C0 -> B1) & (C1 -> B2)) -> B2,
# where C_i = (A_i -> B_i) v (~A_i -> B_i).

# 1. To falsify F at a root node w0, we need w0 to force the premise but not the conclusion.
#    - w0 forces (C0 -> B1) & (C1 -> B2)
#    - w0 does not force B2
#    This is the root node of our model.
root_node = 1

# 2. From (w0 forces C1 -> B2) and (w0 does not force B2), we must conclude that (w0 does not force C1).
#    To not force C1 = (A1 -> B1) v (~A1 -> B1), w0 must fail to force both disjuncts.
#    - To not force (A1 -> B1), there must be a successor w1 where A1 is forced but B1 is not.
#    - To not force (~A1 -> B1), there must be a successor w2 where ~A1 is forced but B1 is not.
#    This requires adding 2 distinct successor nodes to the root.
level_1_nodes = 2

# 3. Now we must satisfy the other part of the premise: (w0 forces C0 -> B1).
#    This means for any world w accessible from w0, if w forces C0, then w must force B1.
#    Let's check this for w1 and w2.
#    - At w1: By construction, B1 is not forced. So, for the implication (C0 -> B1) to hold, C0 must not be forced at w1.
#    - At w2: Similarly, B1 is not forced. So, C0 must not be forced at w2.

# 4. To not force C0 at w1, w1 must have two successors:
#    - w1a, where A0 is forced but B0 is not.
#    - w1n, where ~A0 is forced but B0 is not.
#    This adds 2 more nodes to the model, as successors of w1.
w1_children = 2

# 5. Similarly, to not force C0 at w2, w2 must have two successors:
#    - w2a, where A0 is forced but B0 is not.
#    - w2n, where ~A0 is forced but B0 is not.
#    This adds 2 more nodes to the model, as successors of w2.
w2_children = 2

# 6. All these constructed nodes must be distinct, forming a tree-like structure.
#    The total number of nodes is the sum of the root, its children, and their children.
total_nodes = root_node + level_1_nodes + w1_children + w2_children

# Final Answer
# print(total_nodes)
# The prompt asks for each number in the final equation. So printing the line above is better.
# Final Answer format should just be <<<...>>>.
# I will just print the number
