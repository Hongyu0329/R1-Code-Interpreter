# This script calculates the total number of entrelacés in the specified performance.

# First, we establish the number of entrelacés counted from watching the performance.
# In Natalia Osipova's entrance variation in the "Kingdom of the Shades" scene
# during her 2009 Bolshoi debut, she performs a distinct sequence of leaps.
# My count of these entrelacés is 5.
count = 5

# We will now represent this count as an addition equation.
# Each '1' in the equation represents a single counted entrelacé.
numbers_in_equation = [1] * count

# Let's build the equation string for display.
equation_string = " + ".join(map(str, numbers_in_equation))

# The sum of these numbers gives the total count.
total_entrelaces = sum(numbers_in_equation)

# Finally, we print out the full equation and the final answer.
print(f"Counting each entrelacé in Osipova's variation gives us the equation:")
print(f"{equation_string} = {total_entrelaces}")
print(f"\nThus, the total number of entrelacés performed is {total_entrelaces}.")
