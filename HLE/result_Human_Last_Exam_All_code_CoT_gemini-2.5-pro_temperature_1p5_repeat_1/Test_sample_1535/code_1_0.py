# The user wants to identify the anatomical region expected to have a rash based on a clinical vignette.

# Clinical Reasoning Steps:
# 1. The patient presents with muscle weakness, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), and fatigue.
# 2. The physical exam reveals "periorbital recession and erythema".
# 3. "Periorbital" refers to the area around the eyes. "Erythema" means redness.
# 4. This combination of muscle weakness and a characteristic rash around the eyes is highly suggestive of Dermatomyositis.
# 5. A key pathognomonic (specifically characteristic) sign of Dermatomyositis is the "heliotrope rash", which is a purplish or reddish rash on the upper eyelids.
# 6. The finding of "periorbital erythema" directly describes this rash.
# 7. Therefore, a rash is expected on the eyelids.

# Let's map the choices to the reasoning.
# A. Dorsum of the hands: Also common in Dermatomyositis (Gottron's papules), but the vignette specifically mentions the eye area.
# B. Nose: More characteristic of Lupus (malar rash).
# C. Eyelids: Directly corresponds to the "periorbital erythema" (heliotrope rash) mentioned in the physical exam.
# D. Groin: Not a characteristic location.
# E. Shoulders: Also common in Dermatomyositis (Shawl sign), but the vignette specifically mentions the eye area.

# The most accurate answer based on the provided physical exam finding is C.

answer = "C"
