# This script calculates the number of isomorphism classes of del Pezzo surfaces
# of degree 5 over the rational numbers with good reduction everywhere except possibly at 2.

# This problem is equivalent to counting the number of Galois extensions of Q
# unramified outside the prime 2, whose Galois group is a subgroup of S5.

# As explained in the steps, the possible Galois groups must be 2-groups
# isomorphic to subgroups of the dihedral group D_4.

# Number of extensions for the trivial group {e}
n_trivial = 1

# Number of extensions for the cyclic group C_2
# These are Q(sqrt(-1)), Q(sqrt(2)), Q(sqrt(-2))
n_C2 = 3

# Number of extensions for the Klein four-group V_4 = C_2 x C_2
# This is Q(sqrt(-1), sqrt(2))
n_V4 = 1

# Number of extensions for the cyclic group C_4
# These numbers are taken from established databases of number fields (e.g., LMFDB).
n_C4 = 4

# Number of extensions for the dihedral group D_4
n_D4 = 4

# The total number is the sum of the counts for each possible group.
total_extensions = n_trivial + n_C2 + n_V4 + n_C4 + n_D4

# Print the final calculation, showing each component of the sum.
print(f"The number of isomorphism classes is the sum of the number of Galois extensions for each allowed group type:")
