    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism, presented by a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Core Formula:** The partition function `Z` is expressed as a functional integral over Grassmann fields. The main equation is `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S)`.\n2.  **Define the Action (S):** The term in the exponent, `S`, is the Euclidean action. I will provide its standard definition, `S = ∫ dτ [ ψ* ∂_τ ψ + H(ψ*, ψ) ]`.\n3.  **Explain the Components:** I will break down what each symbol in the formula represents: the path integral measure `D[ψ*, ψ]`, the Grassmann fields `ψ` and `ψ*`, the imaginary time `τ`, the inverse temperature `β`, and the Hamiltonian `H`.\n4.  **Specify the Boundary Conditions:** A critical feature for fermions is the anti-periodic boundary condition `ψ(τ + β) = -ψ(τ)`, which arises from the trace operation in fermionic Hilbert space. I will explicitly state this.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to print this entire formula and its explanation in a clear, structured format.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script prints the formula for the fermionic partition function (Z)\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # The main formula is constructed and printed piece by piece.\n    print(\"Z = ∫ D[ψ*(τ), ψ(τ)] * exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")\n    print(\"Where the components of the formula are defined as follows:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
