    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Establish Start and End Dates:** I will find the start and end years of the conflict according to the established StarCraft lore. The Second Great War is generally considered to have started with the Brood War in the year 2500 and concluded with the death of the Overmind's second incarnation in 2504.\n2.  **Calculate the Duration:** Subtract the start year from the end year.\n3.  **Round Up:** Apply the rounding up rule as requested.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a Python script that defines these years, performs the subtraction, rounds the result up, and prints the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War started in the year 2500\n# and concluded at the end of the Brood War in 2504.\nstart_year = 2500\nend_year = 2504\n\n# Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The result is an integer, but we use math.ceil() to follow the \"rounded up\" instruction.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print out the explanation and the final calculation.\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft Lore began in the year {start_year} and ended in the year {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The duration is calculated as: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
