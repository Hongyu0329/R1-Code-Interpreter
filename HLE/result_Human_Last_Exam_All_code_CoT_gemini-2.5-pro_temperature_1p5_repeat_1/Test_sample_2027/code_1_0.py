# The mathematical analysis of the limit shows that the value of l(d) is 0 for all d >= 2.
# The plan is as follows:
# 1. Analyze the denominator of the expression for f(d, p, o).
#    The first term is the infinite product for cosh(2x).
#    The second term is an infinite product that diverges to +infinity for x > 1.
#    Therefore, the denominator diverges to -infinity as x -> infinity.
# 2. Analyze the numerator of the expression.
#    All terms in the numerator converge to a finite value or zero. The limit of the numerator is 1 - tanh(infinity) = 1 - 1 = 0.
# 3. The limit of the fraction is therefore 0 / (-infinity), which is exactly 0.
#    This makes f(d, p, o) = 0 for all arguments.
# 4. The value of l(d) is the minimum of f(d, p, o) over all omega points o.
#    Since f is always 0, its minimum value is 0.
#
# The final equation is l(d) = 0.
# The number in this equation is 0.
