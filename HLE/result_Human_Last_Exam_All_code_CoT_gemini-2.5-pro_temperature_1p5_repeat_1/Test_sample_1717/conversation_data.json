    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. According to the official Terraria Wiki, its health in single-player Expert Mode is 3,640.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I need the multiplayer health scaling formula for Expert Mode. For each player beyond the first, the boss's health is increased by 35%. This can be expressed with the formula: `Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1)`.\n3.  **Formulate the Full Equation:** Combining the base health and the multiplier, the total health for `N` players is: `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))`.\n4.  **Evaluate for \"Infinite Players\":** The user asks for the health with an infinite number of players. Mathematically, as `NumberOfPlayers` (N) approaches infinity, the `Total Health` calculated by the formula also approaches infinity.\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** The prompt specifies that the answer should be based on the game's source code. In software, values are stored in specific data types that have limits. Terraria's source code stores NPC health (including bosses) as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n6.  **Determine the Hard Cap:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum value of `2^31 - 1`, which is `2,147,483,647`. No matter what the health formula calculates, the health value in the game cannot exceed this number. Therefore, this is the theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have.\n7.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will state the base values and the formula, explain the concept of the infinite limit, and then print the final answer, which is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_cap():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, based on Terraria's source code.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base health for single-player Expert Mode.\n    expert_base_health = 3640\n\n    # Step 2: Define the health scaling factor per additional player.\n    per_player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the health calculation formula.\n    print(\"The health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is calculated based on the number of players (N).\")\n    print(f\"Base Health (1 Player): {expert_base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Health increase per additional player: {per_player_scaling_factor * 100}%\")\n    print(f\"Full Formula: Total Health = {expert_base_health} * (1 + {per_player_scaling_factor} * (N - 1))\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the implication of infinite players and the technical limitation.\n    print(\"As the number of players (N) approaches infinity, the result of this formula also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria's source code stores NPC health as a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a hard-coded maximum value, which acts as the game's theoretical health cap.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: State the final answer, which is the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n    # This value is 2^31 - 1.\n    max_health_cap = 2147483647\n\n    # Final Answer: Present the equation representing the limit.\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Maximum Health = Limit (32-bit Integer) = {max_health_cap}\")\n\n\nsolve_terraria_health_cap()\n<<<2147483647>>>\n```"
