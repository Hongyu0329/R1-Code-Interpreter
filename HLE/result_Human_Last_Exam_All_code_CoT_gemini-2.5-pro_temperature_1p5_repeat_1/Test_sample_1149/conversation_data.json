    "This is a knowledge-based question from the field of paleontology. The answer can be found in scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. My plan is to find the established scientific fact and then present it using a simple Python script, as requested. The script will assign the number of depressions to a variable and print it out in a descriptive sentence that resembles an equation.\n\nBased on the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype (specimen SMNS 58022), the lacrimal recess contains two accessory openings, which are described as depressions. Therefore, the number is 2.\n\nHere is the Python code to present this information:\n\n```python\n# This script provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess\n# of the dinosaur Irritator challengeri based on paleontological data.\n\n# Define the entity and the feature in question.\ndinosaur = \"Irritator challengeri\"\nfeature = \"lacrimal recess depressions\"\n\n# The number of depressions as documented in scientific literature.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the final statement in an equation-like format.\nprint(f\"Number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of {dinosaur} = {number_of_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
