    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent Quantum States:** The six basis states (`∣0⟩`, `∣1⟩`, `∣+⟩`, `∣-⟩`, `∣i⟩`, and `|-i⟩`) are represented as two-dimensional complex vectors in a NumPy array. For instance, `∣0⟩` is `[1, 0]` and `|+⟩` is `[1/√2, 1/√2]`.\n\n2.  **Understand Unitary Operations and Linearity:** Any valid quantum gate operation `U` on a single qubit must be a *linear* transformation. This means that the gate's action on a superposition state is determined by its action on the basis states `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`. For example, since `|+⟩ = (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)/√2`, linearity implies that `U|+⟩` must be equal to `(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)/√2`.\n\n3.  **Account for Global Phase:** In quantum mechanics, a state `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `c|ψ⟩`, where `c` is any complex number with an absolute value of 1 (a \"phase factor\"). Therefore, a transformation rule like `U|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` really means `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` for some phase factor `c`. The specific phase can differ for each input state.\n\n4.  **The Consistency Check:** For each answer choice, we'll test if its set of transformations is consistent with linearity.\n    a. Let `U|0⟩ = p₀|out₀⟩` and `U|1⟩ = p₁|out₁⟩`, where `p₀` and `p₁` are unknown phase factors.\n    b. We use the transformation rule for `|+⟩` to determine the required *relative phase*, `p_ratio = p₁/p₀`, between the `U|0⟩` and `U|1⟩ transformations.\n    c. We then verify if this same `p_ratio` works for the transformations of the other superposition states (`|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, `|-i⟩`). For example, we check if `(p₀|out₀⟩ - p₁|out₁⟩)/√2` (which is `p₀(|out₀⟩ - p_ratio|out₁⟩)/√2`) is proportional to the specified output state `|out_−⟩`.\n    d. If we cannot find a `p_ratio` that satisfies all transformations simultaneously, that set of transformations violates linearity and is therefore not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** A Python script will perform this check for all answer choices (A-W). It will loop through each choice until it finds the one that fails the consistency test and will print the result. The helper function `are_proportional` checks if two vectors are parallel by verifying if their 2D determinant is close to zero.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\n\ndef solve_quantum_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the quantum transformation puzzle by checking for linearity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
