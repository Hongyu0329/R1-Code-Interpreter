# This script identifies the letter formed by the buildings of two high schools in Pisa.

# Step 1: The two schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini,
# are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce, Pisa.

# Step 2: Observing their layout from a satellite view reveals a distinct shape.
# The Galilei-Pacinotti building forms a vertical line.
# The Ulisse Dini building forms a horizontal line at the bottom of the first.

# Step 3: This arrangement of the two buildings clearly forms a letter of the alphabet.
# The code below prints the name of that letter.

letter = "L"
