    print("--- The 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Blow-Up Problem ---")
    print("\nQuestion: Is there a smooth divergence-free periodic initial data u_0 such that the solution u blows up in finite-time?")
    print("Answer: No.")
    print("\n--- Explanation ---")

    # Step 1: State the equation and the problem
    print("1. The equations are:")
    print("   ∂_t u + u·∇u = Δu - ∇p")
    print("   ∇·u = 0  (incompressibility)")
    print("   Domain: 2D Torus (T^2), meaning periodic boundary conditions.")
    print("\n'Blow-up' would mean some norm of u(t), e.g., ||∇u(t)||_L2, goes to infinity as t approaches a finite time T.")

    # Step 2: Energy Estimate
    print("\n2. The first step is to establish an energy estimate.")
    print("   By taking the L^2 inner product of the equation with u, we find that the total kinetic energy ||u(t)||^2_L2 is non-increasing.")
    print("   The energy equality is:")
    print("   (1/2) * d/dt ||u||^2_L2 + ||∇u||^2_L2 = 0")
    print("   This shows ||u(t)||_L2 <= ||u_0||_L2 for all time t > 0.")
    print("   While this prevents the L^2 norm from blowing up, it's not enough to guarantee smoothness.")

    # Step 3: Vorticity Formulation
    print("\n3. The crucial step for the 2D case is to analyze the vorticity, ω.")
    print("   Vorticity is the curl of the velocity field. In 2D, ω is a scalar: ω = ∂_1 u_2 - ∂_2 u_1.")
    print("   Taking the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation eliminates the pressure term and yields the vorticity equation:")
    print("   ∂_t ω + u·∇ω = Δω")
    print("   This is a scalar advection-diffusion equation for ω.")

    # Step 4: Maximum Principle for Vorticity
    print("\n4. The vorticity equation satisfies a maximum principle.")
    print("   Because there is no 'vortex-stretching' term (which would look like ω·∇u in 3D), the maximum value of |ω| cannot increase.")
    print("   This leads to the fundamental L-infinity bound:")
    print("   ||ω(t)||_L∞ <= ||ω_0||_L∞")
    print("   This means if the initial vorticity is bounded, it remains bounded for all time.")

    # Step 5: Bounding derivatives and proving global regularity
    print("\n5. The bound on vorticity guarantees smoothness.")
    print("   The velocity u can be recovered from the vorticity ω via the Biot-Savart law.")
    print("   A bound on ||ω||_L∞ provides a bound on the gradient of velocity ||∇u||_Lp for any p.")
    print("   This control on the gradient of u is sufficient to bound all higher-order derivatives of the velocity field for all time.")
    print("   Therefore, if the solution starts smooth, it remains smooth forever.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("For the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, global regularity holds. No matter how large or complex the initial smooth data is, the solution will exist and remain smooth for all time. Finite-time blow-up is impossible.")
