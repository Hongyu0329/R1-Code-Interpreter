def solve_rope_force():
    """
    Calculates the force required to lift a rope under specific conditions.

    The problem states we need to find the force F applied to one end of a rope
    of mass m and length l, such that when the other end just leaves the ground,
    its speed is v.

    The force F at that final instant is composed of two parts:
    1. The force to counteract the rope's total weight (mg).
    2. A force required to accelerate new segments of the rope from rest to speed v.
       This is a thrust-like force, equal to (m/l)v^2.

    We assume that at the final moment, the acceleration is zero, as the goal is to
    achieve an exact speed v.

    The final formula is: F = mg + (m * v^2) / l
