    "Answering this question requires determining the minimum value of $N(X, B)$, where $N(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of a given cardinality $K$. We are free to choose the most suitable $X$ and $B$ (from the class of spaces with cardinality $K$) to find this minimum.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The number of embeddings, $N(X, B)$, must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value it can take is 0.\n2.  We will show that the number 0 is achievable. To do this, we need to find just one example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ (of some valid cardinality $K$) for which there are no isometric embeddings.\n3.  A simple and common Banach space is the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value as the norm, i.e., $B = (\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$. The cardinality of this space is $K=2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n4.  We will choose a simple finite ultrametric space $X$. Let $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ be a set of three points. Let the distance function be $d(p_i, p_j) = 1$ for any two distinct points $p_i, p_j \\in X$. This space is ultrametric because for any distinct points $p_i, p_j, p_k$, the ultrametric inequality $d(p_i, p_k) \\le \\max(d(p_i, p_j), d(p_j, p_k))$ becomes $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$, which is true.\n5.  An isometric embedding $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ would require finding three points $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that the distance between any pair is 1. This means they must satisfy the following system of equations:\n    *   $|x_1 - x_2| = 1$\n    *   $|x_2 - x_3| = 1$\n    *   $|x_1 - x_3| = 1$\n6.  The following Python code will demonstrate that this system of equations has no solution in $\\mathbb{R}$, proving that no such embedding exists.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_embedding_in_R():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that it's impossible to isometrically embed a\n    3-point space with all pairwise distances equal to 1 into the real line R.\n    It does so by showing that the system of distance equations has no solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let X = {p1, p2, p3} be an ultrametric space where d(pi, pj) = 1 for i != j.\")\n    print(\"Let B be the Banach space of real numbers R with the standard absolute value norm.\")\n    print(\"We search for an isometric embedding f: X -> R.\")\n    print(\"This requires finding f(p1), f(p2), f(p3) in R satisfying the distance conditions.\")\n\n    # An isometric embedding preserves distances, so we must satisfy:\n    # |f(p1) - f(p2)| = 1\n    # |f(p2) - f(p3)| = 1\n    # |f(p1) - f(p3)| = 1\n\n    # An isometry remains an isometry after translation.
