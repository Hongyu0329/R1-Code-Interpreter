    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  First, I will define what a batting Triple Crown in MLB is: leading one's respective league (American or National) in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in all in the same season.\n2.  Next, I will compile a list of all the players who have achieved this feat throughout MLB history.\n3.  Since some players have won it more than once, I will count the number of unique players from this list.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this data, prints the name of each unique winner, and then calculates and prints the total number of unique winners.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# A list of all MLB batting Triple Crown wins.\n# Each tuple contains the year, player's name, and league.\ntriple_crown_wins = [\n    (1878, \"Paul Hines\", \"NL\"),\n    (1887, \"Tip O'Neill\", \"AA\"),\n    (1901, \"Nap Lajoie\", \"AL\"),\n    (1909, \"Ty Cobb\", \"AL\"),\n    (1912, \"Heinie Zimmerman\", \"NL\"),\n    (1922, \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"NL\"),\n    (1925, \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"NL\"),\n    (1933, \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"AL\"),\n    (1933, \"Chuck Klein\", \"NL\"),\n    (1934, \"Lou Gehrig\", \"AL\"),\n    (1937, \"Joe Medwick\", \"NL\"),\n    (1942, \"Ted Williams\", \"AL\"),\n    (1947, \"Ted Williams\", \"AL\"),\n    (1956, \"Mickey Mantle\", \"AL\"),\n    (1966, \"Frank Robinson\", \"AL\"),\n    (1967, \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"AL\"),\n    (2012, \"Miguel Cabrera\", \"AL\"),\n]\n\n# Use a set to get the unique player names to avoid double-counting.\nunique_winners = sorted(list(set(player for year, player, league in triple_crown_wins)))\n\nprint(\"The MLB Triple Crown winners are:\")\nfor winner in unique_winners:\n    print(winner)\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique winners.\nnum_winners = len(unique_winners)\n\n# Create and print the equation as requested.\nequation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_winners\nequation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\nprint(f\"\\nCounting each unique winner:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {num_winners}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nIn total, there are {num_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
