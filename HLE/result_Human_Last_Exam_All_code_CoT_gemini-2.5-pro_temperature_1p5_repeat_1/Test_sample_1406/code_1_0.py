def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function solves the topological problem about n-cubes as sets of non-block points.

    Problem Statement:
    A continuum is a compact connected metric space. A space S is continuum-connected
    if for any x, y in S, there exists a continuum K with {x, y} subset K subset S.
    A point p in a continuum X is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a
    continuum-connected dense subset.
    For how many n = 1, 2, 3, ... does the n-cube [0,1]^n fail to occur as the set
    of non-block points of a continuum?

    Method:
    We use a theorem from continuum theory and analyze cases for n=1 and n>=2.

    Theorem (Whyburn): The set of non-block points N(X) of a continuum X is
    either empty or a dense G_delta subset of X.

    # Analysis for n = 1:
    # Assume there exists a continuum X such that N(X) = [0,1].
    # 1. Since N(X) = [0,1] is not empty, by the theorem, it must be dense in X.
    # 2. [0,1] is compact, hence it is a closed subset of the metric space X.
    # 3. A set that is both dense and closed in a space must be the space itself. So, X = [0,1].
    # 4. Now we must check if N([0,1]) equals [0,1].
    #    A point p in (0,1) is a cut point. [0,1]\{p} is disconnected. Any dense subset
    #    of a disconnected space is also disconnected, and thus not continuum-connected.
    #    So, points in (0,1) are NOT non-block points.
    # 5. This contradicts the assumption N(X) = [0,1].
    # 6. Therefore, for n=1, the n-cube cannot be the set of non-block points.
    n1_fails = True

    # Analysis for n >= 2:
    # Consider the continuum X = [0,1]^n for n >= 2.
    # 1. Let p be any point in X. The set S = X \ {p} is path-connected for n>=2.
    # 2. A path-connected space is continuum-connected. So S is continuum-connected.
    # 3. S is an open subset of X, so it's dense in itself.
    # 4. Thus, S is a continuum-connected dense subset of itself.
    # 5. This means every point p in [0,1]^n (for n>=2) is a non-block point.
    # 6. So, N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n for n>=2. The n-cube does occur for n>=2.

    # Final Answer
    # The question asks for how many such n exist.
    # The only failing case is n=1. So the count is 1.
