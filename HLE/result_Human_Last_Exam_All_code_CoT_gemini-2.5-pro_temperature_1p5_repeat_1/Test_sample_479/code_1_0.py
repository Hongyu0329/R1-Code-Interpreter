def solve_genus_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem of finding the maximal genus of a specific type of surface.

    The problem states that Omega is a compact region in R^3 with a smooth connected
    boundary, and the mean curvature vector of the boundary never vanishes.

    Based on deep results in differential geometry (related to the positive mass theorem):
    1. If the mean curvature vector points everywhere outward from the bounded region,
       the surface must be a sphere (genus 0).
    2. If the mean curvature vector points everywhere inward, the surface must have
       genus 1.

    Combining these two cases, the possible genera are 0 and 1. The maximal genus
    is therefore 1.
