    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we denote as $\\pi_i$. This implies that their derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nThe given system of differential equations thus transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $\\pi_i$:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nWe can solve this system to find the values of $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2,$ and $\\pi_3$.\nFrom equations (1), (3), and (4), we express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2,$ and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$:\n*   From (1): $\\pi_{0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_{1}$\n*   From (3): $\\pi_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_{1}$\n*   From (4): $\\pi_{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_{2}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\pi_2$ into the one for $\\pi_3$ gives $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$. We then substitute all these expressions into the normalization equation (5) to solve for $\\pi_1$. Once $\\pi_1$ is found, we can easily calculate $\\pi_0$ and the required sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# We express pi_0, pi_2, and pi_3 in terms of pi_1.\n# pi_0 = c0 * pi_1\n# pi_2 = c2 * pi_1\n# pi_3 = c3_2 * pi_2 = c3_2 * c2 * pi_1 = c3 * pi_1\nc0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\nc2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\nc3_2 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\nc3 = c3_2 * c2\n\n# From the normalization equation: pi_0 + pi_1 + pi_2 + pi_3 = 1\n# (c0 * pi_1) + pi_1 + (c2 * pi_1) + (c3 * pi_1) = 1\n# pi_1 * (c0 + 1 + c2 + c3) = 1\nsum_of_coeffs = c0 + 1 + c2 + c3\npi_1 = 1 / sum_of_coeffs\n\n# Now calculate pi_0\npi_0 = c0 * pi_1\n\n# The required value is pi_0 + pi_1\nresult = pi_0 + pi_1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\n# Using f-strings to format the numbers to a reasonable precision\nprint(f\"The steady-state probabilities P0(+inf) and P1(+inf) are:\")\nprint(f\"P0(+inf) = {pi_0}\")\nprint(f\"P1(+inf) = {pi_1}\")\nprint(f\"The sum is P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {pi_0} + {pi_1} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
