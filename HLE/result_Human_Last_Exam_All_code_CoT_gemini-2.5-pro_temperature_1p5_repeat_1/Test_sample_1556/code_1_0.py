# The problem defines a quantum operator B. Its properties lead to a specific
# probability for measuring the |0> state in any output.

# From Property 1: P(1) = P(0)^2
# From Property 2: P(0) + P(1) = 1
# Combining them gives the quadratic equation: P(0)^2 + P(0) - 1 = 0.
# We solve this for P(0).
# The coefficients are a=1, b=1, c=-1.
a = 1
b = 1
c = -1

# Using the quadratic formula: P(0) = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
# We take the positive root because probability must be non-negative.
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
p0 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * a)

# Property 3 (B^2 = I) implies that applying B to the output state |ψ'>
# returns the input state |ψ>. The probability of measuring |0> in |ψ> is |α|².
# |α|² = |<0|ψ>|² = |<0|B|ψ'>|².
# This value is the probability of measuring |0> from the operator B, which we calculated as p0.
