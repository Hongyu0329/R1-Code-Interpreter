    # --- Reasoning ---
    # 1. A child's position P must be such that their view to tree E is blocked by one of the
    #    visible trees {A, B, C, D}. Let's call the blocking tree T_E. This means P, T_E, and E are collinear.
    # 2. Similarly, the view to tree F must be blocked by a tree T_F from {A, B, C, D}.
    #    This means P, T_F, and F are collinear.
    # 3. The position of a child is therefore at the intersection of the line passing through T_E and E,
    #    and the line passing through T_F and F.
    # 4. The tree blocking E (T_E) and the tree blocking F (T_F) cannot be the same.
    #    If they were the same tree (e.g., tree A), then A, E, and F would have to be on the same line.
    #    This is forbidden by condition (2) of the problem, which states no three trees are collinear.
    # 5. So, we must choose an ordered pair of two *different* trees from the set {A, B, C, D}.
    #    The first tree in the pair blocks E, and the second blocks F.

    # --- Calculation ---
    # Number of choices for the tree that blocks E.
    choices_for_T_E = num_blocking_trees

    # Number of choices for the tree that blocks F (must be different from T_E).
    choices_for_T_F = num_blocking_trees - 1

    # The maximum number of children is the total number of such ordered pairs.
    # This is a permutation of 2 items from a set of 4.
    max_children = choices_for_T_E * choices_for_T_F

    # --- Output ---
