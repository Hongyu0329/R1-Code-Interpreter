    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that are solutions to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$.\n\n2.  **Initial Strategy - Brute Force:** A simple approach would be to use five nested loops, one for each variable $x_i$, from 0 up to $\\sqrt{2024} \\approx 45$. This would involve approximately $45^5$ iterations, which is too slow for practical execution.\n\n3.  **Optimized Strategy:** A much more efficient method is to find the unique *combinations* of numbers that satisfy the equation first, and then calculate how many unique ordered solutions (permutations) each combination can generate.\n    *   To find the unique combinations efficiently, we enforce an order on the variables, such as $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$. This constraint dramatically prunes the search space.\n    *   We can use four nested loops for $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$. The fifth value, $x_5$, is then determined by the equation: $x_5^2 = 2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)$.\n    *   For each set of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, we calculate the remaining value needed for $x_5^2$. We then check if this value is a perfect square.\n    *   The loop boundaries will be optimized. For instance, $5x_1^2 \\le x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, so $x_1 \\le \\sqrt{2024/5} \\approx 20$. This makes the search much faster.\n\n4.  **Counting the Solutions:**\n    *   If a valid combination $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ is found, we count the number of distinct ordered tuples it can form.\n    *   This is a permutation problem. If a combination has numbers with counts $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$, the number of permutations is $\\frac{5!}{c_1! c_2! \\dots c_k!}$.\n    *   We sum these permutation counts for all unique combinations found.\n\n5.  **Implementation Details:**\n    *   The Python code will implement the optimized strategy with four nested loops.\n    *   To robustly check for perfect squares and calculate integer square roots, we will use `math.isqrt()`.\n    *   To fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will print each valid combination found and show how their squares sum up to 2024.\n    *   Finally, the total count will be printed.\n\n### Python Code\n\nHere is the Python script to solve the problem.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation\n    x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of non-negative integer solutions for the equation:\")\n    print(f\"x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = {target}\\n\")\n    print(\"The unique combinations of integers (x1...x5 with x1<=x2<=...<=x5) whose squares sum to the target are:\\n\")\n\n    # Use optimized loop limits based on the ordering x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5\n    limit1 = math.isqrt(target // 5)\n    for x1 in range(limit1 + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        limit2 = math.isqrt((target - s1) // 4)\n        for x2 in range(x1, limit2 + 1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            limit3 = math.isqrt((target - s1 - s2) // 3)\n            for x3 in range(x2, limit3 + 1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                limit4 = math.isqrt((target - s1 - s2 - s3) // 2)\n                for x4 in range(x3, limit4 + 1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    \n                    rem_sq = target - (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4)\n                    \n                    if rem_sq >= 0:\n                        # Check if rem_sq is a perfect square using integer square root\n                        x5 = math.isqrt(rem_sq)\n                        if x5 * x5 == rem_sq:\n                            # We must maintain the order x5 >= x4\n                            if x5 >= x4:\n                                combo = (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)\n                                squares = [n*n for n in combo]\n                                sum_of_squares = sum(squares)\n                                \n                                # This equation shows one of the found combinations\n                                print(f\"Combination {combo}:\")\n                                equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, squares))\n                                print(f\"  {x1}² + {x2}² + {x3}² + {x4}² + {x5}² = {equation_str} = {sum_of_squares}\")\n\n                                # Calculate permutations for this combination\n                                counts = Counter(combo)\n                                permutations = math.factorial(5)\n                                for count in counts.values():\n                                    permutations //= math.factorial(count)\n                                \n                                total_solutions += permutations\n    \n    print(\"\\nSumming the number of distinct permutations for each unique combination gives the total.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is {total_solutions}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_diophantine_equation()\n```\n<<<4640>>>"
