    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Geometry:** The problem describes a triangle ABC where we know the length of one side (`BC = S`), one angle (`∠B = 30°`), and we are considering different integer lengths for another side (`AC`). We need to find how many possible integer lengths of `AC` lead to exactly two possible lengths for the third side (`AB`).\n2.  **Apply the Ambiguous Case (SSA):** This scenario, where we have two sides and a non-included angle (Side-Side-Angle), is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. For there to be two distinct possible triangles, the length of the side opposite the given angle (`AC`) must be greater than the triangle's altitude from vertex C to side AB, but less than the length of the other given side (`BC`).\n3.  **Formulate the Inequality:** Let's denote the side lengths `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `a = S` and `∠B = 30°`. The altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB has length `h = a * sin(B)`. The condition for two possible triangles is `h < b < a`. Plugging in our values, this becomes `S * sin(30°) < AC < S`. Since `sin(30°) = 0.5`, the condition simplifies to `S/2 < AC < S`.\n4.  **Determine the value of S:** The variable `S` is defined as `SNYWR`. This appears to be a simple alphabetic-to-numeric cipher. I will convert each letter to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ...) and sum the values to get `S`.\n    *   S = 19\n    *   N = 14\n    *   Y = 25\n    *   W = 23\n    *   R = 18\n    *   Sum = `19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`. So, `S = 99`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Count:** With `S = 99`, the inequality for `AC` is `99/2 < AC < 99`, or `49.5 < AC < 99`. I will count the number of integers that satisfy this condition. The smallest integer is 50, and the largest is 98.\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step of the solution, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_triangle_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the ambiguous triangle problem based on the given parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the value of S from SNYWR\n    s_word = \"SNYWR\"\n    s_components = [ord(char) - ord('A') + 1 for char in s_word]\n    S = sum(s_components)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the value of S from SNYWR.\")\n    print(\"Each letter is converted to its alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, ...).\")\n    s_equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, s_components))\n    print(f\"S = {s_word[0]} + {s_word[1]} + {s_word[2]} + {s_word[3]} + {s_word[4]} = {s_equation_str} = {S}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the condition for two possible triangles\n    # The condition is S * sin(30) < AC < S. sin(30) = 0.5.\n    lower_bound = S / 2\n    upper_bound = S\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the condition for the length of AC.\")\n    print(\"For two possible triangles (ambiguous SSA case), the length of AC must be\")\n    print(\"strictly between BC * sin(B) and BC.\")\n    print(f\"Given BC = S = {S} and m∠B = 30°, with sin(30°) = 0.5:\")\n    print(f\"The condition is: {S} * 0.5 < AC < {S}\")\n    print(f\"Which simplifies to: {lower_bound} < AC < {upper_bound}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of integer values for AC\n    # The first integer greater than lower_bound is math.floor(lower_bound) + 1\n    # The last integer less than upper_bound is upper_bound - 1\n    first_integer = math.floor(lower_bound) + 1\n    last_integer = upper_bound - 1\n    \n    # The number of integers is last - first + 1\n    count = last_integer - first_integer + 1\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of integer values for AC.\")\n    print(f\"We need to count the integers in the interval ({lower_bound}, {upper_bound}).\")\n    print(f\"The smallest integer value for AC is {first_integer}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest integer value for AC is {last_integer}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation for the number of integer values is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of values = {last_integer} - {first_integer} + 1 = {count}\")\n\nsolve_triangle_problem()\n```\n<<<49>>>"
