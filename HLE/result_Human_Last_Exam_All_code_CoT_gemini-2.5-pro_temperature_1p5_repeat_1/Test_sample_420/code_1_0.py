# This script calculates the ratio of a specific area on a cube's surface to the total surface area.
# The problem defines a region D on the surface S of a cube with side length s.
# D is the set of points with a surface distance of at most sqrt(2)*s from a vertex P.
#
# The derivation involves calculating the area of D on the 3 faces adjacent to P
# and the 3 faces remote from P, summing them, and dividing by the total surface area (6*s^2).
#
# The final result is a numerical ratio, independent of the side length s.
# The derived ratio is (pi + 3) / 12.

# The numbers that form the final equation for the ratio are: pi, 3, and 12.
# We use the sympy library to represent pi symbolically.
pi_symbol = sympy.pi
numerator_number = 3
denominator_number = 12

# We are asked to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is: Ratio = (pi + 3) / 12
