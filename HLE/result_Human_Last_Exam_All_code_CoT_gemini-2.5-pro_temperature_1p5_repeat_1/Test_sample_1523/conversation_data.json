    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the inner product followed by a Python script to represent the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Start with the Partition Function**: In finite-temperature field theory, we work with the partition function `Z`, which is a functional integral over the field `ϕ`:\n    `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n    where `S_E` is the Euclidean action.\n\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action**: For a neutral scalar field `ϕ` with mass `m`, the Euclidean action `S_E` is given by:\n    `S_E[ϕ] = ∫ dτ ∫ d³x [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² + V(ϕ) ]`\n    Here, `τ` is the imaginary time, integrated from `0` to `β = 1/T` (where `T` is the temperature). The `V(ϕ)` term contains interactions.\n\n3.  **Isolate the Free Action**: The inner product structure comes from the quadratic (or \"free\") part of the action, `S_0`, where we set `V(ϕ) = 0`:\n    `S_0[ϕ] = ∫ dτ ∫ d³x [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]`\n\n4.  **Rewrite the Action using Integration by Parts**: To reveal the operator structure, we can perform integration by parts on the derivative terms. Assuming the field vanishes at spatial infinity and using its periodicity in `τ`, the boundary terms vanish. This gives:\n    `S_0[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ`\n\n5.  **Identify the Inner Product**: This expression is in the form `(1/2) (ϕ, D_ϕ)`. This leads to the following definitions:\n    *   **Operator `D`**: The differential operator `D` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator: `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`.\n    *   **Inner Product `(f, g)`**: The inner product is defined as the integral over Euclidean spacetime: `(f, g) = ∫ dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x)g(τ, x)`.\n\n6.  **The Final Expression**: Therefore, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is the integral of `ϕ` multiplied by the result of the operator `D` acting on `ϕ`:\n    `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)`\n\nThe Python code below uses the `sympy` library to symbolically represent this expression and its equivalent in momentum space, where calculations are often performed.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_field_theory_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script uses the SymPy library to define and display the inner product\n    (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    It shows the representation in both configuration space and momentum space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize pretty printing for clear mathematical output\n    sympy.init_printing(use_unicode=True)\n\n    print(\"--- Inner Product in Configuration Space ---\")\n\n    # Define the necessary symbols for configuration space\n    phi = sympy.Function('ϕ')\n    tau = sympy.Symbol('τ', real=True) # Imaginary time\n    x, y, z = sympy.symbols('x y z', real=True) # Spatial coordinates\n    m = sympy.Symbol('m', real=True, positive=True) # Mass\n    beta = sympy.Symbol('β', real=True, positive=True) # Inverse temperature, β = 1/T\n\n    # Define the scalar field ϕ as a function of Euclidean spacetime\n    phi_spacetime = phi(tau, x, y, z)\n\n    # Define the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n    # The numbers in the operator definition are the exponents '2' and the implicit coefficients '-1' and '+1'.\n    D_phi = -sympy.diff(phi_spacetime, tau, 2) \\\n            - sympy.diff(phi_spacetime, x, 2) \\\n            - sympy.diff(phi_spacetime, y, 2) \\\n            - sympy.diff(phi_spacetime, z, 2) \\\n            + m**2 * phi_spacetime\n\n    print(\"The operator D, acting on the field ϕ, is D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m².\")\n    print(\"The result Dϕ is:\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_phi)\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers appearing in the operator are the implicit coefficients -1 and 1, and the exponent 2.\")\n\n    # Define the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) as the integral of ϕ * (Dϕ)\n    integrand = phi_spacetime * D_phi\n    inner_product_integral = sympy.Integral(\n        integrand,\n        (tau, 0, beta),\n        (x, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo),\n        (y, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo),\n        (z, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo)\n    )\n\n    print(\"\\nThe full inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is the integral over Euclidean spacetime:\")\n    sympy.pprint(inner_product_integral)\n\n\n    print(\"\\n\\n--- Inner Product in Momentum Space ---\")\n    # This representation is often more useful for calculations.\n\n    # Define symbols for momentum space\n    phi_tilde = sympy.Function('~ϕ') # Fourier mode of the field\n    omega_n = sympy.Symbol('ω_n', real=True) # Matsubara frequency\n    px, py, pz = sympy.symbols('p_x p_y p_z', real=True) # 3-momentum components\n    p_squared = px**2 + py**2 + pz**2 # Squared magnitude of 3-momentum\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n', integer=True) # Matsubara mode index\n    pi = sympy.pi # The number pi\n\n    # In momentum space, the differential operator D becomes an algebraic factor\n    momentum_space_factor = (omega_n**2 + p_squared + m**2)\n\n    print(\"In momentum space, the inner product becomes a sum over Matsubara modes (n) and an\")\n    print(\"integral over 3-momentum (p).
