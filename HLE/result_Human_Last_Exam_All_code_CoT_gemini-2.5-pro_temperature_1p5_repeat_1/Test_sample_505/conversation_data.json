    "To solve this, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Encoding Principle:** For a planar surface code (which is the standard type of \"patch\"), the number of logical qubits it can encode is simply equal to the number of \"holes\" or enclosed boundaries created within it.\n2.  **Consider Multiple Patches:** When there are multiple, separate patches of surface code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each individual patch.\n3.  **Analyze the Constraints:** We have 2 patches and a total of 2 holes to distribute between them.\n4.  **Calculate for Different Distributions:** We can put both holes in one patch, or one hole in each patch. We will calculate the total number of logical qubits for each scenario.\n5.  **Determine the Maximum:** The maximum value from these calculations will be our answer. The calculation will show that the total number of logical qubits is always equal to the total number of holes, regardless of their distribution.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given number\n    of surface code patches and holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_patches = 2\n    total_holes = 2\n\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits in a single planar surface code patch is equal to the number of holes it contains.\")\n    print(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from all individual patches.\")\n    print(f\"\\nWe have {num_patches} patches and a total of {total_holes} holes.\")\n    print(\"Let's consider the possible distributions of holes:\")\n\n    # Case 1: 2 holes in the first patch, 0 in the second.\n    holes_patch1_case1 = 2\n    holes_patch2_case1 = 0\n    logical_qubits_case1 = holes_patch1_case1 + holes_patch2_case1\n    \n    print(\"\\nDistribution 1: One patch has 2 holes, the other has 0.\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = (qubits from patch 1) + (qubits from patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = {holes_patch1_case1} + {holes_patch2_case1} = {logical_qubits_case1}\")\n\n    # Case 2: 1 hole in the first patch, 1 in the second.\n    holes_patch1_case2 = 1\n    holes_patch2_case2 = 1\n    logical_qubits_case2 = holes_patch1_case2 + holes_patch2_case2\n\n    print(\"\\nDistribution 2: Each patch has 1 hole.\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = (qubits from patch 1) + (qubits from patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = {holes_patch1_case2} + {holes_patch2_case2} = {logical_qubits_case2}\")\n\n    # The maximum is the same in all cases.\n    max_logical_qubits = total_holes\n    print(f\"\\nSince the total is always {max_logical_qubits}, this is the maximum possible value.\")\n\nsolve_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
