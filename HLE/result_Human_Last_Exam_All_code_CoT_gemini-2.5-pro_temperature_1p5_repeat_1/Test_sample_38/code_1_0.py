# Define the mass 'm' as a symbolic variable
m = sympy.Symbol('m')

# From the derivation, the equation of motion for the scalar mode 'h' is:
# (Box - m^2)h = 0
# The standard Klein-Gordon equation is (Box + M^2)h = 0, where M^2 is the squared mass.
# By comparing the two equations, we have M^2 = -m^2.

# Let's represent m^2 as m_squared
m_squared = m**2

# The squared mass of the 6th degree of freedom is M^2
M_squared = -m_squared

# The problem gives that the squared mass of the other 5 degrees of freedom is m^2.
# Let's state the final result.
m_val = 5 # An example value for m to show the calculation
print(f"Let the parameter 'm' from the Lagrangian be m = {m_val}.")
print(f"The squared mass of the first 5 degrees of freedom is m^2 = {m_val**2}.")
print(f"The equation for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom (M^2) is:")
print(f"M^2 = -m^2")
# Final calculated value
final_M_squared = -(m_val**2)
print(f"So, the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom is {final_M_squared}.")

# The final answer is the expression in terms of m^2
final_answer_expr = -m**2

# The sympy.pretty_print function can display the expression nicely.
