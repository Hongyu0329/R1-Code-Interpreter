    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python script that implements Bresenham's line algorithm to determine all the integer coordinates (pixels) on the line segment from (1, 1) to (11, 5).\n2.  The algorithm will iterate from the start point to the end point, storing each pixel's coordinates in a list. Since the change in x (10) is greater than the change in y (4), the algorithm will increment x by 1 at each step and decide whether to increment y based on a decision parameter.\n3.  Once the list of all pixels on the line is complete, I will count the number of pixels.\n4.  The central pixel will be the one located at the middle index of this list. I can find this index by dividing the total number of pixels by 2 using integer division.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the coordinates of this central pixel.\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel_bresenham():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm.\n    The line is hardcoded from (1, 1) to (11, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    pixels = []\n    x, y = x1, y1\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n\n    # This is a simplified version for slopes between 0 and 1.\n    # Decision parameter\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n\n    # Add the starting point\n    pixels.append((x, y))\n\n    # Iterate from x1 to x2-1\n    while x < x2:\n        x += 1\n        if p < 0:\n            p = p + 2 * dy\n            # y does not change\n        else:\n            p = p + 2 * dy - 2 * dx\n            y += 1\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Find the middle index of the list of pixels.\n    # For a list with an odd number of elements, this gives the exact center.\n    middle_index = len(pixels) // 2\n    central_pixel = pixels[middle_index]\n\n    # Output the coordinates of the central pixel\n    print(f\"The coordinates of the central pixel are ({central_pixel[0]}, {central_pixel[1]})\")\n\nfind_central_pixel_bresenham()\n<<< (6, 3) >>>\n```"
