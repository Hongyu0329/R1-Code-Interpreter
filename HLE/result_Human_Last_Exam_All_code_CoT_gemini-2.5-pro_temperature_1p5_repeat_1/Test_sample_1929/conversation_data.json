    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the reaction product.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction**: First, I will identify the two reactants: `butadiene` (specifically 1,3-butadiene) and `1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene`. I will recognize that this is a classic organic chemistry reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile (an alkene). This type of reaction is called a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n2.  **Determine the Product**: I will determine the product's structure and molecular formula. In a Diels-Alder reaction, a new six-membered ring is formed. The molecular formula of the product is simply the sum of the atoms from the two reactants.\n    *   Butadiene: C₄H₆\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: C₂Cl₂F₂\n    *   Product: C₄+₂H₆Cl₂F₂ = C₆H₆Cl₂F₂\n    The product is a cyclohexene derivative named **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n3.  **Develop Python Code**: I will write a Python script that models this chemical addition. The script will represent the molecules and their atom counts using dictionaries. It will then combine these dictionaries to find the composition of the product and format the reactants and product into a final chemical equation, ensuring all numbers in the formulas are printed.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_formula(atom_counts):\n    \"\"\"Converts a dictionary of atom counts into a chemical formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order for organic compounds: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest\n    formula = \"\"\n    if 'C' in atom_counts:\n        count = atom_counts['C']\n        formula += 'C'\n        if count > 1:\n            formula += str(count)\n    if 'H' in atom_counts:\n        count = atom_counts['H']\n        formula += 'H'\n        if count > 1:\n            formula += str(count)\n    \n    # Add other elements alphabetically\n    other_elements = sorted([elem for elem in atom_counts if elem not in ['C', 'H']])\n    for elem in other_elements:\n        count = atom_counts[elem]\n        formula += elem\n        if count > 1:\n            formula += str(count)\n    return formula\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the product of the reaction between\n    butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants using dictionaries for atom counts.\n    butadiene = {'C': 4, 'H': 6}\n    dienophile = {'C': 2, 'Cl': 2, 'F': 2}\n\n    # Step 2: The reaction is a 1:1 addition (Diels-Alder).\n    # We use a Counter to easily add the atom counts.\n    product_atoms = collections.Counter(butadiene) + collections.Counter(dienophile)\n\n    # Step 3: Format the chemical formulas from the atom counts.\n    butadiene_formula = get_formula(butadiene)\n    dienophile_formula = get_formula(dienophile)\n    product_formula = get_formula(product_atoms)\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition.\")\n    print(\"This reaction forms a new six-membered ring.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final reaction equation is:\")\n    \n    # The equation contains all the required numbers within the molecular formulas.\n    # Reactant 1 + Reactant 2 -> Product\n    equation = f\"{butadiene_formula} + {dienophile_formula} -> {product_formula}\"\n    print(equation)\n    \n    print(\"\\nProduct Name: 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\")\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<C6H6Cl2F2>>>"
