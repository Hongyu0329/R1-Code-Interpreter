    "My plan is to first identify the key elements of your question: the artist (Curt Querner), the year (1933), the context (after escaping the Gestapo), and the object in question (the symbol of resistance).\n\nI will then write a Python script that assigns these pieces of information to variables. The script will use an f-string to construct and print a sentence that directly answers your question, incorporating the details from the variables. This approach uses code to present the factual answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"after escaping from the Gestapo\"\n    symbolic_object = \"Carline thistle\"\n    symbolism = \"resistance and defiance\"\n\n    print(f\"In his self-portrait from the year {year}, painted {event}, artist {artist} holds a {symbolic_object}.\")\n    print(f\"The thistle, a prickly and resilient plant, serves as a symbol of his {symbolism}.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<A Carline thistle>>>"
