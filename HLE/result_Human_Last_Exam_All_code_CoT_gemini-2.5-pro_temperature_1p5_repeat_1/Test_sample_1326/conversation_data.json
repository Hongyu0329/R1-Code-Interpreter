    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$. The function is defined in two parts, and the interval of integration spans across the boundary at $x=3$. Therefore, we must split the integral into two parts:\n\n1.  The integral of the first function definition, $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$, from $x = 0$ to $x = 3$.\n2.  The integral of the second function definition, $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$, from $x = 3$ to $x = 4$.\n\nThe total integral is the sum of these two parts:\n$$ \\int_0^4 p(x) \\,dx = \\int_0^3 \\frac{2x^3}{8} \\,dx + \\int_3^4 \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} \\,dx $$\n\nWe can solve this using Python by defining each part of the function and then using a numerical integration library like `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the definite integrals. The final result will be the sum of the two computed values.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan:\n*   It defines the two functions corresponding to the different intervals.\n*   It uses `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the integral for each part.\n*   It sums the results to get the total integral.\n*   It prints out the breakdown of the calculation and the final equation with the computed values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the piecewise function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p_part1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function represents p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3.\n  p(x) = 2x^3 / 8\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the piecewise function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p_part2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function represents p(x) for 3 <= x <= 5.\n  p(x) = e^x(1+sin x)/(1+cos x)\n  \"\"\"\n  # Using numpy functions for exponential, sine, and cosine\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Set the integration limits\nlower_bound_total = 0\nupper_bound_total = 4\nsplit_point = 3\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part from 0 to 3\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an error estimate. We only need the result.\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p_part1, lower_bound_total, split_point)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p_part2, split_point, upper_bound_total)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(\"To find the integral from 0 to 4, we split the integral at x = 3:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 3 of (2x^3/8) dx = {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 3 to 4 of (e^x(1+sinx)/(1+cosx)) dx = {integral2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is the sum of these two values:\")\nprint(f\"{integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n<<< -397.46506838439915 >>>"
