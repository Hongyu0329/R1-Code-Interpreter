    # at a standard point x_0 is that for any x_1 infinitesimally close to x_0,

    # to be continuous on the entire domain.
    #
    # Let's represent this formally:
    # "For all standard points x_0 in X" is written as: ∀x₀ ∈ X
    # "For all points x_1 (standard or nonstandard) in X*" is written as: ∀x₁ ∈ X*
    # "x_0 is infinitesimally close to x_1" is written as: x₀ ~ x₁

    # The condition is: ∀x₀ ∈ X, ∀x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⟹ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)

    # This corresponds to option B.
