# Plan:
# 1. Define constants and input parameters in SI units.
# 2. Calculate the mass M of the black hole Pegasi using Kepler's Third Law for its orbiting planet, Pandora.
# 3. Use the mass M to calculate the Schwarzschild radius Rs of Pegasi.
# 4. Calculate the time dilation factor f for the Pioneer probe at a distance d = 13 km from the event horizon.
# 5. Determine the memory usage z for the most memory-efficient Bagua C program that can perform this calculation.
# 6. Print all calculation steps, the breakdown of the final equation, and the final answer in the f:z format.

# Step 1: Define Constants and Parameters
# Physical constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
c = 299792458     # Speed of light (m/s)

# Pandora's orbital parameters (for calculating Pegasi's mass)
T_days = 800
T_seconds = T_days * 24 * 3600  # Orbital period in seconds
a_km = 100e6
a_meters = a_km * 1000          # Orbital radius in meters

# Pioneer's distance from the event horizon
d_km = 13
d_meters = d_km * 1000

# Step 2: Calculate Mass M of Pegasi
# Using Kepler's Third Law: M = (4 * pi^2 * a^3) / (G * T^2)
M = (4 * math.pi**2 * a_meters**3) / (G * T_seconds**2)

# Step 3: Calculate Schwarzschild Radius Rs
# The formula is Rs = 2 * G * M / c^2
Rs = (2 * G * M) / (c**2)

# Step 4: Calculate Time Dilation Factor f
# The total distance r from the center of the black hole is the distance from the event horizon (d) plus the radius of the event horizon itself (Rs).
r = d_meters + Rs
# The time dilation formula is f = 1 / sqrt(1 - Rs/r)
f_raw = 1 / math.sqrt(1 - (Rs / r))

# Round the final factor f to 3 decimal places as required.
f_rounded = round(f_raw, 3)

# Step 5: Determine Memory Usage z for the Bagua C program
# To be memory-efficient, the C program would pre-calculate Rs and store it as a constant.
# The program calculates f based on an input distance d.
# The most efficient C code would minimize the number of declared variables:
#   frac Rs = ...;         // Constant for Schwarzschild radius. Requires `frac` type. Size: 8 trits
#   int d = 13000;         // Input distance. 13000 > 4095 (max for wchar), so `int` is needed. Size: 8 trits
#   frac f = ...;          // Final result. Requires `frac` type. Size: 8 trits
# A single expression can compute f: `f = 1 / sqrt(1 - Rs / (d + Rs));`
# This requires 3 variables in the program source.
# Memory usage (z) = size_of(Rs) + size_of(d) + size_of(f)
z = 8 + 8 + 8

# Step 6: Print the full breakdown and the final answer.
