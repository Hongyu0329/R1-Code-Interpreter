    # Reasoning
    reasoning = """
    1. The enzyme is an obligate dimer, meaning it must be in a two-subunit complex to be active.
    2. Chilling on ice can cause some multi-subunit enzymes to dissociate into their inactive monomer components. This is known as cold lability.
    3. The most likely cause of the non-linear plot is a 'lag phase'. The chilling step causes the active dimers to break apart. When the reaction is started, time is required for the inactive monomers to re-associate into active dimers.
    4. This re-association process results in a reaction rate that starts low and increases over time, producing a non-linear (upward curving) plot.
    5. To fix this, we must create conditions that favor the stable, active dimer from the beginning of the reaction.
    """

    # Evaluation of choices
    evaluation = """
    A. Increase temperature: This is the best solution. It counteracts the effect of chilling, promotes the rapid formation of active dimers, and helps achieve a stable, linear reaction rate from the start.
    B. Decrease temperature: This would worsen the problem by favoring dissociation.
    C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: This might shorten the lag but doesn't fix the underlying issue causing the non-linearity.
    D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: This would slow down re-association and likely lengthen the lag phase.
