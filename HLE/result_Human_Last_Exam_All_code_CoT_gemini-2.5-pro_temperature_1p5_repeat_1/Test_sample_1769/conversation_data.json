    "To determine what the word \"sister\" would be in Modern English without the influence of the Old Norse language, we need to trace the linguistic path of the original Old English word.\n\nOur current word \"sister\" is a borrowing from Old Norse \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Norse invaders and settlers. It replaced the native Old English word. If this historical event had not occurred, the Old English word would have evolved naturally over the centuries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step linguistic deduction:\n\n1.  **Identify the Old English Word:** The word for \"sister\" in Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons) was **sweostor**.\n2.  **Trace its Evolution:** Languages change predictably over time. We can observe what happened to similar sounds and words in English. The Old English \"sweostor\" was documented to have evolved into **suster** in many English dialects during the Middle English period. This change involved two key steps:\n    *   The initial consonant cluster `sw-` was simplified to `s-`.\n    *   The vowel sound represented by `eo` shifted to `u`.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The form \"suster\" was a real and common word in English for hundreds of years, competing with the Norse-derived \"sister.\" Eventually, \"sister\" won out and became the standard. Without the Norse influence, the native form \"suster\" would have been the most likely survivor to become the standard Modern English word.\n\nThe following Python script prints out this deduction.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_word_for_sister():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the likely Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse language had not influenced English.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1. Identify the original Old English and competing Old Norse words.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n\n    print(\"--- The Linguistic Problem ---\")\n    print(f\"Our current word 'sister' comes from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"To find the word without Norse influence, we must trace the evolution of the native Old English word: '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 2. Explain the evolution from Old English to Middle English.\n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- The Likely Evolution ---\")\n    print(f\"The Old English '{old_english_word}' evolved naturally into the Middle English form '{middle_english_form}'.\")\n    print(\"This happened through common sound changes:\")\n    print(\"1. Simplification of the initial 'sw-' sound to 's-'.\")\n    print(\"2. A shift in the vowel sound 'eo' to 'u'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 3. Present the conclusion.\n    final_word = middle_english_form\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- The Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The word '{final_word}' was widely used in parts of England for centuries.\")\n    print(\"Without the competition from the Norse '{old_norse_word}', it is the most likely candidate for the modern word.\")\n    print(\"\\nPredicted Modern English word for 'sister':\")\n    print(final_word)\n\nfind_native_word_for_sister()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
