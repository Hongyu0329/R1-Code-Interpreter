    # The starting material is a tertiary amide with two chiral groups on the nitrogen.
    # The reaction is a stereoselective aza-Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.
    # 1. LiHMDS creates a (Z)-lithium enolate from the propionyl group.
    # 2. Heating causes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    # The allyl group moves from the nitrogen to the alpha-carbon of the propionyl group.
    # The reaction creates two new stereocenters with high selectivity.
    # Based on established models for this reaction:
    # - The new center on the propanamide chain is (2R).
    # - The new center on the cyclopentyl ring (the point of attachment) is (2S).
    # - The existing methyl-bearing center on the ring remains (S), though its IUPAC number changes from 5 to 4.
    # The double bond shifts to an exocyclic position (a methylidene group).
