    # The problem describes a formula φ over n variables, where n ≥ 2.
    # We are looking for the minimum number of variables in a formula ψ that is
    # logically equivalent to φ.
    # This minimum number is determined by the size of the support of the Boolean
    # function defined by φ (i.e., the number of variables the function essentially depends on).

    # Let's break down the given conditions for φ:
    # 1. φ has exactly n distinct atomic variables.
    # 2. φ has exactly 2^(n-1) truth assignments that make it true (models).
    # 3. φ is not a tautology.
    # 4. For any two distinct models of φ, the assignments differ on at least one variable.

    # Analysis of the conditions:
    # - Condition 3 is a direct consequence of condition 2, because for n ≥ 2,
    #   the number of models 2^(n-1) is less than the total number of assignments 2^n.
    # - Condition 4 is always true for any two distinct truth assignments by definition.
    # - Condition 2 is the most powerful constraint. A Boolean function on n variables has
    #   exactly 2^(n-1) models if and only if it is a non-constant affine function
    #   (or its negation). An affine function is the XOR sum of a subset of variables.
    #   For example, a function like f(p_1, ..., p_n) = p_1 ⊕ p_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ p_k for 1 ≤ k ≤ n
    #   will have exactly 2^(n-1) models. The size of its support is k.

    # The Ambiguity:
    # The analysis above shows that a formula φ satisfying the conditions could depend on
    # k variables, where k could be any integer from 1 to n. For example, if n=4,
    # φ could be equivalent to p_1 (support size 1) or p_1 ⊕ p_2 ⊕ p_3 ⊕ p_4 (support size 4).
    # Both have 2^(4-1) = 8 models.
    # If the answer could be any k from 1 to n, the question "What is *the* minimum number..."
    # would be ill-posed.

    # Resolving the Ambiguity:
    # The ambiguity is resolved by Condition 1: "φ has exactly n distinct atomic variables."
    # In the context of logic puzzles, this is standardly interpreted to mean that the function
    # is non-degenerate and its support contains all n variables. In other words, φ essentially
    # depends on every single one of its n variables.

    # Conclusion:
    # Under this interpretation, the size of the support of φ must be n.
    # A logically equivalent formula ψ represents the same Boolean function, so it must
    # have the same support and depend on the same number of variables.
    # The fact that ψ uses only conjunction (∧) and negation (¬) does not change this, as
    # this set of connectives is functionally complete and can represent any Boolean function.
    
    # The equation for the minimum number of variables (min_vars) is therefore:
    # min_vars = n
    final_equation_variable = 'n'
    
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The properties of the formula φ, particularly the phrase 'with exactly n distinct atomic variables', imply that the function must depend on all n variables.")
    print("Therefore, the size of its support is n.")
    print("Any logically equivalent formula ψ must have the same support.")
    
    # In the final code, output each number in the final equation.
    # The final equation is simply that the number of variables is 'n'.
    print(f"\nThe minimum number of distinct atomic variables required in the equivalent formula ψ is: {final_equation_variable}")
