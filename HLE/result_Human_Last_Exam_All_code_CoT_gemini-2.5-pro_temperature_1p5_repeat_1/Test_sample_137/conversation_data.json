    "My plan is to solve this problem by calculating the Hurwitz number using the well-established character formula, also known as the Frobenius-Schur or Burnside formula. This formula connects the number of solutions to a group-theoretical equation to the characters of the irreducible representations of the group.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Identify the group and parameters.** The problem is about counting covers of $\\mathbb{P}^1$, which translates to a factorization problem in the symmetric group $S_d$. Here, the degree is $d=7$, so the group is $S_7$. The number of branch points is $k=4$.\n\n2.  **Define the ramification profiles.** The ramification profiles are given as partitions of the degree $d=7$:\n    *   $\\mu_1 = (4,3)$\n    *   $\\mu_2 = (5,2)$\n    *   $\\mu_3 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n    *   $\\mu_4 = (2,1,1,1,1,1) = (2, 1^5)$\n\n3.  **Use the character formula.** The number of ways to write the identity permutation as a product of four permutations $g_1 g_2 g_3 g_4 = \\text{id}$, where each $g_i$ belongs to the conjugacy class $C_{\\mu_i}$ determined by the partition $\\mu_i$, is given by:\n    $N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^4 |C_{\\mu_i}|}{|S_7|} \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash 7} \\frac{\\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_1) \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_2) \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_3) \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_4)}{(\\chi^\\lambda(id))^{4-2}}$\n    where the sum is over all irreducible representations of $S_7$, indexed by partitions $\\lambda$ of 7. $\\chi^\\lambda(\\mu)$ is the character of the representation $\\lambda$ on the conjugacy class $\\mu$, and $\\chi^\\lambda(id)$ is the dimension of the representation.\n\n4.  **Connect to the Hurwitz number.** For a genus 0 cover (as is the case here, confirmed by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula), the Hurwitz number $H$ is obtained by dividing this count $N$ by $d!$ to account for isomorphisms of the fibers. This gives:\n    $H = \\frac{N}{d!} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^4 |C_{\\mu_i}|}{(d!)^2} \\sum_{\\lambda \\vdash 7} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^4 \\chi^\\lambda(\\mu_i)}{(\\chi^\\lambda(id))^2}$\n\n5.  **Gather necessary data.** To perform the calculation, I will need:\n    *   The character table of $S_7$.\n    *   The sizes of the conjugacy classes $|C_\\mu|$ for the given partitions.\n    *   The size of the group, $d! = 7!$.\n\n6.  **Implement the calculation in Python.** I will define the character table and class sizes as data structures and then loop through all irreducible representations to compute the sum. Finally, I will plug all the values into the formula for $H$ and print the result as an equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for a given ramified cover problem\n    using the character formula for the symmetric group S_7.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 7\n    k = 4\n    \n    # Partitions for ramification profiles\n    # mu_1 = (4,3), mu_2 = (5,2), mu_3 = (2,1^5), mu_4 = (2,1^5)\n    \n    # Character table of S7.
