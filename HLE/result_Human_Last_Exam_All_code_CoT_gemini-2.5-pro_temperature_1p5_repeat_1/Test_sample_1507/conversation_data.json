    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the outer-hull:** The outer-hull, or convex hull, of a great icosahedron is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the surface:** The question is now simplified to finding the number of triangles on the surface of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its surface is already composed entirely of equilateral triangles.\n3.  **Calculate the number of faces:** We need to find the number of faces (F) of a regular icosahedron. We can do this using Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states that for any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices (V) minus the number of edges (E) plus the number of faces (F) is equal to 2 (V - E + F = 2).\n4.  **Use known properties:** A regular icosahedron is known to have 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n5.  **Solve for F:** By rearranging Euler's formula (F = 2 - V + E), we can calculate the number of faces. This number represents the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation, as the surface is already perfectly triangulated.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull (convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We need to find the number of triangular faces on a regular icosahedron.\n# We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2\n# where V = vertices, E = edges, and F = faces.\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\nV = 12\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 30 edges.\nE = 30\n\n# We rearrange Euler's formula to solve for F:\n# F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron has {V} vertices (V) and {E} edges (E).\")\nprint(\"Using Euler's formula (F = 2 - V + E) to find the number of faces:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Triangles = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"The minimal number of triangles needed is: {F}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
