    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. In quantum mechanics, this probability is found by integrating the probability density function, |ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **State the Wavefunction and Probability Density:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a). The probability density is P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a).\n2.  **Set Up the Integral:** We need to calculate the definite integral of P(x) from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a for the quantum state n = 2.\n    Probability = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx.\n3.  **Simplify the Integral:** To make the calculation easier and independent of the box length 'a', we can perform a change of variables. Let u = x/a, which means du = dx/a. The integration limits change from [0.495a, 0.505a] to [0.495, 0.505].\n    The integral becomes: Probability = ∫ [from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πu) du.\n4.  **Calculate Numerically:** This integral can be solved accurately using numerical methods. We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to perform the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan and find the probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the constants for the problem\nn = 2\nlower_bound_ratio = 0.495\nupper_bound_ratio = 0.505\n\n# The function to integrate is the probability density after a change of variables u = x/a.\n# P(u)du = 2 * sin²(n*pi*u) du\ndef probability_density(u, n_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability density as a function of the normalized position u=x/a.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * u))**2\n\n# Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad.\n# The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error.\nprobability, error = quad(\n    probability_density,\n    lower_bound_ratio,\n    upper_bound_ratio,\n    args=(n,) # Pass the value of n to the function\n)\n\n# Output the explanation, the final equation with all numbers, and the result.\nprint(f\"To find the probability of the particle's location, we integrate the probability density function.\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, from x = {lower_bound_ratio}a to {upper_bound_ratio}a, the equation to solve is:\")\nprint(f\"Probability = ∫ from {lower_bound_ratio}a to {upper_bound_ratio}a of (2/a) * sin²({n}πx/a) dx\")\nprint(f\"\\nThis integral is calculated numerically.
