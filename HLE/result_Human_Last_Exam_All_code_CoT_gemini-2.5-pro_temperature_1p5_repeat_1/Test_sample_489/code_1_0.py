    # a) The quotient topology is Hausdorff.
    # This is a standard result for Satake-Baily-Borel compactifications.
    answers.append('Y')
    explanations.append("a) Correct. The quotient space is a Satake compactification, which is Hausdorff.")

    # b) Barycentric subdivision is simplicial.
    # This is a general property of polyhedral complexes.
    answers.append('Y')
    explanations.append("b) Correct. The barycentric subdivision of any polyhedral decomposition is simplicial.")

    # c) A compact set is covered by a finite number of cones.
    # This follows from the definition of compactness and the fact that the decomposition is a locally finite covering.
    answers.append('Y')
    explanations.append("c) Correct. This is a standard property of compact sets in a space with a locally finite cover.")

    # d) Number of orbits of maximal cones for g=7 is 33.
    # This is a known computational result for perfect forms.

    answers.append('Y' if num_perfect_forms_g7 == 33 else 'N')
    explanations.append(f"d) Correct. The number of orbits of maximal cones for g=7 corresponds to the {num_perfect_forms_g7} perfect forms.")

    # e) Stabilizer of a full-dimensional cone is finite.
    # The stabilizer must permute the finite set of extremal rays of the cone.
    answers.append('Y')
    explanations.append("e) Correct. The stabilizer of a full-dimensional cone is a finite group.")

    # f) Number of cone orbits for g=5 is 222.
    # This is a known computational result for Delaunay types.
    num_delaunay_types_g5 = 222
    answers.append('Y' if num_delaunay_types_g5 == 222 else 'N')
    explanations.append(f"f) Correct. The number of cone orbits for g=5 corresponds to the {num_delaunay_types_g5} Delaunay types.")

    # g) Stab(face) is a subgroup of Stab(cone).
    # This is generally false. The stabilizer of a substructure is not necessarily a subgroup of the stabilizer of the whole structure.
    answers.append('N')
    explanations.append("g) False. The stabilizer of a face is not, in general, a subgroup of the stabilizer of the cone.")
