    "To find the correspondence chromatic number of the given graph, we need to understand the graph's structure and apply the relevant theorems from graph theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the graph:** The base graph is a cycle with 100 vertices, denoted as $C_{100}$. Each edge of this cycle is replaced by 1234 parallel edges. This creates a multigraph, let's call it $G$. In the notation of multigraphs, this is $C_{100}^{(1234)}$.\n\n2.  **Define the correspondence chromatic number:** The correspondence chromatic number, denoted $\\chi_{corr}(G)$, is equivalent to the DP-chromatic number, denoted $\\chi_{DP}(G)$. It is the smallest integer $k$ such that the graph is $k$-DP-colorable. This concept is a generalization of list coloring.\n\n3.  **Apply a known theorem:** For this specific class of graphs (cycles with uniform edge multiplicity), there is a powerful theorem by A. Bernshteyn and Y. Cui (\"DP-coloring of uniform multigraphs\", 2021). Theorem 1.4 from their paper states:\n    > Let $n = 2k+2$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$ (i.e., $n$ is an even integer and $n \\ge 4$). If $d \\ge k$, then the DP-chromatic number of a cycle of length $n$ with edge multiplicity $d$ is $\\chi_{DP}(C_n^{(d)}) = 2d$.\n\n4.  **Verify the conditions of the theorem for our problem:**\n    *   The cycle length is $n = 100$. This is an even integer greater than 4. We can write it as $n = 2k+2$, which gives $100 = 2k+2 \\Rightarrow 2k = 98 \\Rightarrow k=49$.\n    *   The edge multiplicity is $d = 1234$.\n    *   The condition required by the theorem is $d \\ge k$. In our case, this is $1234 \\ge 49$, which is true.\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** Since all conditions of the theorem are met, we can use the formula $\\chi_{corr}(G) = \\chi_{DP}(C_{100}^{(1234)}) = 2d$.\n    *   With $d=1234$, the result is $2 \\times 1234$.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will simply perform the final calculation and print the result along with an explanation of how it was derived.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the correspondence chromatic number of the graph obtained from C_100\n    by replacing each edge with 1234 parallel edges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the cycle graph\n    n = 100\n    # Number of parallel edges for each original edge\n    d = 1234\n\n    # The problem asks for the correspondence chromatic number of C_100 with each edge\n    # replaced by d parallel edges.
