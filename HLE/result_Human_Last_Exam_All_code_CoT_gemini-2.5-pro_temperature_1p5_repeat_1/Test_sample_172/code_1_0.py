    # We use a theorem by A. Bernshteyn and Y. Cui (2021) for the DP-chromatic number of
    # cycles with uniform edge multiplicity.

    # Theorem 1.4: Let n = 2k+2 for some integer k >= 1 (i.e., n is an even integer >= 4).
    # If the edge multiplicity d >= k, then Chi_DP(C_n^(d)) = 2d.

    # Step 1: Verify the conditions for our graph.
    # The cycle length is n = 100, which is an even integer >= 4.
    # We find the value of k corresponding to n.
    # n = 2k + 2
    # 100 = 2k + 2
    # 98 = 2k
    k = 49

    # Step 2: Check the condition d >= k.
    # The edge multiplicity is d = 1234.
    # The condition is 1234 >= 49, which is true.
    
    # Step 3: Apply the theorem's formula to find the correspondence chromatic number.
    # The formula is 2 * d.
    correspondence_chromatic_number = 2 * d
