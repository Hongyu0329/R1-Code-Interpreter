    # Step 1 & 2: Characterize Geodesics
    # In the given metric space, geodesics are found to be of two types:
    # 1. Straight lines passing through the origin.
    # 2. "V-shapes" composed of two distinct rays starting from the origin.

    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze Intersections and Identify Shapes
    # The intersection of any two geodesics must be a set composed of rays
    # originating from the zero function. The number of rays in the intersection
    # can be 0, 1, or 2. This leads to four possible shapes for the intersection set.

    print("The possible shapes for the intersection of two geodesics are:")
    
    # Shape 1: A single point
    print("1. A single point: This occurs when two distinct lines intersect, or when two geodesics only share the origin.")
    point_class = 1
    
    # Shape 2: A single ray
    print("2. A ray: This occurs when a line intersects a V-shape along one of its rays, or when two V-shapes share exactly one ray.")
    ray_class = 1

    # Shape 3: A line
    print("3. A line: This occurs when two identical lines intersect. A line is topologically equivalent to the union of two opposite rays.")
    line_class = 1
    
    # Shape 4: A V-shape
    print("4. A V-shape: This occurs when two identical V-shaped geodesics intersect. A V-shape is the union of two non-collinear rays.")
    v_shape_class = 1

    # Step 5: Distinguish Classes
    # These four shapes are topologically distinct.
    # - A point is 0-dimensional.
    # - A line is a 1D manifold where every point is locally Euclidean.
    # - A ray is a 1D manifold with a boundary point (the endpoint).
    # - A V-shape is not a manifold, as the vertex point has a neighborhood that is not locally Euclidean.
    
    total_classes = point_class + ray_class + line_class + v_shape_class

    print("\nThese four shapes are topologically distinct, giving four homeomorphism classes.")
