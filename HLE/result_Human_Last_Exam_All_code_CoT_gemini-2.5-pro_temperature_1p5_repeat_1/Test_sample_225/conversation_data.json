    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we need to find the number of unique coordinate pairs `(x, y)` that the curve passes through at two or more different times `t`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the condition for self-intersection:** A self-intersection occurs when `(x(t1), y(t1)) = (x(t2), y(t2))` for two distinct time values `t1` and `t2`. The curve's overall period is the least common multiple of the periods of `cos(9t)` and `sin(5t)`, which is `2π`. So we look for solutions `t1` and `t2` in the interval `[0, 2π)`.\n\n2.  **Set up the equations:**\n    *   `cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)`\n    *   `sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)`\n\n3.  **Solve the trigonometric equations:** These equations lead to a system of linear equations for `t1` and `t2`. There are two main cases that yield non-trivial solutions:\n    *   **Case C:** `t2 - t1 = 2kπ/9` and `t1 + t2 = (2m+1)π/5`\n    *   **Case D:** `t2 - t1 = 2kπ/5` and `t1 + t2 = 2mπ/9`\n    where `k` and `m` are integers that produce valid `t1`, `t2` in the `[0, 2π)` range.\n\n4.  **Count the unique points:** The number of integer pairs `(k, m)` gives the total number of intersection *pairs* `(t1, t2)`. However, multiple pairs can correspond to the same `(x, y)` point (e.g., a triple intersection point involves three pairs). To find the number of unique intersection *points*, we will:\n    *   Iterate through all valid integer pairs `(k, m)` for both cases.\n    *   For each valid pair, calculate the corresponding `t1`.\n    *   Compute the intersection point coordinates `(x, y) = (cos(9*t1), sin(5*t1))`.\n    *   Store these unique coordinate pairs in a set data structure to automatically handle duplicates. A tolerance is used for floating-point comparisons.\n    *   The final answer is the size of this set.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_self_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t).\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n    intersection_points = set()\n    precision = 8 # Precision for rounding to identify unique points\n\n    # Case C: t2 - t1 = 2k'pi/a, t1 + t2 = (2m+1)pi/b\n    # k' is a positive integer\n    for k_prime in range(1, a):\n        # We need 10*k' <= 18m+9 and 18m < 171 - 10k'\n        # Which simplifies to (10k'-9)/18 <= m < (171-10k')/18\n        m_min = math.ceil((10 * k_prime - 9) / 18)\n        m_max = math.floor((171 - 10 * k_prime - 1) / 18)\n        \n        for m in range(m_min, m_max + 1):\n            # t1 = pi/ (2*a*b) * (a*(2m+1) - b*(2k'))\n            t1 = math.pi / (2 * a * b) * (a * (2 * m + 1) - b * (2 * k_prime))\n            \n            x = math.cos(a * t1)\n            y = math.sin(b * t1)\n            \n            point = (round(x, precision), round(y, precision))\n            intersection_points.add(point)\n            \n    # Case D: t2 - t1 = 2m'pi/b, t1 + t2 = 2kpi/a\n    # m' is a positive integer\n    for m_prime in range(1, b):\n        # We need 9m' <= 5k and 5k < 90 - 9m'\n        # Which simplifies to 9m'/5 <= k < (90 - 9m')/5\n        k_min = math.ceil((b * m_prime) / a)\n        k_max = math.floor((a * b - b * m_prime -1) / a)\n        \n        for k in range(k_min, k_max + 1):\n             # t1 = pi/(a*b) * (b*k - a*m')\n            t1 = math.pi / (a*b) * (b * k - a*m_prime)\n            \n            x = math.cos(a * t1)\n            y = math.sin(b * t1)\n\n            point = (round(x, precision), round(y, precision))\n            intersection_points.add(point)\n\n    a_val = 9\n    b_val = 5\n    # The formula (a-1)(b-1)/2 holds for sin(at)/sin(bt) with a,b same parity.\n    # The formula for cos(at)/sin(bt) with a,b odd is (a*b - a - b)/2 which is (9*5 - 9 - 5)/2 = 31/2 not an integer\n    # The most reliable method is the numerical one implemented above.\n    \n    num_points = len(intersection_points)\n\n    print(f\"The curve is defined by (cos({a_val}t), sin({b_val}t)).\")\n    print(f\"By finding all intersection events and counting the unique coordinates,\")\n    print(f\"we find that there are {num_points} distinct self-intersection points.\")\n\n\nfind_self_intersections()\n\n# It's a known result from the theory of Lissajous curves that for x=cos(at) and y=sin(bt)\n# where a and b are odd co-prime integers, the number of self-intersections is (a-1)(b-1).\n# However, this is not correct.
