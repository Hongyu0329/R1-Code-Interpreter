# Step 1 & 2: The goal is to find the average of the coordinates z where S(z) is singular.
# These are the singularities of E(z) and B(z).

# Step 3: Find singularities of E(z).
# The equation for E(z) is: z^3 + 5*z^2*E((-3+z)/(-2+z)) + 2*E(z) - 5*z*E((-3+2*z)/(-1+z)) = 0
# Singularities are introduced by the arguments of E.

# Step 4: Find singularities of B(z).
# The equation for B(z) has a right-hand side which becomes singular when its denominator is zero.
# Denominator: 4*z^4 - z^3 + z^2 + 1 = 0.
# The four roots of this polynomial are the singularities from B(z).
# We can find the sum of these roots using Vieta's formulas for a polynomial a*z^n + b*z^(n-1) + ... = 0.
# Sum of roots = -b/a.
# For 4*z^4 - 1*z^3 + 1*z^2 + 0*z + 1 = 0:
a = 4.0
b = -1.0

# Step 5: Calculate the average of all singularities.
# Total number of singularities = 2 (from E) + 4 (from B) = 6.

# Sum of all singularities is the sum of singularities from E and B.
sum_of_singularities_E = sum(singularities_E)
total_sum_of_singularities = sum_of_singularities_E + sum_of_roots_B

print(f"\nTotal number of singularities is {total_num_singularities}.")
print(f"The sum of all singular coordinates is {sum_of_singularities_E} + {sum_of_roots_B} = {total_sum_of_singularities}.")

# The final calculation for the average value:
average_z = total_sum_of_singularities / total_num_singularities

print(f"\nThe average value is the total sum of the coordinates divided by the number of coordinates.")
