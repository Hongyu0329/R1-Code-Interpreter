    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Statement: Every coadjoint orbit O_lambda of G admits a compatible
    # complex structure, making it a Kähler manifold.
    # Reasoning: A fundamental theorem by Borel, Weil, and Kirillov establishes
    # that coadjoint orbits of a compact Lie group G are homogeneous spaces G/K
    # that can be realized as projective algebraic varieties.
    # As such, they are endowed with a natural Kähler structure, where the
    # symplectic form is the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau form.
    answer_a = "True"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Statement: For G = SU(n), with lambda in the Weyl alcove, is the second
    # Betti number b_2(O_lambda) always given by n - 1?
    # Reasoning: This is not always true. The value depends on whether lambda
    # is regular or singular.
    # We can show this with a counterexample for n=3.
    # G = SU(3), rank = n-1 = 2.
    # For a *regular* lambda, the orbit is the full flag manifold SU(3)/T.
    # Its second Betti number is the rank of SU(3).
    n = 3
    b2_regular = n - 1
    # For a *singular* lambda, the orbit can be, for example, the complex projective plane CP^2.
    # CP^2 = SU(3) / S(U(2)xU(1)).
    # The second Betti number of CP^(n-1) is 1.
    b2_singular = 1
    
    # Check if they are always equal
    is_always_equal = (b2_regular == b2_singular) # This will be False for n=3
    answer_b = "Yes" if is_always_equal else "No"
    
    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Statement: If O_lambda is endowed with a natural equivariant Kähler metric, must
    # the corresponding equivariant cohomology ring be isomorphic to the cohomology ring
    # of a GKM graph?
    # Reasoning: For a T-manifold to be a GKM manifold, the weights of the
    # tangential T-representation at each fixed point must be pairwise linearly independent.
    # While this holds for many flag manifolds (e.g., all orbits for SU(n)), it is not
    # universally true. A standard counterexample is the generic coadjoint orbit for
    # G = SO(2n) with n >= 4 (Lie type D_n). For instance, SO(8)/T is not a GKM manifold.
    # Thus, it is not a necessity.
    answer_c = "No"
