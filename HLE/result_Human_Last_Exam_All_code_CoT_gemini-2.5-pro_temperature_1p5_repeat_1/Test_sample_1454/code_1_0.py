# The problem is to find the smallest possible number of non-degenerate,
# locally connected components for a set F satisfying a given equation.

# There are two possible solutions for F that are closed subsets of the unit square.

# Scenario 1: F is the empty set.
# The empty set is a valid solution to the equation F = T(F).
# An empty set has 0 components.
num_components_for_empty_set = 0

# Scenario 2: F is the non-empty attractor of the defining IFS.
# The analysis shows this attractor has infinitely many components that are
# non-degenerate and locally connected. We represent infinity using math.inf.
num_components_for_attractor = math.inf

# To find the smallest possible number, we take the minimum of the results
# from all possible valid solutions for F.
smallest_possible_number = min(num_components_for_empty_set, num_components_for_attractor)

# The result is an integer.
final_answer = int(smallest_possible_number)

# The final equation demonstrates the comparison made.
# The numbers in the equation are the number of qualified components for each scenario.
