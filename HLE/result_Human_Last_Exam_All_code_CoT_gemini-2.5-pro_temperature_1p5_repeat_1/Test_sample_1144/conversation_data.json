    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   The particle is an electron.\n    *   The orbit is the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is `Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m`.\n\n2.  **Determine Necessary Physical Principles and Constants:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position (`Δx`) to the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`). The minimum uncertainty is given by `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant (`1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s`).\n    *   **Momentum in a Bohr Orbit:** The momentum (`p`) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit is given by `p = ħ / r₁`, where `r₁` is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (also known as the Bohr radius).\n    *   **Bohr Radius (`r₁` or `a₀`):** This is a physical constant with a value of approximately `5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:**\n    *   We need to find the ratio `Δp / p`.\n    *   Substitute the formulas from step 2: `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)`.\n    *   Simplify the expression: `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) * (r₁ / ħ)`. The `ħ` terms cancel out, leaving `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation using Python:**\n    *   Define the known values: `r₁` and `Δx`.\n    *   Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula.\n    *   Calculate the intermediate values `Δp` and `p` to show the full process.\n    *   Print the final result in a clear format.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# 1. Define constants and given values\n# Reduced Planck constant (J·s)\nhbar = const.hbar\n# Bohr radius, which is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (m)\nr1 = const.physical_constants['Bohr radius'][0]\n# Given uncertainty in position (m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12  # 10 pm = 10 x 10^-12 m\n\n# 2. Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p)\n# p = ħ / r₁\np = hbar / r1\n\n# 3. Calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n# Δp * Δx ≥ ħ / 2  =>  Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# 4. Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum\nratio = delta_p / p\n# This can also be calculated with the simplified formula: ratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# 5.
