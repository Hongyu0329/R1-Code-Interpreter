    print("The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of a special topological group G.")
    print("The cardinality of G is c, the cardinality of the continuum.")

    # Explanation
    print("Step 1: The key is that the group G cannot be locally connected.")
    print("If G were locally connected, all components of any open set would be open, making the answer 0.")
    print("The problem is structured to allow for non-locally connected groups.")
    print("\nStep 2: We need to find or construct a group G that fits the criteria and allows for many non-open components.")
    print("The problem can be reduced to the case of a connected group H. To get an uncountable number of components, H must be non-separable.")
    print("\nStep 3: Assuming such a group H exists (a non-separable, non-locally connected, connected group satisfying the conditions), we can construct the desired open set.")
    print("   a) Since H is non-separable, we can find c disjoint open sets {U_i}.")
    print("   b) Since H is not locally connected, there exists an open set V with at least one non-open component.")
    print("   c) We place a copy of V inside each U_i. The union of these copies is our open set Omega.")
    print("   d) This construction yields c non-open components in Omega.")
    print("\nStep 4: The maximum number is therefore c, the cardinality of the continuum.")

    # The continuum c is defined by the equation c = 2^aleph_0.
    # The numbers in this equation are 2 and 0.
