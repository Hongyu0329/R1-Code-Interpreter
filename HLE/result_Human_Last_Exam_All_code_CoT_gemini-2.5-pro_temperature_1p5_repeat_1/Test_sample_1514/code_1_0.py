    print("--- Step 1: Translating the Problem ---")
    print("The problem asks for the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications of the ray [0,1) with a remainder X.")
    print("The space X must be a non-degenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space.")
    print("A known theorem in topology connects this concept to functions. The number of such compactifications for a given X is equal to the number of non-equivalent continuous surjections (onto maps) f: X -> Z, where Z is a compact metric space.")
    print("Two surjections, f1: X -> Z1 and f2: X -> Z2, are 'equivalent' if Z1 is homeomorphic to Z2 via a homeomorphism h such that f2 = h o f1.")
    print("Our goal is to find a space X that minimizes this number of non-equivalent surjections.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound ---")
    print("For any space X that meets the criteria, we can always define at least two surjections:")
    print("1. The identity map, id: X -> X. The target space is X itself.")
    print("2. The constant map, c: X -> {p}, where {p} is a single-point space.")
    print("Since X is non-degenerate (i.e., has at least two points), X is not homeomorphic to a single point. Therefore, these two surjections are always non-equivalent.")
    print("This means the smallest possible number of compactifications is at least 2.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Finding a Space X that Achieves the Minimum ---")
    print("Now we must check if any space X achieves this minimum of 2.")
    print("Let's consider the simplest possible space that satisfies the given properties.")
    print("Candidate space: Let X be a two-point space with the discrete topology. Let's call it X_2 = {a, b}.\n")
    print("Verifying the properties of X_2:")
    print("  - Non-degenerate: Yes, it has two points.")
    print("  - Compact metric: Yes, any finite space is compact, and we can define a metric (e.g., d(a,b)=1).")
    print("  - Locally-connected: Yes. A basis for the topology is {{a}, {b}}. Both sets are connected, so every point has a basis of connected open neighborhoods.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Analyzing the Surjections from X_2 ---")
    print("Let f: X_2 -> Z be a continuous surjection. Since the domain X_2 is a discrete space, any function f defined on it is continuous.")
    print("The image Z must be the set f({a,b}) = {f(a), f(b)}. This image can have one or two points.")
    print("  Case 1: The image has one point. This occurs if f(a) = f(b). In this case, f is a constant map, and the target space Z is a single point. All such maps fall into one equivalence class.")
    print("  Case 2: The image has two points. This occurs if f(a) != f(b). The map f is a bijection. The target space Z has two points and inherits the discrete topology from X_2 (as f is a quotient map). Thus, Z is homeomorphic to X_2. All such bijective maps are equivalent to the identity map.\n")
    print("So, for X_2 = {a, b}, there are exactly two classes of non-equivalent surjections.\n")

    print("--- Step 5: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("We showed that the number must be at least 2, and we found a valid space for which the number is exactly 2.")
    smallest_number = 2
    print(f"Therefore, the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications is: {smallest_number}")
