    "For an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine, a certain percentage of the vaccinated population is fully protected, while the rest receive no protection at all. The per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for this type of vaccine is simply the proportion of people who are fully protected.\n\nLet's use a step-by-step calculation to determine if the standard vaccine efficacy formula, `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)`, correctly estimates this value.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a hypothetical per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`). For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected.\n2.  Define a baseline incidence rate (`IR_u`) for the unvaccinated population.\n3.  Calculate the corresponding incidence rate in the vaccinated population (`IR_v`), considering that only the unprotected fraction is susceptible.\n4.  Calculate the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`).\n5.  Calculate the estimated Vaccine Efficacy from the IRR using the formula `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n6.  Compare the estimated `VE` with the true `VE_p` to see if it overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the value.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_all_or_nothing_vaccine():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes if 1 - IRR correctly estimates per-exposure efficacy\n    for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p).\n    # For an all-or-nothing vaccine, this is the proportion of people who are\n    # fully protected.
