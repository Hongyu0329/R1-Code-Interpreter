# Step 1: Define the counts for each case based on categorical analysis.

# Case 1: Two non-identity morphisms from object A to itself {f, g: A -> A}.
# This corresponds to the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, which is 7.
count_case_1 = 7

# Case 2: Two parallel non-identity morphisms from A to B {f, g: A -> B}.
# The composition is trivial. This defines a single unique structure.
count_case_2 = 1

# Case 3: One non-identity morphism from A to A {f: A -> A} and one from A to B {g: A -> B}.
# Analysis shows two ways to define composition for f (f*f=id_A or f*f=f), leading to 2 categories.
count_case_3 = 2

# Case 4: One non-identity morphism from A to A {f: A -> A} and one from B to A {g: B -> A}.
# Similar to case 3, this gives 2 distinct categories.
count_case_4 = 2

# Case 5: One non-identity morphism at A {f: A -> A} and one at B {g: B -> B}.
# This is a disjoint union of two monoids of order 2. There are 3 non-isomorphic pairings.
count_case_5 = 3

# Case 6: One non-identity morphism from A to B {f: A -> B} and one from B to A {g: B -> A}.
# Composition is forced (f and g must be isomorphisms), defining 1 category.
count_case_6 = 1

# Step 2: Sum the counts from all cases to get the total number.
total_categories = count_case_1 + count_case_2 + count_case_3 + count_case_4 + count_case_5 + count_case_6

# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.
print(f"The total number of non-isomorphic categories is the sum of the counts from each case:")
