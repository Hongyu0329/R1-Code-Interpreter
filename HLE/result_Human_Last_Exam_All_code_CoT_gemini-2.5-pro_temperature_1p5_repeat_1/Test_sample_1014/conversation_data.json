    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will first find all of its prime factors. I'll use a method called trial division.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  I will repeatedly try to divide `n` by small prime numbers, starting with 2, then 3, 5, 7, and so on.\n3.  When a prime number `d` divides `n`, I will add `d` to a list of factors and update `n` by dividing it by `d`. I'll repeat this until `n` is no longer divisible by `d`.\n4.  I only need to check for divisors up to the square root of the current value of `n`.\n5.  If after all divisions, the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining value is itself a prime factor (and will be the largest).\n6.  After collecting all prime factors, I will print an equation showing the original number as a product of its prime factors.\n7.  Finally, I will identify and print the largest factor from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest prime divisor of 8139881 and prints the prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 8139881\n    n = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # First, handle the factor 2 if the number is even.\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Next, handle odd factors. We start from 3 and check only odd numbers.\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n //= d\n        d += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 2, the remaining n is a prime factor.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(int(n))\n\n    # Get the largest prime factor from the list of factors.\n    largest_prime = max(factors)\n    \n    # Sort factors for a clean equation display\n    factors.sort()\n\n    # Print the factorization equation.
