    "My plan is to first identify the correct Israeli statute based on legal history. Research confirms that the concept of \"good faith\" (תום לב) was formally and broadly introduced into the Israeli statutory system by a specific law in 1973. I will then write a Python script to print the name of this law as the answer, adhering to the user's formatting requirements.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n# to explicitly introduce the general concept of \"good faith\" into its legal framework,\n# particularly for contracts.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
