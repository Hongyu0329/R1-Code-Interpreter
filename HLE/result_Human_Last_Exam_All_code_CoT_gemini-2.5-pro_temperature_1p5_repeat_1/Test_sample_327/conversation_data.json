    "To find the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to express this number as a signed-binary expansion. The value of a Hackenbush stalk is given by the formula $V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2})^i$, where $s_i$ is +1 for a red piece and -1 for a blue piece at position $i$ from the ground.\n\nOur goal is to find the sequence of coefficients $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots$ for $V = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Start with the value $x = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n2.  Repeatedly apply the following procedure until the value becomes 0:\n    a.  Multiply the current value $x$ by 2 to get $y = 2x$.\n    b.  If $y > 0$, the next piece is Red (coefficient $s_i = 1$). The new value to be represented is $x_{new} = y - 1$.\n    c.  If $y < 0$, the next piece is Blue (coefficient $s_i = -1$). The new value to be represented is $x_{new} = y + 1$.\n    d.  If $y=0$, the process stops.\n3.  We will collect the coefficients ($s_i$) in a list. The total number of pieces is the length of this list.\n4.  Finally, we will construct and print the full equation and state the total number of pieces.\n\nLet's trace this for $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n-   **Step 1:** $x = \\frac{13}{16}$. $y = 2 \\cdot \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{13}{8}$. Since $y>0$, the first piece is **Red** ($s_1=1$). The new value is $\\frac{13}{8} - 1 = \\frac{5}{8}$.\n-   **Step 2:** $x = \\frac{5}{8}$. $y = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}$. Since $y>0$, the second piece is **Red** ($s_2=1$). The new value is $\\frac{5}{4} - 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   **Step 3:** $x = \\frac{1}{4}$. $y = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $y>0$, the third piece is **Red** ($s_3=1$). The new value is $\\frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   **Step 4:** $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. $y = 2 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -1$. Since $y<0$, the fourth piece is **Blue** ($s_4=-1$). The new value is $-1 + 1 = 0$.\nThe process stops. The sequence of coefficients is $(1, 1, 1, -1)$, which means the pieces are Red, Red, Red, Blue. There are a total of 4 pieces.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces for a fraction in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n    and displays the corresponding equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The fraction to represent\n    n_orig = 13\n    d_orig = 16\n\n    # Use a copy of the numerator for calculations\n    n = n_orig\n    d = d_orig\n\n    # Store the signed coefficients (1 for Red, -1 for Blue)\n    coeffs = []\n\n    # Loop until the number to represent becomes 0\n    while n != 0:\n        # Multiply the current value by 2\n        y_num = 2 * n\n        y_den = d\n        \n        # Determine the color of the next piece\n        if y_num > 0:\n            # Piece is Red\n            sign = 1\n            # Subtract 1 from the value y\n            # n_new / d_new = y - 1 = (y_num / y_den) - 1 = (y_num - y_den) / y_den\n            n = y_num - y_den\n            d = y_den\n        else: # y_num <= 0\n            # Piece is Blue\n            sign = -1\n            # Add 1 to the value y\n            # n_new / d_new = y + 1 = (y_num / y_den) + 1 = (y_num + y_den) / y_den\n            n = y_num + y_den\n            d = y_den\n            \n        coeffs.append(sign)\n        \n        # Simplify the fraction for the next iteration\n        if n != 0:\n            common_divisor = math.gcd(n, d)\n            n //= common_divisor\n            d //= common_divisor\n\n    print(f\"To represent the number {n_orig}/{d_orig} in red-blue-Hackenbush, we express it as:\")\n    \n    # Build and print the equation string\n    equation_parts = []\n    for i, s in enumerate(coeffs):\n        denominator = 2**(i + 1)\n        equation_parts.append(f\"({s}) * (1/{denominator})\")\n    \n    print(f\"{n_orig}/{d_orig} = \" + \" + \".join(equation_parts))\n\n    # Determine piece colors\n    colors = [\"Red\" if c == 1 else \"Blue\" for c in coeffs]\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a sequence of pieces: {', '.join(colors)}.\")\n\n    num_pieces = len(coeffs)\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of pieces needed is {num_pieces}.\")\n\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
