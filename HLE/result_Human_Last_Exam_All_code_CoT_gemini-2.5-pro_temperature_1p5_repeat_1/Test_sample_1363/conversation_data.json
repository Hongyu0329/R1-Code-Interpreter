    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballroom dancing technique. The task can be solved by analyzing the fundamental characteristics of each dance listed. I will create a Python script to present this analysis and identify the correct answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the options for the multiple-choice question within the script.\n2.  Provide a step-by-step explanation of the core techniques of Tango versus the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep).\n3.  Explain why the unique, staccato nature of Tango makes it impossible to \"overturn\" a turn without violating its fundamental technique. An overturn requires continuous momentum, which is characteristic of swing dances but antithetical to Tango.\n4.  Print the final conclusion and the letter corresponding to the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dancing techniques to answer a specific question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    correct_option_key = 'C'\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the dance techniques to find the solution:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"1.
