    print("   - 'Overturning' means rotating more than the standard amount. This typically requires generating and using continuous rotational momentum.")

    print("   - The core technique of Tango forbids the use of continuous, swinging momentum.")
    print("   - To overturn a Tango reverse turn, a dancer would have to introduce a flowing, swinging rotation. This action is a direct violation and disregard for the fundamental staccato technique that defines Tango.")
