    "Based on the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) model for quantum games, we can determine an equilibrium point for the Prisoner's Dilemma that provides a better outcome than the classical Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Game:** The game is defined by the classical payoff matrix and a shared entangled initial state for the two players. The initial state `|ψ_i>` depends on an entanglement parameter, `γ`.\n    `|ψ_i> = cos(γ/2)|Cooperate, Cooperate> + i*sin(γ/2)|Defect, Defect>`\n\n2.  **Define Strategies:** Players' strategies are unitary operators. We consider the classical strategies 'Cooperate' (`Ĉ = Identity`) and 'Defect', along with a \"miracle\" quantum strategy, `Q̂ = i * σ_x`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix.\n\n3.  **Find the Nash Equilibrium:** A Nash Equilibrium is a strategy pair where neither player benefits from changing their strategy unilaterally. We analyze the strategy pair `(Q̂, Q̂)`. For this to be a Nash Equilibrium, the payoff for playing `(Q̂, Q̂)` must be greater than or equal to the payoff from deviating to another strategy (e.g., `(Ĉ, Q̂)`).\n\n4.  **Optimize the Equilibrium:** This analysis reveals that `(Q̂, Q̂)` is a Nash Equilibrium only if the entanglement `γ` is below a certain threshold. For the given payoff matrix, this condition is `sin²(γ/2) ≤ 1/3`. To achieve the \"optimal\" equilibrium, we want to maximize the payoff `P(Q̂,Q̂) = 5*sin²(γ/2) + 1*cos²(γ/2)`. This payoff is maximized when `sin²(γ/2)` is as large as possible. Therefore, we choose the boundary value `sin²(γ/2) = 1/3`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Payoff:** At this optimal level of entanglement, the probabilities of the final outcomes are `P(CC) = 1/3`, `P(DD) = 2/3`, and `P(CD) = P(DC) = 0`. We can then calculate the final symmetric payoff for both players. The following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the optimal equilibrium payoff for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    based on the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define payoff values from the matrix\n    # [[(5,5), (0,7)],\n    #  [(7,0), (1,1)]]\n    # R: Reward for mutual cooperation\n    # S: Sucker's payoff\n    # T: Temptation to defect\n    # P: Punishment for mutual defection\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n\n    # From the analysis, the optimal equilibrium is at the boundary of the\n    # Nash Equilibrium condition for the (Q, Q) strategy.
