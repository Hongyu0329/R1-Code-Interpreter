# Based on the problem's premises, we deduce that the edge signal vector x1 must be the zero vector.
# Let's demonstrate the implication for the total variation for a hypothetical graph with 5 edges.

# 1. From our reasoning, the edge signal x1 is a vector of zeros.
x1 = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])

# 2. The problem states that the value of the signal on each edge is given by x1_e = |x0_u - x0_v|.
#    The total variation (TV) of the vertex signal x0 is defined as the sum of these values over all edges:
#    TV = sum(|x0_u - x0_v|) for all edges {u,v}
#    This is equivalent to the sum of all elements in the vector x1.
total_variation = np.sum(x1)

# 3. We print the final calculation as an equation.
# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.

# Create the string for the equation
