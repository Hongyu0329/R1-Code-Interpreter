    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow a structured plan.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Parameters:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is part of a family of groups denoted as $SD_{2^n}$. We need to find the value of 'n' for the group of size 512.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer k. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n3.  **Apply Group Theory Results:** For the semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (with $n \\ge 3$), there's a known theoretical result for the number of distinct power subgroups. The distinct power subgroups are precisely $\\{ G^{2^j} \\mid j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1 \\}$. This gives a total of $n$ distinct subgroups.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** We will write a Python script that calculates 'n' from the given group size (512) and uses the result from step 3 to determine the number of power subgroups. The script will print the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the parameter 'n' for the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.\n    # The order of the group is 2^n. We are given the size (order) is 512.\n    # We solve for n using the logarithm function.\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the theoretical result.\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (n >= 3), the number of distinct power subgroups is n.\n    # The distinct power subgroups are G, <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^(2^(n-2))>, and the trivial subgroup {1},\n    # which correspond to the powers G^{2^j} for j = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The task is to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size {group_size}.\")\n    print(\"This group is denoted as SD_{2^n}, where its size is 2^n.\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we determine the value of 'n' from the group's size:\")\n    print(f\"2^n = {group_size}\")\n    print(f\"n = log2({group_size})\")\n    print(f\"n = {n}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAccording to group theory, the number of distinct power subgroups in the semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is equal to 'n'.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is straightforward:\")\n    print(f\"Number of power subgroups = n = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
