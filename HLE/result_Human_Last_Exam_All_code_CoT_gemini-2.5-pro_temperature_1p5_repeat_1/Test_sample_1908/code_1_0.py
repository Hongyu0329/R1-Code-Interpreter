    # The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements for a non-trivial,
    # non-discrete topology on a set X with cardinality c (the continuum).

    # From advanced results in general topology, it's known that for an infinite set X,
    # any such topology has at least 2^|X| complements, except for a potential (and debated)
    # exception for T0 non-T1 topologies on countable sets.
    # Since our set X has cardinality c (which is uncountable), this exception does not apply.
    # Therefore, the minimum number of complements is 2^|X|.

    # The cardinality of the set X is given as c.
    # By definition, c = 2^(aleph_0), where aleph_0 is the cardinality of natural numbers.
    # The final answer is 2^c = 2^(2^(aleph_0)).

    # The final equation for the number of complements (N) is N = 2^(2^(aleph_0)).
    # We will represent aleph_0 symbolically with the number 0, as it is the smallest infinite cardinal.
    # The numbers in this expression are 2, 2, and 0.
