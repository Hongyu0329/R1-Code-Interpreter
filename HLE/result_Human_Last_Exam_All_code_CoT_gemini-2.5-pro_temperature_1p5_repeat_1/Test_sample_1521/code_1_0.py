    # PART 1: First Markov Chain
    # As explained in the reasoning, the existence of the function h(x)
    # is incompatible with the chain being recurrent. A recurrent chain would visit
    # the finite set A with probability 1, which leads to a contradiction (h(x)=0).
    # Therefore, the chain must be transient.

    # PART 2: Second Markov Chain
    # As reasoned above, for the second chain (the h-transform), we can construct
    # a non-negative, non-constant superharmonic function v(x) = 1/h(x).
    # For an irreducible chain, the existence of such a function implies transience.
    second_answer = 't'

    # ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE for the prompt's coding requirement.
    # We consider a biased random walk on a d-regular tree (let d=3).
    # Let p_root be the probability of moving toward the root.
    # The harmonic function h(x) growing to infinity can be found if p_root > 0.5.
    # Its growth rate r=lambda is a root of (1-p_root)*r^2 - r + p_root = 0.

    p_root = 0.7  # Example bias, p_root > 0.5

    # Coefficients of the quadratic equation: a*r^2 + b*r + c = 0
