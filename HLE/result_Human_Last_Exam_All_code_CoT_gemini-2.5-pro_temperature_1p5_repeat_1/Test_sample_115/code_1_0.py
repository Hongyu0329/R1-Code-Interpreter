# The problem asks for the value of alpha in the expression c_n = Theta(alpha^n).
# Based on the analysis, the value is the square root of 2.

# Step 1: Define the value
# The derived value for alpha is sqrt(2).
alpha_squared = 2
alpha = math.sqrt(alpha_squared)

# Step 2: Output the final answer
# The problem asks for the value of alpha.
# The calculation is straightforward, but for completeness and to adhere to the format,
# we can represent the calculation in code.

print(f"The equation for alpha is alpha = sqrt({alpha_squared})")
print(f"The value of alpha is {alpha}")
print("1 * sqrt(2) = 1.4142135623730951")

# Let's show the final equation as requested by the prompt.
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# The final equation is not complex, it is simply result = sqrt(2).
# Let's represent it as 'alpha^2 = 2'.

a_squared = 2
a = math.sqrt(a_squared)

print(f"The determined value is alpha = {a}.")
print(f"This can be written as the equation: {a}^2 = {a_squared}")
