    "To identify the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch Data**: I will programmatically download the adult hermaphrodite chemical synapse connectome data from a reliable source, `wormwiring.org`.\n2.  **Process Data**: The downloaded data, which is in a CSV format, will be parsed. I will focus on connections where the presynaptic (source) neuron is one of the ASJ pair (ASJL or ASJR).\n3.  **Aggregate Synapses**: I will group all outgoing connections from ASJ by their postsynaptic (target) neuron. For each target neuron, I will sum the number of synapses it receives from both ASJL and ASJR combined.\n4.  **Identify Main Target**: I will then find the target neuron that has the highest total number of synapses from ASJ.\n5.  **Present Results**: Finally, I will display the name of the main target neuron and the total number of synapses it receives. I will also show the individual contributions from ASJL and ASJR to this total, as requested.\n\nThis process will allow me to computationally determine the primary target cell for ASJ axons based on synapse count.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef find_main_target_neuron():\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches C. elegans connectome data to find the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL for the N2U adult hermaphrodite connectome data (chemical synapses)\n    url = \"http://www.wormwiring.org/db/DATA/N2U_neuron_connect.csv\"\n    print(f\"Fetching connectome data from {url}...\")\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        # Raise an HTTPError if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        \n        # The data is embedded within <pre> tags in the HTML response.
