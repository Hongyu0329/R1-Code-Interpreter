    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the number of human let-7 family members.\nI will use a Python script to query the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene database. This is a comprehensive and authoritative source for genetic information.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Use the `Bio.Entrez` module from the Biopython library, which is the standard tool for accessing NCBI databases programmatically.\n2.  Construct a specific search query to find all genes belonging to the let-7 family (`MIRLET7`) in the organism `Homo sapiens`.\n3.  Use the `esearch` function to execute the search and get a count of the matching gene records.\n4.  To be thorough, I will also fetch the official names of the identified genes and print them.\n5.  Finally, I will display the total count and present it as a simple addition equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to accomplish this. You may need to install the Biopython library first by running `pip install biopython`.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from Bio import Entrez\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Biopython is not installed.
