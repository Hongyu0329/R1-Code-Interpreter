    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene (C7H8) consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom type for 6-31G:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** As a first-row element, its single valence orbital (1s) is described by two basis functions (a \"split-valence\" representation). So, each H atom has 2 contracted functions.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** As a second-row element, it has core and valence electrons.\n        *   **Core (1s):** Represented by 1 contracted function.\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** The valence shell is split into two sets of functions. Each set contains one s-function and one p-shell (px, py, pz), totaling 1+3=4 functions. With two such sets, the valence shell uses 2 * 4 = 8 functions.\n        *   **Total for C:** 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions from all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total from 7 Carbon atoms = 7 * 9\n    *   Total from 8 Hydrogen atoms = 8 * 2\n    *   Grand Total = (7 * 9) + (8 * 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule information\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Hydrogen (1s valence orbital split in two): 2 functions\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# For Carbon (1s core orbital + 2 sets of 2s, 2p valence orbitals):\n# Core: 1 function (1s)\n# Valence: 2 * (1 s-function + 3 p-functions) = 8 functions\n# Total: 1 + 8 = 9 functions\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the step-by-step explanation and the final result\nprint(f\"To calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for Toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"1.
