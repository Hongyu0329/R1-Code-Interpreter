    "The statement is **True**.\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the SNPs considered in a study. It is a theoretical upper limit for prediction based on those SNPs. A polygenic score (PGS) is a practical tool built from a real-world Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because any real-world GWAS has a finite sample size, the SNP effect sizes used to build the PGS are estimated with some degree of statistical error. This \"noise\" in the effect size estimates means that the resulting PGS will never be able to capture the full heritable signal perfectly. Therefore, the variance explained by the PGS (its predictive ability, often measured as R²) will necessarily be lower than the total SNP heritability.\n\nTo illustrate this, the following Python code simulates a population, a phenotype with a defined SNP heritability, a mock GWAS to generate a PGS, and then compares the predictive power of the PGS to the theoretical maximum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define simulation parameters: SNP heritability (h2_snp), number of individuals (N), and number of SNPs (M).\n# 2. Simulate genotypes (X) and true SNP effect sizes (beta).\n# 3. Create a \"true\" genetic component (g) based on genotypes and true effects.\n#    Scale it so its variance equals the SNP heritability.\n# 4. Create a phenotype (y) by adding an environmental component to the genetic component.\n# 5. Simulate a GWAS by estimating SNP effect sizes (beta_hat) from the simulated data.\n#    These estimates will be imperfect due to the finite sample size.\n# 6. Build a Polygenic Score (PGS) using these estimated effects.\n# 7. Calculate the predictive ability of the PGS (R_squared_PGS) by seeing how much variance in the phenotype it explains.\n# 8. Compare the R_squared_PGS with the true h2_snp to demonstrate that the former is lower.\n\n# --- Step 1: Define parameters ---\n# True SNP heritability (the theoretical maximum variance explained by all SNPs)\nh2_snp = 0.50\n# Number of individuals in the simulated GWAS\nn_individuals = 5000\n# Number of SNPs\nn_snps = 10000\n\n# --- Step 2: Simulate genotypes and true effects ---\n# Simulate genotypes X, then standardize it (mean=0, variance=1).\ngenotypes = np.random.binomial(2, 0.5, size=(n_individuals, n_snps))\ngenotypes = (genotypes - np.mean(genotypes, axis=0)) / np.std(genotypes, axis=0)\n\n# Simulate true effect sizes (beta) for each SNP. For simplicity, all SNPs have a small effect.\ntrue_effects = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(h2_snp / n_snps), n_snps)\n\n# --- Step 3: Create true genetic component ---\n# Calculate the true genetic value 'g' for each individual and scale its variance to h2_snp\ntrue_genetic_value = genotypes @ true_effects\ntrue_genetic_value = (true_genetic_value - np.mean(true_genetic_value)) / np.std(true_genetic_value) * np.sqrt(h2_snp)\n\n# --- Step 4: Create phenotype ---\n# Simulate environmental component 'e' with variance (1 - h2_snp)\nenvironmental_effect = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(1 - h2_snp), n_individuals)\n# Create final phenotype 'y'. Total variance of y is var(g) + var(e) = h2_snp + (1-h2_snp) = 1\nphenotype = true_genetic_value + environmental_effect\n\n# --- Step 5: Simulate GWAS to get estimated effects ---\n# This simulates the noisy estimates from a GWAS, with noise being inversely related to sample size.\nestimated_effects = (1 / n_individuals) * (genotypes.T @ phenotype)\n\n# --- Step 6: Build the Polygenic Score ---\n# The PGS is the sum of genotypes weighted by the *estimated* effects from our simulated GWAS.\npgs = genotypes @ estimated_effects\n\n# --- Step 7: Calculate the predictive ability of the PGS ---\n# This is measured by R-squared: the squared correlation between the phenotype and the PGS.\ncorrelation = np.corrcoef(phenotype, pgs)[0, 1]\nr_squared_pgs = correlation**2\n\n# --- Step 8: Compare and print results ---\nprint(\"This simulation demonstrates the relationship between SNP heritability and Polygenic Score (PGS) predictive ability.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\nprint(f\"Theoretical maximum variance explained (SNP Heritability, h²_snp): {h2_snp:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Achieved predictive ability of the PGS (R²_PGS):                 {r_squared_pgs:.4f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\nprint(\"As shown, the predictive ability of the PGS is lower than the total SNP heritability.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"R²_PGS ({r_squared_pgs:.4f}) < h²_snp ({h2_snp:.4f})\")\n```\n<<<True>>>"
