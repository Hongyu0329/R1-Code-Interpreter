    # Key patient findings:
    # 1. Gouty tophi (masses of uric acid crystals) found in both hands.
    # 2. Symptoms of numbness and weakness, likely from nerve compression by these masses.
    
    # Medical knowledge application:
    # Gout is fundamentally a type of inflammatory arthritis.
    # The tophi are the physical manifestation and anatomical abnormality resulting from this chronic arthritis.
    
    # Evaluating the choices:
    # A. accessory flexor muscle: Unrelated to gout.
    # B. arthritis of the wrist: Correct. This is the underlying disease process that causes the tophi.
    # C. pronator syndrome: Incorrect location (forearm/elbow).
    # D. ulnar neuropathy: This is a possible complication of the arthritis, but not the primary abnormality itself.
    # E. De Quervain tendinosis: Specific tendon inflammation, not consistent with gouty tophi.
    
    # The presence of gouty tophi is a direct sign of advanced gouty arthritis.
    # This makes 'arthritis of the wrist' the most accurate and encompassing description of the anatomical abnormality.
