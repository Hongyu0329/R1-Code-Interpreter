# This script determines the number of non-zero terms in the asymptotic expansion
# of f(x) up to the term x^{-100}, based on the derived properties of the coefficients a_k.

# The analysis shows that for a given term k, its coefficient a_k is non-zero
# if and only if:
# 1. k is a power of 2, k = 2^p, and p is odd.
# 2. k = 2^p * m where m is an odd number >= 3, and p is an even number.

# We count the number of integers k from 2 to 100 that fall into these categories.

# Category 2: k = 2^p * m, where p is even, m is odd and m >= 3, and 2 <= k <= N.
# We sum up the counts for each even power p.
