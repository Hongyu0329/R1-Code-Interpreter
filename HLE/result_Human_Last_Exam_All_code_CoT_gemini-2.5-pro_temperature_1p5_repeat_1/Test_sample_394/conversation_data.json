    "Of course, I can help with that. To solve this problem, we need to find a right triangle with rational sides `a`, `b`, and `c` (hypotenuse) that has an area of 263. Our goal is to find the smallest possible denominator for the hypotenuse `c`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate Sides and Area**: A right triangle's area `A` is given by `A = (1/2) * a * b`. For this problem, `(1/2)ab = 263`, which means `ab = 526`.\n2.  **Use Euclid's Formula**: All right triangles with rational sides can be described by a scaled version of Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples. The sides can be written as:\n    *   `a = k * (m² - n²) `\n    *   `b = k * (2mn)`\n    *   `c = k * (m² + n²) `\n    Here, `m` and `n` are integers such that `m > n`, they are coprime (`gcd(m, n) = 1`), and one is even while the other is odd. `k` is a rational scaling factor.\n3.  **Find the Scaling Factor `k`**: We can substitute these formulas into our area equation:\n    `A = (1/2) * [k(m² - n²)] * [k(2mn)] = k² * mn(m² - n²) `\n    Since `A = 263`, we have:\n    `263 = k² * mn(m² - n²) `\n4.  **Solve for `k` and `c`**: For `k` to be rational, the term `263 * mn(m² - n²)` must be a perfect square. Let's say `mn(m² - n²) = 263 * S²` for some integer `S`.\n    This gives `k² * 263 * S² = 263`, which simplifies to `k = 1/S`.\n    The hypotenuse `c` is then `c = (m² + n²) * k = (m² + n²) / S`.\n5.  **Find the Smallest Denominator**: We need to find the smallest integers `m` and `n` that satisfy the conditions. The first pair found by systematically searching upwards from `m=2` will correspond to the \"simplest\" rational triangle and will give the smallest denominator for the hypotenuse. The denominator is `S / gcd(m² + n², S)`.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this search. It will find the first valid `(m, n)` pair, calculate `S`, determine the hypotenuse fraction, and print the smallest possible denominator.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return abs(a)\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef find_hypotenuse_denominator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches for the right triangle with area 263 and finds the \n    smallest possible denominator of its hypotenuse.\n    \"\"\"\n    area = 263\n    # A search limit for m.
