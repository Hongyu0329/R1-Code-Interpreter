# A script to calculate the number of equivalence classes.
#

# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem statement
p = 43
n = 18 # degree of extension
e = 3  # ramification index

# Step 2: Calculate the residue field degree
f = n // e

# Step 3: Characterize the set B(1,0)
# The set B(1,0) is defined by d((1,0), (w0,w)) <= 1.
# d((1,0), (w0,w)) = max(|1-w0|_p, |w|_p)^2 / |w0|_p <= 1
# A careful analysis shows this implies |w0|_p = 1 and |w|_p <= 1.
# So, B(1,0) is the set O_K_times x O_K, where O_K is the ring of integers of K
# and O_K_times is its group of units.

# Step 4: Interpret the threshold for the new equivalence relation.
# The threshold is given as "less than pi^(-6) where pi = 1/p^3 is a uniformizer of K".
# This statement is contradictory, as a uniformizer pi_K must have norm |pi_K|_p < 1,
# but |1/p^3|_p = p^3 > 1.
# The most plausible interpretation is that there is a typo and the threshold is related
# to the norm of a true uniformizer pi_K of K. The exponent 6 likely relates to f=6.
# A uniformizer pi_K has norm |pi_K|_p = p^(-1/e).
# We assume the distance threshold T is |pi_K|_p^6 = (p^(-1/e))^6 = p^(-6/e).
# With e=3, the threshold T becomes p^(-6/3) = p^(-2).

# Step 5: Determine the congruence level j from the distance condition.
# The distance between two points (z0, z) and (w0, w) in B(1,0) is
# d = max(|z0-w0|_p, |z-w|_p)^2.
# The equivalence condition is d < p^(-2), so max(|z0-w0|_p, |z-w|_p) < p^(-1).
#
# Let x, y be elements of O_K. The condition is |x-y|_p < p^(-1).
# The norm |x-y|_p takes values of the form p^(-k/e) for integer k >= 0.
# We need p^(-k/e) < p^(-1), which means -k/e < -1, or k > e.
# With e=3, we need k > 3. The smallest integer k satisfying this is 4.
# This corresponds to v_K(x-y) >= 4, where v_K is the valuation on K.
# This means that two elements are equivalent if their difference is in p_K^4.
# The congruence level is j=4.

j = 4

# Step 6: Calculate the size of the residue field, q.
# q = |O_K / p_K| = p^f
q_base = p
q_exp = f

# Step 7: Calculate the number of equivalence classes.
# The number of classes is the product of the number of classes for each component in O_K_times x O_K.
# Number of classes for the O_K component is |O_K / p_K^j| = (p^f)^j.
# Number of classes for the O_K_times component is |(O_K / p_K^j)^*| = (p^f)^(j-1) * (p^f - 1).
#
# Total number of classes = [(p^f)^j] * [(p^f)^(j-1) * (p^f - 1)] = (p^f)^(2j-1) * (p^f - 1).

# Step 8: Print the components of the final calculation and the result.
