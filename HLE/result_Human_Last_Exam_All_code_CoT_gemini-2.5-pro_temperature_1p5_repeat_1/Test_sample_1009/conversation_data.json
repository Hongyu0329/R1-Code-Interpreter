    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given properties:** The group `G` has cardinality `|G| = 2^(2^c)`, is compact, and is first-countable. The property that it might fail to be Hausdorff is crucial.\n2.  **Use character of the group:** A space is first-countable if and only if its character is countable. The character of a topological group, `χ(G)`, is the local base cardinality at the identity element. So, `χ(G) = ℵ₀`.\n3.  **Find an upper bound for the weight:** There is a fundamental inequality for any topological group that relates its weight `w(G)`, its cardinality `|G|`, and its character `χ(G)`. The inequality is `w(G) ≤ |G| * χ(G)`. I will use this to find an upper bound for `w(G)`.\n4.  **Analyze the non-Hausdorff condition:** In the case of a Hausdorff group, the weight and cardinality are much more constrained (e.g., `|G| ≤ 2^w(G)`). The fact that our group `G` is not necessarily Hausdorff allows for a much larger cardinality relative to its other properties. This suggests that the weight can also be very large.\n5.  **Determine if the upper bound is achievable:** I will argue that for non-Hausdorff groups, it is indeed possible to construct a group where the weight reaches the maximum value allowed by the inequality from step 3. Therefore, the largest possible weight will be equal to this upper bound.\n6.  **Present the final result:** I will write a Python script that prints out the reasoning step-by-step and displays the final equation for the largest possible weight.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the largest possible weight of a topological group with specific properties.\n    The properties are:\n    - G is a compact topological group.\n    - The cardinality of G is 2^(2^c), where c is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    - G is first-countable.\n    - G might fail to be Hausdorff.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Representation of the cardinals involved.\n    # c is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    c = \"c\"\n    # aleph_0 is the cardinality of the natural numbers.\n    aleph_0 = \"ℵ₀\"\n\n    # The cardinality of the group G is given.\n    card_G = f\"2^(2^{c})\"\n\n    # The character of the group G is determined by the first-countability property.\n    # A topological space is first-countable if and only if its character is ℵ₀.\n    chi_G = aleph_0\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the given properties and their implications.\")\n    print(f\"  - Cardinality |G| = {card_G}\")\n    print(\"  - The group G is compact.\")\n    print(f\"  - The group G is first-countable, which implies its character χ(G) = {aleph_0}.\")\n    print(\"  - The group G is not assumed to be Hausdorff.
