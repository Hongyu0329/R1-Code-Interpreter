    Analyzes the direction of the gravitational force based on the assumption in option C.
    
    The assumption (C) is: Field strength varies inversely with apparent propagation time.
    
    We model the force as having a magnitude S = k/t_p, where t_p is the propagation time,
    and a direction pointing toward the source's retarded position.
    
    The analysis is done from the reference frame of mass 1 (M1), which is stationary at the origin (0, 0).
    Mass 2 (M2) moves with velocity v along a line parallel to the x-axis.
    We calculate the force on M1 at the moment M2's instantaneous position is at its closest approach, on the y-axis.

    gamma = 1.0 / math.sqrt(1 - (v**2 / c**2))

    # 2. At the moment of closest approach (t=0 for M1), M2's instantaneous
    #    position is P_inst = (0, b). The force M1 feels at this moment comes from
    #    M2's earlier, "retarded" position, P_ret.

    # 3. Calculate the propagation time (t_p) from the retarded position.
    #    This is derived from solving c*t_p = distance, which for this geometry
    #    gives t_p = gamma * b / c.
    t_p = gamma * b / c

    # 4. The retarded position's x-coordinate is x_ret = -v * t_p.
    #    The y-coordinate is simply b.
    x_ret = -v * t_p
    y_ret = b
    
    # 5. Assumption C: Force strength 'S' is inversely proportional to t_p.
    S = k / t_p

    # 6. The force vector F points from the observer (0,0) to the retarded position (x_ret, y_ret).
    #    The direction is given by the unit vector n_ret = (x_ret, y_ret) / |(x_ret, y_ret)|.
    #    The magnitude of the position vector is the distance the signal traveled, which is c * t_p.
