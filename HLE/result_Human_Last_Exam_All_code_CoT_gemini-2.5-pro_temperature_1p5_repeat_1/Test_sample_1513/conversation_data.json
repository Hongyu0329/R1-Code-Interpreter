    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this geographical riddle.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the clues provided in your request:\n1.  **Isolation:** The location is an island town that is more than 500 kilometers away from any other inhabited island. This points to a very remote place.\n2.  **Geography:** The town sits on a bay which was formed by a volcanic caldera.\n3.  **Naming Convention:** The name of the town is the same as the name of the bay.\n\nBased on these clues, I'll evaluate the most well-known remote islands:\n*   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, is extremely remote but its name doesn't match the bay it sits on, nor is the bay itself a caldera.\n*   **Pitcairn Island:** The capital, Adamstown, is on Bounty Bay. The names do not match.\n*   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is Hanga Roa. It is extremely isolated (over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands). The town of Hanga Roa is located on Hanga Roa Bay, so the names match. The island is entirely of volcanic origin, featuring prominent calderas, and the bay itself is a direct result of this volcanic landscape.\n\nHanga Roa on Easter Island is the only candidate that successfully meets all the criteria described in the riddle.\n\nHere is the Python code that will provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle based on a set of clues.\n\n    Clues:\n    1.  An island town.\n    2.  More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    3.  Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4.  The bay shares the town's name.\n\n    The answer is Hanga Roa, the main town on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.\n    - The town of Hanga Roa is located on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    - The island is of volcanic origin, and its landscape, including the bay,\n      was formed by its volcanoes and calderas.\n    \"\"\"\n    answer = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
