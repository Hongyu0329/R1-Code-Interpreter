    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes:** We'll place the first cube, C1, in a standard position in a 3D coordinate system. Let its corners be at coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, and z are either 0 or 1. This means C1 occupies the space defined by `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects opposite corners, like (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most commonly interpreted as a shift vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. Therefore, the second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 unit along each of the three axes. It occupies the space `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region of space that is part of *both* cubes. We can find the boundaries of this intersection by looking at the overlap on each axis:\n    *   **x-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **y-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **z-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    This means the intersection is itself a smaller cube.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The side length of this intersection cube is the length of the interval `[1/2, 1]`, which is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`. The volume of a cube is its side length cubed. So, the volume of the intersection is `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the problem\ncube_side_length = 1\nshift = 1/2\n\n# The intersection of the two cubes is another, smaller cube.\n# Its side length is the original cube's side length minus the shift value.\nintersection_side_length = cube_side_length - shift\n\n# The volume is the side length of the intersection cube, cubed.\nvolume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\nprint(\"The side length of the intersection cube is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{cube_side_length} - {shift} = {intersection_side_length}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe volume of the intersection is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"Volume = {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
