    print("The question asks for the 'root cause factor'. This means we must look for the most fundamental issue that led to the others.")

    print("\nStep 1: Evaluating secondary factors and symptoms.")
    print("E. Default rates: High default rates directly caused RMBS cash flows to stop, crushing their value. However, the high defaults were a *symptom*, not the root cause. We must ask: *Why* did so many people default?")
    print("G. Recovery rates: Low recovery rates on foreclosed homes magnified the losses. This was caused by a flooded housing market from mass defaults, so it is also a *consequence*, not the root cause.")
    print("H. The rating of the credit agency: Credit agencies wrongly gave high ratings to risky RMBS. This was a critical *failure of oversight* that allowed the problem to grow, but it did not create the underlying risk itself. The risk existed regardless of the incorrect rating.")

    print("\nStep 2: Evaluating contributing, but not root, causes.")
    print("C. Average FICO scores on the loans: Low FICO scores in the loan pools were a direct indicator of high credit risk. This is very close to the root cause, but it is a *characteristic* of the loans that were originated.")
    print("B. The percent of floating rate debt: Adjustable-rate mortgages resetting to higher payments was a major trigger for defaults. This, like FICO scores, is a *feature* of the risky loans that were created.")
    print("A. Stock market level (S&P500): The stock market and RMBS values are correlated, but the RMBS crisis arguably *caused* the stock market crash, not the other way around.")
    print("D. The 10 year US Treasury rate: While this rate influences all bond prices, the unprecedented collapse in RMBS was driven by a massive spike in credit risk, not general interest rate movements.")

    print("\nStep 3: Identifying the root cause.")
    print("F. The quality of the loan issuer and RMBS originator: This is the most fundamental source of the problem. The crisis began with a breakdown in incentives at the origin of the loans. Loan issuers ('originators') were motivated by volume, not quality. They created risky products (subprime, low-doc loans) and did not perform proper underwriting because they knew they would sell the loans to RMBS packagers ('originators' of the security). This failure at the point of creation is the true root cause that led to pools of loans with low FICO scores and risky features, which in turn led to high defaults and the ultimate collapse in value.")

    print("-" * 70)
    print("Conclusion: The most fundamental, or root cause, factor was the poor quality and perverse incentives of the loan issuers and RMBS originators.")
