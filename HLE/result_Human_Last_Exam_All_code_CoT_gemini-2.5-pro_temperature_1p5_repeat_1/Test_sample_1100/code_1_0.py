    print("The new food is important because it represents a likely case of unconscious self-medication for a severe neurotransmitter deficiency.")
    print("\nHere is the reasoning:")
    print("1. The patient's postpartum symptoms (fatigue, chills, loss of hair) point to Sheehan's syndrome, a form of pituitary gland damage that disrupts hormone production.")
    print("2. The patient's primary treatment for schizophrenia is an antipsychotic, which works by blocking dopamine. The withdrawal of the second drug (likely a dopamine agonist) and the new pituitary condition would create a severe dopamine-deficient state.")
    print("3. A diet that 'tastes like bean salad' suggests a diet rich in beans, and fava beans in particular are known to have a distinct taste and are the most significant natural source of a specific compound.")
    print("4. This compound is Levodopa (L-DOPA), the direct precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine.")
    print("5. Therefore, the patient's craving for this food is a biologically-driven attempt to replenish her brain's dopamine levels to counteract her underlying illness, the effects of her medication, and her new hormonal condition.")
