# --- Given Parameters ---
# Band gap energy in eV
Eg = 3.0
# 1s exciton resonance peak energy in eV
E1 = 1.0
# Target principal quantum number
n_target = 3

# --- Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton ---
# The binding energy is the difference between the band gap and the exciton energy level.
Eb_1 = Eg - E1
print(f"Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (E_b,1).")
print(f"E_b,1 = E_g - E_1 = {Eg} eV - {E1} eV = {Eb_1} eV\n")


# --- Step 2: Calculate the exciton Rydberg energy (Rx) ---
# For a 2D exciton, the binding energy is E_b,n = Rx / (n - 0.5)^2.
# We can find Rx using the data for the n=1 state.
# Rx = E_b,1 * (1 - 0.5)^2
n1 = 1
Rx = Eb_1 * (n1 - 0.5)**2

print(f"Rx = E_b,1 * ({n1} - 0.5)^2 = {Eb_1} eV * (0.5)^2 = {Rx} eV\n")


# --- Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for n=3 ---
# This is the "Rydberg energy for n=3" requested by the problem.
Eb_n_target = Rx / (n_target - 0.5)**2
print(f"Step 3: Calculate the binding energy for n={n_target} (E_b,{n_target}).")
print("This is the final answer.\n")
# Print the final equation with all numbers
print("Final Calculation:")

print(f"E_b,{n_target} = {Rx} eV / ({n_target - 0.5})^2 = {Eb_n_target:.3f} eV")
