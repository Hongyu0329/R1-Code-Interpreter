    "This is a fascinating geometry problem. To solve it, we need to understand the symmetry of an icosahedron when it's resting on one of its faces.\n\nHere is my plan to determine the shape of the water surface:\n1.  **Analyze the Setup:** The icosahedron tank is standing on one of its triangular faces, which is horizontal. The tank is half-filled, which means the water occupies 50% of the tank's total volume.\n2.  **Use Symmetry:** A regular icosahedron is highly symmetrical. When placed on a face, the face directly opposite it is also horizontal and parallel to the base. Due to this symmetry, the plane that cuts the icosahedron into two equal volumes is the horizontal plane exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces. This plane represents the surface of the water.\n3.  **Identify the Cross-Section:** The core of the problem is to determine the shape of this central cross-section. The axis running through the center of the top and bottom faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. The water surface is a plane perpendicular to this axis.\n4.  **Determine the Polygon:** This plane intersects a specific set of the icosahedron's edges. By analyzing the structure, we find that it intersects 6 edges. The points of intersection form the vertices of the resulting shape. Due to the icosahedron's symmetry, these vertices form a regular polygon. A 6-sided regular polygon is a regular hexagon.\n\nThe following Python code walks through this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icosahedron_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank\n    by reasoning through its geometry and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the shape of the water surface in a half-filled icosahedron tank:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 75)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the water level based on volume and symmetry.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Water Level\")\n    print(\"An icosahedron resting on a face has a parallel top face.
