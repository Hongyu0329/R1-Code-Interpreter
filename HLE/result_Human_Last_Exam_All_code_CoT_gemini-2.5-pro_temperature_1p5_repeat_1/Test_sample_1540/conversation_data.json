    "My plan is to first analyze the memory requirements for a C program that solves this problem efficiently. Then, I will create a Python script that explains this analysis, calculates the total memory usage, and presents the final answer in the required format.\n\n### C Program Analysis\n\n1.  **Input Handling**: The most straightforward and robust way to handle the input strings in C is to read them into character arrays. Since the maximum length is 100, we need buffers of size 101 to accommodate the string characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  **Variables**: The minimal set of variables required for a clean implementation would be:\n    *   `char str1[101];`: An array to hold the first string.\n    *   `char str2[101];`: An array to hold the second string.\n    *   `int i;`: An integer to use as a loop index for character-by-character comparison.\n3.  **Logic**: The program will loop from the first character to the last. In each iteration, it will compare the lowercase versions of the characters from `str1` and `str2` at the current index `i`. Using `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` is ideal for this. The loop terminates and prints the result as soon as a difference is found. If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n4.  **Memory Calculation**: We calculate the total memory `m` by summing the sizes of the declared variables. We'll use standard sizes for data types on common 32-bit and 64-bit systems.\n    *   `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n    *   `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `str1`: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `str2`: `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n    *   Memory for `i`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n    *   Total memory `m` = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206 bytes.\n\nNow, I will write the Python script to present this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_analyze():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the memory usage of an efficient C program\n    for the given problem and provides the total memory in bytes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Plan Explanation ---\n    print(\"Plan: To solve the problem, we will first determine the memory usage 'm'\")\n    print(\"of a memory-efficient C program.
