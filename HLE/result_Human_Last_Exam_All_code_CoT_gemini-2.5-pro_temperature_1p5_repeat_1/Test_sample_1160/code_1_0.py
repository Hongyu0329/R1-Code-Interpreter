    # Let p_n be the probability that a simple random walk starting at (n,0,0)
    # escapes the cube C_n = [0, 2n]^3 and never returns.

    # 1. Scaling of escape probability:
    # Based on the analogy with potential theory for Brownian motion, the probability
    # of a random walk starting just outside a large object of size L to escape to
    # infinity (i.e., not return to the object) is proportional to 1/L.
    # For the cube C_n, its characteristic size L is proportional to n.
    # So, the probability of never returning to C_n from an adjacent point is p_escape ~ c/n for some constant c.

    # 2. Total probability p_n:
    # The probability p_n is an average of these escape probabilities over all
    # possible exit points. Thus, p_n also scales as 1/n.
    # p_n ~ C/n for some constant C.

    # 3. Calculation of the limit:
    # We need to find the limit of ln(1/p_n) / ln(n) as n -> infinity.
    # With p_n ~ C/n, we have 1/p_n ~ n/C.
    # ln(1/p_n) ~ ln(n/C) = ln(n) - ln(C).
    # So, the expression becomes (ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n) = 1 - ln(C)/ln(n).

    # As n -> infinity, ln(C)/ln(n) -> 0.
    # The limit is 1.
