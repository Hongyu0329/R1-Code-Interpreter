  Analyzes whether Kant's account of aesthetic judgment is descriptive or normative.

  Kant's account in the "Critique of Judgment" is descriptive in that it analyzes the cognitive
  faculties (imagination, understanding) involved in making a judgment of taste.
  However, it is also normative because it prescribes the conditions for a *valid* judgment.
  Kant argues that a pure judgment of taste must be disinterested and must lay claim to
  universal assent. By setting these criteria, he is not merely describing how all judgments
  are made, but how a proper aesthetic judgment *ought* to be made. He establishes a
  standard of correctness. Therefore, the account is not purely descriptive.
