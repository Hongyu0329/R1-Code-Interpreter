    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations performed as a function of the input size `n`.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the dominant part of the algorithm:** The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. The number of times this loop executes will determine the overall complexity.\n\n2.  **Analyze the loop condition:** The loop continues as long as the variable `q` is greater than 0. Let's track how `q` changes.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside each iteration of the loop, `x` is set to the current `q`, and then a new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   This means that in every iteration, the value that controls the loop is effectively divided by the base `c`.\n\n3.  **Count the number of iterations:** The process of repeatedly dividing `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is logarithmic. The number of iterations will be proportional to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`. This number is `floor(log_c(n)) + 1`. Therefore, the loop runs `O(log_c(n))` times.\n\n4.  **Analyze the work inside the loop:** The operations inside the `while` loop are:\n    *   `i := i + 1` (increment)\n    *   `x := q` (assignment)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (integer division)\n    *   `aᵢ := x — qc` (multiplication and subtraction, equivalent to a modulo operation `x % c`)\n    Assuming these basic arithmetic operations take constant time, O(1), the work done inside each iteration is constant.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total complexity:** The total time complexity is the product of the number of iterations and the work done per iteration.\n    *   Total Complexity = (Number of iterations) × (Work per iteration)\n    *   Total Complexity = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n))\n\n6.  **Simplify using Big O notation:** In Big O notation, the base of a logarithm does not affect the complexity class, because logarithms of different bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`). Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `1/log(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, the complexity is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements the given algorithm. It calculates and prints the base `c` representation for a given number `n`.\n\n```python\ndef print_base_representation(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements the IMAG(n, c) algorithm to find and print the base-c representation of n.\n    It prints each digit of the final representation as requested.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): A non-negative integer.\n        c (int): The base, an integer greater than or equal to 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Validate the inputs\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or not isinstance(c, int) or n < 0 or c < 2:\n        print(\"Input error: Please provide integers n >= 0 and c >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # Handle the special case where n is 0 as per the algorithm's logic.\n    if n == 0:\n        print(f\"The base-{c} representation of 0 is: (0)\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Initialization\n    i = 0\n    x = n\n    q = x // c\n    a0 = x - q * c\n    \n    digits = [a0] # This will store the digits a_0, a_1, a_2, ...\n\n    # Step 2: Loop while q > 0\n    while q > 0:\n        # Step 2.1\n        i = i + 1\n        x = q\n        q = x // c\n        ai = x - q * c\n        digits.append(ai)\n        # Step 2.2: od (end of loop iteration)\n\n    # Step 3: Return the representation\n    # The algorithm generates digits from least significant (a_0) to most significant (a_i).\n    # For standard display, we reverse the list.\n    digits.reverse()\n    \n    # Format the output to show the sequence of numbers (digits)\n    # This fulfills the instruction \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    print(f\"The base-{c} representation of {n} is:\", end=\" \")\n    representation_str = \", \".join(map(str, digits))\n    print(f\"({representation_str})\")\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\n# You can change these values to test the algorithm.\nnumber_to_convert = 345\nbase = 16\nprint_base_representation(number_to_convert, base)\n\nnumber_to_convert = 25\nbase = 2\nprint_base_representation(number_to_convert, base)\n```\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
