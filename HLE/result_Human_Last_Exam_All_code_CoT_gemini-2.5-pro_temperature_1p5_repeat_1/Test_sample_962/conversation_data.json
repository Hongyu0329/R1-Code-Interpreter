    "Of course. I will provide a Python implementation that demonstrates the principles of a two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Protocol Choice**: I will implement a simplified version of the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)** signature scheme. FROST is a state-of-the-art protocol that is provably secure and features a two-round signing variant, which perfectly matches your request.\n\n2.  **Simplification**: For clarity and to avoid complex dependencies, this implementation will use modular arithmetic over a finite field instead of elliptic curve cryptography. The core cryptographic principles remain the same. We will simulate:\n    *   **Scalar Multiplication (`k*G`)** as **Exponentiation (`g^k mod p`)**.\n    *   **Point Addition (`P1+P2`)** as **Multiplication (`v1 * v2 mod p`)**.\n\n3.  **Phases of the Simulation**:\n    *   **Setup (Key Generation)**: A \"trusted dealer\" will generate and distribute secret shares to `n` participants. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced by a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, which is a multi-round protocol on its own.\n    *   **Signing (Two Rounds)**: A subgroup of `t` participants will collaborate to sign a message.\n        *   **Round 1**: Each participant creates a secret nonce and broadcasts a public commitment to it.\n        *   **Round 2**: After receiving commitments from others, each participant computes a partial signature.\n    *   **Aggregation & Verification**: A coordinator aggregates the partial signatures to form the final signature. We will then verify this signature against the group's public key.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The code will print the steps and values involved, clearly showing the final verification equation with all its numerical components.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\n\n# --- Cryptographic Primitives (using modular arithmetic for simplicity) ---\n# In a real implementation, these would be elliptic curve operations.\n\n# Prime modulus and generator for our finite field\nP = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F\nG = 2\n\ndef sha256_as_int(data_str):\n    \"\"\"Hashes a string and returns it as an integer.\"\"\"\n    return int(hashlib.sha256(data_str.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)\n\n# Simulates scalar multiplication: k * BasePoint -> g^k mod p\ndef scalar_mult(k):\n    return pow(G, k, P)\n\n# Simulates point addition: P1 + P2 -> v1 * v2 mod p\ndef point_add(v1, v2):\n    return (v1 * v2) % P\n\n# --- Shamir's Secret Sharing Polynomial ---\nclass Polynomial:\n    def __init__(self, degree, secret=None):\n        self.degree = degree\n        # Generate random coefficients.
