    "To find the number of real intersection points for the two given plane quadrics, we can solve the system of two polynomial equations. A systematic way to do this is to eliminate one of the variables, which results in a single polynomial equation in the other variable. The number of real roots of this new equation will give us the number of real intersection points.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two equations as polynomials in variables `x` and `y`.\n2.  Use the resultant method to eliminate the variable `y`. This will produce a single polynomial equation in `x`. The roots of this polynomial are the x-coordinates of the intersection points.\n3.  The resulting polynomial will have high-degree coefficients. We will simplify it by dividing all coefficients by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n4.  We will then print this final, simplified polynomial equation in `x`.\n5.  Finally, we will solve for the roots of this polynomial and count how many of them are real numbers. This count will be our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom math import gcd\nfrom functools import reduce\n\ndef count_intersection_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of real intersection points\n    between the two specified quadrics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variables\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Define the two quadric equations as polynomials\n    # Eq1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    # Eq2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    poly1 = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    poly2 = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n\n    print(\"The two quadric equations are:\")\n    print(f\"Equation 1: {poly1} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Equation 2: {poly2} = 0\")\n    print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # We eliminate 'y' using the resultant method.
