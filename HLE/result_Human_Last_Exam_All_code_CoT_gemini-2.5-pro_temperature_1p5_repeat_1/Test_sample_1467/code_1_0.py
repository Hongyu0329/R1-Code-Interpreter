    print("1. 'Polynomial steps of chain-of-thought' implies iterating the transformer function T(x) for a polynomial number of times, p(n).")
    print("2. From Part 1, a single execution of T(x) is in TC^0.")
    print("3. Any TC^0 computation can be simulated in polynomial time on a standard computer. So, one transformer pass is in the class P.")
