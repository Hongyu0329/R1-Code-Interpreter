# The task is to find the best average estimate of a male's age since eclosion for two insect species.

# Species 1: Tridactylophagus tartari (a Ripiphorid beetle)
# This species has a very short adult lifespan (a few days) and mates very soon after eclosion.
# An age of 16 hours is a plausible average time to find a mate.
species_1_name = "Tridactylophagus tartari"
species_1_age = "16 hours"

# Species 2: Periplaneta americana (American cockroach)
# This species becomes sexually mature about a week after eclosion and lives for over a year as an adult.
# An average age of one month for a mating observation is a reasonable estimate, being "relatively shortly" after eclosion in the context of its long adult life.
species_2_name = "Periplaneta americana"
species_2_age = "one month"
