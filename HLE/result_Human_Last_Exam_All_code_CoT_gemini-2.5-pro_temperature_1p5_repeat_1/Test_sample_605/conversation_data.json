    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the key components:** The problem asks for the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link. I am given the defining polynomial and the weights of the ambient projective space.\n2.  **Recall the definition:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant, `c(X)`, for a hypersurface `X` defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of degree `d` in a weighted projective space with weights `w_i` is given by the formula: `c(X) = d - Σwᵢ`.\n3.  **Determine the degree `d`:** The polynomial is quasi-homogeneous, meaning all its monomial terms have the same weighted degree. I will calculate this degree by picking one of the terms. Let's use the term `z₅³`. The weights are `(w₁, w₂, w₃, w₄, w₅) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`. The degree of this term is `3 * w₅ = 3 * 75 = 225`. So, `d = 225`.\n4.  **Calculate the sum of the weights `Σwᵢ`:** I will sum the given weights: `22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75`.\n5.  **Compute the invariant:** I will substitute the values of `d` and `Σwᵢ` into the formula `c(X) = d - Σwᵢ`.\n6.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will perform these calculations and print the result in the specified format, showing each number in the final equation. A key property of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces is that their degree equals the sum of the weights, which implies the invariant should be zero. My calculation will verify this.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n\n    The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as c = d - sum(w_i), where d is the\n    degree of the quasi-homogeneous polynomial and w_i are the weights of the\n    ambient space.\n\n    For a Calabi-Yau variety, the degree d is equal to the sum of the weights.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The weights of the ambient space P(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The defining polynomial is:\n    # 0 = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3\n    # A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its terms have the same weighted degree.\n    # Let's calculate the degree 'd' using the last term, z_5^3.\n    # The exponent is 3 and the corresponding weight is 75.\n    degree = 3 * weights[4] # 3 * 75 = 225\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the weights\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant\n    invariant = degree - sum_of_weights\n\n    # Print the final equation with all its components\n    # The format is: d - (w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + w5) = result\n    weight_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"{degree} - ({weight_sum_str}) = {invariant}\")\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n<<<0>>>\n```"
