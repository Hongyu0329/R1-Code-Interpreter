    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a breakdown of the problem and a Python script to calculate the answer.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 Riemann surface and $C^{(15)}$ is its 15th symmetric power. The rank of the Néron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\n\n2.  **Find a Key Formula**: The first step is to relate the quantity we want, $\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)})$, to a more fundamental invariant of the curve $C$. There is a standard formula in algebraic geometry that connects the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n    This formula is valid for any symmetric power $d \\ge 1$. In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The problem now simplifies to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve $C$.\n\n3.  **Find the Minimum Rank**: The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the algebraic structure of the curve $C$. For a *generic* curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has the simplest possible endomorphism ring, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the canonical principal polarization (the theta divisor), which means its rank is 1.\n    Therefore, the minimum possible value is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Rank**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety is bounded above by $g^2$. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this means $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. This maximum rank is achieved for very special curves, specifically those whose Jacobians have maximal Complex Multiplication (CM). Such Jacobians are isogenous to a product of $g$ CM elliptic curves. An example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian achieves this maximum rank is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 = z^4$.\n    Therefore, the maximum possible value is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: Now we substitute these minimum and maximum values back into our formula from Step 2.\n    *   **Smallest Rank for X**: $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   **Largest Rank for X**: $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this explanation and calculates the results.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riemann_surface_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group\n    for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Parameters ---\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # The symmetric power\n\n    # --- Introduction and Plan ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group (NS) of X.\")\n    print(f\"X is the {d}th symmetric power of a genus g = {g} Riemann surface C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
