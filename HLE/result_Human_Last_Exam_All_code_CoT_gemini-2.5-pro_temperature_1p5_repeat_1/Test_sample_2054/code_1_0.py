    Solves the theoretical questions on computational complexity.

    Let P be the decision problem "is S free?".
    Let co-P be the decision problem "is S not free?".

    (a) If co-P is NP-hard, does that imply P is NP-hard?
        - If co-P is NP-hard, then P is co-NP-hard.
        - The question "is a co-NP-hard problem also NP-hard?" is not known to be true.
        - It would imply NP = co-NP. So, the answer is No.

    (b) If co-P is NP-complete, does that imply P is NP-complete?
        - If co-P is NP-complete, then P is co-NP-complete.
        - The question "is a co-NP-complete problem also NP-complete?" is not known to be true.
        - It would imply NP = co-NP. So, the answer is No.

    (c) If P is in NP, and co-P is NP-hard, does that imply P is NP-complete?
        - Given: P is in NP.
        - Given: co-P is NP-hard.
        - From "P is in NP", we know that "co-P is in co-NP".
        - So we have an NP-hard problem (co-P) which is in co-NP. This implies NP = co-NP.
        - For P to be NP-complete, we need to show P is NP-hard.
        - From "co-P is NP-hard", we know that P is co-NP-hard.
        - Since NP = co-NP, co-NP-hard is the same as NP-hard. So P is NP-hard.
        - Since P is in NP (given) and P is NP-hard (deduced), P is NP-complete. So, the answer is Yes.
