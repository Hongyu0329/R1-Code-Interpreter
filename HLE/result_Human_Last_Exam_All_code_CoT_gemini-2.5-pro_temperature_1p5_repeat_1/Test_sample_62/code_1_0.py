# The riddle is a word puzzle hinting at a specific Italian coffee drink.
# "Cafi." is a misspelling of "Caffè", the Italian word for coffee.
# The clue about preferring what is "not of the correct" shape is a pun.
# It points to a drink called "Caffè Corretto", which means "corrected coffee".
# This drink is an espresso "corrected" with liquor, making it "peculiar".

# The first part of the name, corrected from "Cafi."
first_word = "Caffè"

# The second part of the name, revealed by the pun on "correct"
second_word = "Corretto"

# The full, correctly spelled name of the drink
full_name = first_word + " " + second_word

# Print the final answer
print(full_name)
