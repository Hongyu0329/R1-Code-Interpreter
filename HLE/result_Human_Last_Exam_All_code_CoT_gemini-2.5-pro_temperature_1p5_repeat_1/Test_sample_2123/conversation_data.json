    "This is a classic linguistic riddle. The solution relies on a pun that works between the Russian and English languages, related to a specific feature of Vienna's streets. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** The riddle connects a \"Russian translation,\" \"Vienna's wide boulevards,\" and an \"English poet's surname.\"\n2.  **Focus on Vienna's boulevards:** A notable feature of historic Viennese streets, especially the Ringstrasse, was the presence of numerous, small, cylindrical or octagonal newspaper kiosks (called *Trafik* in German).\n3.  **Find the Russian connection:** In Russian, these kiosks were colloquially nicknamed \"попик\" (popik). This is a diminutive form of the word \"поп\" (pop).\n4.  **Uncover the pun:** The word \"поп\" (pop) is the common Russian word for an Orthodox priest. The kiosks were given this nickname because their rounded tops resembled the cupolas of a small chapel or a priest's hat.\n5.  **Connect to the English poet:** The surname of the famous 18th-century English poet, Alexander Pope, is transliterated into Russian as \"Поп\" (Pop).\n6.  **Synthesize the solution:** A Russian essayist describing the Vienna boulevards could make a witty observation that the streets were filled with \"little Popes\" (\"попики\"), creating a pun between the kiosks and the English poet. A literal-minded translation back into English would thus surface the poet's name.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logical connection.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the key elements of the riddle.\nlocation = \"Vienna's wide boulevards\"\nfeature_on_boulevards = \"Newspaper kiosks\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the Russian nickname for these kiosks.\n# The nickname arose because the kiosks' shape resembled a small chapel or a priest's hat.\nrussian_nickname_for_kiosk = \"попик (popik)\"\nroot_word = \"поп (pop)\"\n\n# Step 3: Define the meaning of the root word in Russian.\nmeaning_of_root_word = \"priest\"\n\n# Step 4: Identify the English poet whose surname is a homograph (sounds the same)\n# to this Russian word when transliterated.\nenglish_poet_full_name = \"Alexander Pope\"\nenglish_surname = \"Pope\"\nrussian_transliteration_of_surname = \"Поп (Pop)\"\n\n# Step 5: Formulate the logical \"equation\" that solves the riddle.\n# The equation shows that the object's nickname in Russian is identical to the poet's name in Russian.\nprint(\"Solving the Riddle: The Logical Equation\")\nprint(\"=========================================\")\nprint(f\"1. Object in Vienna: {feature_on_boulevards}\")\nprint(f\"2. Russian Nickname for Object: '{russian_nickname_for_kiosk}'\")\nprint(f\"3. Root of Nickname: '{root_word}'\")\nprint(f\"4. Russian Transliteration of English Poet's Surname '{english_surname}': '{russian_transliteration_of_surname}'\")\nprint(\"\\nConclusion of the Pun:\")\nprint(f\"'{root_word}' (kiosk's root name) = '{russian_transliteration_of_surname}' (poet's translated name)\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is:\")\nprint(english_surname)\n\n```\n<<<Pope>>>"
