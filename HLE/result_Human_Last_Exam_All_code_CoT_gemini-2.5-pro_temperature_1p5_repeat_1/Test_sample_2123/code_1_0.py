# Step 1: Define the key elements of the riddle.
location = "Vienna's wide boulevards"
feature_on_boulevards = "Newspaper kiosks"

# Step 2: Identify the Russian nickname for these kiosks.
# The nickname arose because the kiosks' shape resembled a small chapel or a priest's hat.
russian_nickname_for_kiosk = "попик (popik)"
root_word = "поп (pop)"

# Step 3: Define the meaning of the root word in Russian.
meaning_of_root_word = "priest"

# Step 4: Identify the English poet whose surname is a homograph (sounds the same)
# to this Russian word when transliterated.
english_poet_full_name = "Alexander Pope"
english_surname = "Pope"
russian_transliteration_of_surname = "Поп (Pop)"

# Step 5: Formulate the logical "equation" that solves the riddle.
# The equation shows that the object's nickname in Russian is identical to the poet's name in Russian.
