    Solves the theoretical questions about Hopf-Ore extensions.

    The solutions are derived based on standard formulas and assumptions
    in the theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups at roots of unity,
    specifically regarding partial actions and Hopf-Ore extensions.
    The variables d and M, representing the order of the group-like element g
    and the root of unity q respectively, are treated as potentially equal,
    a common scenario in this context which makes the problem consistent.
