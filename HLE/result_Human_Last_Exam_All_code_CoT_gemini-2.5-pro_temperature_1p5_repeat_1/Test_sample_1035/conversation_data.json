    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$. The \"total number of vertices\" is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the family.\n\nLet the family of bipartite graphs be $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$. We want to minimize $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$, subject to the condition that $\\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) = E(K_n)$. The vertices of each $G_i$ are a subset of the vertices of $K_n$.\n\nThis is a known problem in graph theory. The minimum value, let's call it $S(n)$, is achieved when the bipartite graphs are complete and partition the edges of $K_n$. The problem was studied by Graham, Pollak, and Witsenhausen, and a definitive solution is presented by Donald Knuth.\n\nThe value of $S(n)$ is given by the formula:\n$S(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\lceil \\log_2 k \\rceil$\n\nFor $n=35$, we need to calculate:\n$S(35) = \\sum_{k=1}^{35} \\lceil \\log_2 k \\rceil$\n\nI will write a Python script to compute this sum. The script will iterate from $k=1$ to $35$, calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 k \\rceil$ for each $k$, and add it to a running total. It will then print the full equation, showing each term of the sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  Import the `math` library for `log2` and `ceil` functions.\n2.  Set the value of `n` to 35.\n3.  Initialize an empty list to store each term of the sum, $\\lceil \\log_2 k \\rceil$.\n4.  Loop `k` from 1 to 35. In each iteration:\n    a. Calculate `ceil(log2(k))`. Note that for $k=1$, $\\log_2 1 = 0$, so the ceiling is 0.\n    b. Append the result to the list of terms.\n5.  Calculate the total sum of the terms in the list.\n6.  Print the terms joined by \" + \" followed by the total sum, to display the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n for n=35.\n    The formula is S(n) = sum_{k=1 to n} ceil(log2(k)).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n    \n    terms = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Calculate each term from k=1 to n\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        # log2(1) is 0, so ceil(log2(1)) is 0.\n        term = math.ceil(math.log2(k)) if k > 0 else 0\n        terms.append(term)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n    # Build the equation string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, terms))\n    \n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices is the result of the following sum:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_sum}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<147>>>"
