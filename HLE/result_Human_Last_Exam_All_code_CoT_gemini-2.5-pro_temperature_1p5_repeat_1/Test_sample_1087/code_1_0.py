    # The problem reduces to finding a configuration of 5 points where the graph of
    # distances < r is a 5-cycle, and the graph of distances >= r is also a 5-cycle.
    # A regular pentagon provides such a configuration.

    # The distances between vertices of a regular pentagon are of two types:
    # 1. The side length, s
    # 2. The diagonal length, d

    # Let phi be the golden ratio
    phi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

    # For a regular pentagon, the relationship between side and diagonal is d = s * phi.
    # It is known that the largest regular pentagon that fits in a unit square has
    # a side length s_max = 1 / phi.
    s_max = 1 / phi
    
    # The diagonal length for this pentagon is:
    d = s_max * phi

    # s_max < r  and  d >= r
    # So, r must be in the interval (s_max, d].
    # To find the largest possible r for this configuration, we take the upper bound of the interval.
