    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to understand the terminology and select a specific nanocar molecule as a reference.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define \"Perfluoro-\"**: In organic chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n2.  **Select a Nanocar Molecule**: \"Nanocar\" is a general term for several different single-molecule machines. We need to choose a specific, well-documented example. A good candidate is the motorized nanocar developed by researchers, which has a known chemical formula.\n3.  **Find the Chemical Formula**: The chosen motorized nanocar has the chemical formula C68H54O2.\n4.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms**: From the formula C68H54O2, we can see there are 54 hydrogen atoms.\n5.  **Calculate Fluorine Atoms**: For a \"perfluoro-\" version of this molecule, all 54 hydrogen atoms would be replaced by 54 fluorine atoms.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a simple Python script to state these facts and print the final calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoro_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar\n    based on a specific, known nanocar molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the chemical formula of a known nanocar.\n    # We will use a motorized nanocar with the formula C68H54O2.\n    chemical_formula = \"C68H54O2\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the number of hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n    # In C68H54O2, the number of hydrogens (H) is 54.\n    num_hydrogens = 54\n\n    # Step 3: In a 'perfluoro-' compound, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    # Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_fluorines = num_hydrogens\n\n    # Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(f\"The chemical formula for a specific motorized nanocar is {chemical_formula}.\")\n    print(f\"This molecule contains {num_hydrogens} hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"A 'perfluoronanocar' is a hypothetical version where all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    # The requirement is to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine Atoms = Number of Hydrogen Atoms = {num_fluorines}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_perfluoro_atoms()\n```\n<<<54>>>"
