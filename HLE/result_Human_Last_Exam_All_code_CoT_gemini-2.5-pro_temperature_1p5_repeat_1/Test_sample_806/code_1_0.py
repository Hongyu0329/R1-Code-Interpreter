    # 1. The final adverse event is severe skin blistering after starting a third drug.
    # 2. This drug was a replacement for a previous anti-seizure medication, making it also an anti-epileptic drug (AED).
    # 3. Severe blistering reactions caused by AEDs are characteristic of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)
    #    or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).
    # 4. SJS/TEN is a T-cell mediated hypersensitivity reaction. The process is initiated by the interaction
    #    of the drug with a specific part of the immune system.
