    Solves the fortress problem for a 3D unit ball.

    The problem is interpreted by considering the "unit ball" in the L-infinity norm,
    which is a cube. For a standard L2-norm unit ball (a sphere), an infinite
    number of guards would be required. The cube interpretation allows for a finite solution.

    A cube has 6 faces. To guard the entire exterior, a guard can be placed at
    the center of each face. Each guard sees the entire half-space extending
    outward from that face. The union of these 6 half-spaces covers the
    entire exterior of the cube. Fewer than 6 guards would leave at least one
    cardinal direction unguarded.
