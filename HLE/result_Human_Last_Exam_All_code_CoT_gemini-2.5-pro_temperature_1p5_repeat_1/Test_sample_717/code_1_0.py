# Based on the reasoning, the value of n is determined by the projective dimension of the functor F.
# Step 1: The problem states that the functor f "discretizes" F.
# This implies that the source poset I is a discrete poset.

# Step 2: The functor category Fun(I, Vect_K) for a discrete poset I is semisimple.
# The global dimension of a semisimple category is 0.
# global_dimension_I = 0

# Step 3: Any object G in Fun(I, Vect_K) is therefore projective.

# Step 4: The functor f^k is given as an exact functor from Fun(I, Vect_K) to Fun(P, Vect_K).
# We identify f^k as the left Kan extension f_!.
# f_! preserves projective objects.

# Step 5: The functor F is in the image of f_!, so F = f_!(G) for some G.
# Since G is projective and f_! preserves projectives, F must be projective.

# Step 6: An object M is n-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length n.
# A projective object P has a projective resolution of length 0:
# 0 -> P -> P -> 0.

# Step 7: Since F is projective, it is 0-resolvable.
n = 0

# The final equation is n = 0.
