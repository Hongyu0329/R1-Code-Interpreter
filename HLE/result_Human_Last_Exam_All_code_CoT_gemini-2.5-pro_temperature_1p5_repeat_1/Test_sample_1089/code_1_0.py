    The key to this question is the specific repair method described: "build-up of layers of filler material".
    This process is additive, meaning it's used to replace material that has been lost. Let's analyze the options:

    - A (Stress Corrosion Cracking) and E (Fatigue Cracking): These are forms of cracking. While welding can be used to repair cracks, the term "build-up" more strongly implies restoring a larger volume or surface that has been worn away.

    - B (Foreign Object Damage): This causes nicks and gouges, which involves material loss. It is a valid candidate for TIG weld repair.

    - D (Creep Deformation): This is the plastic stretching of the blade due to high temperature and stress. Welding adds material; it does not correct the overall deformation or "stretching" of the component.

    - F (High-Temperature Oxidation and Corrosion): This leads to surface material loss (thinning). It can be repaired by build-up, but it is often managed by specialized coatings.

    - C (Blade Tip Rub and Wear): This is the gradual wearing away of the blade tip material due to contact with the engine's casing. This directly reduces engine performance and efficiency by increasing the tip clearance. A very common and critical MRO procedure is to build the tip back to its original dimensions using TIG welding and then machine it to the final profile. This perfectly matches the description of "build-up of layers of filler material" as a primary and routine repair.

    Conclusion: While FOD is also repaired by welding, Blade Tip Rub and Wear is a more fundamental and routine type of degradation that is specifically addressed by building up material on the blade tips. Therefore, it is the best answer.
