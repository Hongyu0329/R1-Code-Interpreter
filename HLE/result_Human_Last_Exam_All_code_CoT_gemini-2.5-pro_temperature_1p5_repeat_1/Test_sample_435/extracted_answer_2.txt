Based on its role in promoting T cell fitness and a potent memory phenotype, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit significantly enhanced and more sustained cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) upon target antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.
