    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we'll verify that the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine the nature of the roots and constrains the possible Galois groups. If its square root is rational, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Find the Resolvent Cubic:** For a quartic polynomial, we can construct an associated cubic polynomial, called the resolvent cubic. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information about the Galois group's structure.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots.\n5.  **Synthesize Results:** By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we can identify the specific Galois group from a known classification table. For quartics, the main possibilities are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n6.  **Determine the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these calculations and print the reasoning at each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_square_free_part(n):\n    \"\"\"Finds the square-free part of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n < 0:\n        return -1 * get_square_free_part(-n)\n    \n    i = 2\n    free_part = n\n    while i * i <= free_part:\n        if free_part % (i * i) == 0:\n            free_part //= (i * i)\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return free_part\n\n# The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\n# This fits the form x^4 + px^2 + qx + r\np = 0\nq = 8\nr = 14\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n# I need to print the numbers in the equation\nprint(f\"The equation is x^4 + {p}x^3 + {p}x^2 + {q}x + {r} = 0.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n# Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2\nprime = 2\nprint(f\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p = {prime}:\")\nprint(f\"- p does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\nprint(f\"- p divides all other coefficients ({p}, {p}, {q}, {r}).\")\nprint(f\"- p^2 = {prime**2} does not divide the constant term ({r}).\")\nprint(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the discriminant Δ.\")\n# For x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Δ = -27*q^4 + 256*r^3\ndelta = -27 * (q**4) + 256 * (r**3)\nprint(\"The formula for the discriminant is Δ = -27 * q^4 + 256 * r^3.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting q = {q} and r = {r}:\")\nprint(f\"Δ = -27 * ({q}^4) + 256 * ({r}^3)\")\nprint(f\"Δ = -27 * {q**4} + 256 * {r**3}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {-27 * q**4} + {256 * r**3}\")\nprint(f\"Δ = {delta}\")\n\nsqrt_delta = math.sqrt(delta)\nis_square = (int(sqrt_delta) ** 2 == delta)\nprint(f\"\\nChecking if Δ is a perfect square in Q...\")\nprint(f\"sqrt({delta}) ≈ {sqrt_delta:.3f}, which is not an integer.\")\nprint(\"Since sqrt(Δ) is not rational, the Galois group is not a subgroup of A_4.\")\nprint(\"Possible groups are S_4, D_4, or C_4.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 4: Form and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial.\")\n# For x^4 + px^2 + qx + r, the resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 + 2py^2 + (p^2-4r)y - q^2\nres_c2 = 2 * p\nres_c1 = p**2 - 4 * r\nres_c0 = -(q**2)\nprint(\"The formula for the resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 + (2p)y^2 + (p^2-4r)y - q^2.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting p = {p}, q = {q}, r = {r}:\")\nprint(f\"g(y) = y^3 + {res_c2}y^2 + ({p**2} - 4*{r})y - {q**2}\")\nprint(f\"g(y) = y^3 + {res_c1}y - {q**2}\")\nprint(f\"So, the resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nChecking for rational roots of the resolvent cubic...\")\n# By the Rational Root Theorem, roots must be divisors of -64\ndivisors = sorted([d for d in range(1, abs(res_c0) + 1) if res_c0 % d == 0])\nrational_root = None\nfor d in divisors:\n    if d**3 + res_c1 * d + res_c0 == 0:\n        rational_root = d\n        break\n    if (-d)**3 + res_c1 * (-d) + res_c0 == 0:\n        rational_root = -d\n        break\n\nif rational_root is not None:\n    print(f\"Testing potential integer roots...
