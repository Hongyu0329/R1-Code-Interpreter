# The task is to find the number of internal adjunctions from F_11^3 to itself
# in the given 2-category C.
# Our analysis shows that this number is equal to the number of invertible 3x3 matrices
# with entries in the field F_11, which is the order of the general linear group GL(3, F_11).

# The order of the general linear group GL(n, F_q) is given by the formula:
# |GL(n, q)| = (q^n - 1) * (q^n - q) * (q^n - q^2) * ... * (q^n - q^(n-1))

# In our case, n=3 (for the dimension of the vector space F_11^3) and q=11 (for the field F_11).
n = 3
q = 11

# Calculate the components of the formula.
q_to_n = q**n

term1_val = q_to_n - (q**0)
term2_val = q_to_n - (q**1)
term3_val = q_to_n - (q**2)

# Calculate the final result.
result = term1_val * term2_val * term3_val

# Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.
