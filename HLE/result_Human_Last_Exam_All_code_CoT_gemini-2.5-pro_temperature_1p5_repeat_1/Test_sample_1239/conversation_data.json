    "This problem requires knowledge from mathematical physics concerning the symmetries of partial differential equations. The dimension of a Lie group of symmetries is equivalent to the number of independent infinitesimal generators that form the basis of the corresponding Lie algebra. These generators represent transformations of the system's variables (time, space, velocity, and pressure) that leave the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations unchanged.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of these symmetries:\n\n1.  **Physical Symmetries of Spacetime and Reference Frames:**\n    *   **Time Translation (1 dimension):** The equations are autonomous (coefficients don't depend on time), so solutions are independent of the time origin.\n    *   **Space Translations (3 dimensions):** The equations are homogeneous in space, meaning the laws are the same at every point in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   **Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions):** The equations are isotropic, meaning the laws are the same in every direction. The rotation group in 3D, $SO(3)$, is 3-dimensional.\n    *   **Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions):** The equations respect Galilean relativity; they are invariant under transformations to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n\n2.  **Scaling Symmetry:**\n    *   **Dilation (1 dimension):** The equations possess a specific scaling symmetry. If we scale time as $t' = a^2 t$, space as $\\mathbf{x}' = a\\mathbf{x}$, velocity as $\\mathbf{u}' = a^{-1}\\mathbf{u}$, and pressure as $p' = a^{-2}p$, the equations remain invariant. This yields one more symmetry generator.\n\n    Summing these up gives $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$ dimensions. This 11-dimensional algebra is sometimes referred to as the Navier-Stokes algebra.\n\n3.  **Pressure \"Gauge\" Symmetry:**\n    *   **Pressure Shift (1 dimension):** The Navier-Stokes equations only feature the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$. Consequently, shifting the pressure field by a constant, $p \\to p + c$, does not alter the equations. This provides an additional generator, $\\partial_p$. When this generator is included, the full maximal finite-dimensional Lie algebra of symmetries has a dimension of $11 + 1 = 12$.\n\nWhile there exists a broader infinite-dimensional symmetry group by allowing time-dependent pressure shifts, the question of \"the dimension\" typically refers to the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\")\n    print(\"The dimension is the sum of the number of independent generators for each type of symmetry transformation.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Dimension from time translation\n    dim_time = 1\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Time translation (t -> t + c)\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_time}\\n\")\n\n    # Dimension from space translations\n    dim_space = 3\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Space translations (x -> x + c) in R^3\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_space}\\n\")\n\n    # Dimension from space rotations\n    dim_rotation = 3\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Space rotations (SO(3) group)\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_rotation}\\n\")\n\n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts\n    dim_galilean = 3\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Galilean boosts (change of inertial frame)\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_galilean}\\n\")\n\n    # Dimension from scaling\n    dim_scaling = 1\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Scaling or dilation\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_scaling}\\n\")\n    \n    # Dimension from pressure shift\n    dim_pressure = 1\n    print(f\"Symmetry: Constant pressure shift (p -> p + c)\")\n    print(f\"Reason: The equations only depend on the pressure gradient âˆ‡p.\")\n    print(f\"Dimension: {dim_pressure}\\n\")\n\n    # Summing up all dimensions\n    total_dimension = dim_time + dim_space + dim_rotation + dim_galilean + dim_scaling + dim_pressure\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions from each independent symmetry.\")\n    \n    # The final print statement that shows the equation explicitly as requested.\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {dim_time} + {dim_space} + {dim_rotation} + {dim_galilean} + {dim_scaling} + {dim_pressure} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
