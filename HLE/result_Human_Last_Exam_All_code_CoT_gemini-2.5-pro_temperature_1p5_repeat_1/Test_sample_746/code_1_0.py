# A classic theorem in topology addresses the number of dispersion points
# in a compact connected metric space. A dispersion point is a point whose
# removal makes the space totally disconnected.

# The proof consists of two main parts:
# 1. Construction of an example: The cone over the Cantor set is a
#    compact connected metric space that has exactly one dispersion point (the apex).
#    This shows the maximum number is at least 1.
# 2. Proof of the upper bound: A proof by contradiction shows that a space
#    of this type cannot have two or more dispersion points. The assumption
#    of two such points leads to a logical contradiction regarding the
#    properties of connected subsets.

# Combining these facts, the maximum number of dispersion points must be 1.
