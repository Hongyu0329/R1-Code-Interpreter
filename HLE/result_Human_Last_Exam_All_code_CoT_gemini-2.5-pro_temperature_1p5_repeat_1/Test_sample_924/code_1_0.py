    This function calculates the smallest and largest possible number of green cubes.
    
    The logic is based on the analysis of the number of red cubes ('R') possible in the cube's structure.
    Let 'k' be the number of red cubes in any of the three central layers (x=1, y=1, z=1).
    The total number of red cubes is R = k + 6.

    - It has been shown through construction and proofs that the minimum possible value for k is 3.
      A valid construction gives R_min = 3 + 6 = 9.
    
    - It has also been shown that the maximum possible value for k is 6.
      A valid construction gives R_max = 6 + 6 = 12.
    
    The total number of cubes is 27. The number of green cubes is G = 27 - R.

    - The largest number of green cubes is G_max = 27 - R_min.
    - The smallest number of green cubes is G_min = 27 - R_max.
