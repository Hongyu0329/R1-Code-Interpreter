# The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of a set S of Diophantine equations.

# Step 1: Establish the upper bound.
# The set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite.
# We can represent its cardinality by aleph_0.
aleph_0_str = "aleph_0 (countably infinite)"
# The set S is a subset of all Diophantine equations, so its cardinality
# is at most aleph_0.

# Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.
# We need to find a statement psi such that the cardinality of S is aleph_0.
# A. The set of true but in ZFC unprovable statements about Diophantine
#    equations is known to be countably infinite. Let's call this set U.
cardinality_of_U = aleph_0_str

# B. We can choose psi to be the statement: "The set of all true sentences of
#    arithmetic exists". Let's call this TA.
#    With this axiom, ZFC + TA can prove all true arithmetic statements.
#    This means that for this psi, the set S becomes equal to the set U.
cardinality_of_S_with_TA = cardinality_of_U

# Step 3: Conclude the maximum cardinality.
# Since the cardinality can be aleph_0 and it cannot exceed aleph_0,
# the maximum possible cardinality is aleph_0.
max_cardinality = cardinality_of_S_with_TA

# The final result is a cardinality, not a result of a numerical equation.
# We print the derived result.
print(f"The set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite (cardinality = {aleph_0_str}).")
print(f"The set S is a subset, so its cardinality is at most {aleph_0_str}.")
print(f"By choosing a suitable statement psi, we can make S countably infinite.")
print(f"Therefore, the maximum possible cardinality of S is {max_cardinality}.")
