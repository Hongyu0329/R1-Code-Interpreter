# Plan:
# 1. Determine the number of placement choices for each element in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
#    based on the given conditions.
#    Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We have a chain of subsets S1, S2, S3, S4 such that:
#    S1 is a subset of S2, S2 is a subset of S3, S3 is a subset of S4, and S4 is a subset of U.
#    This structure creates 5 disjoint regions for any element x in U:
#    - Region 1: x is in S1
#    - Region 2: x is in S2 but not S1
#    - Region 3: x is in S3 but not S2
#    - Region 4: x is in S4 but not S3
#    - Region 5: x is in U but not S4
#
# 2. Analyze the constraints on each element:
#    - For element 1: The condition is 1 in S1. This means 1 must be in Region 1. Number of choices = 1.
#    - For element 2: The condition is 2 in S2. This means 2 can be in Region 1 or Region 2. Number of choices = 2.
#    - For element 3: The condition is 3 in S3. This means 3 can be in Region 1, 2, or 3. Number of choices = 3.
#    - For element 4: No condition. It can be in any of the 5 regions. Number of choices = 5.
#    - For element 5: No condition. It can be in any of the 5 regions. Number of choices = 5.
#
# 3. Calculate the total number of valid set tuples by multiplying the choices for each element.

# Number of choices for each element
choices_1 = 1
choices_2 = 2
choices_3 = 3
choices_4 = 5
choices_5 = 5

# Calculate the total number of combinations
total_combinations = choices_1 * choices_2 * choices_3 * choices_4 * choices_5

# Print the calculation steps and the final answer
print("The number of possible sets is determined by the product of the number of choices for each element.")
print("Choices for element 1: {}".format(choices_1))
print("Choices for element 2: {}".format(choices_2))
print("Choices for element 3: {}".format(choices_3))
print("Choices for element 4: {}".format(choices_4))
print("Choices for element 5: {}".format(choices_5))
print("\nThe final calculation is:")
print("{} * {} * {} * {} * {} = {}".format(choices_1, choices_2, choices_3, choices_4, choices_5, total_combinations))
