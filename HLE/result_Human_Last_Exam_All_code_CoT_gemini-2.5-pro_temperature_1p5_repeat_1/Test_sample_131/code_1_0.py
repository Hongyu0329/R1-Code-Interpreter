    print("Step 1: Understand the core concept.")
    print("The 'self-stabilizing effect' means that gaining knowledge reveals more knowledge gaps, which in turn increases interest in learning more.")
    print("Equation of the effect: More Knowledge -> More Awareness of Gaps -> Stronger Effect (Increased Interest)\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the learning phases as described.")
    print(" - Early Phase: Knowledge is low. A learner is unfamiliar with the topic and doesn't know what they don't know. Therefore, the number of *perceived* knowledge gaps is low.")
    print(" - Intermediate Phase: Basic understanding is built. The learner can now see more connections and notice more gaps.")
    print(" - Late Phase: Knowledge is comprehensive. This deep understanding allows the learner to identify even more subtle, complex, and numerous gaps that a novice would not even see. This is where the awareness of gaps is at its highest.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate each answer choice based on the analysis.")

    print("Choice A: 'The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect.'")
    print("   - This is plausible but less precise. The effect peaks rather than increasing indefinitely. It's not the best description.\n")

    print("Choice B: 'In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur... Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest.'")
    print("   - This is INCORRECT. In the early phase, awareness of gaps is at its lowest, so the effect is at its weakest.\n")

    print("Choice C: 'The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase, where a learnerâ€™s foundational understanding allows them to discover more knowledge gaps.'")
    print("   - This is CORRECT. The deep knowledge of the late phase is what enables the discovery of the most gaps, causing the effect to peak.\n")

    print("Choice E: 'The self-stabilizing effect remains constant...'")
    print("   - This is INCORRECT. The process is dynamic and changes significantly through the phases.\n")

    print("Conclusion: Statement C provides the most accurate description.")
