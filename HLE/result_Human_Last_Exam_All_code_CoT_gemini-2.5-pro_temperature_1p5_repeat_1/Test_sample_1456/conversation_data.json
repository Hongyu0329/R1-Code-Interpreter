    "Of course, let's solve this step by step.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions:** First, we need to be clear on what a \"nondegenerate continuum\" and a \"composant\" are.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle, or a square.\n    *   A **nondegenerate continuum** is simply a continuum that consists of more than one point.\n    *   A **composant** of a point `p` in a continuum `X` is the set of all points `q` such that `p` and `q` are contained together in some *proper* subcontinuum of `X`. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that isn't the whole space `X`). The collection of all composants partitions the space `X`.\n\n2.  **Relate Composants of a Product to Individual Spaces:** The core of the problem lies in a theorem from continuum theory. For two continua, `X` and `Y`, the number of composants in their product space `X x Y` is equal to the product of the number of composants in `X` and the number of composants in `Y`.\n    *   `Number of composants(X x Y) = Number of composants(X) * Number of composants(Y)`\n\n3.  **Find the Maximum Number of Composants for a Single Continuum:** To maximize the product, we need to find the largest possible number of composants a single nondegenerate continuum can have.\n    *   It's a known result in topology that a continuum can have 1, 2, 3, ... (any finite number) of composants.\n    *   More importantly, there exist continua that have an *uncountable* number of composants. The maximum possible number is **c**, which stands for the cardinality of the continuum (the \"size\" of the set of real numbers). An example of such a space is the **Knaster continuum** (or buckethandle).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Result:** We will choose our two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`, to be spaces that achieve this maximum number of composants.\n    *   Let `Number of composants(X) = c`.\n    *   Let `Number of composants(Y) = c`.\n    *   The total number of composants in their product `X x Y` is `c * c`.\n\n5.  **Use Cardinal Arithmetic:** In cardinal arithmetic, which deals with the sizes of infinite sets, `c * c = c`.\n\n6.  **Code the Result:** We will use a Python script to represent this final calculation symbolically and print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the largest possible number of composants\n    of the product of two nondegenerate continua based on established\n    theorems in topology.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let 'c' represent the cardinality of the continuum.\n    # From continuum theory, the maximum number of composants a single\n    # nondegenerate continuum can have is 'c'.\n    max_composants_X = 'c'\n    max_composants_Y = 'c'\n\n    # The number of composants of the product space X x Y is the product\n    # of the number of composants of X and the number of composants of Y.\n    # In cardinal arithmetic, the product c * c is equal to c.\n    product_composants = 'c'\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the maximum number of composants for a single continuum.\")\n    print(f\"Let X be a nondegenerate continuum.
