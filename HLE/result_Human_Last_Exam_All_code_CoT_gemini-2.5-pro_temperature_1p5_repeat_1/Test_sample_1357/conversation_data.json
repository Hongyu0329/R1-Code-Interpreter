    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question from the field of arithmetic geometry. The solution relies on a key theorem connecting the reduction type of a curve's Jacobian to the structure of the curve's stable reduction.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify the Key Theorem:** The core of the problem lies in the Criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich as it applies to curves. This criterion establishes a direct relationship between the Jacobian of a curve having \"good reduction\" and the nature of the curve's own \"stable reduction\".\n2.  **State the Theorem:** The theorem states that the Jacobian of a curve `C` has good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of `C` is a smooth curve of the same genus.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem to the Specific Case:**\n    *   The genus of the curve is given as 4.\n    *   The condition is that its Jacobian has good reduction.\n    *   Based on the theorem, this forces the stable reduction of the curve to be a *smooth* curve of genus 4.\n4.  **Count the \"Types\" of Reduction:** A \"type\" of stable reduction is defined by its combinatorial structure (the number of components and how they are connected by nodes). A smooth curve is irreducible (it has only one component) and has no nodes. All smooth curves of a given genus belong to a single combinatorial type.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the stable reduction must be a smooth curve of genus 4, there is only one possible type of stable reduction.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve\n    under the condition that its Jacobian has good reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The genus of the curve in question.\n    genus = 4\n    \n    # The problem can be solved by applying a fundamental theorem from arithmetic geometry.\n    # Theorem (Criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich for curves):\n    # A curve C has a Jacobian with good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of C\n    # is a smooth curve of the same genus.\n    \n    # In our case, the curve has genus 4 and its Jacobian has good reduction.\n    # Therefore, its stable reduction must be a smooth curve of genus 4.\n    \n    # A \"type\" of stable reduction refers to the combinatorial structure of the\n    # reduced curve (its components and nodes). A smooth, irreducible curve\n    # (one component, no nodes) represents a single, unique combinatorial type.\n    \n    # Thus, there is only one possible type of stable reduction.\n    number_of_types = 1\n    \n    print(f\"The curve has genus g = {genus}.\")\n    print(\"The condition is that its Jacobian has good reduction.\")\n    print(\"By the Criterion of Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich, the stable reduction must be a smooth curve.\")\n    print(\"A smooth curve represents a single combinatorial type of reduction.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of types of stable reductions is: {number_of_types}\")\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_reduction_types()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
