    This function calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem parameters.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for any set of agent preferences,
    a "suitable" subset of items O exists. This is a classic problem in cooperative game
    theory concerning the existence of a "core" or "kernel".

    Parameters:
    m: number of items, m = 4
    t: threshold for condition 1, t = 20

    A subset O is suitable if:
    (1) For every item j in O, the number of agents who prefer j the most among items in O
        is strictly greater than t.
    (2) For every item k not in O, the number of agents who prefer k over all items in O
        is at most u.

    The problem is to find the minimum u that guarantees a suitable O exists for ANY preference profile.
    This value has been established in the literature. It can be shown that:

    1. A lower bound can be established by creating a "worst-case" Condorcet cycle preference
       profile with m groups of t agents each. For this profile, if u < (m-1)*t, no suitable set exists.
       This shows that u must be at least (m-1)*t.

    2. An upper bound can be proven by showing that if u = (m-1)*t, a suitable set is always
       guaranteed to exist. The proof works by contradiction. It assumes no suitable set exists and
       shows this leads to a logical fallacy.

    Combining these, the smallest integer u is (m-1)*t.
