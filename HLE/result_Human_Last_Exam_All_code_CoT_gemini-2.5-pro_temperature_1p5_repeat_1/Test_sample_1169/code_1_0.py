    # Reduction 1: The constraint from the Lagrange multiplier g(tau).

    # removing one degree of freedom from the choice of initial positions for w.

    # Reduction 2: The velocity constraint derived from the position constraint.
    # Differentiating the constraint w_nu * w^nu = 1 with respect to tau yields

    # to the initial positions, removing one degree of freedom from the choice of initial velocities.

    # Reduction 3: Reparametrization Invariance.
    # The Lagrangian, after substituting the constraints, is homogeneous of degree one
    # with respect to the derivatives (dot(x), dot(w)). This implies the action is
    # invariant under reparametrizations of tau (tau -> f(tau')). This is a gauge
    # symmetry. For each gauge symmetry in a mechanical system, we can fix the evolution
