    This function analyzes the provided options about Saint Augustine's philosophy
    and determines which statement is incorrect.

    The analysis process:
    1.  Option A: The link between Augustine and Calvinism on predestination is a common scholarly topic. Plausible.
    2.  Option B: The claim that a major scholar like R. A. Markus would "ignore" central concepts like predestination and grace is highly improbable and a misrepresentation of scholarly work. This is the most likely incorrect statement.
    3.  Option C: Augustine's discussion of the will (*voluntas*) and its classical influences is accurate. Correct.
    4.  Option D: The inseparability of philosophy and theology in Augustine's thought is a key feature of his work. Correct.
    5.  Option E: Ã‰tienne Gilson's nuanced view on irresistible grace, distinguishing Augustine from Jansenism, is a known scholarly position. Correct.
    6.  Option F: The summary of Augustine's dialogue with Evodius regarding free will and responsibility is accurate. Correct.

    Conclusion: Statement B is the incorrect one.
