# The user wants to understand the specific non-disjunction event.
# The key information is:
# 1. Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
# 2. Experiment Context: MisiÃ³n Bridges
# 3. Unexpected Offspring: X0 male
#
# Explanation of the logic:
# In Drosophila, sex is determined by the X:Autosome ratio. X0 is male.
# An X0 individual arises from the fusion of an X gamete and a nullo-somic (O) gamete.
# Bridges' experiments proved that exceptional offspring phenotypes were linked to
# non-disjunction of the X chromosome in the *female* parent during oogenesis (egg formation).
# This means the female produced an 'O' egg, which was then fertilized by a normal X-sperm from the male.
#
# The question is whether this non-disjunction happens in Meiosis I or Meiosis II.
# Non-disjunction in Meiosis I (primary non-disjunction) is the failure of homologous
# chromosomes to separate. This leads to a secondary oocyte with two X chromosomes (XX) and
# a polar body with none (O), or vice-versa. The final products are XX eggs and O eggs.
#
# Fertilization of these abnormal eggs by normal sperm (X or Y) from the male produces:
# - XX egg + Y sperm -> XXY (exceptional female)
# - O egg + X sperm -> X0 (exceptional male)
#
# Bridges observed both types of exceptional offspring, which strongly supported
# non-disjunction in Meiosis I as the cause.

# Therefore, the correct answer choice is A.

print("The experimental observation of X0 male offspring in Bridges' experiments on Drosophila points to a specific failure during egg formation in the female parent.")
print("This X0 male arises when an egg containing no sex chromosomes (a 'nullo-somic' or 'O' egg) is fertilized by a normal sperm carrying an X chromosome from the male parent.")
print("The production of such 'O' eggs, along with corresponding 'XX' eggs that lead to other exceptional offspring (XXY females), is the classic result of the failure of homologous X chromosomes to separate during anaphase I of meiosis.")
