# The problem states alpha = 10^16, but is a function alpha(x).
# We assume alpha(x) is a constant alpha for this calculation.
alpha = 1.0e16

# We will break down the components of this final equation.

# Calculate the final value

# As requested, output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is t0 = sqrt( (A * B) / C )
