    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal, considering that the board wraps around the edges.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem computationally:\n1.  **Understand the Toroidal Attack:** On an `N x N` toroidal board, a queen at `(r, c)` attacks any square `(r', c')` if one of the following conditions is met:\n    *   Row attack: `r = r'`\n    *   Column attack: `c = c'`\n    *   Main diagonal attack: `(r - c) % N = (r' - c') % N`\n    *   Anti-diagonal attack: `(r + c) % N = (r' + c') % N`\n    For our case, N=5.\n\n2.  **Algorithm Choice:** A brute-force search of all possible placements is feasible given the small board (25 squares) and number of queens (4). The total number of ways to choose 4 squares from 25 is C(25, 4) = 12,650, which is a small search space for a computer. We will use a backtracking algorithm to explore these combinations efficiently.\n\n3.  **Backtracking Implementation:**\n    *   We will write a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time on the board.\n    *   To ensure that we count each unique set of 4 squares only once (i.e., we count combinations, not permutations), we'll process the board's 25 squares in a fixed order (from index 0 to 24). When placing a queen, the next recursive call will only consider placing subsequent queens on squares with a higher index.\n    *   A helper function, `is_safe`, will check if a potential square is under attack by any of the queens already placed, using the toroidal attack rules.\n\n4.  **Counting Solutions:** The recursive function will keep a running count of valid placements. The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. In this case, we have found one valid arrangement and add 1 to our total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place K non-attacking queens on an N x N toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5  # The size of the board\n    K = 4  # The number of queens to place\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe from the queens in 'placements'.\n        The board is N x N and toroidal.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in placements:\n            # Check row and column attack\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            # Check toroidal diagonal attacks\n            # (a % n + n) % n is used to handle negative results from Python's % operator consistently\n            if (r - c - (qr - qc)) % N == 0:\n                return False\n            if (r + c - (qr + qc)) % N == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def find_placements(queens_to_place, start_cell_index, current_placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        A recursive function to find valid placements using backtracking.\n        - queens_to_place: Number of queens remaining to be placed.\n        - start_cell_index: The board cell (0-24) to start searching from.
