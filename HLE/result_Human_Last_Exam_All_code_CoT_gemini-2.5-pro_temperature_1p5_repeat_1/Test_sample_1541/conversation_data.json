    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the task, followed by the Python code and the final answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user wants to solve the \"Xenia and Sum\" problem. The core task is to take a string representing a sum (e.g., \"3+2+1\") and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order (e.g., \"1+2+3\"). The user has two specific requests:\n    *   Provide a Python script to perform this rearrangement.\n    *   Calculate the memory `m` in bytes used by the variables in the *most memory-efficient C program* that could solve this problem.\n\n2.  **Python Script Logic:** The Python solution is straightforward.\n    *   Read the input sum as a single string.\n    *   Use the `split('+')` method to separate the string into a list of number strings.\n    *   Sort this list. Since the numbers are single digits ('1', '2', '3', '4'), the default lexicographical sort works correctly.\n    *   Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string, using `+` as the separator.\n    *   Print the final rearranged sum.\n\n3.  **Memory-Efficient C Program Analysis:** To find `m`, I need to design the most memory-efficient C program in theory.\n    *   To minimize memory, the program should avoid storing the entire input string. It can read the input character by character using `getchar()`.\n    *   A counting sort strategy is ideal. We can use a small array to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   After counting, the program will loop through the counts and print the sorted sum directly, without building a new string in memory.\n    *   The variables needed would be:\n        *   An array to store the counts. Since the maximum number of summands is 500, a `short int` (2 bytes) is sufficient for each count. `short int counts[4];` -> `4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n        *   A variable to hold the character from `getchar()`. This must be an `int` to handle the special `EOF` value. `int c;` -> `4` bytes.\n        *   Loop counters for printing. The counters won't exceed 500. `short int i, j;` -> `2 * 2 = 4` bytes.\n        *   A flag to correctly handle printing the `+` signs. A `char` is sufficient. `char is_first;` -> `1` byte.\n    *   The total memory `m` will be the sum of the sizes of these variables: `m = 8 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17` bytes.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_xenia_sum():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function reads a string representing a sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4,\n  and prints the sum with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Read the entire line from standard input and remove any trailing whitespace.\n  input_sum = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n  \n  # Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n  # For example, \"1+3+2+1\" becomes ['1', '3', '2', '1'].\n  summands = input_sum.split('+')\n  \n  # Sort the list of numbers. Python's default sort for strings works\n  # correctly here because all numbers are single digits.\n  # ['1', '3', '2', '1'] becomes ['1', '1', '2', '3'].\n  summands.sort()\n  \n  # Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string,\n  # with '+' as the separator between them.\n  # ['1', '1', '2', '3'] becomes \"1+1+2+3\".\n  # This final string represents the full equation with each number included.\n  sorted_sum = \"+\".join(summands)\n  \n  # Print the final result.\n  print(sorted_sum)\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem.\nsolve_xenia_sum()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
