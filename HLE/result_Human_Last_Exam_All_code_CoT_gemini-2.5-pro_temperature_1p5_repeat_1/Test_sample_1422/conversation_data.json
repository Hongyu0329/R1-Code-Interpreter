    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram, we can use a general topological formula for any connected Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the relevant formulas:** There are two key relationships for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`, which relates the number of lines meeting at each vertex (`n`, e.g., n=4 for a $\\phi^4$ theory), the number of vertices (`V`), internal lines (`I`), and external lines (`E`).\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** We can combine these two equations to get a direct relationship between the number of vertices (`V`), loops (`L`), interaction type (`n`), and external lines (`E`).\n    *   From the first formula, we get `I = L + V - 1`.\n    *   Substituting this into the second formula gives `n * V = 2 * (L + V - 1) + E`.\n    *   Rearranging for `V`, we get the equation: `(n - 2) * V = 2*L - 2 + E`.\n\n3.  **Find the minimum:** We are given `L=2`. Our goal is to find the minimum possible integer value for `V`. The equation becomes `(n - 2) * V = 2*2 - 2 + E`, which simplifies to `(n - 2) * V = 2 + E`.\n    *   To minimize `V`, we need to minimize the right side of the equation (`2 + E`) and maximize the factor on the left side (`n - 2`).\n    *   The minimum number of external lines is `E=0` (this corresponds to a \"vacuum bubble\" diagram).\n    *   The interaction type `n` must be at least 3.\n    *   Let's test `n=3`: `(3-2)*V = 2+E` -> `V = 2+E`. The minimum `V` is 2 (for `E=0`).\n    *   Let's test `n=4`: `(4-2)*V = 2+E` -> `2*V = 2+E`. The minimum `V` is 1 (for `E=0`).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The absolute minimum number of vertices is 1. This occurs in a theory with a quartic (`n=4`) interaction, for a vacuum diagram (`E=0`). The resulting diagram is often called a \"figure-eight\" diagram. The Python code below will explicitly calculate this case.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    based on the topological formula for Feynman diagrams.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of loops required.\n    L = 2\n    \n    # The equation relating Vertices (V), Loops (L), interaction type (n),\n    # and External lines (E) is: (n - 2) * V = 2*L - 2 + E\n    \n    print(\"The general formula for a Feynman diagram is: (n - 2) * V = 2*L - 2 + E\")\n    print(f\"We are looking for the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop (L={L}) diagram.\\n\")\n    \n    # To minimize V, we must choose appropriate values for n and E.\n    # - We minimize the number of external lines, E.
