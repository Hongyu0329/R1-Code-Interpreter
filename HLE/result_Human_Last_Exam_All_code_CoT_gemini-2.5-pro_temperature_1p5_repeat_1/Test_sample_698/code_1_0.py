    # Choice A
    print("\nChoice A: " + choices["A"])
    print("  - Phonetic Match: 'Computers' is similar, but 'comp few urns' does not repeat the 'com-pu-ter' syllable pattern.")
    print("  - Meaning Match: The phrase does not relate to birds or software commands.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Choice B
    print("\nChoice B: " + choices["B"])
    print("  - Phonetic Match: 'Computer' -> com-pu-ter. 'Come poo, tern!' -> come-poo-tern. This is an excellent syllable match.")
    print("  - Meaning Match: The phrase depicts a computer giving a command ('Come poo') to a bird (a 'tern'). This perfectly matches the description.")
    print("  - Verdict: Strong Candidate.")

    # Choice C
    print("\nChoice C: " + choices["C"])
    print("  - Phonetic Match: 'Come, pee you turkey!' -> come-pee-you-tur-key. The syllables do not align well with 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("  - Meaning Match: While it involves a command to a bird, the phonetic structure is not a true avalanche.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Choice D
    print("\nChoice D: " + choices["D"])
    print("  - Phonetic Match: 'Comb pewter' -> comb-pew-ter. This is an excellent syllable match with 'computer'.")
    print("  - Meaning Match: 'Comb pewter' means to search through pewter metalware. This meaning is completely unrelated to the description.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    # Choice E
    print("\nChoice E: " + choices["E"])
    print("  - Phonetic Match: This is a sentence, not a pun with repeating syllables. It does not form an avalanche.")
    print("  - Meaning Match: The meaning is related, but it lacks the required wordplay structure.")
    print("  - Verdict: Incorrect.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Choice B is the only option that is both a well-formed 'True Avalanche' based on the word 'computer' and perfectly matches the context of the given description.")
