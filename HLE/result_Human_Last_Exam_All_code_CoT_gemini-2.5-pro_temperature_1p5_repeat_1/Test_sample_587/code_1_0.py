    A. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable for every class H.
    This statement claims the problem is always easy (in the FPT sense).
    This is highly unlikely. Consider the case where H is the class of all cliques.
    The problem becomes #k-CLIQUE, where k is the parameter. The decision version
    of k-CLIQUE is the canonical W[1]-complete problem, and its counting version
    #k-CLIQUE is #W[1]-complete. #W[1]-complete problems are not considered

    B. If H is the class of all cliques, then #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
    This addresses the specific hard case mentioned above. The problem asks for the
    number of k-cliques in a graph G from a class G that is somewhere dense and closed
    under subgraphs. A key theorem in parameterized complexity (e.g., Theorem 14.12 in
    Flum and Grohe's "Parameterized Complexity Theory") states that for any class of
    graphs G that is closed under subgraphs and is not nowhere dense (i.e., is somewhere
    dense), the #k-CLIQUE problem is #W[1]-complete. The premises on G in the
    question match the conditions of this theorem perfectly. Therefore, this statement is true.

    C. There exists a class H of graphs of degree at most 2 such that #Sub_G(H) is #W[1]-complete.
    A graph with maximum degree at most 2 is a disjoint union of paths and cycles.
    Any such graph has a treewidth of at most 2. There are well-known algorithms that
    can count subgraphs of bounded treewidth in FPT time, even on general input graphs G.
    For instance, counting k-cycles is FPT. Therefore, for any class H of graphs of degree
    at most 2, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. An FPT problem cannot be #W[1]-complete
    (unless FPT = #W[1], which is assumed to be false). So, this statement is false.

    D. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded treewidth.
    This proposes a full dichotomy based on the treewidth of the pattern class H.
    - The 'if' part: If H has bounded treewidth, the problem is FPT. This is a known result.
    - The 'only if' part: If the problem is FPT, then H must have bounded treewidth.
    This is equivalent to saying that if H has unbounded treewidth, the problem is hard (not FPT).
    This dichotomy is known to hold for the decision version of subgraph isomorphism (under ETH),
    and is largely believed to hold for counting as well. However, the precise boundary for
    counting can be more nuanced and may depend on other parameters like pathwidth. Some recent
    research suggests this simple treewidth dichotomy might not hold for all cases of subgraph counting.
    Given the unconditional proof for statement B, and the potential subtleties and unstated
    assumptions (like ETH or the specific type of somewhere dense class) for the universality of this
    statement, it is less certain than B.

    E. #Sub_G(H) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if H has bounded vertex-cover number.
    This statement is false. Bounded vertex-cover number implies bounded treewidth, but the converse is not true.
    Consider H to be the class of all paths {P_k}. This class has bounded treewidth (it is always 1),
    and counting paths is FPT. However, the class does not have a bounded vertex-cover number, as the
    vertex cover of P_k is floor(k/2). Since the problem is FPT but H does not have bounded vertex cover,
    the 'if' direction of the 'if and only if' statement ('is FPT' implies 'has bounded VC') is false.
