    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus:** I will list the most well-known and visually distinct structural forms of pure phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine the color of each allotrope:** I will state the characteristic color for each identified allotrope.\n3.  **Count the unique colors:** I will count how many different colors are in the list.\n4.  **Format the output:** I will present the final count as a sum, where each '1' in the equation represents one distinct color, to meet the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and counts them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify allotropes and their distinct colors.\n    # Note: White phosphorus can turn yellow upon exposure to light,\n    # but it's considered one color group (white/yellow).\n    allotropes_colors = {\n        \"White/Yellow\": 1,\n        \"Red\": 1,\n        \"Violet\": 1,\n        \"Black\": 1\n    }\n\n    color_names = list(allotropes_colors.keys())\n    total_colors = len(color_names)\n\n    print(\"The main colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in color_names:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Create and print the equation representing the count.\n    # Each '1' represents one of the distinct colors.\n    equation_parts = [str(v) for v in allotropes_colors.values()]\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we sum them up:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
