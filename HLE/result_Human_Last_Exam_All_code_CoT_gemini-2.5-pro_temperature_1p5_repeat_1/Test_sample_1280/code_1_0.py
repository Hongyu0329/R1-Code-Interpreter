def solve_hamiltonian_difference():
    """
    This function determines the maximum number of differing energy levels
    between two supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians H_0 and H_1.

    Problem Setup:
    H_0 = L^+L - alpha
    H_1 = LL^+ - alpha

    The energy spectra of H_0 and H_1 are almost identical due to the
    supersymmetric partnership. A difference can only arise from states
    that are annihilated by L or L^+, which must have the specific
    energy E = -alpha.

    Let u_0 be the number of normalizable solutions to L(psi) = 0 satisfying
    the boundary conditions.
    Let u_1 be the number of normalizable solutions to L^+(phi) = 0 satisfying
    the boundary conditions.

    Since L(psi) = 0 and L^+(phi) = 0 are first-order linear ODEs, they
    can have at most one linearly independent solution.
    Therefore, u_0 and u_1 can only take values 0 or 1.

    The difference in the dimensions of the eigenspaces (d_0, d_1) at the
    special energy E=-alpha is given by the index theorem: d_0 - d_1 = u_0 - u_1.

    For the set of energy levels (the spectrum) to differ, one Hamiltonian
    must have an eigenvalue at E=-alpha while the other does not. This occurs
    when one eigenspace dimension is non-zero and the other is zero.

    We want to find the maximum possible value for the difference.
    This corresponds to maximizing |d_0 - d_1|, which is equivalent to
    maximizing |u_0 - u_1|.
