    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Crystallographic Point Groups:** First, we list the 10 two-dimensional crystallographic point groups.\n2.  **Find Point Groups of Order 2:** The \"order\" of a point group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. We will filter the list from step 1 to find which groups have exactly two operations (the identity operation and one other). The point groups of order 2 are point group **2** (containing identity and a 180Â° rotation) and point group **m** (containing identity and a reflection).\n3.  **Map Wallpaper Groups to Point Groups:** There are 17 wallpaper groups in total. We will create a mapping of each wallpaper group to its corresponding point group.\n4.  **Count the Matches:** We will count how many wallpaper groups are associated with point group '2' and how many are associated with point group 'm'. The sum of these counts will be our final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by storing the known data about the 17 wallpaper groups and then filtering it based on the specified criteria.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines how many of the 17 wallpaper groups\n    have a crystallographic point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups, their point groups, and the order of those point groups.\n    # Note: 'pg' and 'cm' have point group 'm', as glide reflections and mirror reflections\n    # are equivalent in the point group.\n    wallpaper_data = [\n        {'name': 'p1', 'point_group': '1', 'order': 1},\n        {'name': 'p2', 'point_group': '2', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pm', 'point_group': 'm', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pg', 'point_group': 'm', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'cm', 'point_group': 'm', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'p2mm', 'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2mg', 'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2gg', 'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'c2mm', 'point_group': '2mm', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p4', 'point_group': '4', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p4mm', 'point_group': '4mm', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p4gm', 'point_group': '4mm', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p3', 'point_group': '3', 'order': 3},\n        {'name': 'p3m1', 'point_group': '3m', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p31m', 'point_group': '3m', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p6', 'point_group': '6', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p6mm', 'point_group': '6mm', 'order': 12},\n    ]\n\n    # Find the groups with point group order 2\n    groups_with_order_2 = [\n        group for group in wallpaper_data if group['order'] == 2\n    ]\n\n    # Separate them by their specific point group for clarity\n    groups_with_pg_2 = [\n        group['name'] for group in groups_with_order_2 if group['point_group'] == '2'\n    ]\n    groups_with_pg_m = [\n        group['name'] for group in groups_with_order_2 if group['point_group'] == 'm'\n    ]\n    \n    count_pg_2 = len(groups_with_pg_2)\n    count_pg_m = len(groups_with_pg_m)\n    total = count_pg_2 + count_pg_m\n    \n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are '2' and 'm'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nWallpaper groups with point group '2': {', '.join(groups_with_pg_2)}\")\n    print(f\"Count: {count_pg_2}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nWallpaper groups with point group 'm': {', '.join(groups_with_pg_m)}\")\n    print(f\"Count: {count_pg_m}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 is the sum:\")\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers\n    print(f\"{count_pg_2} + {count_pg_m} = {total}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
