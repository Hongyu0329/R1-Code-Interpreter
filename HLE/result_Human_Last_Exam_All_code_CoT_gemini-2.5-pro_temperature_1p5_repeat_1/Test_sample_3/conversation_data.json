    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of elliptic curves, specifically the classification of torsion subgroups that can appear over quadratic number fields. The field in question is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the complete classification of possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields, as established by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, Momose, and Najman.\n2.  This classification provides a list of all possible group structures and, for those that appear over only a finite number of quadratic fields, the exact fields where they occur.\n3.  I will encode this classification data into a Python script.\n4.  The script will then filter this data to identify all non-cyclic torsion groups that are possible over the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n5.  Finally, from this filtered list, the script will calculate the order of each possible group and determine the maximum value.\n\nThis approach uses a Python script to systematically apply the known mathematical theorems to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_torsion_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    It uses the known classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The field we are interested in is Q(sqrt(D))\n    D = -3\n\n    # Data from the classification of non-cyclic torsion subgroups E(K)_tors\n    # over quadratic fields K.\n    # A group is represented as a tuple (m, n) for Z/mZ x Z/nZ.\n    # 'fields' can be:\n    #   'inf': occurs over infinitely many quadratic fields.\n    #   'inf_with_mu3': occurs over infinitely many quadratic fields that contain\n    #                   the 3rd roots of unity (like Q(sqrt(-3))).\n    #   A list of integers [d1, d2, ...]: occurs only over Q(sqrt(d1)), Q(sqrt(d2)), ...\n    \n    # This data is compiled from papers by F.
