    "To solve this problem, we will use the pole placement technique. The goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` are at the desired locations, which are `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the desired characteristic polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j` correspond to a target characteristic polynomial:\n    `P(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n2.  **Formulate the system's characteristic polynomial:** We need to find the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` in terms of the elements of `F`.\n    Let `F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`. The characteristic polynomial is `det(sI - (A + BF)) = 0`. This will result in a polynomial whose coefficients are functions of the four elements of `F`.\n3.  **Simplify the problem:** We have four unknowns in `F` but only two constraints from the second-order characteristic polynomial. This means there are infinitely many solutions for `F`. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common approach is to assume a simpler structure for `F`. Let's assume we only use the first control input, which is equivalent to setting the second row of `F` to zero: `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`.\n4.  **Solve for the unknowns:** With the simplified `F`, the characteristic polynomial of `A + BF` is `s^2 + s(1 - f1 - f2) - (1 + f1 + 2*f2) = 0`. By equating the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial (`s^2 + 2s + 2`), we get a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (`f1`, `f2`):\n    *   `1 - f1 - f2 = 2`\n    *   `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2`\n5.  **Construct F and Verify:** We will solve this system for `f1` and `f2` to construct the matrix `F`. Finally, we'll verify the solution by calculating the eigenvalues of the resulting `A + BF` matrix to ensure they match our target locations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_state_feedback():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system A, B\n    and desired eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # System matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1],\n                  [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2],\n                  [1, 0]])\n\n    # The desired eigenvalues are -1 + j and -1 - j.\n    # The corresponding characteristic polynomial is s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0.\n\n    # We assume a simplified F of the form [[f1, f2], [0, 0]].\n    # Comparing coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of A+BF\n    # with the desired one gives a system of linear equations:\n    # 1 - f1 - f2 = 2  =>  f1 + f2 = -1\n    # -1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2  =>  f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n\n    # We solve this system M * x = y for x = [f1, f2]\n    M = np.array([[1, 1],\n                  [1, 2]])\n    y = np.array([-1, -3])\n\n    # Solve for f1 and f2\n    f1_f2 = np.linalg.solve(M, y)\n    f1 = f1_f2[0]\n    f2 = f1_f2[1]\n\n    # Construct the full gain matrix F\n    F = np.array([[f1, f2],\n                  [0, 0]])\n\n    print(\"Calculated state feedback gain matrix F:\")\n    print(F)\n\n    # Verification step\n    A_closed_loop = A + B @ F\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_closed_loop)\n\n    print(\"\\nVerification:\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A + BF are:\")\n    # np.round is used to clean up floating point inaccuracies\n    print(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n    \n    # Per the instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\",\n    # we print the elements of the F matrix that forms our solution.\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the feedback gain is F = [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]], where:\")\n    print(f\"f11 = {F[0, 0]}\")\n    print(f\"f12 = {F[0, 1]}\")\n    print(f\"f21 = {F[1, 0]}\")\n    print(f\"f22 = {F[1, 1]}\")\n\nsolve_state_feedback()\n```\n<<<[[1.0, -2.0], [0.0, 0.0]]>>>"
