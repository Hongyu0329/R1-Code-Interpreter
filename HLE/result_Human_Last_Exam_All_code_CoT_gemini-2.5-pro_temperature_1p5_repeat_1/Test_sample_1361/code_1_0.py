# The Act III "Pizzicato" solo from Frederick Ashton's "Sylvia"
# contains two distinct sequences of gargouillades.
# Each sequence has 4 gargouillades.

sequence1 = 4
sequence2 = 4
total_gargouillades = sequence1 + sequence2

# The final equation to find the total is:
print(f"{sequence1} + {sequence2} = {total_gargouillades}")
