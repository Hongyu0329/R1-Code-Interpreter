    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is to use my knowledge base to find the museum that acquired the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther. Then, I will create a Python script that stores the relevant information in variables and prints a sentence answering your question, ensuring the years 1927 and 1967 are included in the output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_art_history_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's question about the acquisition\n    of Kurt Günther's painting \"The Radionist\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information from the query and external knowledge\n    painting_year = 1927\n    acquisition_year = 1967\n    painting_title = \"The Radionist\"\n    artist = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    museum = \"Lindenau-Museum Altenburg\"\n\n    # Constructing the sentence as an \"equation\" of facts, including each number.\n    # Fact 1 (Painting Year): 1927\n    # Fact 2 (Acquisition Year): 1967\n    print(f\"The painting '{painting_title}' from the year {painting_year} was acquired by the {museum} in the year {acquisition_year}.\")\n\nsolve_art_history_query()\n```\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
