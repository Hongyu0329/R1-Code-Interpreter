    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Inputs:** We are given two values:\n    *   `Phi_k(x') = 0.7`: This represents the firing level of the primary membership function for the k-th rule's antecedent.\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This is the membership value of the consequent parameter in its secondary fuzzy set.\n\n2.  **Choose a T-Norm:** A t-norm is a type of function used to model the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic. The problem states to use a t-norm but doesn't specify which one. The most common and straightforward t-norm is the **minimum operator**, defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. We will use this for our calculation.\n\n3.  **Calculate Activation Level:** The rule activation level is found by applying the chosen t-norm to the given values.\n    *   `Activation Level = T(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will write a simple Python script to define the variables, perform the calculation, and print the steps and the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values.\n# Phi_k(x') is the firing level of the primary membership function.\nphi_k_x_prime = 0.7\n\n# μG_k_j(y_j) is the membership of the consequent parameter in the secondary fuzzy set.\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the rule activation level using a t-norm.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, T(a, b) = min(a, b).\n# The activation level is the t-norm of the two given values.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Step 3: Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(\"The rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set is calculated by applying a t-norm to the primary firing level and the secondary membership value.\")\nprint(\"We will use the minimum t-norm for this calculation.\")\nprint(f\"Given values: Phi_k(x') = {phi_k_x_prime}, μG_k_j(y_j) = {mu_G_k_j}\")\nprint(\"\\nEquation:\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
