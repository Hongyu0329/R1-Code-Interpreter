    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Principle of Duality**: The problem of transforming a system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form is dual to transforming the system `(A^T, C^T)` to controller canonical form. If `P_c` is the transformation matrix for the controllable dual system, then the transformation for the original system is `T_o = (P_c^T)⁻¹`.\n2.  **Select an Output**: Since the system has two outputs, the standard canonical form is defined with respect to a single output. We will perform the transformation based on the first output vector, `c1 = [0, 1, 0]`.\n3.  **Dual System**: We will define the dual system with state matrix `A_d = A^T` and input matrix `B_d = c1^T`.\n4.  **Controller Canonical Form Transformation**: We'll find the transformation matrix `P_c` that puts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into controller canonical form. This involves calculating the controllability matrix of the dual system and the characteristic polynomial of `A`.\n5.  **Observer Canonical Form Transformation**: We will then calculate `T_o = (P_c^T)⁻¹`.\n6.  **New C Matrix**: Finally, we compute the new output matrix for the original system as `C_new = C @ T_o`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute these steps:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the original system matrices A and C\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0], \n              [2, 1, 1], \n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0], \n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\n# Step 2: Select the first output vector for the transformation\nc1 = C[0, :].reshape(1, -1) # Shape (1, 3)\n\n# Step 3: Define the dual system\nA_d = A.T\n# B_d is the transpose of c1, making it a column vector\nB_d = c1.T  # Shape (3, 1)\n\n# Step 4: Find the transformation P_c for the controller canonical form of the dual system\n# 4a. Calculate the controllability matrix of the dual system: W_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d]\nWc = np.hstack([B_d, A_d @ B_d, A_d @ A_d @ B_d])\n\n# 4b. Find the characteristic polynomial of A (or A_d): det(sI - A) = s^3 + a1*s^2 + a2*s + a3\n# The coefficients are returned as [1, a1, a2, a3]\npoly_coeffs = np.poly(A)\na1, a2, a3 = poly_coeffs[1], poly_coeffs[2], poly_coeffs[3]\n\n# 4c. Construct the M matrix for transformation\n# This specific structure of M corresponds to the standard controller canonical form\nM = np.array([[a2, a1, 1],\n              [a1, 1,  0],\n              [1,  0,  0]])\n\n# 4d. Calculate the transformation matrix P_c\nPc = Wc @ M\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the transformation matrix T_o for the observer canonical form\n# T_o is the inverse of the transpose of P_c\nTo = np.linalg.inv(Pc.T)\n\n# Step 6: Compute the new C matrix for the system in observer canonical form\nC_new = C @ To\n\n# Let's verify the transformation. The new state matrix should be in observer canonical form.\n# A_new = inv(To) @ A @ To\n# The new output vector corresponding to c1 should be c1_new = c1 @ To = [0, 0, 1]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(\"Original A matrix:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nOriginal C matrix:\")\nprint(C)\nprint(\"\\nCharacteristic Polynomial Coefficients (a1, a2, a3):\")\nprint(f\"p(s) = s^3 + ({a1:.2f})s^2 + ({a2:.2f})s + ({a3:.2f})\")\nprint(\"\\nTransformation matrix T_o:\")\nprint(To)\nprint(\"\\nNew A matrix in observer canonical form (A_new = T_o^-1 * A * T_o):\")\nA_new = np.linalg.inv(To) @ A @ To\nprint(A_new)\nprint(\"\\nFinal new C matrix (C_new = C * T_o):\")\n# We explicitly format the output to show each number in the final matrix equation\nprint(\"C_new =\")\nprint(C_new)\n\n```\n<<<[[0. , 0. , 1. ], [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
