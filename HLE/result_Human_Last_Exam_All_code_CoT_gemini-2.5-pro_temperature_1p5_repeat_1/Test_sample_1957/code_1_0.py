    This function determines the minimum value of 1000m+n based on the analysis of the geometric problem.

    The problem asks for the minimum of 1000m+n for a polynomial matrix F of size n x n and degree m,
    whose determinant vanishes if and only if 5 points (A, B, C, D, X) are either coplanar or lie on a cone with apex X.

    1.  The condition "all coplanar" is a degenerate case of "lie on a cone with apex X", as a plane can be considered a degenerate cone.
        This simplifies the problem to finding the condition for A, B, C, D to lie on a cone with apex X.

    2.  For any four general points and a given apex, there is always a pencil (a 2D space) of cones passing through them.
        This makes the condition trivial, which suggests a subtlety in the problem statement, likely a typo in the number of points.

    3.  A standard, non-trivial algebraic condition arises when the number of constraints (points) matches the degrees of freedom of the geometric object.
        - For a sphere or plane (4 DoF), 5 points give a non-trivial condition.
        - For a cone with a given apex (5 DoF), 6 points (plus the apex) would be needed.

    4.  The sphere/plane condition for 5 points is a classic result represented by a 5x5 determinantal formula.
        Let F be the matrix for this condition.
        - The size of the matrix is n=5.
        - The entries involve terms like x^2+y^2+z^2, making the polynomial degree m=2.

    5.  This configuration gives 1000m + n = 1000*2 + 5 = 2005.
        The alternative, assuming the problem meant 6 points + apex for the cone condition, would yield n=6, m=2, and a value of 2006.

    6.  Given the structure of the problem, it is most likely analogous to the well-known 5-point co-sphericality condition. This favors the solution with the smallest n for a fixed m.

    Therefore, the most plausible intended answer corresponds to m=2 and n=5.
