    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Parse SMILES and Generate 3D Structure:** The input is a SMILES string, which is a 1D representation of a molecule. To determine its symmetry, we first need its 3D structure. I will use the `rdkit` library, a powerful cheminformatics toolkit in Python, to parse the SMILES string. `RDKit` can then generate a plausible 3D conformation for the molecule and optimize its geometry using a molecular mechanics force field (MMFF94). This process provides the 3D coordinates of all atoms.\n\n2.  **Symmetry Analysis:** With the 3D atomic coordinates available, I will then find the symmetry elements and the corresponding point group. For this task, I will use the `ase` (Atomic Simulation Environment) library. `ase` is a widely-used Python library for building and analyzing atomistic structures.\n\n3.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python script that carries out this plan. The script will:\n    a. Define the input SMILES string.\n    b. Use `rdkit` to create a 3D molecule object.\n    c. Convert the `rdkit` molecule object into an `ase.Atoms` object.\n    d. Utilize the `PointGroupAnalyzer` class from `ase.symmetry` to find the Schoenflies symbol for the point group.\n    e. Print the final result clearly.\n\nThis computational approach allows for an objective and reproducible determination of the molecular point group.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n    from ase import Atoms\n    from ase.symmetry.analyzer import PointGroupAnalyzer\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the RDKit and ASE libraries.\")\n    print(\"Please install them using pip: pip install rdkit ase\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef find_molecule_point_group(smiles_string: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the point group of a molecule from its SMILES string.\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string: The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing molecule with SMILES string: {smiles_string}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Create a molecule object from SMILES using RDKit\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if mol is None:\n        print(\"Error: Invalid SMILES string provided.\")\n        return\n\n    # Add hydrogens, as they are part of the molecule's structure and symmetry\n    mol = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n\n    # Step 2: Generate a 3D conformation and optimize it\n    # Use a fixed random seed for reproducibility\n    if AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol, randomSeed=42) == -1:\n        print(\"Error: Could not generate a 3D conformation.\")\n        return\n    \n    try:\n        # MMFF94 is a good general-purpose force field for organic molecules\n        AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(mol)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # The optimization might fail for complex or strained molecules\n        print(f\"Warning: Geometry optimization failed: {e}.
