    # The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a
    # compact topological space X with two specific properties related to the
    # long ray R = [0, omega_1).

    # Let's analyze the properties of X:
    # 1. X is a compact space containing a dense copy of R.
    #    This means X is a 'compactification' of R.

    # 2. Every bounded continuous function f from R to the real numbers extends
    #    to a unique continuous function on X.
    #    This is the universal mapping property that defines the Stone-Čech
    #    compactification of a Tychonoff space. The long ray R, being a
    #    linearly ordered space, is a Tychonoff space.

    # These two properties together uniquely define the Stone-Čech compactification
    # of R, denoted as βR. A fundamental theorem in topology states that the
    # Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space is unique up to
    # homeomorphism.

    # This means that any space X that satisfies the given conditions must be
    # homeomorphic to βR.

    # Therefore, all such spaces X belong to the same homeomorphism class.
    # The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is consequently 1.
