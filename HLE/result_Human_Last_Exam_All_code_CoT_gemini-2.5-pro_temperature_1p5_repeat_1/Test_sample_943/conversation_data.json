    "My plan to find the value of $K$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Tensor's Structure**: The given tensor is $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. This can be seen as a perturbation of the tensor $P_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$. The tensor $P_n$ is an $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $S(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$. The perturbation consists of subtracting the tensor $J_n$, which is a tensor with all entries equal to 1.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor**: The base tensor $S(x, y, z) = x + y + z$ is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor, since $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The slice rank of any tensor in $\\mathbb{C}^{d_1} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_2} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_3}$ is at most $\\min(d_1, d_2, d_3)$. In our case, this is $\\min(2, 2, 2) = 2$. The slice rank is not 1 because the matrix representations of its slices are linearly independent. Therefore, the slice rank of $S$ is exactly 2.\n\n3.  **Determine the Asymptotic Growth Rate**: The slice rank is sub-multiplicative under the tensor product, i.e., $\\text{srank}(A \\otimes B) \\le \\text{srank}(A) \\cdot \\text{srank}(B)$. For many tensors, this is believed to be an equality or at least asymptotically tight. Assuming this, the slice rank of $P_n = S^{\\otimes n}$ grows as $(\\text{srank}(S))^n = 2^n$. The tensor we are interested in is $T_n = P_n - J_n$. The tensor $J_n$ (all-ones tensor) has slice rank 1. Subtracting a slice rank 1 tensor from a tensor with slice rank $r$ results in a tensor with slice rank between $r-1$ and $r+1$. Thus, the slice rank of $T_n$ is between $2^n-1$ and $2^n+1$. Asymptotically, for large $n$, the slice rank of $T_n$ grows as $2^n$.\n\n4.  **Solve for K**: The problem states that the slice rank of the tensor is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. The base of this exponential growth is $3/2^K$. By equating this with our calculated base of 2, we get the equation:\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\]\n    Solving for $K$:\n    \\begin{align*} 3 &= 2 \\cdot 2^K \\\\ 3 &= 2^{K+1} \\\\ \\log_2(3) &= K+1 \\\\ K &= \\log_2(3) - 1 \\end{align*}\n\n5.  **Final Code**: I will now write a Python script to calculate the numerical value of $K$ and to print the numbers involved in the final equation I solved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the value of K based on the derivation K = log2(3) - 1.\nK = math.log2(3) - 1\n\n# Step 2: The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The final equation we solved for K is: 3 / (2**K) = 2.\n# Let's define the numbers in this equation.\nnumerator = 3\nbase_of_power = 2\nresult_of_rate = 2 # This is the calculated asymptotic base for the slice rank.\n\n# Step 3: Print the value of K and the equation for clarity.\nprint(f\"The calculated value of K is: {K}\")\nprint(f\"The equation relating the asymptotic rate is: {numerator} / ({base_of_power}**K) = {result_of_rate}\")\nprint(f\"Let's verify this with the calculated K:\")\nprint(f\"{numerator} / ({base_of_power}**{K}) = {numerator / (base_of_power**K)}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
