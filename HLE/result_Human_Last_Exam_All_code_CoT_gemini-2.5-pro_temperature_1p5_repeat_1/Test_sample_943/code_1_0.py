# Step 1: Calculate the value of K based on the derivation K = log2(3) - 1.
K = math.log2(3) - 1

# Step 2: The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation we solved for K is: 3 / (2**K) = 2.
# Let's define the numbers in this equation.
numerator = 3
base_of_power = 2
result_of_rate = 2 # This is the calculated asymptotic base for the slice rank.

# Step 3: Print the value of K and the equation for clarity.
print(f"The calculated value of K is: {K}")
print(f"The equation relating the asymptotic rate is: {numerator} / ({base_of_power}**K) = {result_of_rate}")
print(f"Let's verify this with the calculated K:")
print(f"{numerator} / ({base_of_power}**{K}) = {numerator / (base_of_power**K)}")
