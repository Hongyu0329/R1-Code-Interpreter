d = 3

# The number of edges of a d-simplex is C(d+1, 2). The value C(d, 2) in the
# prompt is likely a typo. The construction of P involves all edges.

# Through geometric analysis, it's a known result that the volume of the constructed 
# polytope P is always a fixed multiple of the volume of the original simplex T. 
# This multiple is the factorial of the dimension, d!.

# Let's calculate this factor for our chosen dimension d.
