# The user wants to identify a specific word in a song timed to a dance move in a movie.
# This requires analyzing the film scene, which a script cannot do in real-time.
# The answer is based on pre-existing knowledge of the 'Pulp Fiction' dance scene.
#
# 1. The song is "You Never Can Tell" by Chuck Berry.
# 2. The key line in the chorus is "'C'est la vie,' say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell."
# 3. In the choreography, Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) performs an exaggerated kick with her right leg
#    precisely on the final word, "tell", of this chorus line.
# 4. The chorus repeats during the dance. The first time she does this move is on the first "tell".
# 5. The second time she does the move is on the word "tell" in the second chorus.
# 6. Therefore, the correct word is 'tell'.

answer_word = "tell"
