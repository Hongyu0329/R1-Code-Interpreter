    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, and indeed in other formulations of many-body quantum theory, the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional form is fundamental to perturbation theory, where interactions are later added.\n\nThe relationship is most clearly expressed in the energy-frequency domain. The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a particle in a state with quantum numbers $k$ at an energy (frequency) $\\omega$ depends on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ as follows:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the energy variable of the propagating particle.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state $|k\\rangle$.\n*   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive imaginary term ($i$ is the imaginary unit, $\\eta \\to 0^+$) required for the proper analytic structure of the Green's function, ensuring causality. It displaces the pole of the function slightly from the real energy axis.\n\nThus, the functional dependence is an **inverse relationship**. The Green's function has a simple pole when the energy variable $\\omega$ is equal to the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. This pole signifies the existence of a stable, non-interacting particle with that specific energy.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this relationship by calculating the value of the bare Green's function for a sample set of parameters.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters\n    and prints the calculation step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the calculation\n    # omega: the energy of the probe\n    omega = 1.5  # in some arbitrary units of energy, e.g., eV\n    \n    # epsilon_k: the energy eigenvalue of the single-particle state 'k'\n    epsilon_k = 1.2 # in the same units as omega\n    \n    # eta: a small positive number for the infinitesimal imaginary part\n    eta = 0.1\n\n    # The formula is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    print(f\"The functional form of the bare Green's function is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Calculating for the following values:\")\n    print(f\"omega     = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"eta       = {eta}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the denominator\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    \n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the final equation with all the numbers\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + i*{eta})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is an inverse relationship, where the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a simple pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The explicit formula is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.>>>"
