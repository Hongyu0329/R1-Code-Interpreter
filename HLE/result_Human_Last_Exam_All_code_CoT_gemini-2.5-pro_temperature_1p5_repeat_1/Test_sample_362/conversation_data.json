    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the Wittig reaction and generate the required script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** The reaction involves pivalaldehyde and a phosphorus ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n2.  **Analyze the Wittig Reaction:** This reaction forms a carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the carbonyl oxygen of an aldehyde (or ketone) with the carbanion part of the ylide.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde provides the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n    *   The ylide provides the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` fragment.\n3.  **Form the Product Structure:** Combining these fragments yields the alkene: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`.\n4.  **Determine Stereochemistry:** The ylide `Ph₃P=CH-R` (where R is an alkyl group) is non-stabilized. Non-stabilized ylides typically yield the (Z)-isomer (cis) as the major product.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain.\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest locant number (`-2-`) results in the name `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n    *   Combining this with the stereochemistry gives the final product name: **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n6.  **Create the Python Script:** The script will programmatically construct this product name. To fulfill the special requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will identify the product name as the \"final equation\" and extract all numerical locants (1, 2, 4, 4, 2) from this name for printing.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the product of a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde\n    and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
