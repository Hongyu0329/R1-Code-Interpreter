    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Translate Roman Numerals:** First, I will convert each Roman numeral (`VIII`, `CCC`, `CCCXI`) into its corresponding modern Arabic number.\n2.  **Set up the Equation:** I will substitute these new numbers back into the original equation.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** I will then solve the resulting mathematical expression following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\n4.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these steps automatically and print the full equation with the solution.\n\n```python\ndef roman_to_int(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a Roman numeral string to an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    roman_map = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # If the next numeral is larger, this is a subtractive case (e.g., IV, IX)\n        if i + 1 < len(s) and roman_map[s[i]] < roman_map[s[i+1]]:\n            result -= roman_map[s[i]]\n        else:\n            result += roman_map[s[i]]\n    return result\n\n# The Roman numerals from the equation\nroman_str1 = \"VIII\"\nroman_str2 = \"CCC\"\nroman_str3 = \"CCCXI\"\n\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers\nnum1 = roman_to_int(roman_str1)\nnum2 = roman_to_int(roman_str2)\nnum3 = roman_to_int(roman_str3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\n# The equation is: (VIII / CCC) - CCCXI\nsolution = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the equation with modern numbers and the final answer\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {solution}\")\n<<<_solution_>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
