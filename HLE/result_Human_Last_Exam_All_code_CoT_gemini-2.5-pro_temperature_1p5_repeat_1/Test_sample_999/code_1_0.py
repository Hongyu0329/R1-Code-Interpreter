# The final answer is B because the quantization scheme described, while powerful,
# is also complex to implement efficiently.
# On the older Turing architecture, the overhead from handling dynamic per-token scales for activations
# and per-channel scales for weights simultaneously in the GEMM epilogue might have been too high
# to guarantee a runtime speed-up compared to the highly optimized FP32 GEMM kernels.
# The other statements are well-established facts in the field of neural network quantization.
# A: True, this is mixed-precision quantization.
# C: True, H100 has architectural advantages (e.g., Transformer Engine) over A100 for LLMs.
# D: True, memory bandwidth savings in memory-bound scenarios can provide speed-up even without INT8 kernels.
# E: True, low-precision formats like FP8 and FP4 are forms of quantization.
