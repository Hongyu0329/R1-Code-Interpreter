    This function explains the reasoning behind the answer to the biological question
    about the diet of an adult male Micromalthid beetle.
    """
    explanation = """
    1.  The question concerns the feeding habits of an adult male insect in the family Micromalthidae.

    2.  Insects of this family have a complex and unusual life cycle. The larvae hatch from eggs and feed on decaying, fungus-infested wood. This means that during its larval stage, the individual fed on decaying wood (C), which contains cellulose (D) and fungus (B).

    3.  However, the question specifically asks about the *adult male*. The adult males of Micromalthidae are haploid, rare, and very short-lived.

    4.  Crucially, they are non-feeding. They have vestigial (non-functional) mouthparts and do not consume any food during their adult stage. They exist solely to attempt to mate, living off the energy reserves they accumulated as larvae.

    5.  Therefore, upon the death of the *adult male*, it will not have fed on anything *during its adult life*. The question focuses on this specific life stage.
