    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will identify the Oscar-nominated film that features the described scene. The scene you're referring to, where a character's fate is sealed shortly after saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, is from the 2004 thriller *Collateral*. In the film, a key witness being escorted by federal agents is one of the targets for the hitman, Vincent. The witness says \"Thank you\" to the bus driver as he boards, just before Vincent also boards the bus and assassinates him.\n\nNext, I will create a Python script to perform a calculation related to the film. I will use the film's release year (2004) and the number of Oscar nominations it received (2) to calculate a fictional \"Cinematic Impact Score\". The formula will be: `(Release Year - 2000) * Nominations`. The code will print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# The film in question is \"Collateral\".\n# Data for the film:\n# Release Year: 2004\n# Oscar Nominations: 2 (Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing)\n\ndef calculate_impact_score():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a fictional score based on a film's release year and Oscar nominations.\n    \"\"\"\n    release_year = 2004\n    base_year = 2000\n    nominations = 2\n\n    # Calculate the score\n    impact_score = (release_year - base_year) * nominations\n\n    # Print the details and the full equation as requested\n    print(\"Film: Collateral\")\n    print(f\"Release Year: {release_year}\")\n    print(f\"Oscar Nominations: {nominations}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating a fictional 'Cinematic Impact Score'...\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed out\n    print(f\"Equation: ({release_year} - {base_year}) * {nominations} = {impact_score}\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_impact_score()\n```\n<<<Collateral>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
