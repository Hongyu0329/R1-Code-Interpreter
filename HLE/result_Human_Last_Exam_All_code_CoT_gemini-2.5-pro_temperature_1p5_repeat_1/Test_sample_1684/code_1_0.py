# The problem is to find the smallest k such that for any smooth Riemannian metric
# on S^2 with total area 4*pi, the second non-zero eigenvalue lambda_2 is always < k.
# This value k is the supremum of lambda_2 over all such metrics.
# This supremum is achieved for a sequence of metrics degenerating to two identical touching spheres.

# 1. Define the parameters from the problem description.
total_area = 4 * math.pi
num_spheres = 2
l = 1  # For the first non-zero eigenvalue of a sphere.

# 2. Calculate the area of a single sphere in the limiting configuration.
area_per_sphere = total_area / num_spheres

# 3. Calculate the squared radius (R^2) of this sphere.
# Area = 4 * pi * R^2  =>  R^2 = Area / (4 * pi)
R_squared = area_per_sphere / (4 * math.pi)

# 4. Calculate the first non-zero eigenvalue of this sphere.
# This is the limit of lambda_2 for the sequence of smooth metrics.
# The eigenvalues of a sphere are l*(l+1)/R^2.
eigenvalue_numerator = l * (l + 1)
k = eigenvalue_numerator / R_squared

# 5. Output the step-by-step calculation and the final equation.
