    print("     - Analysis: The MA biotype is NOT adapted to raffinose. It likely lacks the efficient genetic machinery to produce galactosidase. It cannot simply 'increase' the activity of an enzyme it isn't well-equipped to make, just because the substrate is present. This contradicts the fundamental nature of the MA biotype.")
