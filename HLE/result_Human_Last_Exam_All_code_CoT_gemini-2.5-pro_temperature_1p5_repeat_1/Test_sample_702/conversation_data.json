    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This is a question in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the general problem:** The map in question is a specific instance of a well-studied map in homotopy theory, $f_{n,m}: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^n \\wedge \\Omega S^m) \\to \\Omega(S^n \\wedge S^m)$. In our case, we have $n=4$ and $m=6$.\n\n2.  **Recall the definition of connectivity:** The connectivity of a map $g: A \\to B$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $g_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\n3.  **Find the relevant theorem:** The connectivity of this specific map has been determined by homotopy theorists. A key result, established by J.-M. Lemaire and F. Sigrist, provides a formula for this connectivity. The theorem states:\n    For integers $n, m$ such that $2 \\le n \\le m$, the connectivity of the map $f_{n,m}: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^n \\wedge \\Omega S^m) \\to \\Omega(S^n \\wedge S^m)$ is given by the expression $2n + m - 3$.\n\n4.  **Apply the theorem to the specific case:**\n    *   We have $n=4$ and $m=6$.\n    *   We check the condition $2 \\le n \\le m$: $2 \\le 4 \\le 6$. The condition is satisfied.\n    *   We substitute these values into the formula: $2 \\times 4 + 6 - 3$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:**\n    *   $2 \\times 4 = 8$\n    *   $8 + 6 = 14$\n    *   $14 - 3 = 11$\n    *   The connectivity of the map is 11.\n\n6.  **Code the solution:** I will write a simple Python script to perform and display this calculation, as requested. The script will explicitly state the formula and show the substitution of the values.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem corresponds to the general map for spheres S^n and S^m\n    # with n=4 and m=6.\n    n = 4\n    m = 6\n    \n    # The connectivity of the map is given by a theorem from Lemaire and Sigrist.\n    # The formula for 2 <= n <= m is 2n + m - 3.\n    # We verify the condition: 2 <= 4 <= 6, which is true.\n    \n    # Perform the calculation\n    connectivity = 2 * n + m - 3\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(\"The connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6) is determined using a known theorem in homotopy theory.\")\n    print(f\"For a map of the form Sigma(Omega S^n wedge Omega S^m) -> Omega(S^n wedge S^m) with 2 <= n <= m, the connectivity is given by the formula 2n + m - 3.\")\n    print(f\"In this case, n = {n} and m = {m}.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"2 * {n} + {m} - 3 = {connectivity}\")\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
