    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relationship:** The problem asks for the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an interleaved sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. The 8-point DFT of this sequence, let's call it `Y(k)`, can be directly related to the 4-point DFTs of the original sequences, `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n2.  **State the formula:** The relationship is given by the formula:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n    where `k` ranges from 0 to 7, and `W_8^k` is the 8-point DFT twiddle factor, `exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)`.\n3.  **Implement the calculation:** I will write a Python script that uses this formula. The script will:\n    *   Define the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` as numpy arrays.\n    *   Loop `k` from 0 to 7.\n    *   In each iteration, calculate `Y(k)` using the formula above.\n    *   Print the full equation for each `k`, showing the values of `X(k mod 4)`, `H(k mod 4)`, `W_8^k`, and the final result `Y(k)`. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n4.  **Provide the final result:** The code's output will contain the detailed calculations. Finally, I'll summarize the resulting 8-point DFT vector `Y(k)` in the requested format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence given the 4-point DFTs\n    of the original sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    # X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]\n    # H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n    # The sequence y(n) is {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), ..., x(3), h(3)}.\n    # The 8-point DFT Y(k) is related to X(k) and H(k) by the formula:\n    # Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)\n    # where W_8 = exp(-j*2*pi/8)\n\n    print(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) is calculated using the formula: Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)\\n\")\n\n    Y_result = []\n    # Loop for k from 0 to 7\n    for k in range(8):\n        # Twiddle factor W_8^k\n        W = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / 8)\n        \n        # Get the corresponding values from X and H, using modulo for periodicity\n        x_val = X[k % 4]\n        h_val = H[k % 4]\n        \n        # Calculate Y(k)\n        y_val = x_val + W * h_val\n        Y_result.append(y_val)\n        \n        # Formatting for clear output\n        # Using np.round to clean up floating point inaccuracies\n        x_str = str(np.round(x_val, 4)).replace('j', 'j')\n        h_str = str(np.round(h_val, 4)).replace('j', 'j')\n        W_str = str(np.round(W, 4)).replace('j', 'j')\n        y_str = str(np.round(y_val, 4)).replace('j', 'j')\n\n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({k % 4}) + W_8^{k} * H({k % 4})\")\n        print(f\"   = {x_str} + {W_str} * {h_str}\")\n        print(f\"   = {y_str}\\n\")\n\n    # This part is for the final answer block and will not be printed by the script\n    final_answer_str = \", \".join([str(np.round(y, 4)).replace('j', 'j') for y in Y_result])\n    return f\"[{final_answer_str}]\"\n\n\n# Execute the function to print the detailed calculations\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_dft()\n\n```\n<<<[1.0, (1.4142+1j), (-1-1j), (-1.4142-1j), 1.0, (-1.4142+1j), (-1+1j), (1.4142-1j)]>>>"
