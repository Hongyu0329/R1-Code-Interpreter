    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I need to determine which \"Sir Launfal\" is being referred to. The most famous version in early literature is the Middle English romance by Thomas Chestre from the late 14th century. This poem survives in a single manuscript.\n\nSecond, I will identify that manuscript, which is Cotton Caligula A.ii, now held in the British Library.\n\nThird, I will look at the other works contained in that same manuscript to find one that is a \"book of manners.\" Manuscripts from this period were often compilations of various texts bound together.\n\nFinally, after identifying the book of manners from the manuscript's table of contents, I will write a Python script to print its name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the book of manners\n    preserved in the same manuscript as the Middle English romance 'Sir Launfal'.\n    \n    The romance 'Sir Launfal' is found in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n    A review of the contents of this manuscript reveals several romances and\n    a specific text on etiquette.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    manuscript = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    sir_launfal = \"Sir Launfal\"\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n\n    print(f\"The romance '{sir_launfal}' is preserved in the manuscript known as {manuscript}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it, in the same manuscript, is the book of manners called '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
