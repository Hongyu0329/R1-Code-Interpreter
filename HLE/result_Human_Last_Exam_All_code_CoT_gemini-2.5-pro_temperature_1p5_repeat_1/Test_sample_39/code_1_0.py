    print("Step-by-step analysis:")
    print("1.  The problem sets up a formal system S, which is ZFC plus the axiom that an inaccessible cardinal κ exists.")
    print("2.  It then provides a statement P, which asserts the existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding j from the universe V into a transitive class M, with κ as its critical point.")
    print("3.  This statement P is the formal definition of κ being a 'measurable cardinal'.")
    print("4.  The question is therefore about the logical relationship between inaccessible cardinals and measurable cardinals within ZFC.")
    print("\n")

    print("Key facts from set theory:")
    print("- Fact A: The existence of a measurable cardinal is a stronger large cardinal axiom than the existence of an inaccessible cardinal.")
    print("- Fact B: It's a theorem that every measurable cardinal is also inaccessible. The reverse is not true.")
    print("\n")

    print("Evaluating the options:")
    print("A) P is provable in S: This is incorrect. One cannot prove a stronger axiom (existence of a measurable cardinal) from a weaker one (existence of an inaccessible cardinal).")
    print("B) The negation of P is provable in S: This is incorrect. If this were true, it would mean 'ZFC + inaccessible' proves 'no measurable exists'. However, assuming 'ZFC + measurable' is consistent, there are models of S where P is true. Therefore, S cannot prove not-P.")
    print("D) P leads to a contradiction in S: This is incorrect. The existence of a measurable cardinal (Statement P) is a standard large cardinal axiom and is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC.")
    print("E) P is meaningless within the framework of S: This is incorrect. P is a well-formed and meaningful statement in the language of set theory.")
    print("\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Since P is not provable in S, and the negation of P is also not provable in S, P is independent of S.")
