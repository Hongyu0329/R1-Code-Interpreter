    # Step 1: Define the problem.
    # The student is using a 3'-end mRNA capture system (BD Rhapsody with poly-dT beads).
    # This method captures the poly(A) tail of transcripts.
    # The goal is to sequence the CDR3 region of TCR transcripts.
    # The problem is that the CDR3 region is located at the 5' end of the transcript,
    # far from the 3' capture site.
    print("Problem Analysis:")
    print("The current method uses 3'-end capture via a poly(dT) tail. The sequencing read (Read 2) starts from the 3' end.")
    print("The target CDR3 region is located in the V(D)J segment, which is near the 5' end of the TCR transcript.")
    print("A 225 bp read from the 3' end is not long enough to reach the CDR3 region.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the options.
    # The most effective solution must bridge the gap between the 3' capture and the 5' region of interest
    # without changing the fundamental capture chemistry or the sequencing modality.
    print("Evaluating Solutions:")
    print("The standard and most compatible solution for 3'-end capture systems is to perform a targeted enrichment after the initial cDNA synthesis.")
    print("This involves a specific PCR step to amplify the region of interest (V(D)J) from the complete cDNA library.\n")

    # Step 3: Identify the correct action.
    # This enrichment PCR uses a forward primer on the common adapter sequence and a reverse primer
    # in the conserved constant (C) region of the TCR transcript, which lies just upstream of the V(D)J/CDR3 region.
    # This selectively creates a new, smaller sequencing library that contains the cell barcode, UMI, and the CDR3 region.
    # Option D describes this process perfectly.
    print("Recommended Action:")
    print("The student should keep the initial capture process and add a subsequent targeted PCR step.")
    print("This PCR will use primers designed to flank the CDR3 region (one in the adapter, one in the TCR constant region) to specifically amplify it for sequencing.")
    print("This is the method described in option D.\n")
