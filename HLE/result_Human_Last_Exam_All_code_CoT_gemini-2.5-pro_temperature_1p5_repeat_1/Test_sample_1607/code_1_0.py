def solve_quantum_symmetry_statements():
    """
    This function analyzes the given statements about quantum symmetries and identifies the true ones.

    A) The eigenvalues of τ̂ are necessarily quantized.
       - False. The momentum operator p̂ is a generator with a continuous spectrum.

    B1) "If τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ and [τ̂,Ĥ] = 0, then the potential V(r) must be of form V(r) ∝ 1/r² (if it exists)".
       - True. For H = p²/2m + V(r), the commutator [x̂p̂ + p̂x̂, H] is generally non-zero, including for V ∝ 1/r².
         Thus, the premise "[τ̂,Ĥ] = 0" is false in the specified context. In logic, if the premise (P) is false, the implication (P → Q) is always true. This is known as a vacuous truth.

    B2) "If τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂, then the transformation Ŝ(θ) = e^{-iθτ̂} scales position and momentum as x̂ → e^θx̂, p̂ → e^{-θ}p̂".
       - False. The actual transformation is x̂ → e^{-2ħθ}x̂ and p̂ → e^{2ħθ}p̂ (with [x,p]=iħ). The scaling factor and exponents are incorrect.

    C) [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0.
       - False. [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = 0 for all θ.

    D) For any energy eigenstate |ψ⟩, τ̂|ψ⟩ is also an energy eigenstate.
       - True. Since [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 implies [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, H(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂H|ψ⟩ = τ̂(E|ψ⟩) = E(τ̂|ψ⟩).

    E) If τ̂ = L̂_z, then Ŝ(θ) represents rotation about z-axis by angle θ.
       - True. This is the standard definition of the rotation operator generated by angular momentum.

    F) The expectation value ⟨τ̂⟩ is conserved if and only if [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
       - True. This follows from the time evolution of expectation values, d⟨τ̂⟩/dt ∝ ⟨[τ̂,Ĥ]⟩. For this to be zero for any state, the operator [τ̂, Ĥ] must be zero.

    G) If [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 for all θ₁,θ₂, then τ̂ must be Hermitian.
       - False. If both operators share the same generator τ̂, they will always commute, e.g., e^A e^B = e^(A+B) = e^B e^A if A and B are proportional to the same operator. This provides no information about τ̂ being Hermitian.

    H) The spectrum of Ŝ is always continuous if τ̂ is unbounded.
       - False. Unbounded operators can have discrete spectra (e.g., L̂_z or the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian). If τ̂ has a discrete spectrum, so will Ŝ.

    I) If [τ̂₁, τ̂₂] = iτ̂₃, then e^{-iθ₁τ̂₁}e^{-iθ₂τ̂₂} ≠ e^{-i(θ₁τ̂₁ + θ₂τ̂₂)}.
       - True. By the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, e^A e^B = e^(A+B) only if [A,B]=0. Here the commutator is non-zero, so the equality does not hold.

    J) If |ψ⟩ is eigenstate of Ĥ with energy E, then Ŝ|ψ⟩ has same energy E.
       - True. Given [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0. H(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜH|ψ⟩ = Ŝ(E|ψ⟩) = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).
