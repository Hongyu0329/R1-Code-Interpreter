    "My plan is to identify the unit that meets all the specified criteria from the game \"Beyond All-Rays\" (BAR).\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** I need to find a unit that is:\n    *   A flying unit.\n    *   Producible from a Tier 1 (T1) building.\n    *   Can shoot (has a weapon).\n    *   Its weapon stuns enemy targets.\n\n2.  **Examine Faction Unit Lists:** I will mentally review the T1 air units for the primary factions, Armada and Core.\n    *   **Armada T1 Aircraft Plant:** Produces Flea (scout), Hawk (fighter), Shuriken (gunship), Stinger (bomber), and the **Rogue** (gunship).\n    *   **Core T1 Aircraft Plant:** Produces Peeper (scout), Vampire (fighter), Banshee (gunship), and Avenger (bomber).\n\n3.  **Analyze Abilities:**\n    *   Standard fighters, bombers, and most gunships do not have a stun effect on their primary weapons.\n    *   I will check the abilities of the less common units. The Armada **Rogue** is specifically equipped with a \"Paralyzer Laser\". This weapon deals damage and applies a \"stun\" or \"paralyze\" effect to the target unit for a short duration.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The Armada Rogue is the only T1 flying unit that fits all the criteria. I will now create a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_bar_t1_stunning_flyer():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the T1 flying unit in BAR\n    that can shoot and stun enemies.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The unit is from the Armada faction.\n    # It is built from the Tier 1 Aircraft Plant.\n    # Its weapon is a Paralyzer Laser which deals damage and stuns.\n    unit_name = \"Rogue\"\n    print(f\"The T1 flying unit that can shoot and stun is the: {unit_name}\")\n\nfind_bar_t1_stunning_flyer()\n```\n<<<Rogue>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which flying unit from 1 tier building in BAR can shoot and stun enemy targets? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
