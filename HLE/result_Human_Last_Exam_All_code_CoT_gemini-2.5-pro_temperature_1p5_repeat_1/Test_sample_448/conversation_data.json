    "To answer your question, I will identify the rarest stable noble gas and calculate its percentage abundance in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  The rarest of all is Radon, but it is radioactive, and its concentration is extremely low and highly variable. Therefore, it is common practice to identify Xenon (Xe) as the rarest *stable* noble gas.\n3.  The abundance of these gases is best represented by their concentration in Earth's atmosphere, which has not significantly changed since 2002.\n4.  The atmospheric abundance of Xenon is approximately 0.087 parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n5.  I will write a Python script to convert this ppm value to a percentage and display the result. The conversion formula is: `Percentage = PPM / 10,000`.\n\n```python\n# The rarest stable noble gas in Earth's atmosphere is Xenon.\ngas_name = \"Xenon\"\n# Its abundance in the atmosphere is approximately 0.087 parts per million (ppm).\nabundance_ppm = 0.087\n\n# Convert parts per million (ppm) to percentage.\n# 1 ppm = 0.0001%, so we divide the ppm value by 10,000.\ndenominator = 10000\npercentage = abundance_ppm / denominator\n\n# Print the final result in the format of an equation.\nprint(f\"The rarest stable noble gas is {gas_name}.\")\nprint(\"Its percentage in Earth's atmosphere is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{abundance_ppm} ppm / {denominator} = {percentage}%\")\n```\n<<<Xenon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
