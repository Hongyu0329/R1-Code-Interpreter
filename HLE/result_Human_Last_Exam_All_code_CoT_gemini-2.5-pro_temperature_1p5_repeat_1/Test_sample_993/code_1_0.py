    This function analyzes the factors responsible for low levels of the 18O isotope in sulfate layers.

    1. Low 18O means less evaporative enrichment.
    2. Wet Climate: Reduces evaporation compared to a dry climate.
    3. Cold Climate: Reduces evaporation compared to a warm climate. Precipitation in cold climates is also naturally lower in 18O.
    4. High Lake Levels: Indicates a positive water balance (wet climate) and a lower surface-area-to-volume ratio, which minimizes the effects of evaporation.
    
    Conclusion: A wet, cold climate with high lake levels creates the ideal conditions for low 18O in lake deposits.
    This corresponds to choice G.
