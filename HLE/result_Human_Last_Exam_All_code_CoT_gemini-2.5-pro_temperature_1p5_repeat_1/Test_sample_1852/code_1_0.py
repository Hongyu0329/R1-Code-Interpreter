    # The problem asks for the sum of the supremum (delta_1) and infimum (delta_2)
    # of the set X, where X contains all regular cardinals lambda that are lengths
    # of a specific type of sequence of sets called a "tower".

    # Step 1: Analyze the tower definition.
    # A "tower" of length lambda is a strictly decreasing chain of length lambda
    # in the poset P = (P(omega_1)/countable, superseteq*).
    # The condition on the tower is that it has no lower bound in this poset.

    # Step 2: Relate to cardinal characteristics.
    # The smallest possible length of such an unbounded tower is the cardinal
    # characteristic known as the bounding number on omega_1, denoted b(omega_1).

    # Step 3: Use known theorems and the problem's assumption to find b(omega_1).
    # We are given that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    # We use three key results from ZFC set theory:
    #   1. b(omega_1) is a regular cardinal.
    #   2. b(omega_1) > omega_1 (a result by Shelah).
    #   3. b(omega_1) <= 2^omega_1.
    #
    # Combining these gives: omega_1 < b(omega_1) <= omega_2.
    # The only regular cardinal between omega_1 (exclusive) and omega_2 (inclusive) is omega_2 itself.
    # Therefore, b(omega_1) must be omega_2.

    # Step 4: Determine the set X.
    # For a tower of length lambda to exist, lambda must be at least b(omega_1).
    # So, for any lambda in X, we must have lambda >= omega_2.
    # Also, the length of any strict chain (our tower) in the poset P cannot exceed the size of P.
    # The size of P is |P(omega_1)/countable| = 2^omega_1 = omega_2.
    # So, for any lambda in X, we must have lambda <= omega_2.
    #
    # Combining these two conditions (lambda >= omega_2 and lambda <= omega_2), we find that lambda must be omega_2.
    # Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal and a tower of this length exists (as b(omega_1) = omega_2),
    # the set X contains only one element.
    # X = {omega_2}

    # Step 5: Calculate delta_1 and delta_2.
    delta_1_str = "omega_2"
    delta_2_str = "omega_2"
    print(f"The set X is {{ {delta_1_str} }}.")
    print(f"delta_1 = sup(X) = {delta_1_str}")
    print(f"delta_2 = inf(X) = {delta_2_str}")

    # Step 6: Calculate the final sum using cardinal arithmetic.
    # For any infinite cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.
    # Thus, omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
    final_sum_str = "omega_2"
    print(f"The final sum is delta_1 + delta_2 = {delta_1_str} + {delta_2_str} = {final_sum_str}")
