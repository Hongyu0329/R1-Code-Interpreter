def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function solves the mathematical problem about counting topologically distinct continua.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  A continuum is a compact, connected metric space.
    2.  The definition of an "end point", after correcting a likely typo (from |i-j|<1 to |i-j|<=1), implies the continuum X is "arc-like".
    3.  A known theorem states that any arc-like continuum has at most two end points.
    4.  Property (1) states that X has more than one end point.
    5.  Therefore, X must have exactly 2 end points. Let E be the set of these two end points.
    6.  Property (2) states that X has exactly two orbits under the action of its homeomorphism group.
    7.  The set of end points E is topologically invariant, so it must be a union of orbits. Since E is not the entire space X (a 2-point space is not connected), the two orbits must be the set of end points E and the set of non-end points X\E.
    8.  This means all end points are interchangeable (one orbit), and all non-end points are interchangeable (the other orbit).
    9.  A simple arc (topologically equivalent to the interval [0,1]) satisfies these conditions:
        - It has two end points {0, 1}, which form an orbit via the homeomorphism f(x) = 1-x.
        - The interior (0,1) forms the other orbit.
    10. No other known continuum fits these stringent requirements. More complex "indecomposable" arc-like continua like the pseudo-arc do not have this two-orbit structure corresponding to endpoints and interior.
    11. Therefore, there is only one such topological type of continuum.
