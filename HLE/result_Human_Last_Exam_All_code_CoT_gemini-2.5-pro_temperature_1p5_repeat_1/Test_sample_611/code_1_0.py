# Let (X_t) be the complex Brownian motion conditioned as described.
# Let A be the Wiener sausage generated by the path of X_t, i.e., A = X_[0,inf) + D_0.
# Let V_n be the relative area of the disk B_n covered by A.
# The problem asks for the limit of the probability P[V_n > 2/3] as n tends to infinity.
#
# The process X_t is transient, meaning |X_t| -> infinity as t -> infinity.
# For large n, the disk B_n is far from the origin. The value V_n, which is the density
# of the sausage in B_n, is expected to converge in probability to a constant p.
# This constant p is the asymptotic density of the sausage at infinity.
#
# p = lim_{|z|->inf} P(z is in A)
#
# The probability that a point z is in A is the probability that the path of X_t
# comes within a distance of 1 from z.
# P(z is in A) = P(X_t hits the disk D(z,1)).
#
# The SDE for the process X_t is dX_t = dZ_t + (X_t / (|X_t|^2 * log|X_t|)) dt.
# For a point z with large |z|, the process X_t near z behaves like a standard
# Brownian motion with a small, nearly constant drift b ~ z / (|z|^2 * log|z|).
# The problem of hitting D(z,1) becomes equivalent to a drifted Brownian motion
# starting far away from the origin hitting the unit disk.
#
# A standard 2D Brownian motion (zero drift) is recurrent and hits any disk with probability 1.
# The hitting probability is a continuous function of the drift parameter.
# As |z| -> infinity, the drift magnitude |b| -> 0.
# Therefore, the hitting probability converges to the hitting probability for a standard
# Brownian motion, which is 1.
# So, p = 1.
#
# Since V_n converges to 1 in probability, for any epsilon > 0,
# P(|V_n - 1| >= epsilon) -> 0 as n -> infinity.
# We are interested in P[V_n > 2/3]. This is equivalent to P[V_n - 1 > -1/3].
# Let epsilon = 1/3. P(|V_n - 1| >= 1/3) -> 0.
# P(|V_n - 1| >= 1/3) = P(V_n - 1 >= 1/3) + P(V_n - 1 <= -1/3)
# = P(V_n >= 4/3) + P(V_n <= 2/3).
# Since V_n represents a proportion of area, V_n <= 1. So P(V_n >= 4/3) = 0.
# Thus, P(V_n <= 2/3) -> 0 as n -> infinity.
#
# The probability P(V_n > 2/3) = 1 - P(V_n <= 2/3).
# As n -> infinity, this probability converges to 1 - 0 = 1.
# The number from the question is 2/3.
# The final answer is 1.
