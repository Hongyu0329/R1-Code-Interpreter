def solve_cardinal_tower_problem():
    """
    Solves the set theory problem about the length of a tower on omega_2.

    The solution proceeds by:
    1. Identifying the mathematical structure as a maximal tower.
    2. Determining the smallest possible length of this tower, t(omega_2), using the
       Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) as a simplifying assumption.
    3. Characterizing the set of all possible lengths for such towers.
    4. Finding the second smallest cardinal in that set.
