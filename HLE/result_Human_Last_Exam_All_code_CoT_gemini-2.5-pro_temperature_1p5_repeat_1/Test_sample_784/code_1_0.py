    # --- Step 1: Calculate passes for all single-token choices ---
    # To evaluate the probability of any single token following the prompt,
    # we need to run one forward pass on the prompt itself. The result of this pass
    # is a probability distribution over all possible next tokens in the vocabulary.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate passes for all multi-token choices ---
    # For a multi-token choice, we must calculate the joint probability of its
    # entire sequence. This can be done efficiently with one forward pass on the
    # prompt concatenated with the answer choice. Since the 4 multi-token
    # choices are distinct sequences, we must perform a separate forward pass for each one.

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the total minimal number of passes ---
    # The total minimal number of passes is the sum of the passes required
    # for the single-token choices and the multi-token choices.
