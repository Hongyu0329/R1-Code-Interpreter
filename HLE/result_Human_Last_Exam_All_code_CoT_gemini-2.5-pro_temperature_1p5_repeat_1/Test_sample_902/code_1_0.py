The question asks if a program P can exist that computes `def_superfast(10000)`.
The answer is no. Such a program cannot exist because the function itself describes an uncomputable problem. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

The pseudo-code defines `def_superfast(10000)` as a value `Huge_int + 1`.
`Huge_int` is the largest integer returned by any Python program that:
1. Has a source code with less than 10000 symbols.
2. Halts and returns an integer.

(The `else` case returning 0 is not relevant for the input 10000).

### Step 2: The Connection to the Halting Problem

To calculate `Huge_int`, a program `P` would need to systematically test all possible program source codes shorter than 10000 symbols. For each potential program, `P` would have to determine if it halts.

This is the famous Halting Problem. It has been proven that no general algorithm (and therefore no computer program) can exist that determines, for all possible inputs, whether a program will finish running or continue forever.

Since `P` would need to solve the Halting Problem to identify the set of programs that contribute to `Huge_int`, and the Halting Problem is unsolvable, the function `def_superfast` is uncomputable.

### Step 3: Proof by Contradiction

We can also prove this with a direct paradox. Let's assume for a moment that a program `P` that computes `def_superfast(10000)` *does* exist.

1.  Let's assume we can write this program `P` so that its own source code is shorter than 10000 symbols.
2.  This means `P` itself is a Python program with source code less than 10000 symbols that halts and returns an integer.
3.  Therefore, `P` must be included in the very set of programs it is analyzing to find `Huge_int`.
4.  The value that `P` computes and returns is `Huge_int + 1`.
5.  However, `Huge_int` is defined as the **largest** value returned by *any* program in the set. Since `P` is in the set, the value it returns must be less than or equal to `Huge_int`.
6.  This creates a logical contradiction. The output of P must satisfy two conflicting conditions:
    - Output of P = `Huge_int + 1`
    - Output of P <= `Huge_int`
    This would imply that `Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int`, which is mathematically impossible.

### Conclusion

The assumption that program `P` exists leads to a logical contradiction. This, combined with the fact that the problem requires solving the undecidable Halting Problem, proves that no program `P` can compute `def_superfast(10000)`.
