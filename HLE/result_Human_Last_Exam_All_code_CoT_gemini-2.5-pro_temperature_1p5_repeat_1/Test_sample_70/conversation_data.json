    "The task is to identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. I will write a Python script to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Flag of Denmark:** I will first model the Danish flag as a matrix to determine its rank. The flag has a red field with a white cross. This design is composed of two fundamental, linearly independent patterns: a row/column with both red and white, and a row/column with only white (or only red). Choosing numerical values for the colors to maximize rank (as per the instructions), we find the rank is 2. For instance, the rows can be represented as vectors like `[Red, Red, White, Red, ...]` and `[White, White, White, White, ...]`, which are linearly independent.\n\n2.  **Analyze African Flags:** Next, I will analyze the structure of each African nation's flag to determine its rank. The rank of a flag's matrix is determined by the number of unique, linearly independent patterns (rows or columns) it contains.\n    *   A flag with three simple horizontal stripes of different colors (a tricolor) will have three unique row patterns, making its rank 3.\n    *   A flag with a simple vertical bisection of two colors will have two unique column patterns, making its rank 2.\n    *   Flags with more complex geometries, such as those with central symbols, chevrons, or multiple stripes, need to be analyzed based on how many distinct row/column patterns their geometry creates.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will create a Python script that encapsulates this analysis. The script will define the rank of the Danish flag as the target rank. It will then contain a function that holds the analysis for various African flags. This function will determine the rank for each flag based on its structural properties.\n\n4.  **Identify and Print Matches:** The script will iterate through the list of African nations, calculate each flag's rank, and identify which ones have a rank of 2. Finally, it will print the names of these countries along with the reasoning for their rank determination.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_flag_rank_analysis(country):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of a country's flag to determine its linear algebraic rank.\n\n    The \"maximal rank\" is interpreted as the number of linearly independent\n    row or column patterns that make up the flag's design, assuming colors\n    are chosen to not create accidental linear dependencies.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: (rank, explanation_string)\n    \"\"\"\n    flag_analysis = {\n        # Rank 2 Flags: Have exactly two fundamental patterns.\n        \"Nigeria\": (2, \"A vertical bicolor (green-white-green) is spanned by two column vectors: [Green] and [White].
