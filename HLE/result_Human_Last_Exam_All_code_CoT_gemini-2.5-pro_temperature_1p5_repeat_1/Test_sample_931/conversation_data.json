    "This is a biological question that can be answered by accessing established entomological knowledge. Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, have a specific diet. I will write a Python script that encapsulates this knowledge to determine the correct answer from the given choices.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish Known Facts**: I'll create a data structure in Python that represents the known diet of adult snakeflies. They are primarily predators of soft-bodied insects but are also known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen for energy.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option**: The script will then systematically check each answer choice against these established facts.\n3.  **Identify the Correct Combination**: It will identify that snakeflies eat aphids (predation) and also consume nectar (supplemental).\n4.  **Print the Conclusion**: The script will print the logical breakdown of why certain options are correct or incorrect and state the final, most comprehensive answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    by checking known facts against a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish known dietary facts for adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Based on entomological sources, they are predators and also feed on pollen/nectar.\n    known_diet = {\n        'Nectar': True,\n        'Pollen': True,\n        'Fungus': False,\n        'Leaf tissue': False,\n        'Aphids': True\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the provided answer choices.\n    # Note that some options are combinations of others.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen', # We evaluate this based on the \"Pollen\" key.\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue', # We evaluate this based on the \"Leaf tissue\" key.\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids', # We evaluate this based on the \"Aphids\" key.\n        'F': ['A', 'E'], # Combination of Nectar and Aphids\n        'G': ['D', 'E']  # Combination of Leaf tissue and Aphids\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the dietary choices for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate individual components.\n    print(\"Fact Check on individual food sources:\")\n\n    # Check Nectar (A)\n    is_correct_a = known_diet['Nectar']\n    print(f\"- Choice A (Nectar): Correct.
