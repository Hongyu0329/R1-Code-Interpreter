    # First, let's count the total number of monoid homomorphisms from A to A,
    # ignoring the closure condition for a moment.

    # 1. Constant maps: f(x) = c for x != inf, f(inf) = inf. There are n+1 such maps.

    # 3. Maps of the form f_{d,c}(x) = c if d|x, else 1 (where c|d).
    # For each d in {1..n}, there are tau(d) (number of divisors) choices for c.
    # The case c=1 for any d gives the constant map f_1, which is already counted.
    # The map f_{1,1} is the constant map f_1.
    # We count the number of additional maps from this family.
    # These are maps f_{d,c} where d>1 and c>1.

    # Total homomorphisms if G was not constrained by the action definition.
    card_G_unconstrained = num_const_maps + num_id_map + num_fdc_maps
    
    # Now, apply the constraint from the definition of the functor G.
    # For G to be a functor, the set G(.) must be closed under the action.
    # The action is (a f) = f o lambda_a, where lambda_a(b) = gcd(a,b).
    # A map g is a monoid homomorphism only if g(inf) = inf.
    # So, for f in G(.), (a f)(inf) must be inf for all a in A.
    # (a f)(inf) = f(lambda_a(inf)) = f(gcd(a,inf)) = f(a).
    # Thus, f(a) must equal inf for all a in A.
    # Let's find homomorphisms with this property.
    # The only function f: A -> A with f(a)=inf for all a in A is the constant
    # infinity map. Let's check if it's a homomorphism:
    # f(inf) = inf. Check: inf = inf.
    # f(gcd(a,b)) = gcd(f(a), f(b)). Check: inf = gcd(inf, inf) = inf.
    # It is a valid homomorphism.
    # This is the *only* homomorphism satisfying the condition.
    # Therefore, the set G(.) contains exactly one element.

    # Step 4: Calculate the cardinality of the Day convolution
    # The cardinality of [F * G](.) is |F(.) (x)_A G(.)|.
    # This is the cardinality of the set (A x G(.)) / ~, with relation
    # (gcd(a,x), g) ~ (x, a.g) for a,x in A and g in G(.).
    # Since G(.) = {f_0}, the pairs are of the form (x, f_0).
    # The action on f_0 is trivial: (a.f_0)(y) = f_0(gcd(a,y)) = inf. So a.f_0 = f_0.
    # The relation simplifies to (gcd(a,x), f_0) ~ (x, f_0).
    # This induces an equivalence relation on A: x ~ gcd(a,x) for all a,x in A.
    # Let's find the number of equivalence classes.
    # - For any x in {1..8}, take a=1. Then x ~ gcd(1,x) = 1. So all {1..8} are equivalent to 1.
    # - For x = inf, take a=1. Then inf ~ gcd(1,inf) = 1. So inf is also equivalent to 1.
    # All elements of A are in the same equivalence class.
    # Thus, there is only one class.
