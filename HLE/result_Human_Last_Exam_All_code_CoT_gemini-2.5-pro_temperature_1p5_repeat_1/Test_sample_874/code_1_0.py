# Step 1: Explain the strategy.
# Based on the theory of Ducci sequences, tuples that generate a maximal
# number of steps (M) for a given limit on their components are often
# related to Fibonacci numbers. A specific family of such tuples is of the
# form (F_{n-1}, F_{n+1}, F_{n+2}, 0), where F_k are Fibonacci numbers.
# To find the tuple with the smallest sum a+b+c+d, we select k=1 for the
# scaling factor k*(...) and set one element to 0.

# Step 2: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the limit of 10,000,000.
limit = 10_000_000
fib = [0, 1]
while fib[-1] <= limit:
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])

# The last Fibonacci number generated that is within the limit is F_{35},
# since F_{36} = 14,930,352 > 10,000,000.
# fib is 0-indexed, F_k = fib[k]. The list has len(fib) = 37, F_0 to F_36.
# F_{35} = 9,227,465.

# Step 3: Determine the value of n.
# We need to find the largest n such that F_{n+2} <= limit.
# F_{35} is the largest Fibonacci number in our list that's <= limit.
# So we set n+2 = 35, which means n = 33.

n = 33
# The numbers in our tuple are F_{n-1}, F_{n+1}, F_{n+2}, and 0.
# These correspond to F_{32}, F_{34}, F_{35}, and 0.

val1 = fib[n - 1] # F_32
val2 = fib[n + 1] # F_34
val3 = fib[n + 2] # F_35
val4 = 0

# Step 4: Assign the numbers to a, b, c, d.
# The number of steps can depend on the permutation of the elements.
# A natural choice for achieving maximal length is a descending order.
# This gives a specific assignment for (a, b, c, d).
a = val3  # F_35 = 9,227,465
b = val2  # F_34 = 5,702,887
c = val1  # F_32 = 2,178,309
d = val4  # 0

# Step 5: Compute the expression and print the results.
result = (a + b - c - d) % 1000

print("The determined tuple (a, b, c, d) is based on Fibonacci numbers F_n.")
print(f"The chosen numbers are 0, F_32, F_34, and F_35.")
print(f"For the calculation, we assume the descending order permutation:")
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"b = {b}")
print(f"c = {c}")
print(f"d = {d}")
print("\nCalculating (a + b - c - d) mod 1000:")
