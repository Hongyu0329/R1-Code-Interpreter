The pharmacist should counsel Allison that her choice of headache medicine, Excedrin, contains aspirin (an NSAID). When combined with her prescription for Fluoxetine (an SSRI), there is an increased risk of stomach bleeding. It would be safer for her to use an alternative like acetaminophen (Tylenol) for her headaches. The pharmacist could also note that headaches can be a side effect of both Fluoxetine and Junel Fe, and she should follow up with her doctor if they persist.
