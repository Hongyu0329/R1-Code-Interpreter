    A stable curve C of arithmetic genus 2 can be classified by its
    number of components (c), the geometric genera of these components (g_i),
    and the total number of nodes (delta).
    
    The arithmetic genus is calculated as: p_a = sum(g_i) + delta - c + 1
    We check that for each type, p_a = 2.
