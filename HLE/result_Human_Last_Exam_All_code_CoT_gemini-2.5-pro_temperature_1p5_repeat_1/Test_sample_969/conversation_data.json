    "An analysis of the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` reveals a pattern based on grouping the numbers into blocks of three.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Group the sequence:** The sequence can be broken down into three blocks of three numbers each.\n    *   Block 1: `B1 = [3, 2, 1]`\n    *   Block 2: `B2 = [2, 3, 3]`\n    *   Block 3: `B3 = [3, 2, 2]`\n\n2.  **Identify the generation rule:** We can find a rule to generate the next block `B(i+1)` from the previous block `B(i) = [x, y, z]`.\n    *   **Rule for the first two elements:** The first element of the new block is the second element of the old block (`new_x = y`), and the second element of the new block is the first element of the old block (`new_y = x`).\n    *   **Rule for the third element:** The third element (`z`) follows its own pattern. The sequence of `z` values is `1, 3, 2`. This is a permutation of `{1, 2, 3}`. The most likely pattern is that this sequence of `z` values cycles.\n\n3.  **Apply the rule to find the next block (B4):**\n    *   We start with `B3 = [3, 2, 2]`, so `x=3, y=2`.\n    *   The next block's first two elements are `new_x = y = 2` and `new_y = x = 3`.\n    *   The next `z` value in the `1, 3, 2` cycle is `1`.\n    *   So, `B4 = [2, 3, 1]`.\n\n4.  **Determine the next four elements:**\n    *   The first three are from `B4`: `2, 3, 1`.\n    *   This matches the beginning of answer choice C: `2, 3, 1, 2`. Although the logic does not perfectly predict the final `2`, this is the closest and most plausible option.\n\n5.  **Construct the final code:** The Python code will append the chosen next four elements to the original sequence and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function completes the given sequence based on an identified pattern.\n\n    The sequence is grouped into blocks of three:\n    B1 = [3, 2, 1]\n    B2 = [2, 3, 3]\n    B3 = [3, 2, 2]\n\n    The rule to generate the next block B(i+1) from B(i)=[x,y,z] is:\n    - The first two elements are swapped: new_x = y, new_y = x.\n    - The third element, z, follows a cycling pattern: 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, ...\n\n    Applying the rule:\n    - B4 is derived from B3=[3,2,2]:\n      - new_x = 2\n      - new_y = 3\n      - new_z is the next in the cycle, which is 1.\n      - So, B4 = [2, 3, 1].\n\n    The next three elements are 2, 3, 1. Option C is [2, 3, 1, 2], which is the closest match.\n    We will use the elements from option C to complete the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n    next_four_elements = [2, 3, 1, 2]\n\n    completed_sequence = sequence + next_four_elements\n\n    print(\"The original sequence is:\")\n    print(*sequence)\n    print(\"\\nThe next 4 elements are:\")\n    print(*next_four_elements)\n    print(\"\\nThe completed sequence is:\")\n    print(*completed_sequence)\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
