    print("1. The core quantity is the expected information gain, which represents the expected change in the agent's beliefs (posterior) from one time step to the next.")
    print("2. There is a fundamental result in information theory relating the agent's learning process to its initial uncertainty. The sum of all expected information gains over time cannot exceed the entropy of the agent's initial prior distribution.")
    print("   - Let P_t be the posterior at time t.")
    print("   - The expected information gain at t+1 is E[KL(P_{t+1} || P_t)].")
    print("   - The key inequality is: sum_{t=0 to inf} E[KL(P_{t+1} || P_t)] <= H(P_0), where H(P_0) is the entropy of the initial prior.")
    print("3. The KL-divergence is always non-negative. If a sum of non-negative terms is finite (bounded), then the terms themselves must approach zero as t -> infinity.")
    print("4. Evaluating the options based on this insight:")
    print("   - (a) The prior has finite entropy: If H(P_0) is finite, the sum is bounded. This directly implies that the expected information gain must approach zero. This is a sufficient condition for the most general proof.")
    print("   - (d) Observations are sampled i.i.d.: This is not true for an agent acting in a world, where its actions influence future states and observations.")
    print("   - (e) The entropy of the posterior approaches zero: This is a result of the posterior converging to a single point, which would indeed cause information gain to go to zero. However, it is a consequence to be proven, not a foundational assumption.")
    print("   - (b) and (c) These are specific assumptions about the environment and the agent's policy. They are often used to prove a stronger result, posterior consistency (i.e., the agent learns the true model). While consistency implies information gain goes to zero, it is not required. Information gain can go to zero simply because the posterior stops changing, even if it's wrong. The information-theoretic proof using (a) is more general.")
    print("5. Conclusion: Assumption (a) is the most fundamental assumption from the list that allows for a proof.")
