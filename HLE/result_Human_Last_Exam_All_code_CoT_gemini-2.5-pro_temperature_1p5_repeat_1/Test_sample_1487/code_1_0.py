# Based on the analytical derivation, the expression simplifies considerably.
# The expression to be evaluated is:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# We derived that ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1).

# Let's substitute this into the first term of the expression:
# (2 * 0.5 * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1)
# This simplifies to 2 * 0.5 = 1.

# So the whole expression becomes 1 + 10^15.

# Let's calculate this using Python.
# First term calculation
first_term = 2 * 0.5

# Second term value
second_term = 10**15

# Final result
result = first_term + second_term

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final simplified equation is 1 + 10^15.
print("The simplified final equation is:")
# We use int() to display the numbers as integers.
print(f"{int(first_term)} + {int(second_term)} = {int(result)}")
