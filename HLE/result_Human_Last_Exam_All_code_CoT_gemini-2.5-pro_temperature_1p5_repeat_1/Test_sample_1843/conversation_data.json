    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ and order $k$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N:** Any primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the order of the character:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n3.  **Analyze the lcm condition:** For the lcm of a set of numbers to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n    a) Every number in the set must be a divisor of 6 (i.e., belong to {1, 2, 3, 6}).\n    b) The set must contain at least one number that is a multiple of 2, and at least one that is a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Count the possibilities:** For each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, we count how many primitive characters modulo $p^a$ have an order that divides 6. We then multiply these counts to get the total number of character combinations whose orders all divide 6. Finally, we verify that for every such combination, the lcm of the orders is exactly 6.\n\nHere is the step-by-step application of this plan to $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes Euler's totient function, phi(n), which counts the\n    number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    For a cyclic group of order n, phi(d) gives the number of elements of order d\n    for any d that divides n.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N=36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    \n    print(f\"Let N = {N}.
