    This function solves for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions
    f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. f must be injective and therefore strictly monotonic.
    2. Case 1: f is strictly increasing.
       - It's proven that f must be strictly positive, i.e., f(x) > 0 for all x.
       - Let L = lim_{x->-inf} f(x). L must be a non-negative real number.
       - Taking the limit of f(f(x)) = exp(x) as x -> -inf, we get f(L) = 0.
       - This contradicts f(x) > 0 for all x.
       - So, no strictly increasing solution exists.
    3. Case 2: f is strictly decreasing.
       - It's proven that f must be strictly positive, i.e., f(x) > 0 for all x.
       - Let M = lim_{x->+inf} f(x). M must be a non-negative real number.
       - Taking the limit of f(f(x)) = exp(x) as x -> +inf, we get f(M) = +inf.
       - This is impossible for a function f: R -> R which must map real numbers to real numbers.
       - So, no strictly decreasing solution exists.
    4. Conclusion: The set of such functions is empty.
