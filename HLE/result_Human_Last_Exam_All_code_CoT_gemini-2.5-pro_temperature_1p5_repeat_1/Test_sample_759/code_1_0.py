    This program seeks the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple, connected graph
    whose automorphism group has a size of exactly 3.

    Based on graph theory, the smallest such graph has 9 vertices and 9 edges.
    This graph has a 3-fold rotational symmetry but lacks mirror symmetry,
    resulting in an automorphism group of size 3 (the cyclic group C3).

    We define this graph below and programmatically verify that its automorphism
    group size is indeed 3. Since graphs with fewer edges (e < 9) do not satisfy
    this property, the minimum number of edges is 9.
