    "To find the intermediate step in the cellular automaton sequence, we need to identify the rule that governs its evolution. Elementary cellular automata have 256 possible rules (numbered 0-255), and each rule defines the next state of a cell based on its own state and that of its two immediate neighbors.\n\nHere is the plan to find the unique intermediate step:\n1.  **Assume Standard Conventions**: We will assume the automaton uses a standard setup:\n    *   **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: The sequence is treated as a loop, where the left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell, and the right neighbor of the last cell is the first.\n    *   **Wolfram Numbering**: The rule number (0-255) corresponds to an 8-bit binary string, which defines the output for the 8 possible neighborhoods (`111`, `110`, ..., `000`).\n\n2.  **Brute-Force Search**: We will write a script that iterates through all 256 possible rules.\n\n3.  **Simulate and Verify**: For each rule, the script will:\n    a. Take the initial state `01101001`.\n    b. Apply the rule to generate a candidate for the intermediate `????????` state.\n    c. Apply the same rule to this intermediate state to generate a final state.\n    d. Compare the result with the given final state `10000111`.\n\n4.  **Identify the Solution**: If the generated final state matches the given one, we have found a valid rule and the corresponding intermediate step. Since the problem asks for \"the only valid solution,\" we will confirm that only one unique intermediate step is found across all possible rules.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to discover the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in an elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_str = \"01101001\"\n    final_str = \"10000111\"\n\n    initial_state = [int(c) for c in initial_str]\n    final_state = [int(c) for c in final_str]\n    n = len(initial_state)\n\n    valid_solutions = []\n\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # The rule string maps neighborhood 111, 110, ..., 000 to its bits.\n        rule_bits = format(rule_num, '08b')\n\n        # --- First generation: initial_state -> intermediate_state ---\n        intermediate_state = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic boundary conditions\n            left = initial_state[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = initial_state[i]\n            right = initial_state[(i + 1) % n]\n\n            # Convert neighborhood to an integer (0-7) to find the rule index\n            neighborhood_value = 4 * left + 2 * center + 1 * right\n            rule_index = 7 - neighborhood_value\n            \n            new_cell_state = int(rule_bits[rule_index])\n            intermediate_state.append(new_cell_state)\n\n        # --- Second generation: intermediate_state -> calculated_final_state ---\n        calculated_final_state = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighbors with periodic boundary conditions\n            left = intermediate_state[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center = intermediate_state[i]\n            right = intermediate_state[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            neighborhood_value = 4 * left + 2 * center + 1 * right\n            rule_index = 7 - neighborhood_value\n            \n            new_cell_state = int(rule_bits[rule_index])\n            calculated_final_state.append(new_cell_state)\n            \n        # Check if the calculated final state matches the target\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state:\n            valid_solutions.append(intermediate_state)\n\n    # Check for a unique solution and print the result\n    if len(valid_solutions) == 0:\n        print(\"No solution was found.\")\n    else:\n        # Remove duplicate solutions if multiple rules produce the same intermediate step\n        unique_solutions = []\n        for sol in valid_solutions:\n            if sol not in unique_solutions:\n                unique_solutions.append(sol)\n        \n        if len(unique_solutions) == 1:\n            result_list = unique_solutions[0]\n            result_str = \"\".join(map(str, result_list))\n            # The problem requests printing the full equation\n            print(f\"{initial_str} -> {result_str} -> {final_str}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Found multiple possible intermediate steps, so the solution is not unique.\")\n\nsolve_cellular_automaton()\n```\n<<<00001111>>>"
