    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button, we need to consult a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening chart for a 100BB cash game.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Acknowledge the game conditions: 100BB deep, rake-free, and opening from the button. The button is the most powerful position, so we can play a very wide range of hands profitably. The rake-free condition further encourages opening more marginal hands.\n2.  List the suited jack (Jxs) hands in descending order of strength: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. Strength here is determined by high-card value and connectivity (ability to make straights).\n3.  Consult a standard GTO opening range for the button. In modern GTO strategies for this specific scenario, all suited jacks are considered profitable opens. This is because they have the potential to make strong flushes and can exert pressure on the blinds.\n4.  The \"worst\" hand to open is therefore the one with the lowest intrinsic strength that is still part of this standard opening range. By ranking the suited jacks, the weakest is J2s.\n5.  The Python code will simply declare this hand as a string and print it.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n    In poker strategy, particularly from the button, a very wide range of hands are opened to apply pressure\n    on the blinds. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts for a 100BB rake-free game recommend opening all\n    suited jack hands. These hands are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\n    The \"worst\" of these hands is the one with the lowest rank, which has the least high-card value and\n    connectivity for making straights. In this list, J2s is the weakest. Therefore, it is the worst\n    suited jack that you should still open from the button.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The hand is identified based on standard GTO poker charts.\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n\n    print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nsolve_poker_question()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
