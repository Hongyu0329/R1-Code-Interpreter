    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the starting and ending leg positions for each of the five classical ballet steps provided in the multiple-choice options. My goal is to identify which step concludes with the dancer's legs in the exact same position from which they started.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will define the starting and ending positions for each of the following ballet terms:\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:** A jump where the feet start in fifth position, cross six times in the air, and land back in the same fifth position.\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:** A step involving an \"escape\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one, and then a return to the closed position. The word \"changé\" explicitly means the feet switch places upon closing.\n    *   **C. Assemblé:** A jump where the legs are \"assembled\" in the air and land together. Common forms like `assemblé dessus` (over) or `dessous` (under) result in the feet changing their front/back relationship.\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:** A gliding step where the second foot closes \"derrière\" (behind). While this specific execution can preserve the starting foot position, the `glissade` step itself has a very common `changé` variation, making it less definitive than other options.\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:** A complex, decorative jump that typically ends with the feet having switched their front/back position.\n2.  I will use a Python script to represent this information and programmatically determine the correct answer.\n3.  The script will iterate through the options, explain the movement for each, and identify the one that fits the criteria.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the name of the correct step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one starts and ends\n    in the same leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Python 2/3 compatibility for printing\n    if sys.version_info[0] < 3:\n        # pylint: disable=redefined-builtin\n        # In Python 2, print is a statement.
