    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph Definition:** The graph \\( G \\) is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\( n \\). The sum (also known as the graph join) of graphs \\( G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k \\) is formed by taking the disjoint union of their vertices and adding edges connecting every vertex of \\( G_i \\) to every vertex of \\( G_j \\) for all pairs \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number Property of Graph Sums:** A fundamental property of the graph sum is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of its constituent graphs. For our graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), where \\( C_n \\) is a cycle of length \\( n \\), this means:\n    \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Determine the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) (for \\( n \\ge 3 \\)) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd:\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, \\( C_n \\) is a bipartite graph, so its chromatic number is **2**.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, \\( C_n \\) is not bipartite and requires **3** colors.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximal Chromatic Number:** To find the maximal possible chromatic number for \\( G \\), we must use the maximal possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when the cycle length \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** We substitute the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our equation for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\nThe following Python code performs the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the maximal chromatic number. This occurs when the\n    # chromatic number of the cycle, chi(C_n), is maximized.\n\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle C_n is:\n    # 2 if n is even (n >= 4)\n    # 3 if n is odd (n >= 3)\n    # The maximal value is 3.\n    max_chi_cn = 3\n\n    # The number of cycles being summed.\n    num_cycles = 3\n\n    # The chromatic number of a sum of graphs (G1 + G2 + ...) is the sum of\n    # their individual chromatic numbers (chi(G1) + chi(G2) + ...).\n    # So, chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n).\n    # The maximal chi(G) is therefore 3 + 3 + 3.\n    maximal_chi_g = max_chi_cn * num_cycles\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number of a cycle of length n, chi(C_n), is {max_chi_cn} (when n is odd).\")\n    print(f\"The graph G is the sum of {num_cycles} such cycles.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of the sum of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximal chromatic number of G is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} = {maximal_chi_g}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
