    Solves the researcher table constellation puzzle.

    possible "all-friends" tables (triangles) and "all-strangers" tables 
    (independent sets of size 3) in the collaboration graph.

    # Step 1: Define the graph parameters from the problem statement.
    v = 42  # Number of researchers (vertices)
    d = 24  # Number of co-authors for each researcher (degree of each vertex)

    # Step 2: Calculate some basic graph counts.
    # Total number of pairs of vertices
    total_pairs = v * (v - 1) // 2
    # Number of edges in the graph
    num_edges = v * d // 2

    # Total number of possible triplets of researchers
    total_triplets = math.comb(v, 3)

    # Step 3: Use Goodman's theorem framework to relate triplet types.
    # Let N_k be the number of triplets with k edges (k=0,1,2,3).
    # We have two fundamental equations based on summations over all triplets:
    
    # Equation A: Sum of edges in all triplets.
    # Each edge is part of (v-2) triplets.
    # N_1 + 2*N_2 + 3*N_3 = num_edges * (v - 2)
    sum_of_edges_in_triplets = num_edges * (v - 2)

    # Equation B: Sum of pairs of edges meeting at a vertex (cherries/V-shapes).
    # Each vertex v with degree d contributes comb(d,2) such pairs.
    # For a triplet, only those with 2 or 3 edges contribute. A 2-edge triplet (a-b-c) 
    # contributes 1 cherry. A 3-edge triplet (triangle) contributes 3 cherries.
    # So, N_2 + 3*N_3 = v * comb(d,2)
    sum_of_cherries = v * math.comb(d, 2)

    # Step 4: Solve the system of equations for N_0 + N_3.
    # We have the following system for any v-vertex, d-regular graph:
    # 1) N_0 + N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = total_triplets
    # 2)       N_1 + 2*N_2 + 3*N_3 = sum_of_edges_in_triplets
    # 3)             N_2 + 3*N_3 = sum_of_cherries
    
    # From (3), we can express N_2. From (2), we can then express N_1.
    # Substituting both into (1) allows us to find N_0 + N_3.
    #
    # N_2 = sum_of_cherries - 3*N_3
    # N_1 = sum_of_edges_in_triplets - 2*N_2 - 3*N_3
    #     = sum_of_edges_in_triplets - 2*(sum_of_cherries - 3*N_3) - 3*N_3
    #     = sum_of_edges_in_triplets - 2*sum_of_cherries + 3*N_3
    #
    # N_0 = total_triplets - N_1 - N_2 - N_3
    #     = total_triplets - (sum_of_edges_in_triplets - 2*sum_of_cherries + 3*N_3) - (sum_of_cherries - 3*N_3) - N_3
    #     = total_triplets - sum_of_edges_in_triplets + sum_of_cherries - N_3
    #
    # This simplifies to: N_0 + N_3 = total_triplets - sum_of_edges_in_triplets + sum_of_cherries
