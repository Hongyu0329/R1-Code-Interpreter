    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  List all the given information theoretic quantities.\n2.  Use the chain rule for mutual information, $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$, to derive any missing basic mutual information values between $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.\n3.  Express the quantity we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$, in terms of the given values and quantities involving $W$. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, there are specific identities that apply.\n4.  The key identity relates the mutual information of four variables. For any four variables $X,Y,Z,W$, the following identity holds:\n    $I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    Since $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=f(Z)$), conditioning on both $Z$ and $W$ is the same as conditioning on $Z$ alone. This simplifies some terms. For example, $I(A;B|C,Z,W) = I(A;B|C,Z)$.\n5.  Use these identities to establish a relationship between $I(X;Y|W)$ and other known quantities.\n6.  The relationship will involve terms like $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$. The goal is to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$ by choosing the function $W=f(Z)$ appropriately. This involves finding the achievable bounds for these intermediate terms.\n7.  Analyze the derived expression to find its maximum possible value. This involves finding the maximum of some terms and the minimum of others, subject to the constraints that all information quantities must be non-negative and consistent with the given values.\n\nLet's execute the plan.\n\n```python\n# Step 1 & 2: List givens and derive I(X;Z)\n# Given values\nI_XY = 3  # I(X;Y)\nI_XY_Z = 2 # I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XZ_Y = 5 # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# The chain rule for mutual information states:\n# I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\n# I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# Therefore, I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# We can solve for I(X;Z)\n# 3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2\nI_XZ = I_XY + I_XZ_Y - I_XY_Z\n# I_XZ = 3 + 5 - 2 = 6\n\nprint(f\"I(X;Y) = {I_XY}\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|Z) = {I_XY_Z}\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Z|Y) = {I_XZ_Y}\")\nprint(f\"Derived I(X;Z) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_Y} - {I_XY_Z} = {I_XZ}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3, 4, 5: Find an expression for I(X;Y|W)\n# We use the chain rule on I(X; Y,Z | W).\n# I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)\n# Equating the two expressions:\n# I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)\n\n# Since W is a function of Z (W=f(Z)), conditioning on Z is more informative\n# or equal to conditioning on W. So, conditioning on (Z, W) is the same as on Z.\n# This means I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z)\nI_XY_ZW = I_XY_Z # I(X;Y|Z,W) = 2\n\n# Substitute this into the equation:\n# I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)\n# Rearranging for I(X;Y|W):\n# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\n\n# Step 6 & 7: Maximize the expression\n# We need to maximize I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# Let's express the terms with W using known quantities.\n# For I(X;Z|W):\n# I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)  (since W is a function of Z)\n# I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)\n\n# For I(X;Z|Y,W):\n# I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z,W|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)\n\n# Substitute these back into the expression for I(X;Y|W):\n# I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))\n# I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - I(X;W) - 5 + I(X;W|Y)\n# I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)\n\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we need to maximize the difference I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W).\n# Let's analyze the bounds of this difference.\n# I(X;W|Y) is the information between X and W, given Y.\n# Since W is a function of Z, any information W has about X must come through Z.\n# By the data processing inequality, I(X;W|Y) <= I(X;Z|Y).\n# We know I(X;Z|Y) = 5, so I(X;W|Y) <= 5.\n# Also, mutual information is always non-negative, so I(X;W) >= 0.\n\n# The difference is therefore bounded:\n# I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) <= 5 - 0 = 5.\n# This gives an upper bound for I(X;Y|W):\n# I(X;Y|W) <= 3 + 5 = 8.\n\n# However, we must check if this bound is attainable.\n# To reach this bound, we would need I(X;W|Y) = 5 AND I(X;W) = 0.\n# Let's check for contradictions.\n# 1. I(X;W|Y) = 5 = I(X;Z|Y). Equality holds if and only if I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0.\n# 2. I(X;W) = 0. This means X and W are independent.\n\n# If X and W are independent, then conditioning on W provides no information about X.\n# So, I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) because W is independent of X.\n# So condition (1) becomes I(X;Z|Y) = 0.\n# This contradicts the given information that I(X;Z|Y) = 5.\n# Therefore, the value 8 is not attainable.\n\n# We need to maximize I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W) subject to being constructible.\n# The value of I(X;Y|W) is given by $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n# Let's explore achievable values for $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n# Consider a case where we can choose W=f(Z) such that:\n# - I(X;W|Y) = 5 (This requires I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0)\n# - I(X;W) = 1\n# This is a hypothetical valid construction, as there is no immediate contradiction.
