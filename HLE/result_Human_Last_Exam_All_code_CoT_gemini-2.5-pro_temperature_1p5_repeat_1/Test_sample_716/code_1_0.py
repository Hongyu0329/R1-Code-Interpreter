1.  The Hausdorff dimension is a concept used to measure the dimension of any set, including fractals.
    For standard geometric shapes like lines, planes, and smooth curves, the Hausdorff dimension
    is an integer and equals the familiar topological dimension.

2.  The given curve is parametrized by the functions:
    x(t) = sin(pi * t)
    y(t) = sin(t)
    z(t) = cos(2t)

3.  The functions sin(u) and cos(u) are infinitely differentiable (smooth).
    Therefore, the functions x(t), y(t), and z(t) are also smooth.

4.  A curve parametrized by smooth functions is a smooth manifold (a smooth curve),
    which is a 1-dimensional object. Its derivative vector is never zero, which makes it a 'regular' curve.

5.  The Hausdorff dimension of a smooth k-dimensional manifold is k. Since our curve is a
    smooth 1-dimensional manifold, its Hausdorff dimension must be 1.
