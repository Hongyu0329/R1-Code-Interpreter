    # Part (a): Analysis of smooth coverings and semi-regular actions.
    # A smooth covering D -> D_N requires the orders of the generators to be
    # preserved in the quotient G/N. This implies that the cyclic subgroups
    # generated by b, w, and bw intersect trivially with N.
    # The vertex and face sets are coset spaces G/<g>. The stabilizer in N of
    # a point in such a space is conjugate to N intersect <g>, which is trivial.
    # Therefore, N acts semi-regularly.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Analysis of the definition of a quasi-simple group.
    # The problem provides the definition of a quasi-simple group as one where
    # G/Z(G) is simple and G = G'. A perfect group is defined as G = G'.
    # Since this is part of the given definition, the statement is true by definition.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Determining the type of G based on its properties.
    # The conditions imply that G has a minimal normal subgroup N which acts
    # regularly on the set of faces. The O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive
    # groups states that such a group must be of type HA (Holomorph Affine,
    # if N is abelian) or TW (Twisted Wreath, if N is non-abelian).
    answer_c = "[(HA), (TW)]"
