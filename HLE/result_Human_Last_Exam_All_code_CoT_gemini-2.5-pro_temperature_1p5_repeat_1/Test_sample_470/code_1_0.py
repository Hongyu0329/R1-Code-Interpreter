# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the problem
# Order of the defect group D = (C_2)^5
dim_D = 5
order_D = 2**dim_D

# Order of the inertial quotient E
order_E = 5

# Step 2: Calculate l(B)
# l(B) is the number of 2'-conjugacy classes of E.
# Since |E| = 5 is odd, all elements are 2'-elements.
# A group of order 5 is cyclic and thus abelian, so the number of
# conjugacy classes is its order.
l_B = order_E
print(f"The number of irreducible Brauer characters, l(B), is {l_B}.")

# Step 3: Calculate k(B) using the formula for abelian defect groups
# k(B) = (1/|E|) * sum_{x in E} |C_D(x)|

# For the identity element e in E, C_D(e) = D
size_C_D_identity = order_D

# For any non-identity element x in E, the size of the centralizer C_D(x) is 2^1 = 2,
# as explained in the reasoning.
size_C_D_non_identity = 2

# The number of non-identity elements in E is |E| - 1
num_non_identity_elements = order_E - 1

# Calculate the sum of the sizes of the centralizers
sum_of_centralizer_sizes = size_C_D_identity + num_non_identity_elements * size_C_D_non_identity

# Calculate k(B)
# The result should be an integer, so we use integer division
k_B = sum_of_centralizer_sizes // order_E
print(f"The number of irreducible ordinary characters, k(B), is {k_B}.")

# Step 4: Compute the final value k(B) - l(B)
result = k_B - l_B

print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"k(B) - l(B) = {k_B} - {l_B} = {result}")
