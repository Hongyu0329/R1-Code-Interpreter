    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Foundation (Large Deviation Theory):** I will start by explaining how the problem of finding the equilibrium state in statistical mechanics is fundamentally a large deviation problem. The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state, and according to large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov, its probability overwhelms all other states in the thermodynamic limit. This justifies the use of the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**, where we find the state that maximizes the system's entropy subject to physical constraints.\n\n2.  **Bose-Einstein Entropy:** For light quanta (photons), which are bosons, I will use the appropriate entropy formula derived from Bose-Einstein statistics. This formula counts the number of ways (microstates) to arrange indistinguishable particles in energy levels.\n\n3.  **Maximization and Distribution:** I will maximize this entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total mean energy. Since the number of photons is not conserved, there is no particle number constraint (or equivalently, the chemical potential is zero). This maximization procedure, using Lagrange multipliers, will yield the celebrated **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons in each energy state.\n\n4.  **Calculate Mean Energy (E):** Using the derived Bose-Einstein distribution and the density of states for photons in a 3D cavity, I will integrate over all energy levels to find the total mean energy `E`. This will result in a formula for energy as a function of temperature `T` and volume `V`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Entropy (S):** With the formula for mean energy `E` established, I will find the equilibrium entropy `S`. A convenient way to do this is by using the fundamental thermodynamic relationship between entropy, energy, and the grand potential (`Ω`). For a photon gas, there is a simple relation: `Ω = -E/3`, which allows for a straightforward calculation of `S` in terms of `E` and `T`.\n\n6.  **Final Python Code:** Finally, I will encapsulate these resulting mathematical expressions for `E` and `S` into a Python script. The script will print these formulas in a clear, readable format, showing all the numerical constants and physical variables involved, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that displays the derived equilibrium values:\n\n```python\ndef display_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and displays the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    for a photon gas (Bose case of light quanta) based on the principles\n    of statistical mechanics, which are justified by large deviation theory.\n\n    The derivation proceeds as follows:\n    1. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the Boltzmann entropy\n       S = k_B * ln(W) for bosons, under the constraint of a fixed total energy E.\n    2. This maximization yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the mean\n       occupation number <n_j> of an energy state ε_j:\n       <n_j> = 1 / (exp(ε_j / (k_B*T)) - 1)\n    3. The total mean energy (E) is calculated by integrating the energy of\n       all states, weighted by this distribution, over the density of states\n       g(ε) for photons in a 3D volume V:\n       E = Integral[ε * <n(ε)> * g(ε) dε] from 0 to infinity.\n       The density of states is g(ε) = (8 * π * V / (h^3 * c^3)) * ε^2.\n    4. Performing this integration leads to the formula for E shown below, which is\n       a form of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n       The key integral is Integral[x^3 / (e^x - 1) dx] = π^4 / 15.\n    5. The entropy (S) is found using the thermodynamic relation for a photon gas,\n       S = (4/3) * (E/T). Substituting the expression for E gives the formula for S.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the final equations as strings\n    mean_energy_numerator = \"8 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^4\"\n    mean_energy_denominator = \"15 * h^3 * c^3\"\n\n    entropy_numerator = \"32 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^3\"\n    entropy_denominator = \"45 * h^3 * c^3\"\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Values for Photon Gas ---\")\n    print(\"\\nPhysical constants used in the equations:\")\n    print(\"  k_B: Boltzmann constant\")\n    print(\"  h: Planck's constant\")\n    print(\"  c: Speed of light\")\n    print(\"  π: Pi\")\n    print(\"\\nSystem variables:\")\n    print(\"  T: Absolute temperature\")\n    print(\"  V: Volume of the system\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\")\n    print(\"The equation for the mean energy is:\")\n    print(f\"E = ({mean_energy_numerator}) / ({mean_energy_denominator})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nDecomposing the mean energy equation:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator: {mean_energy_numerator}\")\n    print(\"It includes the numerical factors: 8, 5 (as π^5), 4 (as T^4 and k_B^4)\")\n    print(f\"Denominator: {mean_energy_denominator}\")\n    print(\"It includes the numerical factors: 15, 3 (as h^3 and c^3)\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\")\n    print(\"The equation for the entropy is:\")\n    print(f\"S = ({entropy_numerator}) / ({entropy_denominator})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nDecomposing the entropy equation:\")\n    print(f\"Numerator: {entropy_numerator}\")\n    print(\"It includes the numerical factors: 32, 5 (as π^5), 4 (as k_B^4), 3 (as T^3)\")\n    print(f\"Denominator: {entropy_denominator}\")\n    print(\"It includes the numerical factors: 45, 3 (as h^3 and c^3)\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to display the results\ndisplay_equilibrium_values()\n<<<\nE = (8 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\nS = (32 * π^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\n>>>\n```"
