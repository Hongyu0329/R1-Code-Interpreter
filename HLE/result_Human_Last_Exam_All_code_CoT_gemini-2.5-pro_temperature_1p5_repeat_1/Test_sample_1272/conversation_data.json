    "My plan is to identify the historical event of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam and then determine its modern-day location.\n\n1.  **Identify the Event:** I will research the military career of Ming General Mu Sheng, focusing on his campaigns in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This primarily points to the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427).\n2.  **Pinpoint the Defeat:** I will search for specific battles where Mu Sheng's forces were defeated. Historical records indicate a significant defeat at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in 1426, which can be considered his first major setback in that particular campaign against Lê Lợi's forces.\n3.  **Locate the Modern Province:** I will determine the modern geographical location of Khả Lưu Pass. Historical and geographical sources place this pass in the region that corresponds to the present-day Nghệ An Province in Vietnam.\n4.  **Create Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script to state and print the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the modern Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat during the Lam Son uprising.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    battle = \"Battle of Kha Luu Pass\"\n    year = 1426\n    province = \"Nghệ An Province\"\n\n    print(f\"The first major defeat for {general} during the Lam Son uprising occurred in the year {year}.\")\n    print(f\"This was at the {battle}.\")\n    print(f\"The location of this battle is in the modern-day province of: {province}, Vietnam.\")\n\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
