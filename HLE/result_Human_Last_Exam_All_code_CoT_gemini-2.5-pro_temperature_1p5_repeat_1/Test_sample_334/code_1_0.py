    Analyzes the provided options and determines the best solution for securing biometric authentication.
    
    The four core requirements are:
    1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
    2. An unwilling (coerced) user will NOT authenticate.
    3. The system remains uncompromised if biometric data is exposed.
    4. The solution applies to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    Analysis:
    - Options like (D) Liveness Detection and (J) Hashing solve individual problems but are not complete solutions.
    - Options like (H) Context-Aware Auth and (E) AI Anomaly Detection are good at coercion but may fail on other points like data exposure.
    - (I) Strong MFA is a very strong practical choice, solving the issues by adding complementary factors.
    - (M) Revocable Fuzzy Biometric Vaults is an innovative enhancement that fundamentally addresses the core weaknesses of biometrics, particularly their non-revocable nature. By making a biometric credential revocable, it solves the data exposure problem at its root. The description explicitly claims it handles spoofing and coercion as well, making it a complete solution that fulfills all four requirements.
    
    Therefore, (M) is the most comprehensive and well-described solution.

The system allows users to revoke and reissue their biometric credentials without needing to change their inherent physical traits, ensuring data integrity and resistance to both spoofing and coercion. This solution provides multi-modal support, ensuring that any modality can be securely used or revoked as needed, making it highly adaptable and meeting all specified requirements."
