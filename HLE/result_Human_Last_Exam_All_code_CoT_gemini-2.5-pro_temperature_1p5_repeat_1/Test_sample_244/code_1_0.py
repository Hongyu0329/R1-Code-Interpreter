# Step 1: Define the lists of knots
all_7_crossing_knots = ["7_1", "7_2", "7_3", "7_4", "7_5", "7_6", "7_7"]
# From knot theory, the only non-hyperbolic knot with 7 crossings is the torus knot 7_1
non_hyperbolic_7_crossing_knots = ["7_1"]

# Step 2: Count the total number of knots
total_knots = len(all_7_crossing_knots)

# Step 3: Count the number of non-hyperbolic knots
num_non_hyperbolic = len(non_hyperbolic_7_crossing_knots)

# Step 4: Calculate the number of hyperbolic knots
num_hyperbolic = total_knots - num_non_hyperbolic

# Step 5: Calculate and print the proportion

print(f"The proportion of hyperbolic knots is the number of hyperbolic knots divided by the total number of knots.")
