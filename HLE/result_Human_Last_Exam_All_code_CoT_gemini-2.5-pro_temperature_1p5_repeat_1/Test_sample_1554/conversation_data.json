    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  First, I need to access my knowledge base to identify the specific philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for the conceptual decomposition of a hallmark (or criterion) into symptoms and signals.\n2.  After identifying the philosopher, I will write a Python script.\n3.  This script will store the name of the philosopher in a variable.\n4.  Finally, the script will print a clear statement that answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher known for distinguishing between symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals is: {philosopher}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
