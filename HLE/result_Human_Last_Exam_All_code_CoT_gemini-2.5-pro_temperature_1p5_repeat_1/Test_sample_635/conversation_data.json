    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Rewrite the factorization equation as $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$.\n2.  Let $D(s)$ be a general $2 \\times 2$ polynomial matrix. I will write out the expressions for the elements of $N(s)$.\n3.  For $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all potential denominators in its elements must be canceled. This gives a set of conditions on the polynomial entries of $D(s)$.\n4.  I will find the simplest non-trivial polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these conditions and is invertible.\n5.  With this $D(s)$, I will calculate the corresponding $N(s)$.\n6.  Finally, I will verify that the found $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime by checking the rank of the concatenated matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to carry out this plan and finds the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) for the given transfer function matrix.\n    The method involves finding a suitable polynomial matrix D(s) that makes N(s) = D(s)H(s) a polynomial matrix,\n    and then verifying the coprimeness of the pair (D(s), N(s)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given transfer function is H(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H)\n    print(\"\\nWe are looking for a factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\\n\")\n\n    # From the condition D(s)H(s) = N(s), where D and N are polynomial matrices,\n    # we derive conditions on the elements of D(s).\n    # A systematic derivation leads to a simple choice for D(s) that satisfies the requirements.\n    # The simplest non-trivial solution is found to be:\n    \n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Now, we calculate the corresponding N(s) matrix using N(s) = D(s)H(s)\n    # sympy.simplify() is used to cancel out terms and show N(s) is polynomial.\n    N = sympy.simplify(D * H)\n\n    # The resulting matrices for the left coprime factorization are:\n    print(\"A valid left coprime factorization is given by:\")\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # The final equation is:\n    print(\"H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) = \")\n    # Print D inverse\n    print(\"⎡ 1   s - 1⎤⁻¹   ⎡1  1⎤\")\n    print(\"⎢          ⎥      ⎢    ⎥\")\n    print(\"⎣ 0  s² - 1⎦      ⎣2  0⎦\")\n\n\n    # Verification steps\n    # 1.
