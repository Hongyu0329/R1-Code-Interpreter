The ground state is the minimizer of energy among all non-trivial solutions. A ground state may not exist if the energy is unbounded below on the set of solutions (which can occur in supercritical cases). Therefore, existence of a mountain pass solution does not imply existence of a ground state.\n")

    print("\nConclusion for (c): No. Firstly, existence of a minimizer is not guaranteed. The condition r1+r2 < 2s does not ensure the problem is L^2-subcritical (r1+r2 < 4), which is typically required for a minimizer to exist. For s>2, we can have r1+r2 > 4, leading to an unbounded functional on P(a,b). Secondly, even if a minimizer exists, uniqueness (even up to symmetries) is not guaranteed for coupled nonlinear systems. There are known counterexamples where multiple distinct solutions exist.\n")
