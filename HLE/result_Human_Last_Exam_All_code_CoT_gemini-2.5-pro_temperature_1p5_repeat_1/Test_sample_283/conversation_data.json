    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned. This partitioning creates a hierarchical structure that can be thought of as a quadtree. For a tree of depth `d`, there are `d+1` levels, starting from level 0 (the root, representing the entire matrix) to level `d` (the leaves).\n\nAt each level `l` of this hierarchy, the matrix is divided into `(2^l) x (2^l)` blocks. This means there are `(2^l * 2^l) = 4^l` nodes or submatrices at that level.\n\nA matrix operation, such as a matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication, that leverages the HSS structure involves an algorithm that traverses this entire tree. The computations are performed using the compressed data (low-rank factors and small dense blocks) stored at each node. Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of all nodes across all levels of the tree.\n\nFor a tree with a depth of 4, we need to sum the number of nodes from level 0 to level 4.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Define the depth of the tree, `d=4`.\n2.  Iterate through each level `l` from 0 to 4.\n3.  Calculate the number of submatrices at each level using the formula `4^l`.\n4.  Sum these values to find the total number of accessed submatrices.\n5.  Print the full equation showing the sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of submatrices accessed during a matrix\n    multiplication in a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree is given as 4.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # A tree of depth 'd' has 'd+1' levels, from 0 (root) to 'd' (leaves).\n    levels = range(depth + 1)\n\n    # This list will store the number of submatrices at each level,\n    # which will be the terms in our final sum.\n    terms_in_sum = []\n    total_submatrices = 0\n\n    print(\"For a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree with a depth of 4, the structure is a quadtree.\")\n    print(\"The number of submatrices accessed corresponds to the total number of nodes in this tree.\")\n    print(\"The number of nodes at any level 'l' is 4^l.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total is the sum of nodes at each level from 0 to 4:\")\n\n    # Calculate the number of submatrices for each level and add to the total.\n    for l in levels:\n        # The number of submatrices (nodes) at level l is 4^l.\n        submatrices_at_level = 4**l\n        terms_in_sum.append(submatrices_at_level)\n        total_submatrices += submatrices_at_level\n\n    # To meet the requirement of outputting each number in the final equation,\n    # we construct a string representing the full summation.\n    # `map(str, terms_in_sum)` converts each integer term to its string representation.\n    # ' + '.join(...) concatenates these strings with \" + \" in between.\n    equation_str = ' + '.join(map(str, terms_in_sum))\n\n    # Print the final equation and the result.\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Accessed Submatrices = {equation_str} = {total_submatrices}\")\n\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n<<<341>>>"
