# Step 1: Identify the numbers in the Tzotzil sentence.
# The word 'ox' is the Tzotzil for "three".
ox = 3

# The word 'junabi' (last year) is derived from 'jun', which is Tzotzil for "one".
jun = 1

# Step 2: Form an equation as hinted by the prompt.
# The most straightforward equation is addition.
result = ox + jun

# Step 3: Print the full equation as requested.
# This equation's numbers (3 and 4) are found in answer choice C.
print(f"The number from 'ox' is {ox}.")
print(f"The number from 'junabi' is {jun}.")
print("The resulting equation is:")
print(f"{ox} + {jun} = {result}")
