    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its heptad repeat pattern, specifically the residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. The identity and packing of these residues largely determine whether the protein forms a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** A coiled-coil is defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure. We will analyze the sequence to find the most likely heptad framing that places hydrophobic residues at these positions.\n2.  **Extract Core Residues:** Once the frame is established, we will identify the specific amino acids at every 'a' and 'd' position throughout the sequence.\n3.  **Analyze Packing Efficiency:** Based on the identified 'a' and 'd' residues, we will use established principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing to predict the oligomeric state.\n    *   **Dimers** often have large hydrophobic residues at both 'a' and 'd' (e.g., L-L pattern).\n    *   **Trimers** are often specified by beta-branched residues (I or V) at 'a' and Leucine (L) at 'd' (I-L pattern). They are also highly compatible with the A-L pattern.\n    *   **Tetramers** are often specified by a pattern of a beta-branched residue at 'a' and a small residue at 'd' (e.g., I-A pattern).\n4.  **Conclude the Oligomeric State:** Based on the analysis, we will determine the most stable oligomeric state.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"1.

This is the 'efgabcd' frame.\n    \n    # Heptad 'a' positions start at index 3 (pos 4) and repeat every 7.\n    # Heptad 'd' positions start at index 6 (pos 7) and repeat every 7.\n    a_indices = [i for i in range(3, len(sequence), 7)]\n    d_indices = [i for i in range(6, len(sequence), 7)]\n\n    print(\"2.

Leucine's large, straight-chain hydrophobic side chain is a classic anchor for the coiled-coil core and is found in oligomers of all states.\n\nThe 'a' positions are consistently Alanine (A). Alanine is the smallest hydrophobic amino acid. This provides a strong clue:\n\n- Dimer (2 helices): Packing an 'A' from one helix against an 'A' from another would likely leave a cavity in the core, which is energetically unfavorable. Dimers are more stable with larger residues like Leucine or Isoleucine at the 'a' position.\n\n- Trimer (3 helices): A trimeric arrangement allows the three small Alanine side chains (one from each helix) to pack together efficiently in the center of the bundle. This 'A-L' pattern (a=A, d=L) is a known structural motif that strongly favors the formation of trimers.\n\n- Tetramer (4 helices): While possible, the classic tetramer motif involves a larger residue at 'a' and a smaller one at 'd' (e.g., Isoleucine at 'a', Alanine at 'd') to accommodate the different packing interfaces. The observed 'A-L' pattern is a much better fit for the trimeric geometry.\n\"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.fill(analysis_text, width=70))\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n    print(\"4.
