    explanation = """
    The "perturbation theory interpretation of feedforward neural networks" primarily refers to theories like the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This framework analyzes the network's behavior in the limit of infinite width.

    Here's the core idea:
    1. A neural network is initialized with random weights and biases.
    2. If the learning rate is sufficiently small, the network's parameters (weights) do not move far from their initial values during training. They are "perturbed".
    3. Because the changes are small, the network's output function can be accurately approximated by its first-order Taylor expansion around the initial parameters. This makes the model behave like a linear model in parameter space.
    4. The training dynamics of this linearized model are governed by a kernel, the NTK, which remains nearly constant throughout training. The training process becomes equivalent to solving a kernel regression problem.
    5. The final "optimal parameters" are those that solve this kernel regression task. The solution is completely determined by the properties of the NTK.

    What determines the NTK?
    The NTK is computed by taking an expectation over the random distribution of the network's initial parameters for a given architecture. The most critical statistical property of this distribution is its variance (or standard deviation), which is directly controlled by the **magnitude of weight initialization**.

    Changing the initial weight magnitude fundamentally changes the resulting kernel, which in turn changes the function the network learns and the final solution it converges to. Therefore, within this theoretical framework, the magnitude of weight initialization is the key property determining the optimal parameters.
