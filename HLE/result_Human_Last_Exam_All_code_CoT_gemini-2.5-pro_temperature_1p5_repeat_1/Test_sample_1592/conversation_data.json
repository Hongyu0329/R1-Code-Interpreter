    "My plan is to identify the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec, by calculating the geographic distance.\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates:** First, I'll find the latitude and longitude of the Waskaganish gathering place.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors:** The provinces and territories neighboring Quebec are Ontario, Nunavut, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Given Waskaganish's location on James Bay, the closest neighbors will be Ontario (to the west) and Nunavut (the islands within James Bay, like Akimiski Island).\n3.  **Select Representative Points:** I will select a representative point for the closest part of Ontario (the border on James Bay) and the closest part of Nunavut (the southern shore of Akimiski Island).\n4.  **Calculate Distances:** I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, to find the distance from Waskaganish to the points in Ontario and Nunavut.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I'll compare the calculated distances to determine which province or territory is closer.\n\nI will now write a Python script to execute this plan. The script will print all the numbers used in the calculation and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Earth radius in kilometers\n    R = 6371.0\n\n    # Convert coordinates from degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Difference in coordinates\n    dlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    dlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n\n    # Haversine formula calculation\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    distance = R * c\n\n    return distance\n\n# Coordinates for the Waskaganish gathering place, Quebec\nwaskaganish_lat = 51.1947\nwaskaganish_lon = -78.7708\n\n# The Quebec-Ontario border along the James Bay coast is at approximately longitude 79°31′ W.\n# We will use a point on this border at the same latitude as Waskaganish for our Ontario reference.\nontario_border_lat = 51.1947\nontario_border_lon = -79.5167\n\n# The closest part of Nunavut is Akimiski Island.
