    Calculates the number of turns in Kitri's Act I variation based on symbolic values.

    The famous turning sequence in the variation consists of piqué turns across the
    diagonal. The standard choreography calls for 16 turns.

    For this calculation, we'll use a symbolic representation:
    - The Bolshoi Theatre's iconic facade has 8 columns.
    - The sequence of 16 turns is often performed as 2 sets of 8.

    # The question asks for the number of turns performed by Osipova in the variation.
    # While the technical term used in the question may be imprecise (pirouette from fifth vs. piqué),
    # the most famous turning sequence in Act I contains this many turns.
