    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold, so its dimension can be described by a complex number, let's call it `m`. The corresponding real dimension is `n = 2m`.\n2.  The presence of a compatible complex structure on a Kähler manifold imposes strong constraints on its Riemann curvature tensor, significantly reducing the number of its independent components compared to a generic Riemannian manifold of the same real dimension.\n3.  The curvature tensor on a Kähler manifold is entirely determined by its components of the form $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$ in complex coordinates. All other types of components (like $R_{ijkl}$ or $R_{ijk\\bar{l}}$) are zero.\n4.  These non-zero components define a symmetric operator on the space of real (1,1)-forms.\n5.  The real dimension of the space of real (1,1)-forms on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is $N = m^2$.\n6.  The number of independent components of a symmetric operator on a real vector space of dimension $N$ is given by the formula $\\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$.\n7.  By substituting $N = m^2$ into the formula, we find the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m`: $\\frac{m^2(m^2+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for a user-specified complex dimension `m`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the space of real (1,1)-forms, N.\n    N = m * m\n    print(f\"First, we find the dimension of the relevant vector space (real (1,1)-forms), N.\")\n    print(f\"N = m^2 = {m}^2 = {N}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Use the formula for the number of components of a symmetric operator.\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of independent components is given by the formula: N * (N + 1) / 2.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the equation with the calculated numbers.\n    numerator = N * (N + 1)\n    result = numerator // 2\n    \n    print(f\"Plugging in N = {N}, we get:\")\n    final_equation = f\"{N} * ({N} + 1) / 2 = {N} * {N+1} / 2 = {numerator} / 2 = {result}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the number of independent entries is {result}.\")\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # You can change the complex dimension 'm' here.\n    # For example, for a complex surface (like a K3 surface), m = 2.\n    # For a complex curve (a Riemann surface), m = 1.\n    try:\n        # Prompt the user for the complex dimension\n        input_m = int(input(\"Enter the complex dimension 'm' of the Kähler manifold: \"))\n        final_answer = calculate_riemann_components_kahler(input_m)\n        if final_answer is not None:\n             # The final answer is requested in a special format.\n             # This will print the final numerical answer after the explanation.\n             print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(\"Invalid input.
