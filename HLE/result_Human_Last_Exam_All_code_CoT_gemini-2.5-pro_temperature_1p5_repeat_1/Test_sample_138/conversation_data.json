    "This is a problem in the mathematical theory of integral lattices. A direct calculation is not feasible, but the answer can be determined by applying fundamental theorems that constrain the properties of such lattices. The Python script below will walk through the logical argument that proves no such lattices exist.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  State the properties of the lattice in question: dimension `n=17`, determinant `d=2`, positive definite (which means signature `\\sigma=17`), and even.\n2.  Introduce a powerful theorem that connects the signature `\\sigma` of an even lattice to the squared norm of a special vector `w` within the lattice, called a characteristic vector. The theorem states that `w \\cdot w \\equiv \\sigma \\pmod 8`.\n3.  Analyze the nature of this characteristic vector `w` and its squared norm for a lattice with determinant 2. We will find that `w \\cdot w` must be an even integer.\n4.  Combine these two facts to reveal a mathematical contradiction: a number that must be even is required to be congruent to 1 modulo 8 (i.e., be odd).\n5.  Since the existence of such a lattice leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that no such lattice exists, and therefore the answer is 0.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates why no positive definite even lattices of\n    dimension 17 and determinant 2 can exist.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the hypothetical lattice L.\n    n = 17\n    det = 2\n    # The lattice is positive definite, so its signature (n_+, n_-) is (17, 0).\n    # The signature sigma is n_+ - n_-.\n    sigma = 17\n\n    print(\"We are looking for the number of positive definite even lattices with:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Determinant = {det}\")\n    print(f\"Signature \\u03C3 = {sigma}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem.\n    # For any even lattice L, there exists a vector w (called a characteristic vector)\n    # in L.
