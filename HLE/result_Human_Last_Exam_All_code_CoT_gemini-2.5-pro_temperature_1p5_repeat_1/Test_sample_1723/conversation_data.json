    "It is a common misconception that a genus of mushroom produces a blue spore print. In reality, no known genus has a distinctly blue spore print. The colors are typically in the range of white, cream, pink, yellow, brown, or black.\n\nHowever, there is a very famous genus of mushroom known for its vibrant blue latex (the milky fluid it exudes when cut) and for its flesh bruising a deep blue color. This is almost certainly the genus you are looking for. The following Python script will print its name.\n\n```python\ndef find_blue_mushroom_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the mushroom genus famously associated with the color blue.\n    \n    While no mushroom genus is known to produce a truly blue spore print,\n    the genus Lactarius is renowned for its blue latex and blue-staining flesh,\n    particularly in the species Lactarius indigo. This is the common answer\n    to this mycological trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The genus known for its blue latex and bruising.\n    genus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n    \n    # Print the name of the genus.\n    print(f\"The genus of mushroom known for its distinct blue latex is: {genus_name}\")\n\nfind_blue_mushroom_genus()\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
