    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation:\n1.  **Rearrange the Equation**: The given non-linear first-order differential equation is complex. The first step is to rearrange it into a more recognizable form, specifically as a quadratic equation in terms of `dy/dx`.\n2.  **Substitution**: To simplify the equation further, we can introduce a substitution. Observing the terms `y^2` and `y * dy/dx`, a suitable substitution is `u = y^2`. This transforms the equation into a new differential equation involving `u` and `x`.\n3.  **Solve the Transformed Equation**: The new equation in `u(x)` is still non-linear but might have a simpler class of solutions. We will look for a polynomial solution, as this often works for such equations when coefficients are polynomials in `x`. By assuming a quadratic form `u(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + K` and substituting it into the equation, we can determine the coefficients.\n4.  **Back-substitute**: Once the general solution for `u(x)` is found, we will substitute `y^2` back for `u` to obtain the general solution for the original differential equation. The solution will contain an arbitrary constant, as expected for a first-order differential equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_differential_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the given differential equation\n    and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Rearrange the original differential equation.\")\n    print(\"The given equation is: x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*(dy/dx) + y^2*(dy/dx)^2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2\")\n    print(\"Let p = dy/dx.
