# The reaction described is a Pummerer reaction.
# 1. Reactants: Methyl phenyl sulfoxide (Ph-S(=O)-Me), triflic anhydride ((Tf)2O),
#    and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN).
# 2. Mechanism:
#    a. Activation: The sulfoxide is activated by triflic anhydride to form a sulfonium ion, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+.
#    b. Elimination: Deprotonation of the methyl group forms a thionium ion intermediate, [Ph-S=CH2]+.
#    c. Nucleophilic Attack: Cyanide from TMSCN attacks the CH2 carbon.
# 3. Product: The final product is Phenyl-S-CH2-CN.
# 4. IUPAC Naming:
#    - The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).
#    - The parent alkane with the nitrile is acetonitrile (-CH2CN).
#    - The substituent on the second carbon is a phenylthio group (Ph-S-).
#    - Therefore, the IUPAC name is 2-(Phenylthio)acetonitrile.
