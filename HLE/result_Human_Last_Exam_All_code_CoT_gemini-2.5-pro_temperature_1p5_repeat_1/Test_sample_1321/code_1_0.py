    # Questions 1-4: Is a(n) = infinity for large n in d-dimensions?
    # For dimensions d>=2, it is known that for sufficiently large n,
    # configurations exist that allow the sequence of placed numbers to be infinite.
    # Q1: 3d. Answer: Yes
    answers.append("Yes")
    # Q2: 4d. Answer: Yes
    answers.append("Yes")
    # Q3: 5d. Answer: Yes
    answers.append("Yes")
    # Q4: 6d. Answer: Yes
    answers.append("Yes")

    # Question 5: In d>=1 dimension is it true that a(n) < K*n?
    # Since a(n) can be infinite for d>=2, no such finite K can exist.
    # The statement must hold for all d>=1, so it is false.
    answers.append("No")

    # Questions 6, 7, 9: Is a(n) >= (2^d+1)(n-1)+1 for d>=2?
    # This is a known conjectured lower bound for all n.
    # Q6: 3d case: a(n) >= (2^3+1)(n-1)+1 = 9n-8. Answer: Yes.
    answers.append("Yes")
    # Q7: 4d case: a(n) >= (2^4+1)(n-1)+1 = 17n-16. Answer: Yes.
    answers.append("Yes")

    # Question 8: 5d case, is a(n) < 33n-32 for large n?
    # 33n-32 is the value from the formula for d=5. However, for large n, a stronger
    # lower bound a(n) >= 3^(5-1)*n - C = 81n - C is known. Since a(n) grows faster
    # than 33n, the inequality is false for large n.
    answers.append("No")
    
    # Q9: General case for d>=2. Answer: Yes.
    answers.append("Yes")

    # Questions 10, 11, 12: Values of a(n) in 1d.
    # In 1d, a cell has 2 neighbors. To place k=2, we need two 1s as neighbors.
    # This is possible for n>=2. To place k=3, we need a sum of 3.
    # The value 2 we just placed cannot be a neighbor to an empty cell.
    # So the sum must come from the initial 1s. The maximum sum from two 1s is 2.
    # Therefore, 3 can never be placed. So, for any n>=2, a(n)=2.
    # Q10: a(2) = 2

    # Q11: a(3) = 2
    answers.append(2)
