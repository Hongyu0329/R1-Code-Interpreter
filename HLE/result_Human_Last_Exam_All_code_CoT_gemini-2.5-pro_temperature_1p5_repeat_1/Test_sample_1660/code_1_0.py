    print("Step 3: Analyzing the Result")
    print("Comparing the two values, the LD50 of TMT-Cl is significantly lower than that of TBT-Cl.")
    print(f"This indicates that TMT-Cl is more than 10 times as acutely toxic as TBT-Cl.")
    print("While factors like cell permeability and metabolism contribute to this difference, the LD50 itself is the direct quantitative evidence of its higher danger.")
    print("Therefore, the most important factor among the choices is the significantly lower LD50 value of TMT-Cl.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The correct choice is B because a lower LD50 value directly correlates with higher danger.")
