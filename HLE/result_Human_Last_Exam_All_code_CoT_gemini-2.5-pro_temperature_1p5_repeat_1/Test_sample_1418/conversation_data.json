    "Here is a plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Field Extension:** We can view $L$ as a tower of extensions. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. Its automorphisms are determined by the signs they assign to $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. Let these be $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$, along with their product $\\sigma_4$ and the identity.\n2.  **Analyze the Top Extension:** The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. Let $\\delta = \\gamma^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$. The extension $L/K$ has degree 2, i.e., $[L:K]=2$, if and only if $\\delta$ is not a perfect square in $K$. We can verify this using a norm argument. This will establish that the total degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n3.  **Check for Galois Property:** For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Equivalently, for any automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sigma(\\delta)$ must have its square root in $L$. We'll verify this condition for all conjugates of $\\delta$.\n4.  **Determine the Group Structure:** Once we establish that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8, we need to find the structure of its Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $(C_2)^3$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$. We will find the relations between the generators of $G$ to identify the group.\n    *   Let $\\tau$ be the generator of $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, where $\\tau(\\gamma) = -\\gamma$.\n    *   Let $\\hat{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_3$ be automorphisms in $G$ that extend $\\sigma_2$ and $\\sigma_3$ from $K$ to $L$.\n    *   We will compute the orders of these generators and their commutation relations. Specifically, we will calculate $\\hat{\\sigma}_2^2$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_3^2$, and the commutator $\\hat{\\sigma}_2\\hat{\\sigma}_3\\hat{\\sigma}_2^{-1}\\hat{\\sigma}_3^{-1}$. These relations will uniquely determine the group structure.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the necessary symbolic calculations to establish the relations between the group generators.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Galois Group of L/Q by finding the relations\n    between the generators of the group.\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). sqrt(6) will be derived.\n    sqrt2, sqrt3 = sympy.symbols('sqrt2 sqrt3')\n    sqrt6 = sqrt2 * sqrt3\n\n    # Define delta = (2+sqrt(2))*(3+sqrt(3))\n    delta = (2 + sqrt2) * (3 + sqrt3)\n\n    # Define the automorphisms of the base field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    def sigma_2(expr):\n        \"\"\"Automorphism: sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> sqrt(3)\"\"\"\n        return expr.subs({sqrt2: -sqrt2, sqrt6: -sqrt6})\n\n    def sigma_3(expr):\n        \"\"\"Automorphism: sqrt(2) -> sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\"\"\"\n        return expr.subs({sqrt3: -sqrt3, sqrt6: -sqrt6})\n\n    # The extension L/K is generated by gamma = sqrt(delta).
