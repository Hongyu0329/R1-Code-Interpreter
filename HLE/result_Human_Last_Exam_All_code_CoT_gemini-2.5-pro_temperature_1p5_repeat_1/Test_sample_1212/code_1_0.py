    print("   - If Black responds A1, White plays B2. This also reduces Black's liberties to A3 and A4. Black must play A3, and White captures at A4.")
    print("   In all variations after White plays B1, White can successfully kill the Black group.")

    print("\n2. Other moves are insufficient:")
    print("   - White at A1: Black plays at B1, creating a 'bent four in the corner' shape which is alive.")
    print("   - White at B2: Black plays at B1. This allows Black to form a bulky five shape, which is alive.")
    print("   - White at A3: Black responds at B2. This sequence leads to a 'ko' fight, which is not a guaranteed kill.\n")
