    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to find the pattern in the sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship between terms:** I'll check for a rule of the form `next_number = constant * current_number Â± something`. A multiplication factor of 2 seems promising.\n    *   `2 * 2 = 4`\n    *   `2 * 11 = 22`\n    *   `2 * 23 = 46`\n    *   `2 * 51 = 102`\n3.  **Refine the relationship:** The next number is always slightly more than twice the current number. Let's see by how much. The rule appears to be `next_number = 2 * current_number + C`, where `C` is a changing addend.\n    *   `11 -> 23`: `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`. So, the addend `C` is 1.\n    *   `23 -> 51`: `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`. So, the addend `C` is 5.\n    *   `51 -> 119`: `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`. So, the addend `C` is 17.\n    *   Note: The first step `2 -> 11` doesn't fit this pattern perfectly (`11 = 2 * 2 + 7`), which is common in such puzzles. We will assume the pattern starts from the second term.\n4.  **Find the pattern in the addends:** The sequence of addends we found is `[1, 5, 17]`. Let's find the pattern here.\n    *   Look at the differences between these addends:\n        *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n        *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n5.  **Identify the sub-pattern:** The differences are `[4, 12]`. This is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n6.  **Predict the next terms:**\n    *   The next difference in the addend sequence will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next addend (`C`) will be the previous addend plus this new difference: `17 + 36 = 53`.\n7.  **Calculate the final answer:** Now we can apply our rule to the last number in the original sequence, 119.\n    *   `next_number = 2 * 119 + 53`\n    *   `next_number = 238 + 53 = 291`\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying the underlying pattern.\n    The pattern is found to be x_{n+1} = 2 * x_n + C_n, where the sequence of addends C_n\n    follows its own geometric progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    # 1. We assume the pattern is x_{n+1} = 2 * x_n + C_n and find the addends C.\n    # The pattern appears to start consistently from the second term.\n    c1 = s[2] - 2 * s[1]  # 23 - 2*11 = 1\n    c2 = s[3] - 2 * s[2]  # 51 - 2*23 = 5\n    c3 = s[4] - 2 * s[3]  # 119 - 2*51 = 17\n    addends = [c1, c2, c3]\n\n    # 2. We find the pattern in the 'addends' sequence [1, 5, 17].\n    # We look at the differences.\n    diff1 = addends[1] - addends[0]  # 5 - 1 = 4\n    diff2 = addends[2] - addends[1]  # 17 - 5 = 12\n\n    # 3. The differences [4, 12] show a geometric progression with a ratio of 3.\n    ratio = diff2 / diff1\n\n    # 4. We predict the next difference and the next addend.\n    next_diff = diff2 * ratio\n    next_addend = addends[-1] + next_diff\n\n    # 5. We calculate the next number in the original sequence.\n    last_known_number = s[-1]\n    next_number = 2 * last_known_number + next_addend\n\n    # 6.
