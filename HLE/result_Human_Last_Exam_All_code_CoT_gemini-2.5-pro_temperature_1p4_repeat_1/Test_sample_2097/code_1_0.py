# The problem is to find the minimum magnetization M_z(1) for a number of spins n.
# Based on the analysis, the minimum occurs for n=1.
# The value of M_z(1) for n=1 is given by the expression -10 / pi.

numerator = -10
denominator = math.pi
result = numerator / denominator

print("The minimum magnetization M_z(1) occurs at n_min = 1.")
print("The value is calculated from the expression: numerator / denominator.")
print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")
print(f"Denominator (pi): {denominator}")
print(f"M_z(1) = {numerator} / {math.pi} = {result}")

# Final Answer format
print(f"The final equation is {numerator}/{denominator}")
