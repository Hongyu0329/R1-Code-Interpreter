    alpha = (3 * gamma * (3 * gamma + 1)) / 2

    # Step 3: Define coefficients for the first-order solution x1, derived from
    # the method of multiple scales. These arise from the quadratic nonlinearities.
    # Gamma2 is the coefficient of the e^(2i*w0*t) term.

    # that arises from the interaction of the first-order solution (x1) with the
    # quadratic terms in the equation.

    C3 = (gamma * (3 * gamma + 1) * (3 * gamma + 2)) / 2

    # Step 6: The total coefficient of the term causing the frequency shift is -(K - 3*C3).
    # The factor of 3 arises because the x^3 term produces a secular term 3*C3*A^2*A_bar.
