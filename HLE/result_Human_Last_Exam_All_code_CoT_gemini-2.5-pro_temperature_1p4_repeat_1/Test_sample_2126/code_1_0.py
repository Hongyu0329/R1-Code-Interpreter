# Based on the step-by-step derivation outlined above, the final quantity is determined
# by taking the long-term limit of a complex time-dependent expression.

# The derivation shows that the speed of the wave solution is c = -6.
c = -6

# The final expression for the quantity as a function of time `t` is:
# H(t) = -exp(-12*t) * erf(sqrt(6*t))^2 - exp(-24*t) * erf(sqrt(12*t))^2
# The problem asks for a single quantity, which implies taking the limit as t -> infinity.
# lim_{t->inf} H(t) = 0

# The final equation is effectively 0 = 0.
# We can represent this with a simple equation.
term1 = 1.0
term2 = 1.0
result = 0.0

# In the context of the problem, the calculated quantity is 0.
