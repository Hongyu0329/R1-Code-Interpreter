    # The 12 notes are represented by k = 0, 1, ..., 11.
    # The number of sharps for a major key with tonic k is (7 * k) % 12.
    # This formula correctly handles the user's rule of converting flats to sharps
    # (e.g., F major, k=5, gives (7*5)%12 = 35%12 = 11 sharps, i.e., E-sharp major).

    # Note: Because 7 is coprime to 12, the set of {(7*k)%12 for k=0..11} is a
    # permutation of {0, 1, ..., 11}. Therefore, the sum is simply 0+1+...+11,
    # which is 11 * 12 / 2 = 66. The calculation above confirms this.
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the coefficient for the 'n' term.
    # The problem states we sharp each of the 12 notes 'n' times.
    # According to music theory (and the "do not simplify" rule), each time
    # a tonic is sharped, 7 sharps are added to its key signature.
    # For n sharpenings, this means 7 * n sharps are added per key.
    
    # Since there are 12 keys, the total number of added sharps is 12 * 7 * n.
    n_coefficient = 12 * 7
    
    # Step 3: Assemble and print the final simplified formula.
    # The formula is: Total Sharps = (Sum at n=0) + (Added sharps from n)
