    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a 1D box is determined by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region.\n2.  **State the Formula:** The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is `ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`. The probability density is therefore `P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`.\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to calculate the definite integral of the probability density for the state `n = 2` over the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`. The integral is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n4.  **Execute with Code:** While this integral can be solved analytically, it's more straightforward and less error-prone to use numerical integration. I will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to compute the value of this definite integral. I will set `a=1` for simplicity, as the probability is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a given interval\n    for a specified quantum state in a 1D box.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the constants for the problem\n    n = 2\n    # We can set the length of the box 'a' to 1.0 for simplicity in calculation,\n    # as the probability is a dimensionless quantity.\n    a = 1.0\n    x1 = 0.495 * a\n    x2 = 0.505 * a\n\n    # The integrand is the probability density function, |psi(x)|^2.\n    # |psi_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a)\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # The quad function returns the integral result and an estimated error.\n    probability, _ = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"The probability P is found by integrating the probability density function for n=2\")\n    print(\"from x1 = 0.495a to x2 = 0.505a.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation being solved is:\")\n    print(f\"P = \\u222B[{x1:.3f}a, {x2:.3f}a] (2/a) * sin\\u00b2({n}\\u03c0x/a) dx\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated Probability: {probability}\")\n    \n    # Return the final answer in the specified format\n    return probability\n\n# Run the function and capture the result for the final answer format\nfinal_probability = solve_probability()\nprint(f\"<<<{final_probability}>>>\")\n\n```"
