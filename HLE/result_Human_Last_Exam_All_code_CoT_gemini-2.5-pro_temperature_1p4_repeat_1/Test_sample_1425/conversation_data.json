    "Of course. To find the partition function Z for a system in the grand canonical ensemble using path integrals, we need to express the trace of the density operator as a functional integral over fields in imaginary time. Here is the step-by-step plan for the derivation, which will be implemented in the Python script:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Start with the Definition**: I will begin with the standard definition of the grand canonical partition function, `Z`, in operator formalism: `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]`.\n2.  **Introduce the Path Integral**: I will explain how this operator trace can be rewritten as a path integral over fields (let's use `ψ` for generality) in imaginary time `τ`. The general form is `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S_E)`, where `S_E` is the Euclidean action.\n3.  **Derive the Euclidean Action `S_E`**: The crucial step is to find the correct Euclidean action. I will show how starting from the real-time Lagrangian and incorporating the `-μN` term from the grand canonical Hamiltonian modifies the standard action. The term `-μN` corresponds to `-μψ*ψ` in the Hamiltonian density.\n4.  **Perform Wick Rotation**: I will apply the Wick rotation (`t → -iτ`) to the modified real-time action to obtain the final Euclidean action, `S_E`.\n5.  **Present the Final Result**: The Python script will print out this entire derivation in a clear, step-by-step manner and display the final, complete formula for the partition function `Z` and the Euclidean action `S_E`, explaining each component of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the formula for the grand canonical partition function\n    Z using the path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use UTF-8 encoding for special characters if possible\n    if sys.stdout.encoding.lower() not in ('utf-8', 'utf8'):\n        hbar = 'h_bar'\n        d_tau = 'd_tau'\n        del_tau = 'd/d_tau'\n        psi_star = 'psi*'\n        psi = 'psi'\n        mu = 'mu'\n        beta = 'beta'\n        integral_sign = 'INT'\n    else:\n        hbar = 'ħ'\n        d_tau = 'dτ'\n        del_tau = '∂_τ'\n        psi_star = 'ψ*'\n        psi = 'ψ'\n        mu = 'μ'\n        beta = 'β'\n        integral_sign = '∫'\n\n    print(\"Derivation of the Grand Canonical Partition Function Z via Path Integrals\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Definition in Operator Formalism\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The grand canonical partition function (Z) describes a system at constant temperature (T) and chemical potential ({mu}).
