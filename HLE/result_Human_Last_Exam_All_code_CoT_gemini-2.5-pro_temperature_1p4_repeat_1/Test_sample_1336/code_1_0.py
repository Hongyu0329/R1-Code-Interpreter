    # The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2,p), b, w)
    # for G = SL(2, p) where p > 5 is a prime.
    
    # In the theory of character sheaves, the number of such smooth coverings is equal
    # to the number of characters of the center of the group G, denoted |hat(Z(G))|.
    
    # For any finite abelian group A, the order of its character group is equal to its own order, i.e., |hat(A)| = |A|.
    # So, we need to find the order of the center of G = SL(2, p), |Z(G)|.
    
    # The center Z(G) consists of scalar matrices k*I (where I is the 2x2 identity matrix)
    # that are in SL(2, p). The condition for being in SL(2, p) is that the determinant is 1.
    
    # The determinant of the matrix k*I is k^2. So, we need to find the number of
    # solutions to the equation k^2 = 1 in the finite field F_p.
    
    # The equation is k^2 - 1 = 0, which can be factored as (k - 1)(k + 1) = 0.
    # In a field, this implies k=1 or k=-1.
    
    # These two solutions are distinct if 1 is not congruent to -1 mod p,
    # which means 2 is not congruent to 0 mod p. This is true for all odd primes p.
    # The problem states p > 5, so p is an odd prime.
    
    # Thus, there are exactly two solutions for k.
