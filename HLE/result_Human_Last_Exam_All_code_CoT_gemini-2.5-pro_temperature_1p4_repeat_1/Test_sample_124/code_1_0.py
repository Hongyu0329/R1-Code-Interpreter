    # A: False. Approximate inference can be more efficient.
    # B: False. It is not resilient to high treewidth.
    # C: True. Its nodes are cliques, and it works with their joint distributions.
    # D: False. The premise ("resilient to high treewidth") is false.
    # E: True. High treewidth is the primary cause of impracticality.
    # F: False. Duplicate of D.
    # G: True. This is the correct reason why it's not resilient to high treewidth.
    # H: False. The complexity is exponential, not linear.
    # I: True. Efficiency diminishes exponentially as the largest clique size grows linearly.
    # J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on clique size.
    # L: True. This is a correct consequence of the running intersection property.
