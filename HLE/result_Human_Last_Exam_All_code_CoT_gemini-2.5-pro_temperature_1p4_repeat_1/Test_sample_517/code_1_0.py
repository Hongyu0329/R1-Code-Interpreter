# The problem is a theoretical one about the limit of a probability.
# Based on the analysis, the limit tends to 0.
# The step-by-step reasoning involves mapping the problem to a continuous domain (Brownian motion),
# and then using an inversion transformation z -> 1/z.
#
# Let p_n be the probability we are looking for.
# The reasoning shows that p_n is equal to the probability q_n of a related process
# hitting a target disk B(center=1/n, radius=n^{-5/3}).
#
# The conditioned process is defined to never enter the origin.
# As n -> infinity, the target disk B(1/n, n^{-5/3}) shrinks to the origin.
# The probability of a process that avoids the origin to hit a set that shrinks to the origin must be 0.
# So, the limit is 0.
