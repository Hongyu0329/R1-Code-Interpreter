def solve_recombination_frequency():
    """
    This function models and solves the E. coli recombination frequency problem.

    In interrupted mating, gene transfer starts at an origin (oriT) and proceeds linearly.
    The frequency of recombination for a gene is highest when it's close to the origin
    and decreases with distance.

    Problem statement:
    - Gene order: thr - azi - gal
    - Transfer order: thr+ is transferred first, then azi.
    - This implies the transfer direction is: oriT -> thr -> azi -> gal

    We will model this by assigning arbitrary positions to the genes on a number line
    and calculating a "recombination score" that is higher for locations closer to the origin.
