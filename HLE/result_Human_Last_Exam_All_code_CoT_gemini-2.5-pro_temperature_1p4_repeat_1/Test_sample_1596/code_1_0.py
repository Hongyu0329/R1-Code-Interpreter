  # Based on the mathematical analysis of quaternion properties:
  # A is False: Depends on (n-m), not |m-n|.
  # B is False: General quaternion products are not equal in this way.
  # C is True: A fixed axis is necessary for the relative property.
  # D is False: It encodes a 1D position, not 3D.
  # E is True: The rotation quaternion has a norm of 1, so it's an isometry.
  # F is True: Scalar multiplication is commutative.
  # G is True: Inner products are preserved by the rotation.
  # H is True: This is De Moivre's formula for quaternions with a shared axis.
  # J is True: The rotation quaternions R_m and R_n commute, so their commutator is 0. The zero quaternion is purely imaginary.
  # K is False: The real component is not preserved.
  # L is True: The trace of the left-multiplication matrix is 4 times the real part of the quaternion.
  # M is False: The commutator is zero for any fixed axis, not just a specific one.
  # N is False: The limit is 1, not 1/sqrt(2), as the norm is always 1.
