The number of starting positions is given by the formula `((4*t + 2)^n) / 2`. The provided Python script calculates this value. To run the script, save it as a file (e.g., `solve_game.py`) and execute it from your terminal with integer values for `n` and `t`, for example: `python solve_game.py 201 1`.
