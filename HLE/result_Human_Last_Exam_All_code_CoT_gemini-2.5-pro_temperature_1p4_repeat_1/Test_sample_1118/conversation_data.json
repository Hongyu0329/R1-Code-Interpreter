    "My plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific self-portrait Curt Querner painted in 1933 after his release from the Gestapo.\n2.  I will then research the object he is holding in that portrait and its symbolic meaning in the context of resistance.\n3.  My research indicates the painting is \"Selbstbildnis mit Distel\" (Self-Portrait with a Thistle). A thistle is a prickly plant that can thrive in difficult conditions, making it a powerful symbol of defiance and resilience.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script to state this fact, as requested by the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"after being released from Gestapo custody\"\n    symbol = \"a thistle\"\n    painting_name = \"Self-Portrait with a Thistle\"\n\n    print(f\"In {year}, the painter {artist} created a self-portrait named '{painting_name}' {event}.\")\n    print(f\"In his hand, he holds {symbol}, which is considered a symbol of resistance and defiance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a thistle>>>"
