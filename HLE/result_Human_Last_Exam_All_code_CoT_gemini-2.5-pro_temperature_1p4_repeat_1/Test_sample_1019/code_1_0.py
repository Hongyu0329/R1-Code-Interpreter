# Based on the analysis, the d-threshold for Hamiltonicity is determined by
# the case where eta grows with n, which requires a probability p
# that is proportional to 1/n.
#
# Our detailed analysis of a worst-case graph (an unbalanced complete
# bipartite graph) led to a specific constant of proportionality.
# The calculation was:
# p is approximately 2 / (n - 1)
# For large n, this is approximately 2 / n.

numerator = 2
denominator = n

# The d-threshold for Hamiltonicity in the given range is p = 2/n.
# We print the components of this final equation.
