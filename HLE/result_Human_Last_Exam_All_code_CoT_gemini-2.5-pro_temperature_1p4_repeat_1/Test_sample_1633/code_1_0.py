1.  **Goal:** Transform a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network (L ~ log n) into an ultra-small-world network (L ~ log(log n)).

2.  **Core Implication:** This transformation represents a fundamental shift in the graph's global topology. A WS network's small-world property comes from random "shortcut" edges on top of a regular lattice. An ultra-small-world property requires a more efficient, often hierarchical, structure of shortcuts.

3.  **Required Operations:** To impose a new global structure on a graph of n nodes, it's not enough to modify a small number, o(n), of edges. Doing so would leave the vast majority of the graph as a WS network, and its average path length would remain dominated by the L ~ log(n) characteristic. Therefore, the minimum number of rewiring operations, m(n), must be proportional to the size of the network, n. This means m(n) must be in Omega(n). Since we can't do more than O(n) operations, we can conclude that m(n) is in Theta(n). This supports option (B).

4.  **Analysis of Option H:** Option (H) states that at least n/6 edge removals must come from the original lattice structure. This is a more specific claim but is consistent with m(n) in Theta(n). To create the new structured long-range links, edge "endpoints" must be sourced from somewhere. The most logical source is the dense local connections of the original lattice. Destroying the old local structure is necessary to build the new global one. The constant 1/6 is plausibly linked to the initial vertex degree k0=6 (e.g., related to some critical fraction of edges or nodes that must be altered). This statement requires that a substantial, constant fraction of the graph's original backbone be re-engineered.

5.  **Elimination of Other Options:**
    *   (D, F, J) are contradicted by fundamental constraints (degree sum, degree max).
    *   (I, K) are contradicted by the problem definition (path length must change).
    *   Other options making "must" claims about specific structures (like a tree) are too restrictive; other structures might also work.

6.  **Conclusion:** Both (B) and (H) are plausible. (H) is a stronger statement that implies (B). Given that the problem parameters (like k0=6) are specific, it is likely that the specific constant in (H) is derivable and intended as part of the solution. The process must fundamentally alter the local lattice structure, making H a very strong candidate for a correct statement.
