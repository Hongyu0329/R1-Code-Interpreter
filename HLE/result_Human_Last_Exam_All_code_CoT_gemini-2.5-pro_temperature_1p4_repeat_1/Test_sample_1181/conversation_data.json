    "This is a knowledge-based question. To solve it using code, I will create a simple knowledge base as a Python dictionary. In this dictionary, the keys will be the characters' names, and the values will be a brief description of them, including the key detail from the question. The script will then iterate through the characters to find the one whose description contains the phrase \"leaves rustling\" and print the corresponding name and answer choice.\n\nThis plan follows these steps:\n1.  Create a dictionary mapping each character's name to a description of their role and sentiments.\n2.  Define the specific detail we are searching for: missing the \"leaves rustling\".\n3.  Loop through the characters in our knowledge base.\n4.  Check if a character's description contains the search phrase.\n5.  Once the correct character is found, print a step-by-step breakdown of the finding, formatted to resemble a logical equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the trivia question by searching a small,\n    pre-defined knowledge base about the characters in the movie Solaris.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Create a knowledge base of the characters and key facts.\n    knowledge_base = {\n        \"Kris\": \"The protagonist, a psychologist sent to investigate the Solaris station.\",\n        \"Hari\": \"Kris's deceased wife, recreated by the Solaris ocean.\",\n        \"Snaut\": \"A cyberneticist on the station who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\",\n        \"Sartorius\": \"A cold, rationalist biologist on the station.\",\n        \"Gibarian\": \"Kris's colleague who died by suicide before his arrival.\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define the answer choices provided.\n    answer_choices = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n    \n    # Step 3: Define the key phrase from the question to search for.\n    search_phrase = \"leaves rustling\"\n\n    # Step 4: Search the knowledge base for the character matching the phrase.\n    correct_character_name = None\n    correct_option = None\n    for option, name in answer_choices.items():\n        if search_phrase in knowledge_base[name]:\n            correct_character_name = name\n            correct_option = option\n            break\n\n    # Step 5: Output the result in a clear, step-by-step format.\n    if correct_character_name:\n        print(f\"Finding the character ashamed to miss the sound of '{search_phrase}'...\")\n        print(f\"Analysis: The description for the character '{correct_character_name}' contains the key phrase.\")\n        print(f\"Logical Equation: Character('{correct_character_name}') + Fact('misses {search_phrase}') = Answer('{correct_option}')\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The character could not be found in the knowledge base.\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
