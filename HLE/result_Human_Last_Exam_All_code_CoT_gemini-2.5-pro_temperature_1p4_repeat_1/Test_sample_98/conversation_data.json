    "An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each face is an equilateral triangle.\n\n1.  **Symmetry is Key:** The icosahedron is a centrally symmetric shape. This means that for any point on its surface, there is an identical point on the opposite side, equidistant from the center. All Platonic solids (including the icosahedron) have this property.\n\n2.  **Orientation:** The tank is standing on one of its triangular faces. This face is horizontal. Because of the icosahedron's symmetry, there is another triangular face on the exact opposite side (the \"top\") which is parallel to the base.\n\n3.  **Half-Full Condition:** For any centrally symmetric object, any plane passing through its center of symmetry bisects its volume. Since the tank is half-full with water, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n4.  **The Shape of the Cross-Section:** The question now becomes: \"What is the shape of the cross-section when you slice an icosahedron through its center with a plane that is parallel to one of its faces?\" The plane at the center, parallel to the top and bottom faces, will intersect 6 of the other faces of the icosahedron. Due to the high degree of symmetry, these intersections form a **regular hexagon**.\n\nThe Python code below will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tank_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the shape of the water surface\n    in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on one face.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # An icosahedron is a centrally symmetric polyhedron.\n    # When it's half-full, the water level is a plane passing through its center.\n    # When an icosahedron stands on one face, this central plane is parallel to the base.\n    # The cross-section of an icosahedron through its center and parallel to a face is a regular hexagon.\n    \n    shape = \"A regular hexagon\"\n    \n    print(f\"The shape of the water surface will be: {shape}\")\n\nsolve_tank_problem()\n```\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
