    "Of course. Here is my analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Plan for Complexity Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Operation**: The computational work of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm is primarily done inside the `while q > 0` loop. Therefore, the overall time complexity will be determined by the number of times this loop executes.\n2.  **Analyze the Loop's Behavior**: We need to understand how the loop variable `q` changes. It is initialized to `q := ⌊n/c⌋`. Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and the new `q` is calculated as `q := ⌊x/c⌋`. In essence, the value of the number being processed (`x`) is divided by the base `c` in each iteration.\n3.  **Count the Iterations**: The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. This is equivalent to asking \"How many times can we divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0?\". This process is logarithmic. The number of iterations will be `⌊log_c(n)⌋`. For example, converting `n=100` to base `c=10` requires `log₁₀(100) = 2` divisions.\n4.  **Analyze Work per Iteration**: The operations inside the loop are `i := i + 1`, `x := q`, `q := ⌊x/c⌋`, and `a_i := x - qc`. For standard integer sizes that fit in a computer's processor, integer division, multiplication, and assignment are considered constant time operations, i.e., `O(1)`.\n5.  **Calculate Total Complexity**: The total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the cost of each iteration. This gives us:\n    *Time = (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration)*\n    *Time = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n))*\n6.  **Simplify in Big-O Notation**: In Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm is considered a constant factor and is typically omitted, because `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Thus, the complexity is written as `O(log n)`.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this analysis by counting the loop iterations for given inputs `n` and `c` and comparing it to the theoretical `log_c(n)` value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_imag_complexity(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    It counts the loop iterations required to convert n to base c and prints\n    the complexity analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(c, int) and n >= 0 and c >= 2):\n        print(\"Error: Input must be integers n, c, where n >= 0 and c >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # Let's trace the algorithm to count the loop iterations.\n    x = n\n    q = x // c\n    \n    loop_iterations = 0\n    \n    # The 'while' loop is the core of the algorithm's complexity.\n    while q > 0:\n        loop_iterations += 1\n        x = q\n        q = x // c\n        \n    print(f\"Analysis for IMAG(n={n}, c={c}):\")\n    print(f\"The 'while' loop executed {loop_iterations} times.\")\n    \n    # The number of iterations is related to log_c(n).\n    # The loop runs floor(log_c(n)) times for n >= c.\n    if n >= c:\n        log_c_n = math.log(n, c)\n        theoretical_iterations = math.floor(log_c_n)\n        print(f\"The value of log_{c}({n}) is approximately {log_c_n:.4f}.\")\n        print(f\"The theoretical number of iterations, floor(log_c(n)), is {theoretical_iterations}.\")\n    else: # Case where 0 <= n < c\n        print(\"Since n < c, the initial quotient 'q' is 0, so the loop does not run.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Complexity Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"The number of loop iterations is proportional to log_c(n).\")\n    print(\"Since the operations inside the loop are constant time (O(1)), the total time complexity is determined by the number of iterations.\")\n    print(\"The final complexity equation is: T(n) = O(log n)\")\n    \n    # Printing each component of the final equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation Components:\")\n    print(\"O\", \"(\", \"log\", \"n\", \")\")\n\n# --- Example Execution ---\n# You can change these values to test different scenarios.\nn_value = 1000\nc_value = 2\nanalyze_imag_complexity(n_value, c_value)\n```\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
