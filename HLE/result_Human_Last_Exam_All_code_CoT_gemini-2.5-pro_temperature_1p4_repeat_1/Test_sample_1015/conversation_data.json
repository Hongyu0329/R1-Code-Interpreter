    "Of course. My plan is to use a Python script to methodically analyze each answer choice regarding the differences in a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods. The script will store the reasoning for each choice and then print a step-by-step evaluation to determine the most accurate answer. This approach ensures all options are considered before reaching a final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical differences between Vaganova and Balanchine\n    methods for a cambré derrière and identifies the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    analysis = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect. While stylistic differences in arm placement can exist, the fundamental technical difference that defines the movement's quality and shape lies elsewhere.\",\n        'B': \"Correct. This is the primary technical difference. In the Vaganova method, the dancer must keep the hips square and stable directly over the supporting legs. In the Balanchine style, the dancer often pushes the hips forward to allow for a deeper, more extreme backbend.\",\n        'C': \"Incorrect. While Balanchine's choreography is often characterized by greater speed, the tempo of the movement is a musical or stylistic choice, not the core technical difference in how the cambré itself is executed.\",\n        'D': \"Incorrect. A greater degree of backbend is a *result* of the Balanchine technique, not the cause. It is achieved *because* of the difference in hip placement.\",\n        'E': \"Incorrect. Like the degree of the backbend, a more extreme head placement is a stylistic result of the deeper bend allowed in the Balanchine method, not the foundational technical cause of the difference.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods:\\n\")\n    final_answer = ''\n    for key in choices:\n        print(f\"Option {key}: {choices[key]}\")\n        print(f\"Analysis: {analysis[key]}\\n\")\n        if \"Correct\" in analysis[key]:\n            final_answer = key\n\n    print(f\"The final conclusion is that the most significant difference is the '{choices[final_answer]}'.\")\n\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```"
