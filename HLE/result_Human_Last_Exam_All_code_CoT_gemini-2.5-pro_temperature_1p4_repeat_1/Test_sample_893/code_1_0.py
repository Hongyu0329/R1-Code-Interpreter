    Solves the six problems about maximal elements in partially ordered sets.
    The reasoning for each case is as follows:

    A) N: For any H-free graph G, the disjoint union with an isolated vertex is also H-free and larger. No maximal element exists.
    B) D: A finite set S can be empty (no maximal element) or non-empty (has a maximal element).
    C) D: The set of natural numbers N is countable but has no maximal element. The set {-n | n in N} is countable and has one.
    D) Y: There are no uncountable discrete subsets of R. The statement is vacuously true.
    E) Y: The order is `a <= b` if `b` is a subsequence of `a`. Constant sequences are maximal elements.
    F) N: The order is `a <= b` if `a` is a subsequence of `b`. For any sequence `m`, `m` is a proper subsequence of `(0, m_1, m_2, ...)` so nothing is maximal.

    The final combined answer is NDDYFN.
