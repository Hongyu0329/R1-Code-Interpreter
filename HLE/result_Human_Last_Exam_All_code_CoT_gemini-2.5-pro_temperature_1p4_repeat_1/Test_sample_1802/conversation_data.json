    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible rank for the complementary channel `Λ^c` of a Pauli channel `Λ` that acts on a `d`-dimensional quantum system (a qudit).\n\n2.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel `Λ` is defined by its action on a density matrix `ρ`:\n    `Λ(ρ) = Σᵢ pᵢ Uᵢ ρ Uᵢ†`\n    *   `ρ` is the `d x d` density matrix of the qudit.\n    *   `{Uᵢ}` is a set of `N` distinct generalized Pauli operators. For a `d`-dimensional system, there are `d²` such operators in total.\n    *   `pᵢ` are probabilities (`pᵢ > 0` and `Σ pᵢ = 1`). The number `N` represents how many operators are included in the channel's definition with a non-zero probability.\n\n3.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** The complementary channel `Λ^c` describes the evolution of the state of the environment that the system interacts with. A key result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel `Λ^c` is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix `G` constructed from the channel's Kraus operators.\n\n4.  **Kraus Operators and the Gram Matrix:**\n    *   The Kraus operators `Eᵢ` for the Pauli channel `Λ` can be written as `Eᵢ = √pᵢ Uᵢ` for `i = 1, ..., N`.\n    *   The Gram matrix `G` is an `N x N` matrix with entries defined by the trace inner product: `Gᵢⱼ = Tr(Eᵢ Eⱼ†)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Gram Matrix and its Rank:**\n    *   Let's substitute the Kraus operators into the Gram matrix definition:\n        `Gᵢⱼ = Tr( (√pᵢ Uᵢ) * (√pⱼ Uⱼ)† ) = √(pᵢpⱼ) * Tr(Uᵢ Uⱼ†)`\n    *   The set of all `d²` generalized Pauli operators forms an orthogonal basis for the space of `d x d` matrices. This orthogonality means that `Tr(Uᵢ Uⱼ†) = d * δᵢⱼ`, which is `d` if `i=j` and `0` if `i≠j`.\n    *   Substituting this orthogonality relation back into the Gram matrix equation gives:\n        `Gᵢⱼ = √(pᵢpⱼ) * d * δᵢⱼ`\n    *   This result shows that `G` is an `N x N` diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries `d*p₁, d*p₂, ..., d*pₙ`.\n    *   Since all probabilities `pᵢ` are non-zero by definition, all `N` diagonal entries of `G` are non-zero. Therefore, the rank of the matrix `G` is exactly `N`.\n\n6.  **Find the Maximal Rank:**\n    *   We have established that `rank(Λ^c) = rank(G) = N`. `N` is the number of Pauli operators with non-zero probabilities used to define the channel.\n    *   To find the *maximal* rank of `Λ^c`, we must find the maximum possible value for `N`.\n    *   The total number of distinct Pauli operators available for a `d`-dimensional system is `d²`. A Pauli channel can, in principle, involve all of them.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum value `N` can take is `d²`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a `d`-dimensional system is `d²`. The provided Python code will calculate this value for an example dimension.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel\n    for a qudit of a given dimension 'd'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension 'd' of the qudit system.\n    # For a standard qubit, d=2.
