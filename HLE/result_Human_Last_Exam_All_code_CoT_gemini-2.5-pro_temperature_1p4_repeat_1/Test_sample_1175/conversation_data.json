    "This is a multi-step problem. First, we need to solve the first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE), and then use the solution to calculate the value of the given expression.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Solve the ODE:** The equation $x_{3}'(t) + \\tanh(t) x_{3}(t) = e^{-\\frac{t}{3}}$ is a first-order linear ODE. We can solve it using the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is $I(t) = e^{\\int P(t) dt}$, where $P(t) = \\tanh(t)$.\n2.  **Apply Initial Condition:** Use the given initial condition $x_3(0) = 5$ to find the constant of integration and get the particular solution for $x_3(t)$.\n3.  **Evaluate the Expression:** The main task is to evaluate $(10^{5} + 10^{-5})x_{3}(\\ln10^{5}) + \\frac{3}{4}10^{\\frac{-20}{3}}$. We will substitute the solution $x_3(t)$ into this expression.\n4.  **Simplify:** A key step in the simplification is to notice the relationship between the hyperbolic cosine function and the terms in the expression. Specifically, for $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$, we have $2\\cosh(t_0) = e^{t_0} + e^{-t_0} = 10^5 + 10^{-5}$. This relationship will lead to significant cancellations.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** After simplification, we will be left with a much simpler expression to calculate.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, explaining each step of the simplification and then computing the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_and_evaluate():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by explaining the simplification steps and calculating the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The user wants to evaluate the expression (10**5 + 10**-5) * x_3(ln(10**5)) + (3/4) * 10**(-20/3)\")\n    print(\"where x_3(t) is the solution to the differential equation x_3'(t) + tanh(t) * x_3(t) = exp(-t/3) with x_3(0) = 5.\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Solve the differential equation.\")\n    print(\"The ODE is a first-order linear differential equation.
