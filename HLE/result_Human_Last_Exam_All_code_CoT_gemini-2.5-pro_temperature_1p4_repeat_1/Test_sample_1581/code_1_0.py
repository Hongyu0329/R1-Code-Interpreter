def find_homeomorphism_classes():
    """
    Solves for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a space X with a given property.

    The problem states that X is a compact connected metric space, and for some n >= 2,
    the configuration space of n distinct points in X is disconnected.

    The argument proceeds as follows:
    1. A fundamental theorem in topology states that for a compact connected metric space X,
       the 2-point configuration space C_2(X) is disconnected if and only if X is an arc
       (a space homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1]).

    2. If X is an arc, its n-point configuration space C_n(X) is disconnected for all n >= 2.
       This is because the ordering of points along the arc cannot be changed continuously
       without points colliding. Thus, the arc is a valid type of space.

    3. If X is not an arc, its 2-point configuration space C_2(X) is connected. It can be
       shown that this implies C_n(X) is also connected for all n > 2. This is because
       a space that is not an arc contains more complex features (like loops or branch points)
       that provide enough "room" to maneuver points around each other.

    4. Therefore, the condition given in the problem is equivalent to X being an arc.

    5. All arcs are homeomorphic to the unit interval [0,1]. This means they all belong to
       a single homeomorphism class.

    The number of such classes is therefore 1.
