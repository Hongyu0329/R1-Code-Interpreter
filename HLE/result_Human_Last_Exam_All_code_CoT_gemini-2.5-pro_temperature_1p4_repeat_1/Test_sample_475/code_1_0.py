    Calculates the total charge on the droplet based on a simplified model.
    
    The reasoning for the simplification is that the original formula is likely intractable
    and contains red herrings. The provided parameters and context clues point towards
    a simpler, solvable problem where the complex part of the charge density
    is replaced by a constant derived from omega = W(1).
