# The user wants to identify the best solution from a list of choices.
# The problem outlines four specific cybersecurity requirements that the solution must meet:
# 1. Prevent spoofing and replay attacks.
# 2. Prevent authentication from a coerced (unwilling) user.
# 3. Remain secure even if biometric data is stolen.
# 4. Apply to a wide range of biometric modalities.

# Let's analyze the options based on these four criteria as described in the prompt.

# A. Multi-Factor Biometric Authentication: Fails on coercion and data theft.
# B. Differential Privacy: Fails on spoofing and coercion.
# C. Zero-Knowledge Biometric Proof: Fails on coercion.
# D. Liveness Detection: Fails on coercion and data theft.
# E. AI Anomaly Detection: Fails on data theft protection.
# F. Challenge-Response Protocols: Fails on coercion and data theft.
# G. Blockchain-Based Biometrics: Fails on spoofing and coercion.
# H. Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication: Fails on data theft protection.
# I. Strong Multi-Factor Authentication: A strong contender, but coercion is only addressed by a claim of handling "duress scenarios," which might require extra features.
# J. Cryptographic Hashing & Salting: Fails on spoofing and coercion.
# K. Quantum Key Distribution: Fails on spoofing, coercion, and data-at-rest protection.
# L. Quantum Key Distribution (variant): Same failures as K.
# M. Revocable Fuzzy Biometric Vaults: Fails on spoofing and coercion.

# N. FIPS 140-3 Level 5 Module: This option is described as a comprehensive solution.
# - Requirement 1 (Spoofing/Replay): Yes, its description says it protects against "biometric spoofing" and "replay attacks".
# - Requirement 2 (Coercion): Yes, its description says it protects against "coercion".
# - Requirement 3 (Data Theft): Yes, its description mentions "quantum-resistant cryptography", "hardware security enclaves", "zeroization", and "real-time revocation", offering the strongest protection for stored data.
# - Requirement 4 (Multi-Modal): Yes, as an integrated module, it can be applied to any biometric system.

# The description for option N explicitly lists protections for every requirement mentioned in the challenge,
# making it the most complete and correct solution presented.

print("Implement a FIPS 140-3 Level 5 compliant cryptographic module integrated with biometric authentication, featuring advanced tamper detection and response mechanisms, secure boot, and zeroization protocols. The module uses quantum-resistant cryptography to protect biometric data at rest and in transit, and hardware security enclaves with multi-layer physical barriers to prevent unauthorized access. The system actively monitors for any physical or logical tampering, instantly rendering the device inoperable if a breach is detected. This solution ensures complete compliance with the most stringent security standards, safeguarding against all known and potential threats, including coercion, replay attacks, biometric spoofing, and advanced adversarial AI manipulation. Furthermore, the architecture supports real-time revocation and reconfiguration of biometric credentials, ensuring that even if compromised, a full system reset can be securely performed without losing integrity or usability.")
