    # --- Step 1 & 2: Derive the equation for Characteristic Capacitance ---
    # The condition that the equivalent capacitance is independent of the number of cells (N)
    # means that the ladder network must be terminated by its own characteristic capacitance.
    # Let this characteristic capacitance be 'x'.
    #
    # We can find a recurrence relation for the capacitance of the ladder.
    # Consider one cell: two series capacitors 'c' and one shunt capacitor 'c'.
    # If this cell is loaded with a capacitance C_load, the shunt 'c' is in parallel
    # with C_load, giving a total shunt capacitance of C_p = c + C_load.
    #
    # Circuit analysis (e.g., nodal analysis) shows the input capacitance C_in is:
    # C_in = (c**2 + c*C_load) / (3*c + 2*C_load)
    #
    # To find the characteristic capacitance, we set C_in = C_load = x.
    # This gives the fixed-point equation:
    equation = sympy.Eq(x, (c**2 + c*x) / (3*c + 2*x))

    # --- Step 3: Solve the equation for x ---
    # Rearranging the equation yields a quadratic equation for x:
    # x * (3*c + 2*x) = c**2 + c*x
    # 3*c*x + 2*x**2 = c**2 + c*x
    # 2*x**2 + 2*c*x - c**2 = 0
    quadratic_eq = 2*x**2 + 2*c*x - c**2

    # Capacitance must be a positive value. We filter for the positive solution.

        # We can check if the symbolic expression is positive by substituting a positive value for c.
