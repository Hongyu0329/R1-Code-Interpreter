    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will factor the given polynomial $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  Next, I will determine the Galois group for each irreducible factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  Based on the Galois groups of the factors, I will determine the Galois group $G$ of the splitting field $K$ of the original polynomial $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The order of this group, $|G|$, is the degree of the extension $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n4.  According to the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, there is a correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ (with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subseteq L \\subseteq K$) and subgroups of $G$. Furthermore, an intermediate field $L$ is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if its corresponding subgroup is a normal subgroup of $G$. The degree of such an extension, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, is equal to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n5.  The problem asks for the degrees of all *proper* normal extensions, so we need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ (i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$).\n6.  Finally, I will compute the indices for all these normal subgroups to find the set of all possible degrees.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this plan. I use the `sympy` library for polynomial factorization and to represent mathematical values symbolically. The core of the argument, which involves group theory, is explained in the comments within the code.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_field_extension_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the degrees of intermediate normal field extensions\n    for the splitting field of the given polynomial over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define and factor the polynomial\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    poly = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Factor the polynomial.\")\n    print(f\"The given polynomial is P(x) = {poly}\")\n    \n    # Factor the polynomial over the rational numbers\n    factors = sympy.factor(poly)\n    print(f\"The factorization of P(x) over Q is: {factors}\\n\")\n    \n    f1 = factors.args[0]\n    f2 = factors.args[1]\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the Galois groups of the factors.\")\n    # For f1 = x^2 - 2, the splitting field is Q(sqrt(2)).\n    # The Galois group is the cyclic group of order 2, C_2.\n    gal_f1_order = 2\n    print(f\"The Galois group of {f1} is C_2, with order {gal_f1_order}.\")\n    \n    # For f2 = x^5 - 9x + 3, the polynomial is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion (p=3).\n    # A calculus check shows it has 3 real roots and 2 complex roots.\n    # An irreducible quintic with 3 real roots has Galois group S_5 (the symmetric group on 5 elements).\n    gal_f2_order = sympy.factorial(5)\n    print(f\"The Galois group of {f2} is S_5, with order {gal_f2_order}.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the Galois Group of the Splitting Field K/Q\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the Galois group G of the splitting field K/Q.\")\n    # The splitting field K is the composite of the splitting fields of the factors.\n    # The intersection of these fields is Q, as one is real and the other's quadratic subfield is imaginary.\n    # Therefore, the Galois group G = Gal(K/Q) is the direct product C_2 x S_5.\n    G_order = gal_f1_order * gal_f2_order\n    print(f\"The Galois group G is C_2 x S_5, with order |G| = {gal_f1_order} * {gal_f2_order} = {G_order}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Find degrees of intermediate normal extensions\n    print(\"Step 4: Find possible degrees of intermediate normal extensions.\")\n    print(\"The degrees correspond to the indices [G:H] of proper, non-trivial normal subgroups H of G.\")\n    print(\"The normal subgroups of G = C_2 x S_5 and their indices |G|/|H| are calculated below.\\n\")\n    \n    degrees = set()\n    \n    # The normal subgroups of C_2 are {e} and C_2.\n    # The normal subgroups of S_5 are {e}, A_5, and S_5.\n    \n    # Product subgroups H = N1 x N2\n    # Case 1: H = {e} x A_5\n    h_order_1 = 1 * 60\n    index_1 = G_order // h_order_1\n    degrees.add(index_1)\n    print(f\"For H = {{e}} x A_5, the degree is |G|/|H| = {G_order} / {h_order_1} = {index_1}\")\n\n    # Case 2: H = {e} x S_5\n    h_order_2 = 1 * 120\n    index_2 = G_order // h_order_2\n    degrees.add(index_2)\n    print(f\"For H = {{e}} x S_5, the degree is |G|/|H| = {G_order} / {h_order_2} = {index_2}\")\n    \n    # Case 3: H = C_2 x {e}\n    h_order_3 = 2 * 1\n    index_3 = G_order // h_order_3\n    degrees.add(index_3)\n    print(f\"For H = C_2 x {{e}}, the degree is |G|/|H| = {G_order} / {h_order_3} = {index_3}\")\n\n    # Case 4: H = C_2 x A_5\n    h_order_4 = 2 * 60\n    index_4 = G_order // h_order_4\n    degrees.add(index_4)\n    print(f\"For H = C_2 x A_5, the degree is |G|/|H| = {G_order} / {h_order_4} = {index_4}\")\n\n    # \"Diagonal\" subgroup\n    # This subgroup arises from the isomorphism between quotient groups C_2/{e} and S_5/A_5.\n    # Case 5: The diagonal normal subgroup H_diag\n    h_order_5 = 120\n    index_5 = G_order // h_order_5\n    degrees.add(index_5)\n    print(f\"For the diagonal normal subgroup H_diag, the degree is |G|/|H| = {G_order} / {h_order_5} = {index_5}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Final Answer ---\n    sorted_degrees = sorted(list(degrees))\n    print(\"The set of possible degrees is the collection of the unique indices calculated above.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The possible degrees are {sorted_degrees}.\")\n\nsolve_field_extension_degrees()\n```\n<<<[2, 4, 120]>>>"
