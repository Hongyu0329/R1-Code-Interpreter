# Step 6: Solve for the smaller radius r, where the larger radius is R=2.
# The ratio of consecutive radii is k = 3 + 2*sqrt(2).
# r = R / k = 2 / (3 + 2*sqrt(2)) which simplifies to 6 - 4*sqrt(2).
r = 6 - 4 * math.sqrt(2)

# Step 7: Calculate r^2.
# r_squared = (6 - 4*sqrt(2))^2
# r_squared = 6^2 - 2*6*(4*sqrt(2)) + (4*sqrt(2))^2
# r_squared = 36 - 48*sqrt(2) + 16*2
# r_squared = 36 - 48*sqrt(2) + 32
# r_squared = 68 - 48*sqrt(2)
r_squared = r**2

# Output the calculation steps as requested.
