    # Analysis of the statements about the parameterized problems PDecide and PCount.

    # PDecide is the decision problem for finding one of three structures:
    # 1. k-clique
    # 2. induced k-matching
    # 3. induced k-by-k-biclique

    # PCount is the corresponding counting problem.

    # Statement A: PDecide is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).
    # The problem of finding a k-clique is a component of PDecide.
    # k-CLIQUE is a canonical W[1]-hard problem.
    # A problem containing a W[1]-hard component is generally not FPT (unless FPT=W[1]).
    # Therefore, Statement A is False.
    is_A_true = False

    # Statement B: PDecide is W[1]-hard.
    # Since k-CLIQUE is W[1]-hard, and it is a subproblem of PDecide,
    # PDecide is also W[1]-hard. A reduction can be made from k-CLIQUE to PDecide.
    # Therefore, Statement B is True.
    is_B_true = True

    # Statement C: PCount is fixed-parameter tractable.
    # If PCount were FPT, one could solve PDecide in FPT time by checking if the
    # count is greater than zero. This would contradict PDecide being W[1]-hard.
    # Therefore, Statement C is False.
    is_C_true = False

    # Statement D: PCount is #W[1]-hard.
    # The counting version of k-CLIQUE, #k-CLIQUE, is #W[1]-hard.
    # PCount computes a sum that includes the number of k-cliques.
    # The #k-CLIQUE problem can be reduced to PCount, making PCount #W[1]-hard.
    # Therefore, Statement D is True.
