    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set is not a single value; it depends on the specific atoms that make up a molecule. The notation `6-311G**` tells us the rules for constructing the basis set for each atom.\n\nHere is my plan to provide a useful answer:\n1.  First, I will explain what the `6-311G**` notation means for different types of atoms (specifically, Hydrogen vs. other \"heavy\" atoms).\n2.  I will then provide a Python script that calculates the total number of primitive Gaussians for any given molecular formula.\n3.  The script will use a dictionary containing the number of primitives for each element (from Hydrogen to Argon), based on data from the reliable Basis Set Exchange library. This is more accurate than trying to derive the rules from scratch.\n4.  Since you didn't specify a molecule, the script will use methane (`CH4`) as a clear and common example.\n5.  The output of the script will show the breakdown of the calculation, including each number used in the final equation as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_primitives(formula: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions for a given\n    molecule with the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of primitive Gaussians for each element in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    # The name is shorthand:\n    # - For H and He, it's 6-311G**.\n    # - For all other atoms (Li-Ar), it's 6-311G*.\n    # Data is sourced from the Basis Set Exchange (bse.pnl.gov).\n    primitive_counts = {\n        'H': 8, 'He': 8,\n        'Li': 17, 'Be': 17,\n        'B': 32, 'C': 32, 'N': 32, 'O': 32, 'F': 32, 'Ne': 32,\n        'Na': 42, 'Mg': 42,\n        'Al': 51, 'Si': 51, 'P': 51, 'S': 51, 'Cl': 51, 'Ar': 51,\n    }\n\n    # Use a regular expression to find all atoms and their optional counts\n    atoms_found = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    \n    if not atoms_found:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse the formula '{formula}'.
