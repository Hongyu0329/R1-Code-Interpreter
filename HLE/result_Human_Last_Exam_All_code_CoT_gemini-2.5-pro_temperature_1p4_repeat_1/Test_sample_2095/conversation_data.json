    "My plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the historical source containing Liu Ban's (刘攽) evaluation of Zhang Ji's (张籍) poetry. This involves searching through classical Chinese literary criticism, specifically \"poetry talks\" (诗话, shihua) from the Song Dynasty.\n2.  The most authoritative source for this is Liu Ban's own work, *Zhongshan Shi Hua* (《中山诗话》).\n3.  I will then extract the exact original phrase Liu Ban used to describe Zhang Ji's seven-character poems.\n4.  To provide a comprehensive answer, I will also include a brief explanation of this classical phrase in modern Chinese.\n5.  Finally, I will present this complete answer within a Python script that uses the `print()` function, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_evaluation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's poetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    source = \"北宋的刘攽在其《中山诗话》中\"\n    evaluation_of = \"对张籍的七言诗的精确评价是：\"\n    quote = \"“拙多于巧，然意地有可爱者。”\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n这句话的意思是：张籍的七言诗在风格和技巧上显得质朴笨拙多于华丽灵巧，但是其诗歌所蕴含的意境和立意却有非常值得欣赏和喜爱的地方。\"\"\"\n\n    full_answer = f\"\"\"{source}，{evaluation_of}\n\n{quote}\n{explanation}\"\"\"\n    print(full_answer)\n\nget_evaluation()\n```\n<<<拙多于巧，然意地有可爱者。>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
