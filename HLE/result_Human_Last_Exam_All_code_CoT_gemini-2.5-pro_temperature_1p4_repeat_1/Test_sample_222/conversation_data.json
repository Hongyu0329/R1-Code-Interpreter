    "To find the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the interleaved sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`, we can use the principles of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), specifically the decimation-in-time algorithm. This method allows us to compute the desired 8-point DFT, let's call it `Y(k)`, by using the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\nThe new 8-point sequence `y(n)` is constructed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `y(2n) = x(n)`\n*   `y(2n+1) = h(n)`\nfor `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThe 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be calculated from `X(k)` and `H(k)` using the following \"butterfly\" formulas, which are fundamental to the FFT algorithm:\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\nwhere `W_8^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\nThe Python code below implements these formulas. It calculates each of the 8 points of `Y(k)` and prints the equation used for each calculation, showing how the final values are obtained from the components `X(k)` and the weighted `H(k)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_complex_number(c):\n    \"\"\"A helper function to format complex numbers for clean printing.\"\"\"\n    # Round to 5 decimal places to handle floating point inaccuracies\n    c = np.round(c, 5)\n    if c.imag == 0:\n        return f\"{c.real}\"\n    if c.real == 0:\n        if c.imag == 1:\n            return \"j\"\n        elif c.imag == -1:\n            return \"-j\"\n        else:\n            return f\"{c.imag}j\"\n    \n    sign = '+' if c.imag > 0 else '-'\n    # Avoid printing '1.0j' and just print 'j'\n    imag_val = abs(c.imag)\n    imag_str = f\"{imag_val}j\"\n    if imag_val == 1:\n        imag_str = \"j\"\n\n    return f\"{c.real} {sign} {imag_str}\"\n\n# Given 4-point DFTs\nX = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\nH = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n\n# Arrays to store intermediate and final results\nY = np.zeros(8, dtype=complex)\ntemp_terms = np.zeros(4, dtype=complex)\n\n# Calculate Y(k) and Y(k+4) for k=0,1,2,3\nfor k in range(4):\n    w_8_k = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / 8)\n    temp_terms[k] = w_8_k * H[k]\n    Y[k] = X[k] + temp_terms[k]\n    Y[k+4] = X[k] - temp_terms[k]\n\n# Print the final equations for each Y(k)\nprint(\"The 8-point DFT Y(k) is calculated as follows:\")\nfor k in range(8):\n    if k < 4:\n        # Equation for Y(k)\n        term1 = format_complex_number(X[k])\n        term2 = format_complex_number(temp_terms[k])\n        result = format_complex_number(Y[k])\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = ({term1}) + ({term2}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        # Equation for Y(k+4), which uses X(k-4) and temp_terms[k-4]\n        k_prime = k - 4\n        term1 = format_complex_number(X[k_prime])\n        term2 = format_complex_number(temp_terms[k_prime])\n        result = format_complex_number(Y[k])\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = ({term1}) - ({term2}) = {result}\")\n```\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
