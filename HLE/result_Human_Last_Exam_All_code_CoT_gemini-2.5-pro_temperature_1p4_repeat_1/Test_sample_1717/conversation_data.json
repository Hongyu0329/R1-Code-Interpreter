    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will research the health calculation formula for the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode, paying close attention to how health scales with the number of players in a multiplayer session.\n2.  I will identify the specific constants used in the formula, such as the base health and the per-player scaling factor, by referring to the game's source code information.\n3.  Next, I will analyze the formula as a mathematical function where the number of players approaches infinity.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines these constants, prints the exact formula, and explains why the health value grows indefinitely, thus demonstrating that the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the Terraria source code, here are the parameters for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n    # The health bonus per additional player for the Eye of Cthulhu is a specific 33%.\n    player_health_bonus = 0.33\n\n    # The formula for calculating the total health (HP) is:\n    # HP = BaseHP * (1 + HealthBonus * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n\n    print(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode multiplayer is based on the number of players.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere are the components of the equation:\")\n    print(f\"Base Health: {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Per-Player Health Bonus: {player_health_bonus} (or {player_health_bonus * 100}%)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health} * (1 + {player_health_bonus} * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n\n    # Let's analyze the formula as the number of players (N) approaches infinity.\n    # Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.33*N - 0.33)\n    # Health(N) = 3640 * (0.67 + 0.33*N)\n    # This simplifies to a linear equation: Health(N) = 2438.8 + 1201.2 * N\n\n    print(\"\\nThis formula is a linear function of the number of players.\")\n    print(\"As the number of players increases, the total health increases without any upper limit or cap.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the theoretical health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"\\nResult: The theoretical maximum health is infinite.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<infinite>>>"
