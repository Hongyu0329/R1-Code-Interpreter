# Step 1: Define the variables based on the clues.
X1 = 450  # Number of deputies in the State Duma.
X2 = 0    # A free service has a value of 0.
X3 = 3    # Mohs hardness of limestone (calcite).
X4 = 12   # Approximate result of the Tolstoy writers anecdote.
X5 = 5    # The five senses related to being "mad".
X6 = 4    # Number of letters in "Amen".
X7 = 1000 # From Juliet's "A thousand times good night."
X9 = 16   # From the "16-to-1" expression for "chance".
X10 = 0   # From Prutkov's "no sons."
X11 = 7   # Number of letters in "ИЛЛЮЗЕОН".

# Step 2: Calculate the result of the first equation.
# X1*X2 + (X3*X4 - X5*X6) + X7*X4 = R
result_part1 = X1 * X2
result_part2 = (X3 * X4 - X5 * X6)
result_part3 = X7 * X4
total_result = result_part1 + result_part2 + result_part3

# Step 3: From the first equation, we know total_result = X8 * X9. We can find X8.
X8 = total_result // X9

# Step 4: Use the second relationship, R = X10 + X11 + X12, to find X12.
# total_result = X10 + X11 + X12
X12 = total_result - X10 - X11

# Step 5: Print the final equation with all its numbers as requested.
print(f"The equation for X12 is derived from X8*X9 = X10 + X11 + X12")
print(f"The calculation is: {total_result} = {X10} + {X11} + {X12}")

# The final answer is the value of X12.
# No need to print this line based on instructions. The value is implicitly found above.
# print(f"The value of X12 is: {X12}")
