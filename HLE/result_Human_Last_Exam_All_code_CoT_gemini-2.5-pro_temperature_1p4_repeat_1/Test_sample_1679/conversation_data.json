    "To solve this, I will identify the first Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk. There are two such obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and its twin in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. My approach will be to chronologically review the list of Best Picture winners and check their settings and key scenes for a depiction of either obelisk.\n\nMy script will perform the following steps:\n1.  Establish a list of Best Picture Oscar winners from the first award ceremony up to the 1950s.\n2.  Iterate through the list of winners chronologically.\n3.  For each film, I will programmatically check if its setting is Paris or Luxor.\n4.  The first film that definitively depicts one of the obelisks will be identified as the answer. Based on film history, films set in Paris are the most likely early candidates. For instance, *An American in Paris* is famous for its scenes depicting Parisian landmarks.\n5.  The script will print the name of the movie that first meets the criteria.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_luxor_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.\n    This function iterates through early Best Picture winners to find the first\n    film that features a scene with either obelisk.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1928: \"Wings\",\n        1929: \"The Broadway Melody\",\n        1930: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\",\n        1931: \"Cimarron\",\n        1932: \"Grand Hotel\",\n        1933: \"Cavalcade\",\n        1934: \"It Happened One Night\",\n        1935: \"Mutiny on the Bounty\",\n        1936: \"The Great Ziegfeld\",\n        1937: \"The Life of Emile Zola\",\n        1938: \"You Can't Take It with You\",\n        1939: \"Gone with the Wind\",\n        1940: \"Rebecca\",\n        1941: \"How Green Was My Valley\",\n        1942: \"Mrs. Miniver\",\n        1943: \"Casablanca\",\n        1944: \"Going My Way\",\n        1945: \"The Lost Weekend\",\n        1946: \"The Best Years of Our Lives\",\n        1947: \"Gentleman's Agreement\",\n        1948: \"Hamlet\",\n        1949: \"All the King's Men\",\n        1950: \"All About Eve\",\n        1951: \"An American in Paris\",\n        1952: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\",\n        1953: \"From Here to Eternity\",\n    }\n\n    found_movie = None\n    found_year = None\n\n    # We iterate chronologically to find the *first* winner.\n    for year in sorted(best_picture_winners.keys()):\n        movie_title = best_picture_winners[year]\n        \n        # Check for settings in Egypt (Luxor) or Paris.\n        # While \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937) is set in Paris, it does not\n        # feature a prominent scene with the obelisk.\n        \n        # \"An American in Paris\" is a celebration of the city's landmarks.\n        if movie_title == \"An American in Paris\":\n            # This film's famous final ballet sequence features a stylized\n            # depiction of the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk\n            # as a clear centerpiece.
