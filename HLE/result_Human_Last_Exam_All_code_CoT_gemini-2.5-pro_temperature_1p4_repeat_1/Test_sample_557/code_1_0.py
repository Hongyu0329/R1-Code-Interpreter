    # Option A: Restaurant Manager, hired 2022
    print("A. Restaurant Manager (hired 2022): Hired AFTER the ban. A 'Restaurant Manager' is not an 'executive'. The clause is VOID by law.")

    # Option B: Associate Lawyer, hired 2022

    # Option D: Hairdresser, hired 2024

    # Option E: Cashier, hired 2019
    print("E. Cashier (hired 2019): Hired BEFORE the ban (October 25, 2021). Therefore, the statutory ban does not apply to their original agreement.")
    print("   The clause is not automatically void. Its validity would be assessed under the older, strict common law rules for reasonableness.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("Only the employee in option E was hired before the ban came into effect.")
    print("While enforcing a non-compete for a cashier is highly unlikely under common law, theirs is the only case where the clause is not automatically voided by the 2021 statute.")
