    Calculates the number of Goldstone bosons for a Kaon condensed phase in QCD.
    
    This function follows these steps:
    1. Defines the symmetry group of the uncondensed (gas) phase.
    2. Calculates the number of generators for this group.
    3. Defines the residual symmetry group of the condensed phase.
    4. Calculates the number of generators for the residual group.
    5. Determines the number of Goldstone bosons by finding the difference,
       which corresponds to the number of broken generators.
