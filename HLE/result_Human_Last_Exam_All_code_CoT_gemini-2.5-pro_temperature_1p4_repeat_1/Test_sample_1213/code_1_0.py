# The solution to the Go puzzle is the set of all moves White can make
# to start a sequence that guarantees a kill of the Black group.
# Based on the analysis, there are five such moves.
# The code below will print these moves in the specified format.

killing_moves = ["A1", "A3", "A4", "B1", "B2"]

# The moves are already in alphanumeric order.
# We will format them as a comma-delimited string inside curly brackets.
answer = "{" + ",".join(killing_moves) + "}"
