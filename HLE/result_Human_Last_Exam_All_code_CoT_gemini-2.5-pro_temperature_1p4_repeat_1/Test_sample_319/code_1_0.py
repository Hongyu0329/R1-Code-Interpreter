    Solves for the largest possible value of c.
    
    The problem asks for the largest exponent c such that the number of special points
    in an arrangement of N planes in R^10 is always O(N^c).

    Step 1: Analyze the definition of a "special point".
    A point is special if the vector spaces of all planes passing through it span R^10.
    A plane is a 2-dimensional affine subspace, so its vector space is 2-dimensional.
    To span the 10-dimensional space R^10, we need at least ceil(10 / 2) = 5 planes.
    So, any special point must be at the intersection of at least 5 planes.

    Step 2: Find an upper bound for c.
    Let's assume the arrangement of planes is such that the number of special points is finite.
    This implies that the intersection of any set of planes whose vector spaces span R^10
    is a set of isolated points (0-dimensional).
    Consider a special point p. It is formed by the intersection of at least 5 planes.
    Let's associate p with a set of 5 planes that pass through it and span R^10.
    Under the finite points assumption, the intersection of these 5 planes is p itself (or a small finite set of points).
    If we assume each such intersection is unique, we can bound the number of special points
    by the number of ways to choose 5 planes out of N.
    This is the binomial coefficient "N choose 5": C(N, 5).
    C(N, 5) = N * (N-1) * (N-2) * (N-3) * (N-4) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
    This is a polynomial in N of degree 5. So, the number of special points is O(N^5).
    This implies c <= 5.

    Step 3: Find a lower bound for c.
    We need to show that a configuration achieving O(N^5) special points exists.
    It is possible to construct N planes such that:
    1. Any 5 planes have direction spaces that span R^10.
    2. Any 5 planes intersect at a single unique point.
    3. No 6 planes share an intersection point.
    In such a configuration, the number of intersection points is exactly C(N, 5).
    Each of these points is special by construction.
    This means the maximum number of special points is at least O(N^5), so c >= 5.

    Step 4: Conclude the value of c.
    From the upper bound (c <= 5) and the lower bound (c >= 5), we can conclude
    that the largest possible value of c is 5.
    
    The final equation is c = 5.
