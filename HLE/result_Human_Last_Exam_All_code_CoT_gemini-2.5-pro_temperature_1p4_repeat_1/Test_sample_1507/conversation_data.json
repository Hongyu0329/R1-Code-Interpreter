    "To solve this, we need to determine the number of faces on the outer hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  Identify the shape of the outer hull (also known as the convex hull) of the great icosahedron. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  The \"visible triangles from the outside\" correspond to the faces of this convex hull. Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the number of triangles needed for the triangulation is simply the number of its faces.\n3.  To find the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, I will use Euler's polyhedron formula: `V - E + F = 2`, where `V` is the number of vertices, `E` is the number of edges, and `F` is the number of faces.\n4.  A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges. I will substitute these values into the formula to solve for `F`.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that performs this calculation and prints each step of the equation to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull\n    of the great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # We can use Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) for convex polyhedra to find the number of faces (F).\n    # For a regular icosahedron:\n    vertices = 12\n    edges = 30\n\n    # The equation is: V - E + F = 2\n    # We solve for F: F = 2 - V + E\n    faces = 2 - vertices + edges\n\n    print(\"The outer hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"The number of visible triangles equals the number of faces of this icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"We use Euler's formula: V - E + F = 2\")\n    print(f\"A regular icosahedron has {vertices} vertices (V) and {edges} edges (E).\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the number of faces (F):\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {vertices} - {edges} + F = 2\")\n    print(f\"Solving for F: F = 2 - {vertices} + {edges}\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: F = {faces}\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe minimal number of triangles needed is {faces}.\")\n\nsolve_triangulation()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
