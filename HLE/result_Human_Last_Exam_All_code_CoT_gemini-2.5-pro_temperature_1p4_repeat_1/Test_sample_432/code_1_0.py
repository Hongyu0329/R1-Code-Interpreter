def solve():
    """
    This function determines which of the given sets have the same cardinality as [0, 1].

    The cardinality of [0,1] is the cardinality of the continuum, c = 2^N_0.

    Analysis of each option:
    A. (0, 1): Cardinality c. Correct.
    B. N: Cardinality N_0. Incorrect.
    C. Q: Cardinality N_0. Incorrect.
    D. R: Cardinality c. Correct.
    E. R \ Q: Cardinality c. Correct.
    F. C (Complex numbers): Cardinality |R^2| = c. Correct.
    G. H (Quaternions): Cardinality |R^4| = c. Correct.
    H. {x: c'(x) = 0}: A countable union of open intervals, so cardinality is c. Correct.
    I. Set of all strings (finite and infinite): Cardinality N_0 + c = c. Correct.
    J. R^N: Cardinality c^N_0 = c. Correct.
    K. Z^N: Cardinality N_0^N_0 = c. Correct.
    L. N x N: Cardinality N_0. Incorrect.
    M. R x R: Cardinality c. Correct.
    N. 2^N: Cardinality 2^N_0 = c. Correct.
    O. 2^Q: Cardinality 2^N_0 = c. Correct.
    P. 2^C: Cardinality 2^c > c. Incorrect.
    Q. 2^(2^Z): Cardinality 2^c > c. Incorrect.

    The correct options are A, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O.
