    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the technical characteristics of the listed dances to find the correct answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a dictionary to represent the dances and assign a \"technical rigidity\" score to each. In this context, a higher score means the dance technique is more rigid and prescriptive, making it harder to alter a standard figure like a reverse turn.\n2.  The script will then find the dance with the highest rigidity score.\n3.  The core of the European Tango's technique is its staccato action, with no rise, fall, or sway. This makes it fundamentally different from the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep). Attempting to overturn a reverse turn in Tango would necessitate a pivot or swing action, which directly violates its core technical principles. Therefore, it will receive the highest rigidity score.\n4.  To meet the prompt's requirement, I will display the rigidity scores as a simple mathematical comparison to find the maximum value, which corresponds to the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer a specific question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the dances and their technical rigidity regarding the reverse turn.\n    # A higher score indicates a technique where overturning the turn is more likely\n    # to be a violation of the dance's fundamental character.\n    # The European Tango's technique (no sway, no rise/fall, staccato action) is the most\n    # restrictive in this regard.\n    dance_rigidity_scores = {\n        'A.
