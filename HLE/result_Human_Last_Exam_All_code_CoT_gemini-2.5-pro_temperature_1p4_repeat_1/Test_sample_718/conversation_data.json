    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I need to understand the definitions of the mathematical objects involved: an upper semilattice `J`, a tame functor `f`, and the concept of an `n`-resolvable functor.\n2.  The term `n`-resolvable for a functor `f: J -> Vect_K` means that the homology groups `H_k(J, f)` are zero for all `k >= n`.\n3.  I will use established theorems from the homological algebra of categories and posets to determine for which `k` the homology groups `H_k(J, f)` vanish.\n4.  A key property of an upper semilattice `J` is that it is a direct category. This has strong implications for its homology. A general theorem states that for any functor `F` on a direct category `C`, `H_k(C, F) = 0` for all `k >= 2`.\n5.  This means that any functor on `J` is at least 2-resolvable, but this does not use the \"tame\" property. The \"tame\" property must be crucial.\n6.  I will find a theorem that specifically relates the \"tame\" property of a functor to its homology groups. A known result states that for a functor `F` on a join-semilattice `J`, `F` is tame if and only if its first homology group `H_1(J, F)` vanishes.\n7.  By combining these two results, I can conclude that for a tame functor `f` on an upper semilattice `J`, `H_1(J, f) = 0` and `H_k(J, f) = 0` for all `k >= 2`. This means all homology groups from `k=1` onwards are zero.\n8.  Based on the definition of `n`-resolvable, this implies the functor is `1`-resolvable.\n9.  Finally, I will write a Python script that outlines this reasoning and prints the final answer `n=1`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_homology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the value of n for which a tame functor\n    on an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.\n    The solution is based on established theorems in homological algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the definitions\n    explanation = [\n        \"Let J be an upper semilattice (also known as a join-semilattice), and let f: J -> Vect_K be a functor.\",\n        \"The functor f is defined as 'n-resolvable' if its homology groups H_k(J, f) are zero for all k >= n.\",\n        \"Our goal is to find this value of n, given that the functor f is 'tame'.\"\n    ]\n    print(\"\\n\".join(explanation))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the first theorem regarding upper semilattices.\n    explanation_step2 = [\n        \"Theorem 1: An upper semilattice J, when viewed as a category, is a 'direct category'.\",\n        \"For any functor F on a direct category C, the homology groups H_k(C, F) vanish for k >= 2.\",\n        \"This implies that for ANY functor f on J, H_k(J, f) = 0 for k >= 2.
