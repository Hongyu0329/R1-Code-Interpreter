def find_nullified_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure.

    Based on the official voter guide:
    - Prop C and Prop L are competing measures.
    - Prop G and Prop H are competing measures.
    - Prop J and Prop K are competing measures.

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes'
    votes is nullified. Therefore, all six of these propositions could
    potentially be nullified.
