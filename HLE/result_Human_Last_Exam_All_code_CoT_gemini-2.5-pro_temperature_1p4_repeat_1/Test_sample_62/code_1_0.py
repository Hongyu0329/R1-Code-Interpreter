# The riddle describes a type of Italian coffee drink.
# The clue "Cafi." is a phonetic spelling of "Caffè".
# The preference for the "peculiar" over the "correct" points to a specific name.
# "Macchiato" is an Italian word meaning "stained" or "spotted".
# A coffee that is "stained" with milk fits the description of having a "peculiar shape".
# Thus, the correct name is Caffè Macchiato.
