# Let's outline the final equation based on the derivation.
# The number of poles inside ]0,1[, n_r, is related to the multiplicity m of special vertices.
# The derivation shows that under the simplifying assumption that all p and q vertices
# are located either at 0, 1 or within the interval ]0,1[, we have the relation:
# n_r = m - 1

# The problem is to find the maximum possible value for n_r. This implies we need to find
# the specific value of m intended by the problem statement.

# The analysis of the problem's definitions leads to the conclusion that m must be 2.
# 1. Vertices must be critical points, so their multiplicity m must be >= 2.
# 2. A common definition of a "simple" dessin, which is likely implied,
#    is that all multiplicities are <= 2.
# 3. These two conditions together force m = 2.

# Therefore, we can find the maximum number of 'r' vertices.

m = 2
n_r = m - 1

# The final equation is n_r = m - 1. We print the components of this equation.
# Since we are solving for n_r, we don't need a full program, but we will print the result
# as if calculated.

print("The relationship derived is n_r = m - 1.")
print(f"Based on the problem's context, the value of m is determined to be {m}.")
print(f"So, the maximum number of 'r' vertices is n_r = {m} - 1 = {n_r}.")
print("Final Equation: 1 = 2 - 1")
