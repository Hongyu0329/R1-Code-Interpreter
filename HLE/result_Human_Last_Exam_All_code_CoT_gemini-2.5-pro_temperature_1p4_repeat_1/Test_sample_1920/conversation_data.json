    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor `d`**: The properties of Dirichlet characters are determined by the prime factorization of their conductor. I will find the prime factors of $d = 53599$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of primitive characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the corresponding prime factor $p_i$.\n\n3.  **Use order properties**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We need this lcm to be 6.\n\n4.  **Count using inclusion-exclusion**:\n    The condition $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)) = 6$ implies:\n    a) The order of each component $\\chi_i$ must divide 6.\n    b) At least one component's order must be divisible by 2.\n    c) At least one component's order must be divisible by 3.\n\n    I will calculate the total number of primitive characters whose order divides 6 and then subtract the cases where the order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., the lcm divides 2 or 3). The number of characters of a specific order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\n    The final count will be:\n    (Total characters with order dividing 6) - (Characters with order dividing 3) - (Characters with order dividing 2)\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    # Check for divisibility by 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n    # Check for odd factors\n    d = 3\n    while d * d <= n:\n        while n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            n //= d\n        d += 2\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n    print(f\"Goal: Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order {order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor\n    print(\"Step 1: Factorize the conductor.\")\n    prime_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n    factors_str = ' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))\n    print(f\"d = {d} = {factors_str}\")\n    \n    # Check if d is square-free, which simplifies the problem\n    if len(prime_factors) != len(set(prime_factors)):\n        print(\"Conductor is not square-free.
