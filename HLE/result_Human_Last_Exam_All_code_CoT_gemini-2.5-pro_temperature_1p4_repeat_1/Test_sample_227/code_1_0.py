# The problem asks for the maximal distance a snail can travel in 7 minutes
# under specific observation conditions.

# This is a classic mathematical puzzle. The solution can be found by
# splitting the problem into two symmetric halves.
total_time = 7.0  # minutes
half_time = total_time / 2

# Through a complex arrangement of overlapping 1-minute observations,
# the maximal distance traveled in the first 3.5 minutes can be shown to be 5 meters.
# For example, with observers on [0,1], [1,2], [2,3] and [0.5, 1.5], [1.5, 2.5], etc.,
# one can construct a scenario where f(0.5)=2, which leads to f(2.5)=4,
# and with an observer on [2.5, 3.5], f(3.5)=5.
max_dist_in_half_time = 5  # meters

# Due to symmetry, the maximal distance in the second 3.5 minutes is also 5 meters.
max_dist_in_second_half = 5 # meters

# The total maximal distance is the sum of the distances from both halves.
total_max_distance = max_dist_in_half_time + max_dist_in_second_half

# The final equation demonstrates this logic.
