To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python code implementation.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Read the entire sum from the user as a single string.\n2.  The sum consists of numbers and '+' signs. I will extract only the numbers. A simple way to do this is to split the string by the '+' character.\n3.  This will give me a list of strings, where each string is a number from the sum.\n4.  I will then sort this list of numbers. Since the numbers are all single digits, a standard string sort will work correctly (e.g., '1' comes before '2').\n5.  Finally, I will join the sorted numbers back together into a single string, with '+' signs in between them, and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\n# Read the input sum as a string\ns = input()\n\n# Extract the numbers by splitting the string by the '+' delimiter.\n# For example, \"1+3+2+1\" becomes ['1', '3', '2', '1']\nsummands = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. Because they are single digits,\n# a standard lexicographical sort works perfectly.\n# ['1', '3', '2', '1'] becomes ['1', '1', '2', '3']\nsummands.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted list of numbers back into a string,\n# separated by the '+' character.\n# ['1', '1', '2', '3'] becomes \"1+1+2+3\"\nnew_sum = \"+\".join(summands)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum.\nprint(new_sum)\n```\n\nFor the second part of your request, here is the analysis for the most memory-efficient C program.\n\nTo create the most memory-efficient C program, we should avoid storing the entire input string. Instead, we can read the input one character at a time and count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4). This technique is a form of counting sort.\n\nThe variables needed for this approach and their memory consumption (assuming a standard system where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte) would be:\n*   `int counts[4]`: An array to store the frequency of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. This requires `4 * sizeof(int)` = `4 * 4` = 16 bytes.\n*   `int c`: A variable to hold the character returned by `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate `EOF`. This requires `1 * sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n*   `int i, j`: Two integer loop counters for printing the final sorted sum. This requires `2 * sizeof(int)` = `2 * 4` = 8 bytes.\n*   `char first_plus_flag`: A small flag variable (a `char` is sufficient) to manage printing the '+' symbols correctly, ensuring one isn't printed before the first number. This requires `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = 16 (for `counts`) + 4 (for `c`) + 8 (for `i`, `j`) + 1 (for the flag) = 29 bytes.\n\n<<<29>>>"
