# Step 1: Determine the coefficients a, b, c from the given conditions.

# From the condition lim_{x→-∞} (f(x) + 3) / e^x = 1, we deduce:
c = -3
b = 1

# From the condition f(ln 2) = 0, we can find a.
# The equation is a * e^(2*ln(2)) + b * e^(ln(2)) + c = 0
# which simplifies to 4a + 2b + c = 0.
# Substituting b=1 and c=-3:
# 4a + 2*(1) - 3 = 0
# 4a - 1 = 0
a = 1/4

# As shown in the thinking process, assuming the 'a' and 'b' in the integral
# equation are the same as the coefficients leads to a contradiction (1/4 = -7/4).
# Therefore, the integral equation is extraneous for finding the coefficients.

# Step 2: Calculate the required sum a + b.
sum_val = a + b

# Step 3: Print the values and the final result.
print(f"The value of the coefficient a is: {a}")
print(f"The value of the coefficient b is: {b}")
print("The final equation is a + b.")
print(f"{a} + {b} = {sum_val}")
