    "My plan is to identify the specific protein based on current biological research that fits the user's description. The key criteria are that the protein, when \"broken down\" (i.e., cleaved or fragmented), facilitates the engulfment of amyloid material by macrophages (or their brain equivalent, microglia). Recent research points to a specific protein in the pentraxin family that functions this way.\n\nI will provide a Python script that defines the protein's name and a brief explanation of its mechanism, and then prints this information to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and provides information about the protein\n    that, when broken down, facilitates macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Pentraxin 3 (PTX3)\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Recent research has shown that a fragment of the protein Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) \"\n        \"is key in this process. The full-length protein is 'broken down' or cleaved, \"\n        \"and its N-terminal fragment then binds to C1q, a complement protein found on amyloid plaques. \"\n        \"This binding disrupts an inhibitory ('don't eat me') signal, which in turn \"\n        \"promotes the engulfment of the amyloid by macrophages and microglia (the brain's immune cells).\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Protein Name: {protein_name}\")\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Pentraxin 3 (PTX3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
