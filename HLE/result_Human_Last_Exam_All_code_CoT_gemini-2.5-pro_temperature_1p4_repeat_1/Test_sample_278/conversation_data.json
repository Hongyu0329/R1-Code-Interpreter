    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates that the curve reaches. This will define a bounding rectangle for the figure. The side length of the smallest enclosing square will be the larger dimension of this bounding rectangle.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the curve:** For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the curve is $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$. This is the upper half of a unit circle.\n    *   The minimum x-value is $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   The maximum x-value is $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n    *   The minimum y-value is $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n    *   The maximum y-value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the curve:** For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the curve is $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$. This is the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-axes of 1 and 5.\n    *   The minimum x-value is $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   The maximum x-value is $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n    *   The minimum y-value is $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$.\n    *   The maximum y-value is $5\\sin(\\pi) = 5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Determine the overall bounding box:** By combining the ranges from both parts, we find the overall minimum and maximum values for x and y.\n    *   Overall $x_{min} = \\min(-1, -1) = -1$.\n    *   Overall $x_{max} = \\max(1, 1) = 1$.\n    *   Overall $y_{min} = \\min(0, -5) = -5$.\n    *   Overall $y_{max} = \\max(1, 0) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   Width = $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   Height = $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n5.  **Find the side of the enclosing square:** The side length of the smallest square that can enclose this bounding box must be equal to the larger of its dimensions, which is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is side * side = $6^2 = 36$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the extreme values for the first part of the curve (t in [0, pi]).\n# x = cos(t), y = sin(t)\nx_min_1, x_max_1 = -1, 1\ny_min_1, y_max_1 = 0, 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the extreme values for the second part of the curve (t in (pi, 2*pi)).\n# x = cos(t), y = 5*sin(t)\nx_min_2, x_max_2 = -1, 1\ny_min_2, y_max_2 = -5, 0\n\n# Step 3: Find the overall bounding box for the entire figure.\nx_min = min(x_min_1, x_min_2)\nx_max = max(x_max_1, x_max_2)\ny_min = min(y_min_1, y_min_2)\ny_max = max(y_max_1, y_max_2)\n\nprint(f\"The figure is bounded by x-values from {x_min} to {x_max} and y-values from {y_min} to {y_max}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The width of the figure's bounding box is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure's bounding box is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# Step 5: The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height, which is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n\n# Step 6: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"The area of this square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n\n<<<36>>>\n```"
