print("The central issue is whether a 'text message' qualifies as 'written notice' under the contract.")
print("If the notice was valid and received on Feb 2, the 3-day period for Jack to pay would be Feb 3, 4, and 5.")
print("In that case, Gary's attempt to repossess on Feb 6 would be after the grace period expired.")
print("However, a text message is often considered informal and may not satisfy the legal or contractual standard of 'written notice'. If the notice is invalid, the 3-day clock never started, and Gary is not yet entitled to repossess.")
print("Therefore, Gary's failure is not in the timing, but potentially in the method of notice, which likely did not adhere to the contract's terms.")
