    "To solve this problem and determine the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case. The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length.\n\n2.  **Brainstorm C Implementation Strategies for Memory Efficiency:**\n    *   **Naive Approach:** The simplest way is to read both strings into two separate character arrays (buffers) and then loop through them, comparing characters after converting them to a common case (e.g., lowercase).\n        *   `char s1[101];` (100 chars + 1 null terminator) -> 101 bytes.\n        *   `char s2[101];` -> 101 bytes.\n        *   Total memory for strings: 202 bytes. Plus a few bytes for loop counters.\n\n    *   **Memory-Efficient Approach:** To minimize memory, we should avoid storing both strings if possible. Since input is sequential (we must read the first string to get to the second), we cannot avoid storing the first string. However, we can avoid storing the second string. The strategy would be:\n        *   Read the entire first string into a buffer (`char s1[101]`).\n        *   Read the second string character by character from the input stream using a function like `getchar()`.\n        *   In a loop, compare the i-th character of the stored first string with the i-th character being read from the second string. Since the strings are guaranteed to have the same length, we can loop until we read a newline character for the second string.\n\n3.  **Calculate Memory for the Efficient Approach:**\n    *   `char s1[101];`: A buffer to store the first string is essential. This takes **101 bytes**.\n    *   `int c;`: A variable to hold the character read by `getchar()`. It must be an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` (End Of File) value. On most modern systems, an `int` takes **4 bytes**.\n    *   `unsigned char i = 0;`: A loop counter to index into `s1`. Using `unsigned char` is sufficient as the string length is at most 100, and it's the smallest integer type. This takes **1 byte**.\n    *   No other variables are strictly necessary. The comparison can be done and the result printed directly.\n\n4.  **Sum the Memory Usage:**\n    *   Total memory = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `c`) + (memory for `i`)\n    *   Total memory = 101 + 4 + 1 = **106 bytes**.\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because it uses only one buffer, which is the absolute minimum required to solve the problem given the nature of standard input streams.\n\nHere is a Python script that solves the logical part of the problem.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n        s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n\n        if s1 < s2:\n            print(\"-1\")\n        elif s1 > s2:\n            print(\"1\")\n        else:\n            print(\"0\")\n    except IndexError:\n        # Handles empty input\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
