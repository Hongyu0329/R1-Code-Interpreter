    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category Delta

    An internal adjunction from [m] to [n] is determined by an order-preserving
    map L: [m] -> [n] with L(0) = 0. We need to count the number of such maps.

    This is equivalent to counting non-decreasing sequences L(1), ..., L(m)
    where each L(i) is in {0, ..., n}.
    This is a stars-and-bars problem, and the solution is C(n+m, m).
