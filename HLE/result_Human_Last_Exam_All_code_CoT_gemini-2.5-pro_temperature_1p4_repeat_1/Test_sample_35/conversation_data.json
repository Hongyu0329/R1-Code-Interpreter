    "Of course. Let's break down this poker problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation**: We are in a crucial spot in a poker tournament: Under The Gun +1 (UTG1), with a 16 big blind (bb) stack, and near the money bubble. This \"bubble\" phase means players are playing more cautiously to ensure they make the money, creating high ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure. This pressure generates significant \"fold equity\" for us.\n2.  **Establish a Model**: To determine the correct hand to shove, we'll calculate the Expected Value (EV) of going all-in for each of the given hand options. The EV of a shove is calculated as:\n    `EV(shove) = (Probability of everyone folding * Pot won) + (Probability of getting called * EV when called)`\n3.  **Define Assumptions**:\n    *   **Pot Size**: 1 Small Blind (0.5bb) + 1 Big Blind (1bb) + Antes (approx. 1bb) = 2.5bb.\n    *   **Opponents**: There are 6 players to act after us.\n    *   **Villain's Calling Range**: Due to bubble pressure, opponents will only call our shove with a very strong, tight range. We'll assume a standard tight calling range of `TT+` (pocket Tens or better) and `AQs+` (Ace-Queen suited or better), `AKo` (Ace-King offsuit).\n    *   **Probabilities**: We'll calculate the probability that one of the 6 players holds a hand from this calling range to determine our fold equity.\n    *   **Equity When Called**: We will use standard equity values for each of our potential hands against the villain's calling range.\n4.  **Execute and Conclude**: The Python script below will perform these calculations for each hand choice (QJs, 99, AJo, AKo). The hand with the highest positive EV is the best one to jam. The script will print the final equation for the best hand.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef poker_shove_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the profitability of shoving all-in with different hands\n    in a specific poker tournament scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
