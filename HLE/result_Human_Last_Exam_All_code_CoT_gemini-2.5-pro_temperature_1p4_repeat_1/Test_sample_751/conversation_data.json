    "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of duality. The task of transforming a system `(A, C)` to its observer canonical form is dual to transforming the system `(A^T, C^T)` to its controller canonical form.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Dual System**: We start with the given system matrices A and C. The dual system is defined by matrices `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`.\n2.  **Controller Canonical Form Transformation**: We will find a transformation matrix, let's call it `T`, that converts the dual system `(A_d, B_d)` into controller canonical form. Since the dual system has multiple inputs (two columns in `B_d`), we will choose the first input column of `B_d` to construct the transformation. This is a standard procedure that leads to one of the possible Luenberger canonical forms.\n    *   First, we construct the controllability matrix `Q_c` for the dual system using its first input.\n    *   Then, we find the inverse of `Q_c`. The last row of `Q_c_inv` is used to build the transformation matrix `T`.\n3.  **Find the New C Matrix**: The transformation `T` converts the dual system's state. The observer canonical form matrices `(A_o, C_o)` are the transposes of the controller canonical form matrices `(A_c, B_c)`. Specifically, the new output matrix `C_o` is the transpose of the new input matrix of the dual system, `B_c`.\n    *   `B_c = T @ B_d`\n    *   `C_o = B_c^T = (T @ B_d)^T = B_d^T @ T^T = C @ T^T`\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We will use Python with the NumPy library to perform the matrix operations and find the value of the new matrix C.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1],\n    [0, 2, 0]\n])\n\nC = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Define the dual system\nA_d = A.T\nB_d = C.T\n\nprint(\"Original A matrix:\\n\", A)\nprint(\"\\nOriginal C matrix:\\n\", C)\nprint(\"\\nDual matrix A_d = A^T:\\n\", A_d)\nprint(\"\\nDual matrix B_d = C^T:\\n\", B_d)\n\n# Step 3: Construct the controllability matrix for the dual system\n# We use the first input of the dual system (first column of B_d)\nb1 = B_d[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)\nb2 = A_d @ b1\nb3 = A_d @ b2\n\nQ_c = np.hstack([b1, b2, b3])\nprint(\"\\nControllability matrix of the dual system (Q_c):\\n\", Q_c)\n\n# Check if the system is controllable\nif np.linalg.det(Q_c) == 0:\n    print(\"\\nThe dual system is not controllable with the first input. Cannot proceed.\")\nelse:\n    # Step 4: Construct the transformation matrix T\n    Q_c_inv = np.linalg.inv(Q_c)\n    print(\"\\nInverse of the controllability matrix (Q_c_inv):\\n\", Q_c_inv)\n    \n    # The last row of Q_c_inv forms the last row of the transformation matrix T\n    t3 = Q_c_inv[-1, :]\n    \n    # The other rows are found by t_{i-1} = t_i * A_d\n    t2 = t3 @ A_d\n    t1 = t2 @ A_d\n    \n    T = np.vstack([t1, t2, t3])\n    print(\"\\nTransformation matrix T:\\n\", T)\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the new C matrix for the observer canonical form\n    # C_o = C * P^-1 = C * T^T\n    C_o = C @ T.T\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe new matrix C in observer canonical form is C_o = C @ T^T:\")\n    # Print the final matrix C_o, which is the answer\n    print(C_o)\n\n```\n<<<[[1.  0.  0. ]\n [1.5 0.5 0.5]]>>>"
