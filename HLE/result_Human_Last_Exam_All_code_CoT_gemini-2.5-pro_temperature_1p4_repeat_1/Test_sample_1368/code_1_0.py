def solve_inscribed_square():

    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square
    inscribed in a circle, given the circle's center and a point on its circumference.

    The allowed commands are:
    - L: Draw a line between two existing points.
    - C: Draw a circle with an existing point as the center and another existing point
         defining the radius.

    The logic follows the geometric construction of two perpendicular diameters.

    # We start with the circle's center (O) and a point on its circumference (A).
    # The goal is to find the four vertices of the inscribed square (A, B, C, D).

    # Step 1: Construct the first diameter (AC).
    # We draw a line through the given points O and A. This line intersects the
    # circle at the given point A and a new point C on the opposite side.
    # The segment AC is a diameter and gives us two vertices of the square.

    # with a radius equal to the length of the diameter AC.

    # Step 3: Continue the perpendicular bisector construction.
    # We draw a second circle of the same size, this time centered at C,
    # with a radius passing through A. This circle will intersect the one from Step 2
    # at two new points (let's call them P and Q).

    # Step 4: Complete the construction by drawing the second diameter.
    # A line drawn through the two intersection points (P and Q) of the last two
    # circles is the perpendicular bisector of AC. This line passes through the
    # center O and defines our second diameter. The points where this line
    # intersects the original circle are the final two vertices of the square (B and D).
