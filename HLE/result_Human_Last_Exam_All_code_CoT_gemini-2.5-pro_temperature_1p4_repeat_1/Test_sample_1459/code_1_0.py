# The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1] and the unit circle
# is a known mathematical result derived from finding an optimal correspondence
# between the two spaces.

# The formula for the distance is pi / 2.
# Here are the components of the final equation:
numerator = math.pi
denominator = 2

# Perform the calculation
result = numerator / denominator

# Output the equation and its result as requested
