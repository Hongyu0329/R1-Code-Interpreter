# The problem is to find the maximum distance from a point A to the surface
# of a specially shaped 1 cubic meter of playdough. The shape is designed
# to produce the maximum gravitational field at A.

# As derived from physics principles, this maximum distance 'd' is given by
# the equation: d = (15 / (4 * pi))^(1/3).

# The numbers that constitute this final equation are:
numerator = 15
denominator_factor = 4
exponent_numerator = 1
exponent_denominator = 3

# We will now calculate this value using Python.
result = (numerator / (denominator_factor * math.pi)) ** (exponent_numerator / exponent_denominator)

# The final equation includes the numbers 15, 4, 1, and 3.
# We print the equation and the final calculated distance.
print(f"The equation for the furthest distance is: ({numerator} / ({denominator_factor} * pi)) ^ ({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator})")
