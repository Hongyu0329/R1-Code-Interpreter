def demonstrate_goedels_proof():
    """
    This function demonstrates the steps of Gödel's Ontological Proof.
    It does not 'prove' it in a computational sense, but rather prints
    out the axioms, definitions, and theorems in logical order to
    illustrate the argument's flow.

    The symbols used are:
    P(φ)  - 'φ is a positive property'
    ~     - 'NOT' (negation)
    ->    - 'IMPLIES' (material implication)
    &     - 'AND' (conjunction)
    □     - 'NECESSARILY' (modal operator)
    ◇     - 'POSSIBLY' (modal operator)
    G(x)  - 'x is God-like'
    E(x)  - 'x necessarily exists'
    Ess(x, φ) - 'φ is the essence of x'
    (∃x)  - 'There exists an x'
