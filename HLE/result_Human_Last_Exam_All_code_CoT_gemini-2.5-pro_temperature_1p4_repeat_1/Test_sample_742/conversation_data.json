    "This is a fascinating question that bridges physics, philosophy, and logic.\n\nMy plan is to first address the core of your question directly, explaining the relationship (or lack thereof) between quantum mechanics and Gödel's ontological proof. Then, as requested, I will provide a Python script. Since one cannot prove a logical theorem with a physical theory, the script will not use quantum mechanics. Instead, it will lay out the step-by-step logical progression of Gödel's proof itself, making the abstract argument concrete and readable. This will allow you to see the \"mechanics\" of the proof, which is a formal system of logic, not physics.\n\nThe foundational issue is that quantum mechanics and Gödel's proof operate in entirely separate domains.\n*   **Quantum Mechanics** is a physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Its claims are validated by experiments and observations of the physical world.\n*   **Gödel's Ontological Proof** is an argument in *modal logic*, a branch of formal logic. It is a purely abstract and deductive argument that proceeds from a set of axioms (assumed starting points) and definitions to a conclusion. Its validity depends only on the rules of logic, not on any physical evidence.\n\nYou cannot use the principles of a physical theory (like wave-particle duality or quantum superposition) to prove a conclusion in a formal logic system, or vice versa. It would be a category error, like trying to use the rules of grammar to solve a calculus problem.\n\nTherefore, the Python code below will not involve quantum mechanics. It will instead serve as a demonstration of the logical steps of Gödel's proof, clarifying its structure. For the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will interpret this as outputting each numbered step of the proof, culminating in the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_goedels_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the steps of Gödel's Ontological Proof.\n    It does not 'prove' it in a computational sense, but rather prints\n    out the axioms, definitions, and theorems in logical order to\n    illustrate the argument's flow.\n\n    The symbols used are:\n    P(φ)  - 'φ is a positive property'\n    ~     - 'NOT' (negation)\n    ->    - 'IMPLIES' (material implication)\n    &     - 'AND' (conjunction)\n    □     - 'NECESSARILY' (modal operator)\n    ◇     - 'POSSIBLY' (modal operator)\n    G(x)  - 'x is God-like'\n    E(x)  - 'x necessarily exists'\n    Ess(x, φ) - 'φ is the essence of x'\n    (∃x)  - 'There exists an x'\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Illustrating the logical steps of Gödel's Ontological Proof (Scott's version):\\n\")\n\n    # The proof proceeds from axioms and definitions to theorems.\n    steps = [\n        (\"1.
