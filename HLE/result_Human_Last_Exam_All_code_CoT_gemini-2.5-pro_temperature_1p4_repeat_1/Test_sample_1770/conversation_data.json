    "To prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out the gene that codes for the first enzyme in its catabolic pathway. This strategy is the most direct way to stop the cell from consuming your desired product.\n\nThe degradation of p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum* begins with its activation by Coenzyme A (CoA), a reaction catalyzed by p-coumaroyl-CoA synthetase. By deleting the gene that encodes this enzyme, p-coumaric acid cannot enter the degradation pathway and will accumulate.\n\nThe following Python script simulates querying a metabolic database to identify this specific gene. It outlines the target, the enzyme it codes for, and the rationale for its selection as a knockout candidate.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_gene_for_knockout():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script queries a simplified metabolic database for Corynebacterium glutamicum\n    to identify the optimal gene for knockout to prevent product degradation.\n    The specific goal is to stop the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified database representing known degradation pathways.\n    # In a real-world scenario, this data would be sourced from genomic and metabolic\n    # databases like KEGG, BioCyc, or NCBI.\n    c_glutamicum_degradation_db = {\n        'p-coumaric acid': {\n            'gene_name': 'fcs',\n            'locus_tag': 'cg2904',\n            'enzyme': 'p-coumaroyl-CoA synthetase (also known as Feruloyl-CoA synthetase)',\n            'reaction': 'p-coumaric acid + CoA -> p-coumaroyl-CoA',\n            'rationale': ('This enzyme catalyzes the very first step of the p-coumaric acid '\n                          'degradation pathway.
