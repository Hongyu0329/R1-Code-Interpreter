# This script calculates the number of initial data points for the Cauchy problem.

# 1. Count the total number of configuration variables.
# The system is described by two 4-vectors, x(tau) and w(tau).
x_components = 4
w_components = 4
total_components = x_components + w_components

# 2. Count the number of constraints.
# The Lagrange multiplier g(tau) enforces the constraint w_mu * w^mu - 1 = 0.
num_constraints = 1

# 3. Count the number of gauge freedoms.
# The action is invariant under reparametrizations of tau, which is a gauge symmetry.
num_gauge_freedoms = 1

# 4. Calculate the number of physical degrees of freedom (DOF).
# DOF = (Total variables) - (Constraints) - (Gauge freedoms)
physical_dof = total_components - num_constraints - num_gauge_freedoms

# 5. Calculate the number of initial data points.
# For a system with second-order equations of motion, we need to specify
# the initial value and its first time derivative for each physical DOF.
num_initial_data = 2 * physical_dof
