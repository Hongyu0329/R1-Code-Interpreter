The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ are precisely all nonabelian groups of that order. These groups can all be represented as a semidirect product $P \rtimes C_2$, where $P$ is a group of order $q^m$. This semidirect product is nonabelian if either (1) $P$ itself is nonabelian, or (2) $P$ is abelian but the action of $C_2$ on $P$ is non-trivial. For $m=1$, the only such group is the dihedral group $D_{2q}$. For $m=2$, there are three such groups, which are semidirect products involving the abelian groups $C_{q^2}$ and $C_q \times C_q$.
