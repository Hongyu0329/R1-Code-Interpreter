def solve_cardinal_problem():
    """
    Solves the mathematical problem about cardinalities of function sets.

    The problem asks for the minimum cardinality of the set of functions g
    for which another function f is bounded by max(g(alpha), g(beta)).
    This is a known result in combinatorial set theory.

    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    Let g be a function from kappa^+ to kappa.
    Let f be a function from kappa^+ x kappa^+ to kappa.
    Let X_f be the cardinality of the set of functions g such that for all alpha, beta in kappa^+,
    f(alpha, beta) <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)).

    The problem is to find min({X_f | f: kappa^+ x kappa^+ -> kappa}).

    The answer is kappa^kappa (kappa to the power of kappa).

    - It can be shown that for any f, the cardinality X_f is at least kappa^kappa.
    - It can be shown that there exists a function f for which the cardinality X_f is exactly kappa^kappa.

    # The result is a formula in terms of the infinite cardinal kappa.

    # Printing the final formula. The prompt asks to output each number

    # we present the equation symbolically.
