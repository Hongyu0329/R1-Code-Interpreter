    This program demonstrates the reasoning for determining the number of
    homeomorphism classes for the intersections of two geodesics.

    A geodesic in the given space is one of two types:
    1. A linear geodesic L(h) = {t*h | t in R}, with ||h||=1.
       This is composed of two opposite rays, R(h) and R(-h).
       Its direction set is {h, -h}.
    2. A bent geodesic B(h1, h2) = R(h1) U R(h2), where h1, h2 are linearly independent.
       Its direction set is {h1, h2}.

    The intersection of two geodesics G_A and G_B is the union of their common rays.
    This is determined by the intersection of their direction sets, D_A and D_B.
    The number of elements in D_A intersect D_B can be 0, 1, or 2.
