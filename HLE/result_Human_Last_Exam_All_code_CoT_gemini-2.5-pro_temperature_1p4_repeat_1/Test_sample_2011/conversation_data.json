    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the set of induced clique sizes:** First, I will establish a fundamental property of induced cliques. If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k` (a `K_k`), I'll show that it must also contain an induced clique of size `j` for any `1 <= j < k`.\n2.  **Simplify the problem:** This property implies that the set of all induced clique sizes for any graph `G` is of the form `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`, where `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique in `G`. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is `k_max`. The problem is then reduced to finding the maximum possible value of `k_max` for a graph with 128 vertices.\n3.  **Maximize the largest clique size:** The size of the largest clique in a graph with `n` vertices (its clique number) cannot be greater than `n`.\n4.  **Find a graph that achieves the maximum:** I will identify a specific graph on 128 vertices that achieves this upper bound for the clique number. This graph is the complete graph `K_128`.\n5.  **State the final conclusion:** For `K_128`, the largest clique is of size 128, meaning it contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. This gives a total of 128 different clique sizes, which is the maximum possible. I will provide a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph\n    on n = 128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the problem.\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes (k) where a K_k\")\n    print(\"is an induced subgraph in a graph G with n = 128 vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the properties of induced cliques.\")\n    print(\"A key insight is that if a graph G has an induced clique of size k on a set of vertices S,\")\n    print(\"then any subset S' of S (with size j < k) will also form an induced clique.\")\n    print(\"This is because all vertices in S are mutually connected, so all vertices in S' are also mutually connected.\")\n    print(\"This means if k is a possible induced clique size, so is every integer from 1 to k.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Simplifying the problem.\")\n    print(\"The set of all possible induced clique sizes in a graph G must be of the form {1, 2, ..., k_max},\")\n    print(\"where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in G (also known as the clique number).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of different clique sizes is equal to k_max.\")\n    print(\"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum possible value of k_max for a graph with n vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Finding the maximum clique number.\")\n    print(f\"For any graph G with n vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed n.\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum possible value for k_max is at most n.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Constructing the optimal graph.\")\n    print(f\"This maximum is achieved by the complete graph on n vertices, K_n.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, with n = {n}, we can consider the complete graph K_{n}.\")\n    print(f\"In K_{n}, any subset of k vertices forms a K_k induced subgraph, for any k from 1 to n.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, K_{n} has induced cliques of all sizes {1, 2, ..., n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 6: Conclusion.\")\n    # The maximum number of different clique sizes is n.\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    # Let M be the maximum possible number of different clique sizes.\n    # The final equation is M = n.\n    print(\"Let M be the maximum number of different clique sizes and n be the number of vertices.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is M = n.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the result is:\")\n    print(f\"M = {max_sizes}\")\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
