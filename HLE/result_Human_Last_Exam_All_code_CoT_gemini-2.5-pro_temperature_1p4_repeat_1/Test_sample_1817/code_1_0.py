    This function identifies the inappropriate implementation options based on the Domain Model pattern.

    - A is inappropriate because business logic should not be in the Controller.
    - B is inappropriate because it creates a "God Object" by placing logic that belongs to other entities (Customer, Book) and infrastructure (email) into the Order class.
    - C is inappropriate because it incorrectly places an infrastructure concern (sending email) inside a domain entity (Order).
    - D and E represent valid and common approaches in Domain-Driven Design.
