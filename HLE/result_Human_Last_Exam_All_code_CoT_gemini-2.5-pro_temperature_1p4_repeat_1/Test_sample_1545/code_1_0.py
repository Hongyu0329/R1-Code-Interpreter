    # --- Problem Analysis and Assumption ---
    # As established, the problem statement's parameters (n=9, m=16, k=4) are
    # contradictory. We proceed by assuming the "Key Properties" theorem is correct,
    # which points to two possible partitions. We select the one that leads to a
    # valid answer from the options. This is the partition (2, 3, 2, 2).
    # This partition implies the number of edges should have been 18, not 16.

    # Partition sizes derived from the theorems
    n_list = [2, 3, 2, 2]
    n1, n2, n3, n4 = n_list

    # --- Calculation of p, q, r ---

    # p: number of vertices in odd-length paths
    # A path with n vertices has length n-1.
    # Paths S1, S3, S4 have lengths 1, 1, 1 (odd). Path S2 has length 2 (even).
    # p = n1 + n3 + n4
    p = n_list[0] + n_list[2] + n_list[3]

    # q: size of the largest induced cycle containing at least one vertex from each S_i
    # For such layered graphs, constructing a cycle by traversing up and down the
    # layers (e.g., S1 -> S2 -> S3 -> S4 -> S3 -> S2 -> S1) is a common pattern.
    # A cycle of length 6 can be formed (e.g., v1-v2-v3-v4-v5-v6-v1, where
    # v1 in S1, v2/v6 in S2, v3/v5 in S3, v4 in S4). This is assumed to be the max.
    q = 6

    # r: number of vertices with exactly 3 neighbors in sets other than their own
    # For a vertex v in S_i, this count is (i-1) + |N_after(v)|.
    # We need (i-1) + |N_after(v)| = 3.
    # For this to be a single value, the graph structure is likely extremal.
    # For v in S4: 3 + |N_after(v)| = 3 => |N_after(v)| = 0. True for all n4=2 vertices.
    # For v in S3: 2 + |N_after(v)| = 3 => |N_after(v)| = 1. In a minimal connection graph, this is impossible. (r_3=0)
    # For v in S2: 1 + |N_after(v)| = 3 => |N_after(v)| = 2. It's possible for 2 vertices. (r_2=2)
    # For v in S1: 0 + |N_after(v)| = 3 => |N_after(v)| = 3. It's possible for 1 vertex. (r_1=1)
    # Total r = r1+r2+r3+r4 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 5.
    r = 5
