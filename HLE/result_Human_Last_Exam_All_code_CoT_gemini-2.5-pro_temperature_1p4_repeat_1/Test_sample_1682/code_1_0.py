The task is to identify the incorrect statement about wedding customs in different Chinese dynasties. Let's analyze each option:

A. Ming Dynasty wedding attire for nobility did feature elaborate phoenix crowns and red robes. This is generally accurate.
B. Ancient texts confirm the practice of veiling the bride during the Zhou Dynasty. This is correct.
C. The custom of covering the face with a fan existed, but the folding fan (摺扇) was not prevalent in the Tang Dynasty. Rigid, non-folding fans (團扇) were used. The folding fan was introduced later, making its mention in the context of the Tang Dynasty an anachronism. This statement is incorrect.
D. The xiapei (shawl) and phoenix crown were indeed important elements of formal attire for noblewomen from the Song Dynasty onward. This is correct.
E. The classic red wedding attire described became the standard for Han Chinese brides during the Qing Dynasty. This is correct.

The most factually incorrect statement is C.
