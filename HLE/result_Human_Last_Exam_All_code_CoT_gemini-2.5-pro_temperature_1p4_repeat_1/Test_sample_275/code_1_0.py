    # Step 1: Define Menotaxis
    print("--- Step 1: Defining Menotaxis ---")
    print("Menotaxis is a biological term for a navigational strategy where an animal maintains a constant, fixed angle to a distant stimulus.")
    print("Essentially, it's a 'compass sense' that allows an animal to travel in a straight line.")
    print("Crucially, this is a visually guided behavior, requiring a stable visual landmark or pattern.\n")

    # Step 2: Evaluate Each Option
    print("--- Step 2: Evaluating the Options ---")

    # Option A
    print("A. Presenting a 100 Hz sinusoidal sound.")
    print("   - Evaluation: This is incorrect. Menotaxis relies on the visual system, not the auditory system. Sound is the wrong sensory modality.\n")

    # Option B
    print("B. Food depriving, heating and providing a visual reference.")
    print("   - Evaluation: This describes methods to *motivate* a fly to navigate (hunger, aversion to heat) and a general requirement (a visual reference). While these conditions are often used in navigation experiments, this option is less precise than others. It doesn't describe the specific *stimulus* that induces the menotactic orientation itself.\n")

    # Option C
    print("C. Presenting 12 constant vertical bright bars around the fly.")
    print("   - Evaluation: This is the correct answer. This describes a classic experimental paradigm. A panoramic arena with high-contrast, stable visual cues like vertical bars is the standard method for inducing and studying menotaxis. The fly's brain can easily 'lock onto' one of the 12 bars and maintain a constant angle to it, which is the definition of menotaxis.\n")

    # Option D
    print("D. Presenting odors from above.")
    print("   - Evaluation: This is incorrect. Odors are used to induce chemotaxis (orienting to a chemical source) or anemotaxis (orienting relative to wind), not menotaxis.\n")

    # Option E
    print("E. Spinning the fly on an air-cushioned foam ball.")
    print("   - Evaluation: This is incorrect. This describes the *apparatus* for measuring a fly's movement (a spherical treadmill), not the stimulus that *induces* the behavior. A scientist would use this device to record menotaxis while presenting a visual stimulus like the one in option C.\n")

    # Step 3: Conclusion
    print("--- Step 3: Conclusion ---")
    print("The most direct and standard experimental method to induce menotaxis is to present a stable, panoramic visual pattern.")
    print("Therefore, presenting 12 constant vertical bright bars is the correct choice.")
