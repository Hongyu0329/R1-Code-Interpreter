    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 chessboard that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a toroidal board).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Toroidal Attack Rules:** On an `N x N` toroidal board, a queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if any of the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack:** The concept of diagonals also wraps around. This can be expressed with modular arithmetic: `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N` or `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`.\n\n2.  **Devise a computational strategy:** The problem can be solved by systematically searching for all valid combinations of 4 queen placements. A backtracking algorithm is well-suited for this task. We will iterate through all squares on the board, and for each square, we will try to place a queen.\n\n3.  **Backtracking Algorithm:**\n    *   We will write a recursive function, say `count_placements(k, start_square, placements)`, which counts the number of ways to place `k` queens.\n    *   `k`: The number of queens still to be placed.\n    *   `start_square`: The index of the board square (from 0 to 24) to start searching from. This ensures we only find unique combinations and avoid duplicates (e.g., placing queens at `(a,b)` then `(c,d)` is the same as `(c,d)` then `(a,b)`).\n    *   `placements`: A list of coordinates for queens already placed.\n    *   The recursion stops when `k` becomes 0, which means we have successfully placed all 4 queens, and we count this as one valid way.\n    *   At each step, the algorithm checks if placing a new queen on a square is \"safe\" (i.e., it doesn't attack any previously placed queens according to the toroidal rules).\n\n4.  **Final Output Formulation:** The problem asks for the final answer to be presented as an equation. We can leverage the board's symmetry for this. On a torus, every square is identical from a strategic point of view. Let `C` be the number of ways to place the remaining 3 queens after one has been fixed at a specific square (e.g., (0,0)). The total number of arrangements can be found with the formula: `Total = (C * 25) / 4`. The division by 4 is necessary because each valid arrangement of 4 queens is counted 4 times (once for each queen being the 'first' one placed). The code will first compute the `Total` and then derive `C` to print the final equation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this backtracking search to find the total number of ways.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It is recommended to use PyPy for this script for better performance,\n# though standard Python will also work.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    # memoization cache for the recursive function\n    memo = {}\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a queen at (r, c) attacks any queen in the placements list.\n        \"\"\"\n        for pr, pc in placements:\n            if r == pr:\n                return False\n            if c == pc:\n                return False\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks\n            if (r - c) % N == (pr - pc) % N:\n                return False\n            if (r + c) % N == (pr + pc) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_placements(k, start_index, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid queen placements using backtracking.\n        k: number of queens left to place.\n        start_index: board square index to start searching from (avoids duplicates).\n        placements: a tuple of (r, c) for already placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: successfully placed all queens\n        if k == 0:\n            return 1\n        \n        # Memoization key\n        state = (k, start_index, placements)\n        if state in memo:\n            return memo[state]\n\n        count = 0\n        # Iterate through all possible squares starting from start_index\n        for i in range(start_index, N * N):\n            # Optimization: if remaining squares are fewer than queens to place, stop.\n            if (N * N - i) < k:\n                break\n                \n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n\n            if is_safe(r, c, placements):\n                # If safe, place queen and recurse for the next one\n                new_placements = placements + ((r, c),)\n                count += count_placements(k - 1, i + 1, new_placements)\n        \n        memo[state] = count\n        return count\n\n    # Initial call to the recursive function\n    total_ways = count_placements(NUM_QUEENS, 0, tuple())\n\n    # Formulate the output as an equation based on symmetry, as explained in the plan.\n    # C = (Total * Num_Queens) / Board_Area\n    # This C represents the number of ways to place the other 3 queens\n    # once one has been fixed on a single square.\n    \n    board_area = N * N\n    c = (total_ways * NUM_QUEENS) / board_area\n\n    if c == int(c):\n      c = int(c)\n      \n    print(f\"Based on the symmetry of the toroidal board, we can establish the following relationship:\")\n    print(f\"({c} * {board_area}) / {NUM_QUEENS} = {total_ways}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis means fixing one queen on any square leaves {c} ways to place the other 3.\")\n    print(f\"The program confirms the total number of ways is {total_ways}.\")\n\n\nsolve()\n<<<50>>>\n```"
