No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to deter natural predators, not humans. Key predators like birds have different visual systems than humans (e.g., they can see ultraviolet light) and perceive color differently. Therefore, clusters based on human-ranked similarity do not necessarily represent the functional mimicry rings that have evolved under the selective pressure of predation.
