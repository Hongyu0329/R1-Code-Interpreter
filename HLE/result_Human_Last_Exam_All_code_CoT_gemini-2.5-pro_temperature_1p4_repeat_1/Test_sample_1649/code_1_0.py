    This function demonstrates that a limit of size 1 is possible
    under the given conditions.

    We model a simple directed poset J = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} with the usual <= relation.
    We define a functor F that maps each object n in J to a non-empty set F(n)
    and each morphism m -> n (for n <= m) to a surjective map F(m) -> F(n).

    To find the smallest possible limit size, we construct the simplest case:
    - Each set F(n) is a singleton set, e.g., {0}.
    - Each map is the unique (and surjective) function between these sets.

    We then compute the limit of this diagram by finding all "compatible families".
    A family is a tuple (x_0, x_1, ...) where x_n is in F(n).
    A family is compatible if for all m >= n, map(x_m) = x_n.
