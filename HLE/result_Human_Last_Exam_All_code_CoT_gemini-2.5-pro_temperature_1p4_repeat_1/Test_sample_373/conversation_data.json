    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the specified graph. A \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" is most commonly interpreted as two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck.\"\n\nSecond, I will analyze the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" process. This process involves two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph.\n2.  One of its neighbors is then selected uniformly at random.\nThe edge between this pair of nodes is considered \"sampled\".\n\nThird, I will calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. This can happen in two ways:\n1.  Selecting the node on one side of the bottleneck and then its neighbor across the bottleneck.\n2.  Selecting the node on the other side of the bottleneck and then its neighbor back across.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations, explain each step clearly, and present the final equation with all its components as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node\n    barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
