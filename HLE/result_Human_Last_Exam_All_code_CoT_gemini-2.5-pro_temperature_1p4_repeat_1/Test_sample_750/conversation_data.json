    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we need to consider the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Represent `z` and `i`:**\n    Let $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    The complex number $i$ can be written in exponential form as $i = e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ for any integer $k$. This multi-valued representation is key. The term $\\ln(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ represents the different branches of the complex logarithm.\n\n2.  **Rewrite the equation:**\n    The equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n    *   **Left-Hand Side (LHS):**\n        $z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y + xi$.\n    *   **Right-Hand Side (RHS):**\n        $i^z$ is defined as $e^{z \\ln(i)}$. Using the logarithm from step 1:\n        $i^z = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{i x (\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + i^2 y (\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n        $i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{i x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n        This can be expanded into real and imaginary parts using Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$.\n        Let $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n        $i^z = e^{-y A_k} (\\cos(x A_k) + i\\sin(x A_k))$.\n\n3.  **Equate Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n    By equating the LHS ($-y + xi$) and the RHS, we get a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$:\n    *   Real part: $-y = e^{-y A_k} \\cos(x A_k)$\n    *   Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y A_k} \\sin(x A_k)$\n\n4.  **Solve for Solutions:**\n    We analyze three cases.\n\n    *   **Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\n        If $y=0$, the system becomes:\n        $0 = \\cos(x A_k)$\n        $x = \\sin(x A_k)$\n        From the first equation, $x A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\n        Substituting this into the second equation, $x = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi)$. This means $x$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n        *   If $x=1$, we get $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+n\\pi$. Since $A_k=\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi$, this holds if $n$ is even ($n=2k$). So $z=1$ is a solution.\n        *   If $x=-1$, we get $-A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}+n\\pi$. This holds if $n$ is odd ($n=2k+1$ for some relabeling). So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n        We can check these: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i=i$ (True). And $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = 1/i = -i$ (True).\n\n    *   **Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\n        If $x=0$, the system becomes:\n        $-y = e^{-y A_k} \\cos(0) = e^{-y A_k}$\n        $0 = e^{-y A_k} \\sin(0) = 0$ (This provides no information).\n        We must solve the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-y A_k}$. Analysis shows that real solutions for $y$ only exist when $A_k < 0$, which means $k \\le -1$.\n        This equation can be solved using the Lambert W function. Let $j = -k \\ge 1$. Then $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2j\\pi$. The solution for $y$ is given by $y_j = \\frac{W(\\pi(2j-1/2))}{-\\pi(2j-1/2)}$.\n        This gives an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions:\n        $z_j = -i \\frac{W(\\pi(2j - 1/2))}{\\pi(2j - 1/2)}$ for $j=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$\n        where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n\n    *   **Case 3: Complex solutions ($x \\neq 0, y \\neq 0$)**\n        While the system of equations is hard to solve in the general case, the analysis shows that no other \"simple\" solutions exist. The three sets of solutions found (two real, one infinite set of imaginary) are believed to be the complete set.\n\nThe Python code below will print the two real solutions and calculate the first three purely imaginary solutions to demonstrate.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\nprint(\"The equation z * i = i^z has several sets of solutions in the complex plane.\")\nprint(\"We found two real solutions and an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions.\")\n\n# --- Solution 1: z = 1 ---\nz1 = 1\nlhs1 = z1 * 1j\n# In Python, 1j**z1 correctly computes the principal value\nrhs1 = 1j**z1\nprint(\"\\nSolution 1: z = 1\")\nprint(f\"Verifying the equation for z = {z1}:\")\nprint(f\"{z1} * i         = {lhs1}\")\nprint(f\"i^({z1})      = {rhs1}\")\nprint(f\"The values match, so z = 1 is a solution.\")\n\n# --- Solution 2: z = -1 ---\nz2 = -1\nlhs2 = z2 * 1j\nrhs2 = 1j**z2\nprint(\"\\nSolution 2: z = -1\")\nprint(f\"Verifying the equation for z = {z2}:\")\nprint(f\"{z2} * i        = {lhs2}\")\nprint(f\"i^({z2})     = {rhs2}\")\nprint(f\"The values match, so z = -1 is a solution.\")\n\n# --- Solution 3: Infinite imaginary solutions ---\nprint(\"\\nSolution 3: An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions.\")\nprint(\"These are of the form z = -i * W(k) / k, where k = pi*(2j-1/2) for j=1, 2, 3,...\")\nprint(\"W is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the first 3 imaginary solutions:\")\n\n# Loop for the first 3 solutions in this family (j=1, 2, 3)\nfor j in range(1, 4):\n    # This corresponds to branches k = -1, -2, -3 of the logarithm\n    k_val = -j\n    \n    # Calculate the argument for the Lambert W function\n    # This is -A_k from our derivation, which is pi*(2j-1/2)\n    lambert_arg = np.pi * (2 * j - 1/2)\n    \n    # Calculate the Lambert W function value.
