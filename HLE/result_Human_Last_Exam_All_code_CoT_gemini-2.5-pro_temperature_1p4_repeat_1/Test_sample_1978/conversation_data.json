    "To find the index of the boundary-value problem, we need to determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions. The index is a property of the boundary conditions themselves and does not depend on the differential equation's specific form (i.e., the matrix `A` or the function `I(t)`).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions:** We are given six boundary conditions. We need to check for any linear dependencies among them.\n    *   (1) `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   (2) `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   (3) `5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   (4) `100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   (5) `1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0`\n    *   (6) `100x_2024(T) - 100x_2024(0) = 0`\n2.  **Identify Dependencies:** We can observe that several conditions relate to the same variables, `x_2(0)` and `x_2(T)`.\n    *   Condition (3) is `5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, which is 5 times condition (2).\n    *   Condition (4) is `100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, which is 100 times condition (2).\n    *   Condition (5) is `-1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, which is -1000 times condition (2).\n    *   Therefore, conditions (2), (3), (4), and (5) are all linearly dependent, providing only one unique constraint.\n3.  **Identify Independent Conditions:** The remaining unique conditions involve different state variables:\n    *   Condition (1) involves `x_1`.\n    *   The single unique condition from the group (2)-(5) involves `x_2`.\n    *   Condition (6) involves `x_2024`.\n    Since these three conditions act on different, independent components of the state vector `x`, they are linearly independent of each other.\n4.  **Count the Independent Conditions:** There are 3 linearly independent boundary conditions.\n5.  **Formalize with Code:** We will use Python with the NumPy library to formalize this. We will construct a coefficient matrix where each row represents one of the original boundary conditions. The rank of this matrix gives the number of linearly independent conditions, which is the index of the problem. The dimension `n` of the system is determined by the variables in the boundary conditions, which is `n=2024`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, calculate the rank, and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the index of the given boundary-value problem\n    by calculating the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of the state vector is n=2024, based on the boundary conditions.\n    n = 2024\n\n    # We create a coefficient matrix M for the boundary conditions of the form Bx(0) + Cx(T) = 0.\n    # The columns of M correspond to the coefficients of [x_1(0), ..., x_n(0), x_1(T), ..., x_n(T)].\n    # The size of M will be 6 rows (for 6 conditions) by 2*n columns.\n    M = np.zeros((6, 2 * n))\n\n    # Populate the matrix based on the given boundary conditions:\n\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0  => -1*x_1(0) + 1*x_1(T) = 0\n    M[0, 1 - 1] = -1\n    M[0, n + 1 - 1] = 1\n\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0  => -1*x_2(0) + 1*x_2(T) = 0\n    M[1, 2 - 1] = -1\n    M[1, n + 2 - 1] = 1\n\n    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0 => -5*x_2(0) + 5*x_2(T) = 0\n    M[2, 2 - 1] = -5\n    M[2, n + 2 - 1] = 5\n\n    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0 => -100*x_2(0) + 100*x_2(T) = 0\n    M[3, 2 - 1] = -100\n    M[3, n + 2 - 1] = 100\n    \n    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0 => 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n    M[4, 2 - 1] = 1000\n    M[4, n + 2 - 1] = -1000\n\n    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0 => -100*x_2024(0) + 100*x_2024(T) = 0\n    M[5, 2024 - 1] = -100\n    M[5, n + 2024 - 1] = 100\n\n    # The index of the problem is the rank of the coefficient matrix M.\n    problem_index = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)\n\n    print(\"The analysis of the boundary conditions reveals that there are 3 linearly independent equations:\")\n    print(\"Independent Equation 1: 1 * x_1(T) - 1 * x_1(0) = 0\")\n    print(\"Independent Equation 2: 1 * x_2(T) - 1 * x_2(0) = 0 (represents 4 of the given conditions)\")\n    print(\"Independent Equation 3: 100 * x_2024(T) - 100 * x_2024(0) = 0\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the rank of the coefficient matrix to confirm...\")\n    print(f\"The calculated index of the problem is: {problem_index}\")\n\nsolve_problem()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
