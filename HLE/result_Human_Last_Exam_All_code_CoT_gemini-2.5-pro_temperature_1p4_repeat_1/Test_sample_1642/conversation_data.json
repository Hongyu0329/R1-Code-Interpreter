    "Answering your question requires a clear interpretation of the problem. The phrase \"without attacking each other\" can be ambiguous. I will proceed with the most common and direct interpretation: the collection of all `2m` queens (both white and black) must be non-attacking. If the problem meant that only queens of the same color cannot attack each other, it would be a significantly more complex problem from a branch of recreational mathematics (the \"peaceable queens\" problem), and finding a solution would be computationally infeasible for a script.\n\nUnder the standard interpretation, the problem is to find the maximum number of non-attacking queens we can place on a 16x16 board, and then divide that number by two to find `m`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The problem is equivalent to the classic N-Queens puzzle for N=16. We need to find the maximum number of queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board so that no two queens threaten each other.\n2.  It is a well-known result in mathematics that for any `N >= 4`, the maximum number of non-attacking queens on an N x N board is exactly N. Therefore, for a 16x16 board, we can place a maximum of 16 non-attacking queens.\n3.  The total number of queens is `m` white + `m` black = `2m`.\n4.  Since the maximum total number of non-attacking queens is 16, we have the inequality `2m <= 16`.\n5.  This implies `m <= 8`. To show that `m=8` is achievable, we simply need to find one solution for the 16-Queens problem and then assign 8 of those queens to be white and 8 to be black.\n6.  I will provide a Python script that uses a backtracking algorithm to find one valid arrangement for 16 non-attacking queens. The script will then use this result to calculate and print the final answer `m`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a higher recursion limit for deep searches on large boards.\n# The default limit (often 1000) is sufficient for N=16, but this is a safeguard.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\nclass NQueensSolver:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n):\n        self.n = n\n        # board[i] will store the column number of the queen in row i\n        self.board = [-1] * n\n        self.solution = None\n\n    def is_safe(self, row, col):\n        \"\"\"\n        Check if placing a queen at board[row] = col is safe.\n        We only need to check for conflicts with queens in previous rows (0 to row-1),\n        as queens in subsequent rows have not been placed yet.\n        \"\"\"\n        for i in range(row):\n            # Check for column conflict\n            if self.board[i] == col:\n                return False\n            # Check for diagonal conflict\n            if abs(row - i) == abs(col - self.board[i]):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve_util(self, row):\n        \"\"\"\n        Utility function to solve the N-Queens problem recursively.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all queens are placed, we have found a solution\n        if row == self.n:\n            self.solution = self.board[:]\n            return True\n\n        # Try placing a queen in each column of the current row\n        for col in range(self.n):\n            if self.is_safe(row, col):\n                self.board[row] = col\n                # Recur to place the rest of the queens\n                if self.solve_util(row + 1):\n                    return True\n                # If placing queen in board[row] = col doesn't lead to a solution,\n                # then backtrack (the position is implicitly reset by the next loop iteration).\n        \n        # If no column works in this row, return False to trigger backtracking\n        return False\n\n    def find_solution(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes and runs the solver.\n        \"\"\"\n        if self.solve_util(0):\n            return self.solution\n        else:\n            return None\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the problem for a 16x16 board.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 16\n    print(f\"Solving for a {n}x{n} chessboard...\")\n    \n    solver = NQueensSolver(n)\n    solution_columns = solver.find_solution()\n\n    if solution_columns:\n        total_queens = len(solution_columns)\n        print(f\"\\nFound a solution for placing {total_queens} non-attacking queens.\")\n        \n        # We can arbitrarily color half the queens white and half black.\n        m = total_queens // 2\n        \n        print(f\"\\nThe problem asks for the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\")\n        print(f\"can coexist without attacking each other.
