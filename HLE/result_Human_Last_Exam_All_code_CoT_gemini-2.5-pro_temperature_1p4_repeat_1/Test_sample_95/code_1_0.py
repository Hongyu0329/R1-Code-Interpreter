def solve_riddle():
  """
  This function solves the riddle by analyzing its clues.
  
  The logic is as follows:
  1. The key clue is the location: Visible from Milan, but not from smoky cities in northern Europe.
  2. This points to a massive geographical feature. The Alps are famously visible from Milan on clear days.
  3. The name "Kasimir Graf" is a red herring. As a German, he is too far away to see the Alps,
     and the comment on his "imagination" is a joke about this impossibility.
  4. The plural "THEM" refers to the mountains that make up the Alps range.
