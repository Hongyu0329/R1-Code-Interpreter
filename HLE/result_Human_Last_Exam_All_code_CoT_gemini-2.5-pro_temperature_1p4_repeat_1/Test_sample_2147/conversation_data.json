    "The historical context of the question points to the intense cultural debates in Russia during the early 20th century. Pavel Milyukov, a liberal politician and historian, was a prominent \"Westernizer,\" but he was often critical of what he saw as the radical or decadent trends in modern Western culture.\n\nThe \"X-Y\" format and the subject of his denunciation strongly suggest he was referring to the **Cubo-Futurists**, a major Russian avant-garde art movement. This movement, which included artists like Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Mayakovsky, adapted the styles of French Cubism and Italian Futurism. These new art forms were shocking to many established figures, who saw them as a chaotic break from tradition. While the specific quote \"stagnant swamp\" is more famously attributed to other critics of the era (like Alexander Benois, who used it to describe an older, realist school of art), the sentiment of denouncing the avant-garde was one Milyukov likely shared.\n\nThe following Python code will identify and print the term.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term referred to in the user's question\n    about Pavel Milyukov's criticisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # X refers to \"Cubo\", an adaptation of the French art movement Cubism.\n    x = \"Cubo\"\n\n    # Y refers to \"Futurists\", an adaptation of the Italian art movement Futurism.\n    y = \"Futurists\"\n\n    # The combined term describes a major Russian avant-garde movement.\n    print(f\"The term X-Y denounced by critics like Pavel Milyukov was: {x}-{y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Cubo-Futurists>>>"
