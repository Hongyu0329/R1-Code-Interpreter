    a fully symmetric partition is arithmetically impossible.

    A fully symmetric partition requires one piece (A) to be composed of
    symmetry orbits. For an n x n grid where n is odd, the size of this
    piece must satisfy n^2/3 = 1 + 4*k4 + 8*k8 for some integers k4, k8.
    This simplifies to (n^2/3 - 1) being divisible by 4.
