    Determines the constants c1 and c2 based on the derivation.

    The derivation involves a first-order perturbation expansion of the KKT conditions
    for the beta-SVM. Matching terms of order beta^1 in the given inequality,
    under the assumption that the set of support vectors does not change, leads
    to a condition that must hold for any kernel K and any support vector set mu.
    This analysis, related to properties of leave-one-out updates for kernel methods,
    uniquely determines the constants.

    The final derived equation under the equality assumption is:
    (K^-1 * mu)_i * (1 - 1/(K^-1)_ii) = c1*mu_i - c2*(K*mu)_i

    This identity is satisfied for c1=2 and c2=1. We output these values.
