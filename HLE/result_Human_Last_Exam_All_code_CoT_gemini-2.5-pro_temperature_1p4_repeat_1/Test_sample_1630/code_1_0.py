    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer for the maximum
    number of fixed points for f(g(x)).

    The problem asks for the maximum number of fixed points of h(x) = f(g(x)),
    where f and g are degree-3 polynomials with positive derivatives.

    1. A fixed point satisfies the equation h(x) = x.
    2. The function h(x) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = 9.
    3. The equation h(x) - x = 0 is a polynomial equation of degree 9.
       By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it can have at most 9 real roots.
    4. To show that 9 is achievable, we consider the derivative of h(x) - x,
       which is h'(x) - 1. If h(x) - x has 9 real roots, h'(x) - 1 must have 8 real roots.
    5. h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) is a polynomial of degree (2*3) + 2 = 8.
       An 8th-degree polynomial equation h'(x) = 1 can have 8 real roots.
    6. The constraints f'(x)>0 and g'(x)>0 do not fundamentally prevent h'(x)
       from oscillating in a way that allows for 8 intersections with the line y=1.
       The space of possible polynomials f and g is large enough to allow for this behavior.

    Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.
