    "A fixed point of a function $H(x)$ is a value of $x$ such that $H(x) = x$. In this problem, we are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$.\n2.  Let's determine the degree of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Since $f$ and $g$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n3.  The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is therefore a polynomial equation of degree 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n4.  Now, we need to check if this maximum of 9 is achievable, given the constraints that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are quadratic polynomials. For them to be always positive, their leading coefficients must be positive and their discriminants must be negative.\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ implies that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ of two strictly increasing functions is also strictly increasing, since its derivative $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a product of two positive functions, and thus is always positive.\n5.  So, we are asking for the maximum number of intersections between the graph of a strictly increasing degree-9 polynomial $y = h(x)$ and the line $y = x$.\n6.  For the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative, $h'(x) - 1$, must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n7.  Let's examine the derivative $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a degree-2 polynomial.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a degree-3 polynomial.\n    *   $f'(y)$ is a degree-2 polynomial.\n    *   Therefore, $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The product $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n8.  So, the equation $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ is a degree-8 polynomial equation. It can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with the requirement from Rolle's theorem.\n9.  To have 8 real roots for $h'(x) = 1$, the graph of the degree-8 polynomial $y=h'(x)$ must intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ eight times.\n    *   Since the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ must be positive (to ensure $f', g' > 0$ for large $x$), the leading coefficient of $h'(x)$ is also positive. This means $h'(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n    *   For such a polynomial to cross $y=1$ eight times, it must have a \"wavy\" shape. Specifically, it must have 4 local minima and 3 local maxima. The values at the local minima must be less than 1, and the values at the local maxima must be greater than 1.\n    *   We also know $h'(x) > 0$, so the values at the local minima must be in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n10. The existence of 4 local minima and 3 local maxima for $h'(x)$ depends on its derivative, $h''(x)$, having 7 distinct real roots. The expression for $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. A degree-7 polynomial can indeed have 7 distinct real roots.\n11. While explicitly constructing such polynomials $f$ and $g$ is a very complex task, this theoretical analysis shows that there is no contradiction in assuming that 9 fixed points are possible. The parameters of the polynomials $f$ and $g$ provide enough degrees of freedom to construct a function $h(x)$ with the required properties.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9. The following Python code formalizes the printing of this result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer for the maximum\n    number of fixed points for f(g(x)).\n\n    The problem asks for the maximum number of fixed points of h(x) = f(g(x)),\n    where f and g are degree-3 polynomials with positive derivatives.\n\n    1. A fixed point satisfies the equation h(x) = x.\n    2. The function h(x) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = 9.\n    3. The equation h(x) - x = 0 is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n       By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, it can have at most 9 real roots.\n    4. To show that 9 is achievable, we consider the derivative of h(x) - x,\n       which is h'(x) - 1. If h(x) - x has 9 real roots, h'(x) - 1 must have 8 real roots.\n    5. h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) is a polynomial of degree (2*3) + 2 = 8.\n       An 8th-degree polynomial equation h'(x) = 1 can have 8 real roots.\n    6. The constraints f'(x)>0 and g'(x)>0 do not fundamentally prevent h'(x)\n       from oscillating in a way that allows for 8 intersections with the line y=1.\n       The space of possible polynomials f and g is large enough to allow for this behavior.\n\n    Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final equation can be considered as finding the maximum number of roots for\n    # a polynomial P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0. The maximum number is 9.\n    # While constructing an explicit example is highly complex, the theoretical\n    # argument shows that 9 is the maximum possible value.\n    # We output the result of this derivation.\n    \n    max_fixed_points = 9\n    \n    # The problem requests to \"output each number in the final equation!\".\n    # We interpret this as printing the final answer derived.\n    print(f\"The final answer is determined by the degree of the polynomial equation f(g(x)) - x = 0.\")\n    print(f\"Let N be the maximum number of fixed points.\")\n    print(f\"The equation for N is: N = 9\")\n    print(f\"{max_fixed_points}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
