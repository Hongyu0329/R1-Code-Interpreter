    "The user wants me to determine the IUPAC name of the product from a chemical reaction and present the solution using a script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene. The reagent is excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in THF under reflux, followed by an aqueous work-up. These are forcing conditions, implying the reaction will proceed as far as possible.\n2.  **Determine Reaction Type:** Grignard reagents react with aryl halides to replace the halogen atom with the organic group from the Grignard reagent. This is a nucleophilic substitution (specifically, a cross-coupling reaction like Kumada coupling).\n3.  **Assess Reactivity:** The reactivity of halogens in these reactions follows the order I > Br > Cl > F. The C-I bond is the weakest and will react first, followed by the C-Br bonds.\n4.  **Predict the Product:** Given the excess reagent and forcing conditions (reflux), it's expected that all halogen atoms will be substituted by phenyl groups. The halogens are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the final product will have phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring.\n5.  **Determine IUPAC Name:** The product is a benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   Parent: benzene\n    *   Substituents: 3 x phenyl\n    *   Prefix for three: tri-\n    *   Locants (positions): 1,2,3-\n    *   Combining these gives the name: **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n6.  **Develop a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that models this step-by-step substitution and programmatically constructs the final IUPAC name, printing out the components as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of the product of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene\n    and excess phenyl magnesium bromide.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
