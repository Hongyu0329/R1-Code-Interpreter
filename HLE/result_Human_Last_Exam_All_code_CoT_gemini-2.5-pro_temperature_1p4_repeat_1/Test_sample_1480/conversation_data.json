    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to combine the firing strength of the antecedent (`Phi_k(x′)`) with the membership grade of the consequent (`μG_k_j(y_j)`).\n\nA t-norm is a function that models the fuzzy logical AND operation. The most common t-norm used in fuzzy inference systems is the minimum operator. Therefore, we will calculate the minimum of the two given values.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Assign the given values, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, to variables.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values.\n3.  Print the equation and the resulting rule activation level.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rule_activation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level using a minimum t-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G = 0.9\n\n    # The t-norm operation is used to combine the antecedent firing strength\n    # with the consequent membership function. We will use the most common\n    # t-norm, which is the minimum operator.\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\n    print(f\"min({phi_k}, {mu_G}) = {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_rule_activation()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
