import sympy

# Define the symbol 'k'
k = sympy.Symbol('k')

# The computed limit is 1 - 1/(2k)
limit_expression = 1 - 1 / (2 * k)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# We will format the output as a string to show the expression clearly.
# For example, for k=2, the expression is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.
# For k=3, the expression is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.
# The general expression in terms of k is what we will print.

final_answer = "1 - 1 / (2 * k)"
print(final_answer)
