    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the members:** I will list the distinct mature microRNAs that belong to the human let-7 family based on established biological databases like miRBase.\n2.  **Create a list:** I will store the names of these members in a Python list.\n3.  **Count and display:** The Python script will then print each member of the family and calculate the total number by finding the length of the list. It will display this count as a sum of 1s for each member, finally printing the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_let7_family_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the members of the let-7 family\n    of microRNAs identified in humans.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The let-7 family in humans is comprised of several distinct mature miRNAs.\n    # While some are encoded at multiple genomic locations, they produce the same\n    # mature miRNA.
