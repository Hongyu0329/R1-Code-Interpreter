    print("Step 1: Understanding the formula φ")
    print("The problem describes a formula φ with n atomic variables (where n ≥ 2).")
    print("1. It has 2^(n-1) satisfying assignments. Out of a total of 2^n possible assignments, this is exactly half.")
    print("2. It is not a tautology. This is guaranteed by condition 1, since it's not true for all 2^n assignments.")
    print("3. For any two distinct satisfying assignments, they differ in at least one variable. This is always true for any two distinct assignments by definition, so it doesn't add a new constraint.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Relate the question to the concept of 'essential variables'.
    print("Step 2: Linking to the concept of Essential Variables")
    print("The question asks for the minimum number of variables in a logically equivalent formula ψ.")
    print("The minimum number of variables in any equivalent formula is equal to the number of 'essential' variables in the original formula φ.")
    print("A variable 'p' is essential if changing its truth value alone can change the truth value of φ.")
    print("Our goal is to find a valid φ with the minimum number of essential variables.")

    # Step 3: Construct a simple formula that satisfies the conditions.

    print("Let's consider the simplest possible case. Let φ depend on only one atomic variable, p_1, out of the n available variables.")
    print("Let the logical function of φ be simply p_1 (i.e., φ ≡ p_1).")
    print("\n")

    # Step 4: Verify that this simple formula works.
    print("Step 4: Verifying the Example")
    print("a) Satisfying Assignments: φ is true if and only if p_1 is true. The other n-1 variables can be anything, giving 2^(n-1) combinations. This condition is met.")
    print("b) Not a Tautology: φ is false when p_1 is false. This condition is met.")
    print("c) The third condition is met as explained in Step 1.")
    print("Therefore, a formula like φ ≡ p_1 is a valid example.")
    print("\n")
    
    # Step 5: Count the essential variables in our example.
    print("Step 5: Counting Essential Variables in the Example")
    print("- The variable p_1 is essential because changing its value directly changes the value of φ.")
    print("- Any other variable (p_2, ..., p_n) is not essential, as changing its value has no effect on φ.")
    print("So, this formula has exactly 1 essential variable.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 6: Prove this is the minimum possible number.
    print("Step 6: Proving Minimality")
    print("Could there be 0 essential variables?")
    print("A formula with 0 essential variables is a constant: either always True (a tautology) or always False (a contradiction).")
    print("- A tautology has 2^n satisfying assignments.")
    print("- A contradiction has 0 satisfying assignments.")
    print("Neither 2^n nor 0 is equal to the required 2^(n-1) assignments (since n ≥ 2).")
    print("Thus, the number of essential variables must be greater than 0.")
    print("\n")
