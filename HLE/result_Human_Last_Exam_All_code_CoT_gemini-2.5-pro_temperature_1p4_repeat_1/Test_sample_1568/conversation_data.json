    "An elegant closed-form expression for this infinite product can be found using the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function. Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Factor the Product Term**: The term inside the product, $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$, can be factored using the three cube roots of unity: $1$, $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$, and $\\omega^2 = e^{-i2\\pi/3}$. The factorization is:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Relate to the Gamma Function**: The infinite product from $n=1$ is related to the Gamma function. The Weierstrass product for the Gamma function gives us the identity:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{\\Gamma(1+x)} = \\frac{e^{\\gamma x}}{x\\Gamma(x)} $$\n    A more convenient form is:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{-\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\n\n3.  **Combine Three Products**: We can form a product of three such Gamma function expressions with $x = z$, $x = \\omega z$, and $x = \\omega^2 z$. When we multiply them, the exponential terms cancel out because the sum of the cube roots of unity is zero ($1 + \\omega + \\omega^2 = 0$). This yields the following beautiful identity for the product starting from $n=1$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n4.  **Adjust the Starting Index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. We can obtain this by taking the full product (starting from $n=1$) and dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n5.  **Final Result**: Substituting the Gamma function expression, we arrive at the final closed-form formula:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-ze^{i2\\pi/3})\\Gamma(1-ze^{-i2\\pi/3})} $$\n\nThe Python code below will print this final formula and explicitly list all the numbers that constitute it, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs and prints the closed-form expression\n    for the infinite product P = Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the numbers that appear in the product definition and final formula.\n    start_index = 3\n    power = 3\n    n1 = 1\n    n2 = 2\n    root_of_unity_numerator = 2\n    root_of_unity_denominator = 3\n\n    # Construct the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation\n    lhs = f\"Product_{{n={start_index} to infinity}} (1 - z^{power}/n^{power})\"\n\n    # Construct the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation\n    term1_simple = f\"(1 - z^{power})\"\n    term2 = f\"(1 - z^{power}/{n2**power})\"\n    gamma1 = f\"Gamma(1 - z)\"\n    gamma2 = f\"Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*{root_of_unity_numerator}*pi/{root_of_unity_denominator}))\"\n    gamma3 = f\"Gamma(1 - z*exp(-i*{root_of_unity_numerator}*pi/{root_of_unity_denominator}))\"\n\n    rhs_numerator = \"1\"\n    rhs_denominator = f\"{term1_simple} * {term2} * {gamma1} * {gamma2} * {gamma3}\"\n\n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"The value of the infinite product is given by the equation:\")\n    print()\n    print(f\"{lhs} = \\n\")\n    print(f\"    {rhs_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"    {rhs_denominator}\")\n    print()\n    print(\"Where 'Gamma' is the Gamma function, 'exp' is the exponential function,\")\n    print(\"'i' is the imaginary unit, and 'pi' is the mathematical constant pi.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Per instructions, outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"The numbers that appear in this final equation are:\")\n    # Numbers are from the LHS\n    print(f\"Start index of product: {start_index}\")\n    print(f\"Power of z and n: {power}\")\n    # Numbers from the RHS\n    print(f\"Numerator: {n1}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent in the (1 - z^3) term: {power}\")\n    print(f\"Base in the (1 - z^3/8) term: {n2}\")\n    print(f\"Resulting denominator ({n2}^{power}): {n2**power}\")\n    print(f\"Constant term in Gamma argument '1 - z': 1\")\n    print(f\"Numerator for pi in exp argument: {root_of_unity_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"Denominator for pi in exp argument: {root_of_unity_denominator}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_and_print_formula()\n```\n<<<1/((1-z^3)*(1-z^3/8)*Gamma(1-z)*Gamma(1-z*exp(i*2*pi/3))*Gamma(1-z*exp(-i*2*pi/3)))>>>"
