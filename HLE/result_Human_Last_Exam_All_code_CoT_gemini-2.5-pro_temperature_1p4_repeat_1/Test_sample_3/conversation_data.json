    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we need to know which torsion structures are possible over this specific field.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Possible Torsion Structures:** We will consult the classification theorems for torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields. A key result by Mazur lists the groups possible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, and further results by Kenku, Momose, and Najman classify the groups over general quadratic fields.\n2.  **Filter for $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** Not all possible torsion groups for quadratic fields can be realized over any given one. We will use specific results that tell us which groups can appear over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This set includes:\n    *   The non-cyclic groups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as any elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can be considered over $K$).\n    *   Additional non-cyclic groups that are known to appear over $K$ but not over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n3.  **Calculate Orders:** For each possible non-cyclic group, which is of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$, we will calculate its order, which is $M \\times N$.\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** We will determine the largest order among all possibilities.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan by defining the possible groups and calculating their orders to find the maximum.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify non-cyclic torsion groups possible over Q.\")\n    print(\"By Mazur's Theorem, these are Z/2Z x Z/2NZ for N in {1, 2, 3, 4}.\")\n    \n    # Non-cyclic groups that can be realized over Q\n    groups_over_Q = [\n        (2, 2),  # Z/2Z x Z/2Z\n        (2, 4),  # Z/2Z x Z/4Z\n        (2, 6),  # Z/2Z x Z/6Z\n        (2, 8)   # Z/2Z x Z/8Z\n    ]\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify additional non-cyclic groups possible over Q(sqrt(-3)).\")\n    print(\"According to classification theorems for quadratic fields (e.g., F.
