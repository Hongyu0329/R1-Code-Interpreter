    # Step 1: Explain the grammatical context.
    # In Latin, a prefix and a verb can form a single compound verb.
    # For example, "prae" (before) + "venio" (I come) = "praevenio" (I come before/anticipate).
    # The present participle would be "praeveniens".
    prefix = "prae"
    verb_participle = "veniens"
    intervening_word = "diem"

    print(f"In this line, we see the prefix '{prefix}-' and the verb participle '{verb_participle}'.")
    print(f"Normally, these could form a single compound word, 'praeveniens'.")
    print("\n")

    # Step 2: Identify the separation.
    print(f"However, Vergil has separated them and inserted the word '{intervening_word}' in between:")
    print(f"'{prefix}que {intervening_word} {verb_participle}'")
