    # Step 1: Analyze the hemolymph pathway (Pathway B)
    print("Fact 1: Overexpressing Imp-L2 (a Dilp2-binding protein) in the fat body 'soaks up' Dilp2 in the hemolymph.")
    print("Result 1: When hemolymph Dilp2 is soaked up, neural stem cells fail to reactivate.")
    print("\nConclusion 1: This experiment directly shows that Dilp2 from the hemolymph is NECESSARY for neural stem cell reactivation. If this pathway is blocked, the process fails. So, 'B. Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph' must be part of the answer.")
    print("="*50)

    # Step 2: Analyze the DRN transport pathway (Pathway A)
    print("Fact 2: Dilp2 is transported from IPCs to the DRNs.")
    print("Result 2: Inhibiting DRN activity causes a DELAY in neural stem cell reactivation.")
    print("\nConclusion 2: If this pathway were irrelevant, inhibiting it would have no effect. The fact that its inhibition causes a delay means this pathway is also functionally IMPORTANT for a normal, timely reactivation. So, 'A. Dilp2 transported to the DRNs' is also involved in the process.")

    # Step 3: Synthesize the conclusions
    print("Synthesis:")
    print("- From Conclusion 1, we know the hemolymph pathway (B) is essential.")
    print("- From Conclusion 2, we know the DRN pathway (A) is also functionally important.")
    print("- Therefore, both pathways contribute to driving neural stem cell reactivation.")
    print("\nFinal logical conclusion: Both A and B are the sources.")
