    # Group H = <a,b | a^2=b^2=1> = C_2 * C_2 (the infinite dihedral group)
    # Group G = H * H
    # Group P = pro-p completion of G, for p an odd prime.

    # Question 1: What is the cohomological dimension of H?
    # H has torsion elements (a, b of order 2).
    # A group with torsion has infinite cohomological dimension.
    ans1 = "oo"

    # Question 2: What is the cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H * H also has torsion.
    ans2 = "oo"

    # Question 3: What is the virtual cohomological dimension of H?
    # H contains an infinite cyclic subgroup <ab> of index 2. This subgroup is torsion-free.
    # The cohomological dimension of the infinite cyclic group Z is 1.
    # So, vcd(H) = 1.
    ans3 = 1

    # Question 4: What is the virtual cohomological dimension of G?
    # G = H * H. G has a finite-index torsion-free subgroup K. By the Kurosh subgroup theorem,
    # K is a non-trivial free group. The cohomological dimension of any non-trivial free group is 1.
    # So, vcd(G) = 1.
    ans4 = 1

    # Question 5: How many ends does H have?
    # By Stallings' theorem, a group has 2 ends if and only if it has an infinite
    # cyclic subgroup of finite index. H has <ab> of index 2.
    ans5 = 2

    # Question 6: How many ends does G have?
    # G = H * H is a free product over the trivial subgroup {1}.
    # By Stallings' theorem, such a group has infinitely many ends.
    ans6 = "oo"

    # Question 7: What is the cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # Since p is an odd prime, the pro-p completion of a group of order 2 (like C_2) is trivial.
    # The pro-p completion of H = C_2 * C_2 is trivial.
    # The pro-p completion of G = H * H is the free pro-p product of two trivial groups, which is trivial.
    # The cohomological dimension of the trivial group is 0.
    ans7 = 0

    # Question 8: What is the virtual cohomological dimension of P as a pro-p group?
    # P is the trivial group, so its vcd is also 0.
    ans8 = 0

    # Question 9: What is the dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G,F_p)?
    # H^1(G,F_p) is isomorphic to Hom(G, F_p).
    # Hom(G, F_p) is isomorphic to Hom(G_ab, F_p), where G_ab is the abelianization of G.
    # G_ab = (H * H)_ab = H_ab x H_ab = (C_2 x C_2) x (C_2 x C_2) = (C_2)^4.
    # A homomorphism from (C_2)^4 to F_p (for p odd) must send every element to 0.
    # Thus, Hom(G, F_p) is the trivial group, and its dimension as an F_p-vector space is 0.
    ans9 = 0

    # Format the final answer as a comma-separated list.
    # The problem statement uses 'oo' for infinity.
