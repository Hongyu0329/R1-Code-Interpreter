    "An elementary cellular automaton evolves a row of cells (represented as a binary string) based on a specific rule. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. There are 256 such rules, numbered 0 to 255.\n\nTo solve this, we need to find a rule `R` that transforms the initial state (`01101001`) into an intermediate state, and then transforms that intermediate state into the final state (`10000111`). Since the problem states there is only one valid solution, we can systematically check all 256 possible rules.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Iterate through every possible rule from 0 to 255.\n2.  For each rule, apply it to the top row (`01101001`) to generate a potential intermediate row. Let's assume periodic boundary conditions, where the ends of the row wrap around.\n3.  Apply the *same rule* to this newly generated intermediate row to produce a new bottom row.\n4.  Compare this new bottom row with the given bottom row (`10000111`).\n5.  If they match, we have found the correct rule and the corresponding unique intermediate row. I will then print this intermediate row.\n\n```python\ndef find_intermediate_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    top_row = \"01101001\"\n    bottom_row = \"10000111\"\n    n = len(top_row)\n    \n    solutions = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules\n    for rule_number in range(256):\n        # Format the rule number as an 8-bit binary string (e.g., 30 -> \"00011110\")\n        # This string defines the output for neighborhoods 111, 110, ..., 000\n        rule_bits = format(rule_number, '08b')\n\n        # === Step 1: Generate the potential middle row from the top row ===\n        potential_middle_row = \"\"\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get the 3-cell neighborhood using periodic (wrapping) boundaries\n            left_cell = top_row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center_cell = top_row[i]\n            right_cell = top_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            neighborhood = f\"{left_cell}{center_cell}{right_cell}\"\n            \n            # Convert the binary neighborhood to an integer (0-7)\n            neighborhood_value = int(neighborhood, 2)\n            \n            # The rule bits are for neighborhoods 111 down to 000.\n            # So, the bit for \"111\" (value 7) is at index 0, \"110\" (value 6) at index 1, etc.\n            new_cell = rule_bits[7 - neighborhood_value]\n            potential_middle_row += new_cell\n\n        # === Step 2: Generate the next row from our potential middle row ===\n        calculated_bottom_row = \"\"\n        for i in range(n):\n            left_cell = potential_middle_row[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center_cell = potential_middle_row[i]\n            right_cell = potential_middle_row[(i + 1) % n]\n            neighborhood = f\"{left_cell}{center_cell}{right_cell}\"\n            neighborhood_value = int(neighborhood, 2)\n            new_cell = rule_bits[7 - neighborhood_value]\n            calculated_bottom_row += new_cell\n\n        # === Step 3: Check if our result matches the given bottom row ===\n        if calculated_bottom_row == bottom_row:\n            solutions.append(potential_middle_row)\n\n    # Since the problem guarantees a single solution, we print the first one found.\n    if solutions:\n        print(solutions[0])\n    else:\n        print(\"No solution was found.\")\n\nfind_intermediate_step()\n<<<10111010>>>"
