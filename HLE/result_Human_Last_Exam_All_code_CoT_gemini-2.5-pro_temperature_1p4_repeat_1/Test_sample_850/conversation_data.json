    "Based on fundamental principles of crystallography and optics, the properties of being \"achiral\" and having \"optical activity\" are mutually exclusive. Here is a step-by-step plan to demonstrate this.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Physical Principles:**\n    *   A crystal class is **optically active** if, and only if, it is **chiral**.\n    *   A crystal class is **chiral** if it lacks all improper rotation symmetry operations (i.e., no center of inversion, no mirror planes, no rotoinversion axes).\n    *   A crystal class is **achiral** if it possesses at least one improper rotation symmetry operation. It is, by definition, not chiral.\n    *   A crystal class is **non-polar** if it does not have a unique axis with different properties at opposite ends (i.e., no spontaneous electric dipole moment). All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar, as are several non-centrosymmetric ones.\n\n2.  **Identify the Incompatibility:** From the definitions, a crystal class cannot be both achiral and optically active. The question is based on a contradictory premise.\n\n3.  **Code Demonstration:** I will write a Python script to prove this. The script will:\n    *   Define sets containing the 32 crystal classes categorized by their properties: achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    *   Find the intersection of these three sets.\n    *   Print the initial sets and the final intersection, which will be empty, thereby demonstrating that no crystal class satisfies all three conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes based on a combination of symmetry properties.\n\n    The user is asking for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n    1. Achiral\n    2. Non-polar\n    3.
