    To solve this, we must identify the option that fails to encourage critical thinking or accountability, and may even increase over-reliance on AI.

    - A. Encouraging teacher accountability: This forces teachers to be more vigilant and personally responsible for the outcome, which combats automation bias. This is a good mitigation strategy.

    - B. Displaying AI confidence levels: This provides crucial context, signaling when the AI's suggestion is less certain and should be scrutinized more carefully. This combats automation bias.

    - C. Regular practice using AI tools: Practice can help users learn the system's limitations and failure modes, leading to more appropriate reliance. This can be a valid mitigation strategy.
    
    - E. Requiring justification for decisions: This forces teachers to actively think through the AI's suggestion and articulate their own reasoning, preventing passive acceptance. This combats automation bias.

    - D. Making the AI advice more salient on the interface: Salience means making something more prominent (e.g., with size, color, or placement). This makes the AI's recommendation more visually and cognitively demanding of attention, encouraging the user to default to it without critical thought. This is known to increase, not decrease, automation bias.
