    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions with other particles. The state of this particle is characterized by quantum numbers, collectively labeled as $k$ (e.g., momentum), and each state has a corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space. The Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a particle with momentum $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ is given by a simple formula.\n\nHere is the plan to explain and demonstrate this relationship:\n1.  State the fundamental equation for the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ in terms of the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  Explain the physical meaning of each term in the equation.\n3.  Describe the functional dependence, which is an inverse relationship. The key feature is that $G_0$ has a \"pole\" (it diverges) when the frequency $\\omega$ of the particle matches its energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n4.
