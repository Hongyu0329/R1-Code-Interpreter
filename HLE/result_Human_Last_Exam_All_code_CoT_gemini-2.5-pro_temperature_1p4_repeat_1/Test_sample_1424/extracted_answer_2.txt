The bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The functional form is given by the equation $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta}$, where $i\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term.
