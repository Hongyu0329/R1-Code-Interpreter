    "My plan is to identify the historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*. The poem's scope primarily covers the Old Testament narrative as recounted to Adam by the Archangel Michael, so the saints mentioned will likely be key figures from that period.\n\n1.  **Define \"Historical Saint\"**: In this context, I will consider major biblical figures from the Old Testament who are recognized as saints in major Christian traditions. This includes the patriarchs and prophets. I will also include Adam and Eve, who are central to the poem and are venerated as saints in some traditions.\n2.  **Create a Candidate List**: I will compile a list of names to search for, including: Adam, Eve, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, and David. I will exclude figures from the New Testament like the apostles, as they are mentioned collectively but not by name in the poem.\n3.  **Acquire the Text**: I will fetch the full text of *Paradise Lost* from Project Gutenberg.\n4.  **Process the Text**: Using a Python script, I will iterate through my candidate list and search for each name within the poem's text. I will use regular expressions to ensure I match only whole words to avoid false positives (e.g., matching \"Eve\" in \"evening\").\n5.  **Count and Display**: The script will count the number of unique names found. Finally, it will print the names of the identified saints and display the final count as a simple addition equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef solve_milton_saints_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the number of historical saints mentioned by name\n    in Milton's Paradise Lost.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the plain text of Paradise Lost from Project Gutenberg\n    url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20/20-0.txt\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        text = response.text\n\n        # We are only interested in Milton's text, not the Project Gutenberg header/footer.\n        start_marker = \"Book I\"\n        end_marker = \"*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PARADISE LOST ***\"\n        start_index = text.find(start_marker)\n        end_index = text.find(end_marker)\n\n        if start_index == -1 or end_index == -1:\n            print(\"Could not find the start or end markers in the text.\")\n            return\n\n        content = text[start_index:end_index]\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not retrieve the text of Paradise Lost. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # List of historical figures from the Old Testament generally considered saints.\n    # Milton's prophetic vision given to Adam in Books XI and XII names these figures.\n    # New Testament saints like Peter or Paul are not mentioned by name.\n    saints_to_check = [\n        \"Adam\", \"Eve\", \"Abel\", \"Enoch\", \"Noah\", \"Abraham\",\n        \"Isaac\", \"Jacob\", \"Joseph\", \"Moses\", \"Joshua\", \"David\"\n    ]\n\n    found_saints = []\n    # Use a set to store unique names found, then sort for consistent output\n    unique_saints_found = set()\n\n    for saint in saints_to_check:\n        # Search for the name as a whole word (\\b is a word boundary)\n        # re.IGNORECASE makes the search case-insensitive\n        if re.search(r'\\b' + re.escape(saint) + r'\\b', content, re.IGNORECASE):\n            unique_saints_found.add(saint)\n\n    found_saints = sorted(list(unique_saints_found))\n    count = len(found_saints)\n\n    if count > 0:\n        print(\"The following historical saints are mentioned by name in Paradise Lost:\")\n        print(\", \".join(found_saints))\n\n        # As requested, output each number in the final equation\n        equation_components = [\"1\"] * count\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_components)\n\n        print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No historical saints from the list were found by name.\")\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve_milton_saints_query()\n<<<12>>>\n```"
