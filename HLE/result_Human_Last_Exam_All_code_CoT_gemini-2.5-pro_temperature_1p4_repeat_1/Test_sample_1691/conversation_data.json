    "An analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ can be found by analyzing the behavior of the integrand near $x=0$. The dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region where $\\epsilon$ is of the same order as the leading terms of the polynomial in the denominator.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the dominant behavior**: For small $\\epsilon$, the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ is dominated by the region where $x$ is small. In this region, the denominator is approximately $\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n2.  **Asymptotic Expansion**: We use an asymptotic expansion method. By performing a change of variables (scaling) $x = (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} y$, we can transform the integral into a form that can be expanded in powers of $\\epsilon$.\n3.  **Derive the formula**: This expansion shows that the integral can be approximated by a series in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$. We will compute the first two terms of this series to obtain a more accurate approximation. The resulting formula will be of the form:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\cdot \\epsilon^a + B \\cdot \\epsilon^b$\n4.  **Calculate Coefficients**: The coefficients $A, B$ and powers $a, b$ depend on the coefficients and powers of the polynomial in the original integral ($p_0=9.0, n=5.0$ and $p_1=5.0, m=6.0$).\n    - The leading term is $A \\epsilon^a = (p_0^{-1/n} \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}) \\epsilon^{-(n-1)/n}$.\n    - The first correction term is $B \\epsilon^b$, where the calculation involves the term $p_1 x^m$.\n5.  **Final Code**: The Python code below calculates these constants and powers and prints the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients and exponents for the asymptotic formula of the integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the integral denominator: epsilon + p0*x^n + p1*x^m + ...\n    p0 = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n    p1 = 5.0\n    m = 6.0\n\n    # Exponent of the leading term\n    a = (1.0 - n) / n\n\n    # Coefficient of the leading term\n    # A = p0**(-1/n) * integral(dy / (1+y**n)) from 0 to inf\n    # The integral is known to be (pi/n) / sin(pi/n)\n    A = math.pow(p0, -1.0 / n) * (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n\n    # Exponent of the first correction term\n    # This is derived from the expansion, which gives a power of epsilon\n    # as -(n-1)/n + (m-n)/n = (m - 2n + 1)/n\n    b = (m - 2.0 * n + 1.0) / n\n\n    # Coefficient of the first correction term, B.\n    # The derivation shows that the coefficient is:\n    # B = -p1 * p0**(-(m+1)/n) * integral(y**m / (1+y**n)**2)\n    # The integral part evaluates to (1/n) * Beta((m+1)/n, 2 - (m+1)/n)\n    # Using the reflection formula for the Beta function, this becomes:\n    # Beta((m+1)/n, 2-(m+1)/n) = Beta(7/5, 3/5) which is (2*pi)/(5*sin(2*pi/5))\n    # The term p1=5 gets canceled by the 1/n=1/5 from the integral evaluation.\n    # So B = -p0**(-(m+1)/n) * Beta((m+1)/n, 2-(m+1)/n)\n    \n    # We use m=6, n=5.
