    "The Justified True Belief (JTB) model is a foundational concept in epistemology, but it faces significant challenges beyond the famous Gettier problems. Here is a breakdown of two fundamental issues it encounters, presented within the requested coding format.\n\nMy plan is to address the philosophical question by embedding the answer within a Python script.\n1.  First, I will identify two core problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, specifically focusing on the \"Justification\" component as requested, and ignoring Gettier cases.\n2.  The first problem is the inherent ambiguity of the term \"justification.\" The JTB model doesn't define how strong evidence must be or what kind of reasoning qualifies as justification. This leads to unresolved debates, such as internalism vs. externalism.\n3.  The second problem is the \"regress problem.\" If every belief requires justification, then the justification itself needs a justification, leading to an infinite regress, circular reasoning, or an arbitrary stopping point.\n4.  I will then write a Python script that uses a multiline string to explain these two problems clearly.\n5.  Finally, the script will print this explanation to the console, fulfilling the user's request.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two non-Gettier problems with the JTB definition of knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge faces several issues beyond Gettier problems. Given the constraints, here are two fundamental problems stemming from the \"Justification\" condition:\n\n1. The Ambiguity of \"Justification\"\n\nThe JTB theory states a belief must be \"justified,\" but it fails to define what level or kind of justification is sufficient for knowledge. This ambiguity creates major issues:\n- How much evidence is enough? The theory doesn't provide a standard to distinguish between a weakly supported opinion and a belief justified enough to be called knowledge.\n- Is justification internal or external? Is it based on factors within the believer's mind (internalism), like their own reasoning? Or is it based on external factors, like the reliability of the belief-forming process (externalism)? The JTB model doesn't specify, leaving a core component of the definition unresolved.\n\n2. The Regress Problem of Justification\n\nThis problem, also known as the Agrippan Trilemma, challenges the very foundation of justification. If every belief must be justified, then what justifies the justification itself? This leads to three problematic outcomes:\n- Infinite Regress: The chain of justification (Belief A is justified by B, which is justified by C...) goes on forever, never reaching a solid foundation.\n- Circular Reasoning: The chain of justification eventually circles back on itself (A is justified by B, which is justified by A). This makes the system coherent but potentially detached from truth.\n- Arbitrary Stop (Foundationalism): The chain stops at a \"foundational\" belief that is accepted without justification. This seems arbitrary and violates the initial rule that beliefs must be justified.\n\nThe JTB framework requires justification but offers no solution to this trilemma, undermining its claim to be a complete definition of knowledge.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are the ambiguity of what constitutes sufficient 'justification' and the unresolved 'regress problem' of how justification is ultimately grounded.>>>"
