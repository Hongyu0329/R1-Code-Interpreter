    Explains two non-Gettier problems with the JTB definition of knowledge.
    """

    explanation = """
The JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge faces several issues beyond Gettier problems. Given the constraints, here are two fundamental problems stemming from the "Justification" condition:

1. The Ambiguity of "Justification"

The JTB theory states a belief must be "justified," but it fails to define what level or kind of justification is sufficient for knowledge. This ambiguity creates major issues:
- How much evidence is enough? The theory doesn't provide a standard to distinguish between a weakly supported opinion and a belief justified enough to be called knowledge.
- Is justification internal or external? Is it based on factors within the believer's mind (internalism), like their own reasoning? Or is it based on external factors, like the reliability of the belief-forming process (externalism)? The JTB model doesn't specify, leaving a core component of the definition unresolved.

2. The Regress Problem of Justification

This problem, also known as the Agrippan Trilemma, challenges the very foundation of justification. If every belief must be justified, then what justifies the justification itself? This leads to three problematic outcomes:
- Infinite Regress: The chain of justification (Belief A is justified by B, which is justified by C...) goes on forever, never reaching a solid foundation.
- Circular Reasoning: The chain of justification eventually circles back on itself (A is justified by B, which is justified by A). This makes the system coherent but potentially detached from truth.
- Arbitrary Stop (Foundationalism): The chain stops at a "foundational" belief that is accepted without justification. This seems arbitrary and violates the initial rule that beliefs must be justified.

The JTB framework requires justification but offers no solution to this trilemma, undermining its claim to be a complete definition of knowledge.
