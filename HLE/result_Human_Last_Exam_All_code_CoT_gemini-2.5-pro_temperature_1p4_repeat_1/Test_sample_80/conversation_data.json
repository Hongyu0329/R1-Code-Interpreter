    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Calculate the Total Number of Edge Squares:** An 8x8 chessboard has 4 sides. The top and bottom rows each have 8 squares. The left and right columns also have 8 squares each, but the 4 corner squares would be counted twice. A simpler way is to count the full top and bottom rows (8 + 8 = 16) and then the remaining squares on the side columns (6 + 6 = 12). So, the total number of edge squares is 16 + 12 = 28.\n\n2.  **Understand Bishop Placement Rules:** The key constraint is that no two bishops can attack each other, meaning they cannot share a diagonal. A crucial property of bishops is that a bishop on a light-colored square can only attack other light-colored squares, and a bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack other dark-colored squares.\n\n3.  **Maximize the Number of Bishops:** To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we should place them all on squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares are perfectly divided into 14 light squares and 14 dark squares. No two edge squares of the same color lie on the same diagonal. Therefore, we can place a bishop on every single edge square of one color. The maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge is 14.\n\n4.  **Calculate Empty Squares:** If we place the maximum number of bishops (14) on the 28 available edge squares, the number of empty squares is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** 28 total edge squares - 14 bishops = 14 empty squares.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares on a chessboard after placing\n    the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares on an 8x8 board.\n    # An 8x8 board has 8 squares on the top and bottom rows, and 6 unique\n    # squares on the left and right columns (excluding corners).\n    total_edge_squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n    # Bishops attack along diagonals of the same color.\n    # The 28 edge squares are split evenly: 14 light and 14 dark.\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, we can fill all\n    # edge squares of a single color.\n    max_bishops_placed = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate how many edge squares are left without bishops.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_placed\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"To find the number of empty edge squares, we subtract the maximum number of bishops placed from the total number of edge squares.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_placed} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
