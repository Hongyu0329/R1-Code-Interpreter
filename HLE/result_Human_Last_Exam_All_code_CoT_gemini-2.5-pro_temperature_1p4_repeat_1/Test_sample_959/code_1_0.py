# The problem reduces to finding the order of the outer automorphism group
# of a single central extension E.
# Our analysis showed that E is isomorphic to the cyclic group C of order 31.

# Let n be the order of the cyclic group C.
n = 31

# The order of the outer automorphism group of C_n, o(E), is phi(n),
# where phi is Euler's totient function.
# For a prime number n, phi(n) is simply n - 1.
result = n - 1

# The sum is over a single element, so the sum is the result itself.
# The final calculation is Sum = o(E) = phi(31) = 31 - 1 = 30.
# The numbers in this final equation are 31, 1, and 30.
