    # Part (a): True or False
    # In the doubling construction, the number of ND-pairs any single element
    # (x, i) is part of (i.e., its degree in the ND-graph) is (v-1)(2v-1)/3.
    # The statement claims this value is v-1.
    # For v >= 4, (v-1)(2v-1)/3 > v-1, because (2v-1)/3 > 1.
    # Therefore, the statement is false.

    # Part (b): Expression for multiplicity
    # The multiplicity of a pure pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is the sum of two parts:
    # 1. A contribution from the mu blocks where {x, y} is an ND-pair in SQS(v). Each such block contributes 2. Total: 2*mu.
    # 2. A contribution from the blocks that contain {x, y} but not as an ND-pair. The number of such blocks is r_2 - mu, where r_2 = (v-2)/2. Each such block contributes 1. Total: r_2 - mu.
    # The total multiplicity is 2*mu + (r_2 - mu) = mu + r_2 = mu + (v-2)/2.

    # Part (c): Yes or No
    # We check if any ND-pair in SQS(2v) can have multiplicity v.
    # 1. For mixed pairs like {(x, 0), (y, 1)}, the multiplicity is exactly 1. Since v >= 4, this cannot be v.
    # 2. For pure pairs like {(x, 0), (y, 0)}, the multiplicity is mu + (v-2)/2.
    # The multiplicity mu for the pair {x, y} in SQS(v) must be less than or equal to the total number of blocks containing {x, y}, which is r_2 = (v-2)/2.
    # So, mu <= (v-2)/2.
    # Therefore, the maximum multiplicity of a pure pair is (v-2)/2 + (v-2)/2 = v-2.
    # Since v >= 4, v-2 is strictly less than v.
    # Thus, no ND-pair can have a multiplicity of exactly v.
