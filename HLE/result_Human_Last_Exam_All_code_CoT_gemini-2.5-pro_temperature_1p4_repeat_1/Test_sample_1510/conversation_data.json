    "There are 17 wallpaper groups in total, each describing a distinct symmetry pattern in a two-dimensional plane. These groups are classified based on their point groups, which are the set of symmetry operations (like rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. The \"order\" of a point group is simply the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe task is to find how many of these 17 wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2. A point group of order 2 contains two operations: the identity operation (doing nothing) and one other operation, which can either be a 180-degree rotation (a 2-fold rotation, C₂) or a reflection (D₁).\n\nI will write a Python script to solve this. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure (a dictionary) that maps the names of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of their respective point groups.\n2.  Iterate through this dictionary to find the groups where the point group order is exactly 2.\n3.  Store the names of these qualifying groups in a list.\n4.  Print the names of the found groups and display the final count as a simple addition equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    It stores all 17 wallpaper groups and their point group orders in a dictionary,\n    then filters them to find the ones that match the condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 17 wallpaper groups and their point group orders.\n    # The key is the group name (IUC notation) and the value is the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'p2mm': 4,\n        'p2mg': 4,\n        'p2gg': 4,\n        'c2mm': 4,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4mm': 8,\n        'p4gm': 8,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    # Find the groups with a point group of order 2\n    groups_of_order_2 = [name for name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items() if order == 2]\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are: {', '.join(groups_of_order_2)}\")\n\n    count = len(groups_of_order_2)\n    \n    # Create the equation string like \"1 + 1 + ... = total\"\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n    equation_str = ' + '.join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"There are a total of {count} such groups.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
