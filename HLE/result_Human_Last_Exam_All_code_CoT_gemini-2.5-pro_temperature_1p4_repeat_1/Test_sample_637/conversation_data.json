    "To design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system, our goal is to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error converges to zero in the shortest possible time. The observer dynamics are given by:\n\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\n\nThe error dynamics, `e(k+1) = x(k+1) - x_hat(k+1)`, can be derived as:\n\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor a deadbeat response, we need to make the error `e(k)` go to zero as quickly as possible. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin of the complex plane (i.e., at zero).\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. We can solve it by considering the dual of our observer problem, which is a state-feedback control problem. The eigenvalues of `(A - LC)` are the same as the eigenvalues of its transpose, `(A^T - C^T L^T)`.\n\nIf we consider a control system with system matrix `A_dual = A^T` and input matrix `B_dual = C^T`, and we design a state-feedback controller with gain `K`, the closed-loop system matrix is `(A^T - C^T K)`. Our pole placement problem is equivalent to finding a gain `K` for this dual system that places all its poles at zero. The desired observer gain `L` is then simply the transpose of this gain `K` (i.e., `L = K^T`).\n\nThe following Python script uses the `python-control` library to solve this pole placement problem and find the gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\n# Set print options for a clear matrix output\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# Define the system matrices as given in the problem\nA = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n              [1, 0, 0, 2],\n              [0, 1, 0, -1],\n              [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n\nC = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n              [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n# The number of states determines the number of poles to place\nn = A.shape[0]\n\n# For a deadbeat observer, all desired poles are at the origin\npoles = np.zeros(n)\n\n# We can design the observer by using pole placement on the dual system.\n# The `control.place` function calculates a state-feedback gain K for a system.\n# We want to find L such that eigenvalues of (A - LC) are at the origin.\n# This is equivalent to finding K = L^T for the dual system (A^T, C^T)\n# such that eigenvalues of (A^T - C^T*K) are at the origin.\n\ntry:\n    # Calculate the state-feedback gain for the dual system (A.T, C.T)\n    K_for_dual = ct.place(A.T, C.T, poles)\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the calculated gain K.\n    L = K_for_dual.T\n\n    # Print the final observer gain matrix\n    print(\"The designed observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred during pole placement: {e}\")\n    print(\"Please ensure the system (A, C) is observable.\")\n\n```\n<<<[[ 1. -2.]\n [ 1.  1.]\n [-2.  1.]\n [ 1. -2.]]>>>"
