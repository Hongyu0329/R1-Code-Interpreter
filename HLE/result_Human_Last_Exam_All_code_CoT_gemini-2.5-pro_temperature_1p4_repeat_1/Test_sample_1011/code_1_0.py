def solve_ultrafilter_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem regarding the smallest number of accumulation points.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points for a set
    U = {u_1, u_2, ...} where u_i are nonprincipal ultrafilters on N and each u_i
    contains a set P_i from a partition P = {P_1, P_2, ...} of N into infinite sets.

    1. The space of nonprincipal ultrafilters, N*, is a compact topological space.
    2. The set U = {u_1, u_2, ...} is a countably infinite subset of N* (the u_i must be distinct).
    3. Any infinite subset of a compact space must have at least one accumulation point.
       Therefore, the number of accumulation points is >= 1.

    4. We need to check if it's possible to construct a scenario with exactly 1 accumulation point.
    5. This can be achieved if we can choose the partition P_i and the ultrafilters u_i
       such that for any subset A of N, the set of indices {i | A is in u_i} is either
       finite or cofinite. A sequence of ultrafilters with this property is called a
       "coherent sequence".

    6. A theorem by KatÄ›tov confirms that such a coherent sequence of ultrafilters can indeed be constructed
       for any given partition of N into disjoint infinite sets.

    7. If such a sequence is constructed, there is a single accumulation point v, which is
       the ultrafilter defined by: A is in v if and only if {i | A is in u_i} is cofinite.
       Any choice of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the index set will yield this same limit point.

    8. Since the number of accumulation points must be at least 1, and it is possible to
       construct a case with exactly 1, the smallest possible number is 1.
