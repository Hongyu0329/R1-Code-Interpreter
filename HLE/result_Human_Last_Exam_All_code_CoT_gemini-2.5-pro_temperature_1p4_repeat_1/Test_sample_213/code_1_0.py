    This function restores the single character that was removed from the shader code.
    The bug is located in the snoise function. A variable `n_` is defined, which is a common naming convention.
    This variable is used in the next line to calculate `ns`.
    The bug introduced was the removal of the underscore `_` from the variable's definition,
    changing `float n_ = ...;` to `float n = ...;`.
    This causes a compilation error in the following line because the identifier `n_` is no longer defined.
    The original, correct line is the definition with the underscore.
