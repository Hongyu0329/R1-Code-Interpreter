    # Step 1: Reaction of [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene with potassium tert-butoxide
    explanation_1 = """1. Reaction 1: Formation of Product A

- Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene is a secondary alkyl halide. The structure is a phenyl group attached to a butyl chain, with a bromine on the third carbon: Ph-CH2-CH2-CH(Br)-CH3. The stereocenter at C3 has an (S) configuration.
- Reagents: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically bulky base.
- Reaction Analysis: When a secondary alkyl halide reacts with a strong, bulky base, an E2 elimination reaction is heavily favored. Due to the steric hindrance of the base, it preferentially removes a proton from the least sterically crowded adjacent carbon. This is known as Hofmann elimination. The protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are less hindered than those on the internal methylene group (C2).
- Product A: The elimination of HBr forms a double bond between C3 and C4, yielding 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The chiral center at C3 is destroyed in this process, so Product A is achiral.

    # Step 2: Hydroboration-oxidation of Product A
    explanation_2 = """2. Reaction 2: Formation of Product B

- Starting Material: Product A, which is 4-phenylbut-1-ene (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2).
- Reagents: 1. Borane in THF (BH3Â·THF), followed by 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
- Reaction Analysis: This two-step process is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction. It results in the addition of water (H and OH) across the alkene's double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the less-substituted carbon of the double bond.
- Product B: For 4-phenylbut-1-ene, the -OH group adds to the terminal carbon (C1). The resulting product is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol. This molecule does not have a chiral center and is therefore achiral.

- Starting Material: Product B, which is 4-phenylbutan-1-ol (Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH). This is a primary alcohol.
- Reagent: Phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).
- Reaction Analysis: PBr3 is a classic reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding alkyl bromides. The hydroxyl group is substituted with a bromine atom.
- Product C: The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.

Identity of the Final Product, C

- IUPAC Name: The IUPAC name for the final product is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.

- Chirality Explanation: The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is achiral. The original stereocenter in the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step. No new stereocenters were formed in the subsequent steps. An analysis of the final structure, Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Ph, shows that no carbon atom is bonded to four different substituents. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and not optically active.
