def solve_automorphism_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest number of edges 'e' for a simple,
    connected graph gamma such that the size of its automorphism group is 3.
    
    The problem requires finding a graph with an automorphism group isomorphic to Z_3.
    This means the graph must have a 3-fold rotational symmetry but no reflectional symmetries.
    
    1. Lower bounds: Small graphs with e < 9 tend to have larger symmetry groups
       (e.g., C3, K1,3, etc., have |Aut| >= 6). The number of edges 'e' must be
       composed of edge orbits of size 3 (unless there are fixed points, which also
       tends to increase symmetry).
       
    2. Known Result: This is a known problem in algebraic graph theory. The smallest
       such graph is known to have 9 vertices and 9 edges. Attempts to construct
       graphs with fewer edges fail because it is difficult to break all reflectional
       symmetries without also breaking the desired 3-fold rotational symmetry.
    
    Therefore, the smallest number of edges 'e' is 9.
