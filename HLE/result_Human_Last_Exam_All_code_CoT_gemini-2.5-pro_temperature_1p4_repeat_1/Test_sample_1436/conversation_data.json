    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the symmetry factor, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Feynman Diagram:** The user describes a diagram with \"two vertices\" and \"four field contractions\" (which are the internal lines, or propagators). The most standard diagram that fits this description in quantum field theory is a vacuum diagram from a $\\phi^4$ theory. In this diagram, two interaction vertices are connected to each other by four separate propagators. This is sometimes called a \"double-bubble\" or \"melon\" diagram.\n\n2.  **Define the Symmetry Factor (S):** The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the number of ways its internal components (vertices and lines) can be rearranged without changing the diagram's overall structure (topology).\n\n3.  **Calculate S by Multiplying Component Symmetries:**\n    *   **Vertex Symmetry:** We have two vertices. Since they are connected in an identical manner, we can swap their positions, and the diagram looks exactly the same. The number of ways to permute these 2 vertices is `2!`.\n    *   **Propagator Symmetry:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be interchanged with each other in any combination. The number of permutations for these 4 lines is `4!`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Factors:** The total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the symmetries from the vertices and the propagators.\n    *   `S = (Vertex Permutations) * (Propagator Permutations)`\n    *   `S = 2! * 4!`\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be written to calculate this value using the `math.factorial` function and print the final equation with all its components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
