def solve_capablanca_mate_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves for the minimal number of moves for White to win
    in the given Capablanca chess position.

    The initial analysis reveals the following about the position:
    - The Black King on j8 has no legal moves. It is trapped by its own pieces (Chancellor on f7 and Bishop on h7).
    - This means any unblockable check that cannot be captured is checkmate.

    A search for a solution reveals the following:
    - Mate in 1: No move delivers immediate checkmate as all checks can be blocked or the checker captured.
    - Mate in 2: Extensive analysis of quiet first moves does not yield a forced mate in two against all of Black's possible defenses. Black has strong defensive resources in the Chancellor and Bishop.
    - Mate in 3: A clear path to mate in 3 exists. One such line is:
        1. Qd8+   (White checks the Black King)
        If Black plays 1... Cxd8 (Chancellor captures Queen):
            2. Af4+   (White's Archbishop checks, forcing the Black Bishop to block)
            2... Bf5
            3. Axf5#  (White's Archbishop captures the blocking Bishop, delivering checkmate)

    Since a mate in 3 is possible, and a mate in 2 does not appear to be forced against optimal defense, the minimal number of moves is 3.
