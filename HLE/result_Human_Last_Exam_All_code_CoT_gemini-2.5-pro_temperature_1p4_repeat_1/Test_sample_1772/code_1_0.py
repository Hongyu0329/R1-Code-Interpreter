    print("--- Problem Analysis ---")
    print("The problem asks us to consider an equivalence relation on the set of all subsets of the rational numbers, P(Q).")
    print("The relation is defined as follows: For two subsets A and B of Q, A is equivalent to B (written A ~ B) if:")
    print("1. A is homeomorphic to a subset of B (A embeds in B).")
    print("2. B is homeomorphic to a subset of A (B embeds in A).")
    print("This is a well-defined equivalence relation based on mutual topological embeddability.")

    print("--- Part 1: Identifying two equivalent, non-homeomorphic subsets ---")
    print("We need to find two subsets, A and B, of the rational numbers Q such that A ~ B, but A and B are not homeomorphic.")
    
    print("\nLet's define our two sets:")
    print("Set A: The set of all rational numbers, Q.")
    print("  - A is a subset of Q.")
    print("  - Topologically, A is dense-in-itself and has no isolated points.")

    print("\nSet B: The union of an open interval of rationals and a discrete set of integers.")
    print("  - Let B = {q in Q | 0 < q < 1} U {2, 3, 4, 5, ...}.")
    print("  - B is also a subset of Q.")
    print("  - Topologically, B has a part with no isolated points ({q in Q | 0 < q < 1}) and a part with infinitely many isolated points ({2, 3, 4, ...}).")
    
    print("\nAre A and B homeomorphic?")
    print("No. A homeomorphism preserves topological properties. The set A has no isolated points, while the set B has infinitely many. Therefore, A and B are not homeomorphic.")
    
    print("\nAre A and B equivalent (A ~ B)?")
    print("1. Is A homeomorphic to a subset of B?")
    print("   Yes. The set A = Q is homeomorphic to any open interval of rationals, for example, {q in Q | 0 < q < 1}. This interval is a subset of B. So, A embeds into B.")
    print("2. Is B homeomorphic to a subset of A?")
    print("   Yes. The set B is itself a subset of A = Q. The identity map shows that B is homeomorphic to a subset of A (namely, itself). So, B embeds into A.")
    
    print("\nConclusion for Part 1: Since A embeds in B and B embeds in A, we have A ~ B. We have successfully identified two such sets.")
    print("\n" + "="*50 + "\n")

    print("--- Part 2: Counting the Equivalence Classes ---")
    print("The number of equivalence classes is the number of distinct topological types of subsets of Q under the relation of mutual embeddability.")
    print("We can group the subsets of Q into several categories:")
    
    print("\n1. Finite Subsets:")
    print("   Any two finite subsets are homeomorphic if and only if they have the same number of elements.")
    print("   For two finite sets A and B, A embeds in B if and only if |A| <= |B|.")
    print("   Therefore, A ~ B if and only if |A| = |B|.")
    print("   This gives a distinct equivalence class for each non-negative integer n = 0, 1, 2, ...")
    print("   Number of these classes = Aleph_0 (countably infinite).")

    print("\n2. Infinite Subsets Containing a copy of Q:")
    print("   This class consists of any subset A of Q that contains a subspace homeomorphic to Q itself.")
    print("   - If A contains a copy of Q, then Q embeds in A.")
    print("   - A key result states that any countable metric space (which A is) embeds in Q.")
    print("   - Therefore, A ~ Q for any such set A.")
    print("   Our example sets A and B from Part 1 fall into this single, large equivalence class.")
    print("   Number of these classes = 1.")

    print("\n3. Infinite Scattered Subsets:")
    print("   These are infinite subsets that do NOT contain a copy of Q.")
    print("   Examples include D = {1, 2, 3, ...} and C = {1/n | n > 0} U {0}.")
    print("   It can be shown that D embeds in C, but C does not embed in D, so they are in different classes.")
    print("   The classification of these spaces is very rich. For every countable ordinal number (e.g., omega, omega+1, omega^2), one can construct a corresponding subset of Q, and they all fall into different equivalence classes.")
    print("   This alone gives Aleph_1 (uncountably many) classes.")

    print("\n--- Final Tally ---")
    print("A deep result in descriptive set theory shows that the classification is even richer than the ordinals suggest.")
    print("It is possible to construct a family of 2^Aleph_0 (the cardinality of the continuum) countable metric spaces, none of which can be embedded into another.")
    print("Since every countable metric space can be realized as a subset of Q, there are at least 2^Aleph_0 distinct equivalence classes.")
    print("The total number of subsets of Q is |P(Q)| = 2^|Q| = 2^Aleph_0, so there cannot be more than this many classes.")

    print("\nFinal Answer: The number of equivalence classes is the power of the continuum.")
    print("\nSymbolic Equation of Cardinalities:")
    print("Let N_finite, N_Q, N_scattered be the number of classes for each type.")
    print("Total Classes = N_finite + N_Q + N_scattered")
    print("              = Aleph_0 + 1 + 2^Aleph_0")
    print("The final sum is dominated by the largest cardinal, so Total Classes = 2^Aleph_0.")
