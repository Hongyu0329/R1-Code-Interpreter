    # Step 1: Analyze the Problem Formulation
    # The problem is to minimize L(w) = E[log(1 + exp(x^T w))] over the set W = {w in R^d, ||w|| <= D}.
    # This is a classic Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) problem.
    # - The loss function l(w,x) = log(1 + exp(x^T w)) is convex in w for any x, so its expectation L(w) is also convex.
    # - The loss function is also smooth.
    # - The parameter space W is a convex and compact set (a ball of radius D in d-dimensions).
    print("Step 1: Problem Analysis")
    print("The problem is a standard Stochastic Convex Optimization (SCO) problem.")
    print("The loss function is convex and smooth, and the constraint set is a compact convex ball.")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Step 2: State the Optimal Convergence Rate
    # For a general (not necessarily strongly convex) SCO problem, the optimal minimax convergence rate is well-established.
    # The rate is given by Theta(Diameter * Gradient_Bound / sqrt(T)).
    # - The parameter set is ||w|| <= D. The diameter of this ball is 2 * D.
    # - The gradient of the loss is grad = sigma(x^T w) * x, where sigma is the sigmoid function.
    # - The norm of the gradient is ||grad|| = |sigma(x^T w)| * ||x||.
    # - Given that |sigma(z)| <= 1 and ||x|| <= 1, the gradient norm is bounded by G = 1.
    # Therefore, the optimal rate is Theta((2 * D * 1) / sqrt(T)), which simplifies to Theta(D / sqrt(T)).

    T_param = 'T'

    print("The standard optimal rate for this class of problems is known to be Theta(Diameter / sqrt(T)).")

    print(f"Thus, the optimal convergence rate is: {rate_formula}")
    print("-" * 40)

    # Step 3: Analyze the Specified Regime
    # The regime T = O(exp(D)) means T <= C * exp(D) for some constant C.
    # This can be rewritten as D >= log(T / C), which is D = Omega(log(T)).
    # This tells us that we are in a setting where D is not a fixed constant but can grow with T.
    # Substituting this into our rate formula gives us a lower bound on the error.
    # Rate = Theta(D / sqrt(T)) = Omega(log(T) / sqrt(T)).
    print("Step 3: Analyze the Regime T = O(exp(D))")
    print("The condition T = O(exp(D)) implies that D grows at least as fast as log(T), i.e., D = Omega(log(T)).")
    print("This means the rate is not independent of D. The convergence rate is a function of both T and D.")

    print("  A. Theta(1/T): Incorrect. This faster rate requires strong convexity, which is not guaranteed here.")
    print("  B. Theta(1/T^(2/3)): Incorrect. This rate is not standard for this problem.")
    print("  C. Theta(1/T^(1/2)): Incorrect. This would only be true if D were a constant, which contradicts the regime D = Omega(log(T)).")
    print("  E. It depends on the dimension d: The rate depends on D. While D and d can be related, the fundamental dependency is on the geometry (D), not necessarily the dimension (d). We can have a large D in low dimensions.")
    print("  D. None of the above: Correct. The rate is Theta(D/sqrt(T)), which depends on D. This expression is not listed in options A, B, or C. Since the rate's dependence is on D and not necessarily d, E is not the most precise answer. Therefore, none of the provided choices accurately describe the optimal rate.")
