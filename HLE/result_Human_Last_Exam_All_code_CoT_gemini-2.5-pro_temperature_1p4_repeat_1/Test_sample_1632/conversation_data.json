    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find `a(10)`, which represents the number of unique 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square grid (Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path that never visits the same point twice.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** This problem can be solved by enumerating all possible paths and counting the ones that are self-avoiding. A recursive backtracking algorithm is a natural fit for this kind of path-finding problem.\n\n3.  **Algorithm Details:**\n    *   We will define a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks(position, steps_left, visited_path)`.\n    *   `position`: The current (x, y) coordinates of the walk.\n    *   `steps_left`: The number of steps remaining to be taken.\n    *   `visited_path`: A set containing all the (x, y) coordinates visited so far in the current walk. Using a set allows for efficient checking of visited points.\n\n4.  **Recursive Logic:**\n    *   **Base Case:** If `steps_left` is 0, it means we have successfully completed a 10-step walk. We have found one valid path, so the function returns 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step:**\n        *   The function will try to move one step in each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current `position`.\n        *   For each potential next position, it checks if that position is already in the `visited_path` set.\n        *   If the position has *not* been visited, the function will:\n            1.  Add the new position to the `visited_path`.\n            2.  Make a recursive call to `count_walks` with the new position, decremented `steps_left`, and the updated `visited_path`.\n            3.  Add the result of this recursive call to a running total.\n            4.  **Backtrack:** Remove the new position from the `visited_path` set. This is crucial as it allows other recursive branches to explore paths that might go through this point.\n    *   The function returns the total count accumulated from all valid moves.\n\n5.  **Initial Call:** The process starts from the origin `(0, 0)`. We will initiate the recursion by calling `count_walks` with the starting position `(0, 0)`, the total number of steps `10`, and a `visited_path` set containing only the origin.\n\nThis method will systematically explore every possible 10-step path from the origin, counting only those that do not intersect themselves.\n\n```python\ndef count_self_avoiding_walks(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice\n    using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Memoization dictionary (optional, but can speed up for more complex problems)\n    # For n=10, direct recursion is fast enough.\n    # memo = {}\n\n    def solve(x, y, steps_left, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid walks.\n        x, y: current coordinates\n        steps_left: number of steps remaining\n        visited: a set of (x,y) tuples representing the path so far\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete valid walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n        \n        # State for memoization key (if used)\n        # key = (x, y, steps_left, tuple(sorted(list(visited))))\n        # if key in memo:\n        #     return memo[key]\n\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four neighboring positions\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # If the next position has not been visited yet\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # 1.
