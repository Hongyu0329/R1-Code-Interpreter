    Solves the two parts of the puzzle.

    Part A: Is every boopable function Turing-computable?
    Yes. The described machine model is a variant of a Random Access Machine (RAM). Its instruction set (with ADD, BITWISENAND, and BRANCHIFZERO) is Turing-complete. The definition of a "boopable" function allows for arbitrarily large machine parameters (R, A, W), which effectively provides the unbounded memory characteristic of a Turing Machine. Since the model is Turing-equivalent, any function it can compute is, by definition, Turing-computable.

    Part B: Suppose (R,A,W)=(64,64,512). Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that, for all x in [0, 2^32), L on (R,A,W) maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 many steps?
    No. The time constraint T(x) <= x + 50 requires that the x boops are executed in x steps, implying a straight-line sequence of BOOP instructions. Let this sequence start at address S. For an input x=k, the program must halt when the PC reaches S+k. This implies the instruction at S+k must cause a halt. However, for an input x=k+1, the program must execute a BOOP at address S+k. An instruction cannot be both a BOOP and a HALT. The machine's lack of indirect addressing (the ability to load/store/branch to an address held in a register) makes it impossible to dynamically place a HALT or jump around this contradiction. Therefore, no such program can exist.
