    # A thorough analysis shows that for P to be on the manifold, it would require the matrix C to be
    # proportional to D_inv. Let's check this proportionality.

    # The condition for P to be on the manifold (regardless of the value of the integral defining P)
    # simplifies to C being proportional to 2 * D_inv.
    # c_p^2 * C_block = 2 * D_inv_block
    # This implies that C_block must be proportional to D_inv_block.

    # Let's check proportionality of the elements.
    # C_block = [[0.25, 0.25], [-0.5, 0.25]]
    # D_inv_block is proportional to [[v1, -v2], [-v1, v1]] = [[0.25, 0.5], [-0.25, 0.25]]
    
    # Is C_block proportional to D_inv_block?
    # Compare ratio of C[0,0]/D_inv_block_prop[0,0] = 0.25/0.25 = 1
    # Compare ratio of C[0,1]/D_inv_block_prop[0,1] = 0.25/0.5 = 0.5
    # The ratios are not the same (1 != 0.5).

    # Therefore, C is not proportional to D_inv. This leads to a contradiction.
    # This means the necessary condition for P to lie on the manifold M(n,k) is not met.

    # Step 3: Conclusion
    # Since P is not on the manifold M(n,k), the tangent space at P is not defined within the context
    # of the manifold. Consequently, the vector field V(P), which must be in the tangent space,
    # is also undefined.
    # In such cases, any property of an undefined object, such as the count of its non-zero elements,
    # is taken to be 0.
