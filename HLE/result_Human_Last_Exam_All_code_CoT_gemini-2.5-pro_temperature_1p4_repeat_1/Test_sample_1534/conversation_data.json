    "This is a biological question rather than a typical coding problem. However, I can still use a script to find and present the information as requested.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I need to access my knowledge base on cephalopod neuroanatomy to answer the specific question about the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*).\n2.  The question asks for the brain regions that are \"adjacent posteriorly\" (i.e., located behind) the palliovisceral lobe.\n3.  I will identify these specific lobes based on anatomical atlases and scientific literature concerning the cuttlefish brain. The palliovisceral lobe is a key part of the subesophageal mass, which controls many bodily functions. The structures directly behind it are involved in locomotion and escape responses.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores the names of these identified regions and prints them in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and displays the brain regions adjacent posteriorly\n# to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish brain.\n\ndef find_posterior_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function contains the neuroanatomical information for the dwarf cuttlefish.\n    The palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass. The regions\n    directly behind it are crucial for functions like escape jetting.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, these are the primary lobes\n    # located posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n    adjacent_posterior_lobes = {\n        \"Region 1\": \"Posterior pedal lobe\",\n        \"Region 2\": \"Giant fiber lobe\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are:\")\n    for key, value in adjacent_posterior_lobes.items():\n        print(f\"- {value}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nfind_posterior_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<Posterior pedal lobe and Giant fiber lobe>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
