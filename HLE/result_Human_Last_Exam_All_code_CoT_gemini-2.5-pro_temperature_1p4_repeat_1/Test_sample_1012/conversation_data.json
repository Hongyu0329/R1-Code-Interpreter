    "To determine the necessary symmetric key length for security against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack on symmetric-key algorithms.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat**: The primary quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric-key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Understand the Impact**: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, like brute-forcing a cryptographic key. This means if a classical computer needs `N` operations, a quantum computer would need approximately `sqrt(N)` operations.\n3.  **Establish Security Level**: The current standard for strong classical security is 128 bits. This implies that it would take approximately 2^128 operations to break, which is considered computationally infeasible.\n4.  **Calculate Post-Quantum Security**: To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key length (`k`) must be large enough so that the quantum attack effort is at least 2^128.\n    *   Classical effort = 2^k\n    *   Quantum effort (with Grover's) = sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2)\n    *   We need the quantum effort to be at least 2^128. So, we set `2^(k/2) >= 2^128`.\n    *   This simplifies to `k/2 >= 128`.\n    *   Solving for `k` gives `k >= 256`.\n5.  **Conclusion**: A symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long to offer a security level equivalent to 128 bits in the pre-quantum era.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The desired security level in bits. A 128-bit security level is the\n# current industry standard, meaning it requires 2^128 operations to break.\ndesired_security_level = 128\n\n# Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, provides a quadratic\n# speedup. This means it can break a symmetric key of length 'k' in\n# roughly sqrt(2^k) = 2^(k/2) operations.\n\n# To maintain our desired security level against a quantum computer,\n# the post-quantum effort must be at least 2^128.\n# So, we set the quantum attack complexity equal to the desired security level:\n# k / 2 = desired_security_level\n\nrequired_key_length = desired_security_level * 2\n\nprint(f\"To achieve a security level of {desired_security_level} bits against a quantum computer,\")\nprint(\"we must account for the quadratic speedup from Grover's algorithm.\")\nprint(\"The relationship is: Post-Quantum Key Length / 2 = Desired Security Level.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the calculation is: {required_key_length} / 2 = {desired_security_level}\")\nprint(f\"The minimum required symmetric key length is {required_key_length} bits.\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
