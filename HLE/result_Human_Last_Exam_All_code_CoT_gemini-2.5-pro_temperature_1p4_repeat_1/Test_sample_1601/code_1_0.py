# The analysis shows that blow-up occurs if and only if a(0) > 0.
# The initial conditions (a(0), b(0)) are in the set [-10, 1] x [10, 20].
# We need to find the measure of the subset Omega where blow-up occurs.
# This subset corresponds to the region where a(0) is in (0, 1] and b(0) is in [10, 20].

# Define the boundaries for the set Omega
a_min_omega = 0
a_max_omega = 1
b_min_omega = 10
b_max_omega = 20

# Calculate the width and height of the region Omega
width = a_max_omega - a_min_omega
height = b_max_omega - b_min_omega

# The measure of Omega is its area
m_omega = width * height

# Print the calculation steps and the final result.
print("The width of the blow-up region for a(0) is:", width)
print("The height of the blow-up region for b(0) is:", height)
print("The measure of the set Omega is m(Omega) =", width, "*", height, "=", m_omega)
