    "In a film's dance scene, the hierarchy of sound is determined by what drives the action and emotion. Here is the breakdown of the ranking:\n\n1.  **Music:** This is the foundational element. The dance is choreographed to the music, and the music sets the tempo, rhythm, mood, and emotional arc of the entire scene. It is the primary reason for the action on screen.\n2.  **Sound Effects (SFX):** These are secondary but still important for adding realism and texture. This includes the sound of feet on the floor (like taps or scuffs), the rustle of costumes, hand claps, or finger snaps. These effects ground the dancers in the environment and can enhance the rhythm.\n3.  **Speech:** Dialogue is almost always the least important sound element in a dance scene. Often, it is completely absent, allowing the music and the physical performance to tell the story. If speech is present, it is typically mixed lower in volume than the music and used sparingly so as not to distract from the central performance.\n\nThe following Python code will print this hierarchy in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in a film's dance scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The elements are ordered from most to least important.\n    sound_elements_in_order = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n    \n    # Joining the list into a single string, separated by a comma and space.\n    ranked_order = \", \".join(sound_elements_in_order)\n    \n    print(ranked_order)\n\nget_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
