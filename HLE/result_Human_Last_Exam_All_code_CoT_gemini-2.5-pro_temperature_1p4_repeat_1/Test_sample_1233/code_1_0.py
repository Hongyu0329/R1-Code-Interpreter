    print("1. The goal was to isolate the cause of bloody diarrhea, likely Campylobacter.")
    print("2. The lab used Campy-Cefex agar, which is a selective medium designed to suppress non-Campylobacter bacteria.")
    print("3. The lab failed because they isolated Bacillus, a contaminant, meaning the selective medium did not work correctly.")
    print("4. A common reason for selective media failure is age, as the antibiotics can degrade and lose potency.")

    print("A. Obtain a fresh sample: This gets a new sample but doesn't fix the processing of the original one.")
    print("B. Decrease sample processing time: A good general practice, but doesn't explain why the selective plate failed to suppress contaminants.")
    print("C. Used Fresh Campylobacter plates: This directly addresses the likely root cause. Fresh plates would have potent antibiotics, which would suppress the Bacillus and allow the Campylobacter to grow and be identified.")
    print("D. Incubated the sample for longer: This wouldn't help if the plate was already overgrown with the wrong bacteria.")
    print("E. Increase the number of plates: This wouldn't help if all the plates were faulty and allowed contaminants to overgrow.")
    
    print("\nConclusion: The most critical failure was the ineffectiveness of the selective medium. Using fresh plates would have corrected this.")
