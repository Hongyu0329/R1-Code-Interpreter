    "To find the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot, we need to determine the smallest integer `n > 1` for which the knot is *n-colorable*. This value, `n`, is determined by the knot's determinant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  A knot can be colored with `n` colors if its arcs can be labeled with integers (colors) from {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that at each crossing, the color of the over-arc (`c`) is related to the colors of the under-arcs (`a` and `b`) by the rule `2c â‰¡ a + b (mod n)`.\n2.  The possible values of `n` for a given knot are the divisors of its determinant. The determinant is calculated from the knot's *coloring matrix*.\n3.  For the figure-eight knot, we can set up a system of linear equations based on its four crossings, which gives us a 4x4 coloring matrix.\n4.  The knot determinant is the absolute value of the determinant of any 3x3 submatrix created by removing one row and one column from the coloring matrix.\n5.  We will calculate this determinant. The smallest prime factor of this determinant will be the size of the smallest (non-trivial) coloring set.\n\nThis Python code will define the submatrix and calculate its determinant step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_knot_coloring():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the smallest algebraic structure for coloring the figure-eight knot.\n    This corresponds to the knot's determinant.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of elements for coloring the figure-eight knot, we calculate its determinant.\")\n    print(\"We start with the coloring matrix for the figure-eight knot.
