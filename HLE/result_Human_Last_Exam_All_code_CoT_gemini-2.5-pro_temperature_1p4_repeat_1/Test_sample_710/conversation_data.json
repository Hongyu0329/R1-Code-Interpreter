    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the set of numbers we are allowed to use for the sum. Then, we can devise a strategy to find the smallest number `N` such that any integer `M >= N` can be formed by summing distinct elements from this set.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the set of generator numbers:** The numbers are of the form `f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1`. The problem doesn't specify the domain for `n`.\n    *   If `n` is restricted to non-negative integers (`n >= 0`), the set of numbers is `{1, 6, 15, 28, ...}`. A quick check shows that small integers like 2, 3, 4, and 5 can never be formed, which suggests that there would be infinitely many unreachable numbers, contradicting the premise of the question.\n    *   If `n` can be any integer (`... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...`), we get a different set of numbers.\n        *   We can factor the expression: `f(n) = (n+1)(2n+1)`.\n        *   For `n >= 0`, this gives `{1, 6, 15, 28, ...}`. These are the triangular numbers with odd indices, `T_{2n+1}`.\n        *   For `n < 0`, let `n = -m` where `m > 0`. The expression becomes `f(-m) = 2m^2 - 3m + 1`.\n            *   `n=-1`: `f(-1) = 0`.\n            *   `n=-2`: `f(-2) = 3`.\n            *   `n=-3`: `f(-3) = 10`.\n            *   `n=-4`: `f(-4) = 21`.\n            These are the triangular numbers with even indices, `T_{2(m-1)}` for `m>1`.\n    *   Combining these, the set of distinct non-zero numbers generated by `f(n)` for all integers `n` is `{1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...}`, which is precisely the set of all triangular numbers, `T_k = k(k+1)/2` for `k >= 1`.\n\n2.  **Reframe the problem:** The problem is now to find the smallest number `N` such that any integer `M >= N` can be written as a sum of *distinct triangular numbers*. This is a well-known problem in number theory. The existence of such an `N` implies that the set of numbers that *cannot* be formed is finite. Our goal is to find the largest number in this finite set. Let's call it `G`. Then, `N` will be `G + 1`.\n\n3.  **Computational Approach:** We can find `G` by using a dynamic programming approach, which is a standard method for solving subset sum problems.\n    *   We create a boolean array, `reachable`, of a certain size (e.g., up to 101). `reachable[i]` will be `True` if the number `i` can be formed, and `False` otherwise.\n    *   Initialize `reachable[0]` to `True` (representing an empty sum) and all other entries to `False`.\n    *   Iterate through the triangular numbers (`t`). For each `t`, update the `reachable` array. To ensure we use each triangular number at most once, we iterate the sum `i` downwards from our maximum limit to `t`. We set `reachable[i] = True` if `reachable[i - t]` is `True`.\n    *   After processing all necessary triangular numbers, the largest index `i` for which `reachable[i]` is `False` is our number `G`.\n\n4.  **Final Code:** The Python code will implement this logic, compute the largest unreachable number `G`, and then determine `N = G + 1`. The code will also print the final equation used to find `N`.\n\n```python\ndef find_frobenius_number_for_distinct_sum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the smallest number N such that any number M >= N\n    can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1.\n\n    As explained in the plan, the set of generators f(n) for all integers n is\n    the set of all triangular numbers {1, 3, 6, 10, ...}.\n    This function finds the largest number that cannot be written as a sum of\n    distinct triangular numbers.
