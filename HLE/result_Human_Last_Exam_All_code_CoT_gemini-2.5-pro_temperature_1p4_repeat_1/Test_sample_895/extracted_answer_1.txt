The largest possible Hausdorff distance is given by the formula:
d = (1/2) * tan(phi/2) * max(a_i + a_{i+1} - b_i)
where the maximum is taken over all i from 1 to n.
I have provided the python code to calculate this value for a given n and a list of side lengths a. The code also prints the full equation that gives the answer.
