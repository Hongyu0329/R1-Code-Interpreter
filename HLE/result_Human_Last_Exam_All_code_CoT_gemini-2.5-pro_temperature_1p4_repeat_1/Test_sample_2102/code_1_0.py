# Step 1: Determine the value of n.
# As derived in the plan, f(n) = n.
# We need the smallest integer n such that f(n) > 10, which means n > 10.
n = 11

# Step 2: Construct the Weyr matrix W_n for the determined n.
# Based on the analysis, W_n is a lower bidiagonal matrix with ones
# on its main diagonal and first subdiagonal.
W_n = np.eye(n) + np.eye(n, k=-1)

# Step 3: Calculate the infinity norm of W_n.
# The infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
norm_W_n = np.linalg.norm(W_n, ord=np.inf)

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
result = n * norm_W_n

# Print the final equation with all its components, as requested.
