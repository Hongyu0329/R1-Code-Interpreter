    "To determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we will use the Schwarzschild metric. The most reliable way to perform this calculation without manual error is to use a symbolic mathematics library in Python.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, and using units where the speed of light $c=1$ and the gravitational constant $G=1$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Its non-zero components are:\n    *   $g_{tt} = -(1 - 2M/r)$\n    *   $g_{rr} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n    where $M$ is the mass of the body.\n\n2.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor and $\\partial_\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\lambda}$.\n\n3.  **Automate with Python:** I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform the following:\n    a. Define the symbolic variables for the coordinates and the mass.\n    b. Construct the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its inverse $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$.\n    c. Pre-calculate all the partial derivatives of the metric components with respect to the coordinates, $\\partial_\\lambda g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n    d. Loop through all $4^3 = 64$ possible combinations of the indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$.\n    e. For each combination, compute $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ using the formula.\n    f. Simplify the resulting symbolic expression. If the expression is not zero, it's a non-zero Christoffel symbol.\n    g. Count the number of non-zero symbols found. This count represents the total number of non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol \"tensor\".\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will print the total count of these non-zero components.\n\nThis approach guarantees that all symbols are checked and correctly evaluated.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef count_nonzero_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
