    "Of course, I can help you with that. This problem requires identifying a specific object from polyhedral combinatorics and then presenting its properties.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the Polytope:** The request specifies a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices (`f₀=6`) and the maximal number of 2-faces (`f₂`). I will consult the known classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices to find the one that fits this description.\n2.  **Determine the f-vector:** For the identified polytope, I will determine its f-vector, which is the sequence `(f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃)` representing the number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces (facets).\n3.  **Verify the f-vector:** I will check if the calculated f-vector satisfies the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes: `f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 0`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that stores the f-vector and prints the answer clearly, including the verification using the Euler-Poincaré formula.\n\n### Execution\nBased on the complete classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there are exactly three combinatorial types. Two of them are simplicial (all facets are tetrahedra), and only one is non-simplicial.\n\n1.  **Cyclic 4-polytope C(6,4):** Simplicial, f-vector = (6, 15, 18, 9).\n2.  **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** Simplicial, f-vector = (6, 14, 15, 7).\n3.  **Pyramid over a square pyramid:** Non-simplicial, f-vector = (6, 13, 13, 6).\n\nSince there is only one non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices, it trivially satisfies the condition of having the \"maximal number of 2-faces\" for that category. Therefore, the polytope in question is the **pyramid over a square pyramid**.\n\nIts f-vector is **(6, 13, 13, 6)**.\n\nLet's check the Euler-Poincaré formula:\n`f₀ - f₁ + f₂ - f₃ = 6 - 13 + 13 - 6 = 0`. The formula holds true.\n\nThe following Python code will present this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_polytope_f_vector():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and describes the f-vector of the non-simplicial\n    4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\n    According to the classification of 4-polytopes, there is only one\n    non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices: the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n    Therefore, it trivially has the maximal number of 2-faces for its class.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The f-vector components for the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n    # f0: vertices\n    # f1: edges\n    # f2: 2-faces (polygons)\n    # f3: 3-faces (facets/cells)\n    f0 = 6\n    f1 = 13\n    f2 = 13\n    f3 = 6\n\n    print(\"The 4-polytope is the pyramid over a square pyramid.\")\n    print(f\"Its f-vector (f0, f1, f2, f3) is: ({f0}, {f1}, {f2}, {f3}).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"To verify, we check the Euler-Poincaré formula for 4-polytopes (f0 - f1 + f2 - f3 = 0):\")\n    result = f0 - f1 + f2 - f3\n    \n    # Print the equation with the actual numbers\n    print(f\"{f0} - {f1} + {f2} - {f3} = {result}\")\n\n    if result == 0:\n        print(\"The formula holds true.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The formula does not hold, there might be an error.\")\n\nsolve_polytope_f_vector()\n```\n<<<(6, 13, 13, 6)>>>"
