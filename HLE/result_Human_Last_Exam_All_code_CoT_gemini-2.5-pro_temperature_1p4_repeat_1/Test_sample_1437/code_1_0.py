def calculate_lindhard_value():
    """
    This function determines the numerical value associated with the Lindhard
    polarization function Π(k, ω) in the static, long-wavelength limit for a
    3D electron gas at T=0.

    Step 1: State the theoretical result.
    In linear response theory, the Lindhard function in the limit of zero
    frequency (ω=0) and zero momentum transfer (k=0) is equal to the negative
    of the density of states (per unit volume, per unit energy, including spin)
    at the Fermi energy, g(E_F).
    The equation is: Π(k=0, ω=0) = -g(E_F)

    Step 2: Analyze the result.
    The density of states at the Fermi energy for a 3D electron gas is given by:
    g(E_F) = m * k_F / (π^2 * ħ^2)
    where m is the electron mass, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and k_F is
    the Fermi wavevector. Since k_F depends on the electron density 'n' of the
    material (k_F ∝ n^(1/3)), the value of Π(0, 0) is not a universal
    constant but depends on the specific material.

    Step 3: Use standard normalization.
    To obtain a universal, dimensionless value, it is conventional to normalize
    the Lindhard function by the density of states g(E_F). This gives a
    quantity that is independent of any material parameters.

    Step 4: Calculate the normalized value.
    The quantity to calculate is the ratio Π(0, 0) / g(E_F).
    Using the result from Step 1, the equation becomes:
    Value = Π(0, 0) / g(E_F) = -g(E_F) / g(E_F)
    """

    # The parameters for the evaluation
    momentum_transfer_k = 0
    frequency_omega = 0

    # Based on the derivation, the dimensionless normalized value is -1.
    # Value = -g(E_F) / g(E_F)
    final_value = -1

    print("The Lindhard polarization function Π(k, ω) is a key quantity in many-body physics.")
    print(f"We evaluate it in the static (ω = {frequency_omega}) and long-wavelength (k = {momentum_transfer_k}) limit.")
    print("In this limit, Π(0, 0) = -g(E_F), where g(E_F) is the density of states at the Fermi energy.")
    print("To find a universal numerical value, we consider the dimensionless function normalized by g(E_F).")
    print("\nThe final equation for the normalized value is: Π(0, 0) / g(E_F) = -1")
    print(f"The numbers in this final equation are k = {momentum_transfer_k}, ω = {frequency_omega}, and the result is {final_value}.")
    print(f"\nThus, the universal numerical value is: {final_value}")
