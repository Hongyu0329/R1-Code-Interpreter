    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\nFirst, I will establish the start and end years of the war based on the official lore timeline.\n1.  **Start Year:** The Second Great War is widely considered to have begun with the events of the Brood War expansion, which started in the year 2500.\n2.  **End Year:** The war concluded with the final defeat of Amon in the epilogue of *Legacy of the Void*, which takes place in the year 2508.\n3.  **Calculation:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the duration. The result is already a whole number, so rounding up will not change the value.\n\nThe Python code below will define these years, perform the calculation, and print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War began with the Brood War.\nstart_year = 2500\n\n# The war concluded with the events of the Legacy of the Void epilogue.\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration.\n# The user requested the result to be rounded up, so we use math.ceil,\n# though it's a whole number in this case.\nduration = math.ceil(end_year - start_year)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The Second Great War started in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"To find the duration, we calculate: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration of the war was {duration} years.\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
