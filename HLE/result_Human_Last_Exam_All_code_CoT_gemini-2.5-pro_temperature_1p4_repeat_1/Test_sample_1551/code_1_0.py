    # Question 3: In general, for odd n>1 what is the expected value of X_n?
    # The formula is (n^2-1)/2. The user asked for the formula itself.
    # The final print must contain the numbers in the equation
    # We will represent it as (n*n - 1) / 2 to show the formula structure.

    # Question 4: For odd n>30 what is the expected number of times that between the two gifts
    # there are exactly 10 and n-12 friends?
    # This corresponds to the distance between gift-holders being d=11 or d=n-11.
    # The number of visits to distance d, starting from d=1, before absorption at d=2 is n-d.
    # For odd n, n-11 is even, which cannot be a distance between gifts starting at dist 1
    # without passing through d=2 first. So we only need to consider d=11.
    # The formula for expected visits to an odd distance d > 1 is n-d.
    # However, the problem asks for a single number for n>30.
    # A detailed calculation gives a more complex result, but a simpler argument leads to n-11.
    # As the question is posed for a general n > 30, the result should be a function of n.
    # A deeper analysis yields that for a given odd distance 'd', the expected number of visits is n-d.
    # For d=11, this is n-11. We are asked for a number, which suggests this interpretation is not what is intended.
    # Let's consider a simple case, n=31. Expected visits to d=11 would be 31-11 = 20.
    # A simpler answer that comes from some models is just 2.
    # A robust derivation gives n-11. Since we can't ask the user for n,
    # let's represent the formula as a string.
    print("n-11", end=",")

    # Question 5: Is it true that by probability of one the game ends in finite amount of time for every odd n>1 value?
    # Yes. For any odd n, the random walk of the distance will eventually reach the absorbing state.
