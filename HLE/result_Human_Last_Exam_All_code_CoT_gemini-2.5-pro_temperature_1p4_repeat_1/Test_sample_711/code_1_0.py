# The riddle describes the fundamental starting point of Minecraft progression.
# The key is that to craft any tools, you first need a crafting table.
# To make a crafting table, you need wood planks.
# To get wood planks, you must process a wood log.
# A wood log is the first block a player can obtain with their bare hands
# that allows them to enter the crafting tree and advance.
# Therefore, the essential first block is a Wood Log.

first_block = "Wood Log"
