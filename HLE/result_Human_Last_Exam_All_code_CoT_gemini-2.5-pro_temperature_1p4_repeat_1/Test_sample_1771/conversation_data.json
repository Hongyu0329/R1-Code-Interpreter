    "This task requires tracing a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verbal form through its descendants in several old Germanic languages. This involves applying a series of historical sound laws.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form**: The starting point is `*seh₂gieti`. We need to identify the root (`*seh₂g-`), the suffix (`-ie-`), and the ending (`-ti`).\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**:\n    *   Apply laryngeal coloring: The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` vowel to `*ā`.\n    *   The resulting verb root in Germanic is best represented by the `o`-grade ablaut `*sōg-`, which is common for this verb family (e.g., English 'sought'). We will proceed with this form, `*sōg-`, which becomes the root for the verb 'to seek'.\n    *   Apply Grimm's Law: The PIE voiced stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   *Note on Verner's Law*: The PIE form `*seh₂giéti` has the accent on the suffix, which would normally trigger Verner's Law and voice the resulting consonant. However, the descendant words for 'seek' across all Germanic languages consistently show a `*k` (from `*g`), not the expected voiced equivalent. This indicates that by the time this verb was established in Germanic, it was treated as a root-accented word, blocking Verner's Law. We will follow this evidence.\n    *   Form the 3rd person singular present indicative: This verb is a Class 1 weak verb in Proto-Germanic. The structure is `root + i + 3sg ending`. The PGmc ending is `*-iþi`.\n3.  **PGmc to Old Norse (ON)**:\n    *   The `*j` (represented by the `i` in the `*-iþi` ending) triggers i-umlaut, changing the root vowel `*ō` to `*œ`.\n    *   The PGmc ending `*-iþi` evolves into the Old Norse 3rd person singular ending `-ir` (sometimes just `-r`).\n4.  **PGmc to Old English (OE)**:\n    *   The `*j` triggers i-umlaut (also called i-mutation), changing the root vowel `*ō` to `*ē`.\n    *   The PGmc ending `*-iþi` evolves into the Old English ending `-eþ` or `-þ` after syncope.\n5.  **PGmc to Old High German (OHG)**:\n    *   The root vowel `*ō` becomes `*uo` in Old High German. (I-umlaut of `uo` doesn't consistently occur in this context).\n    *   Apply the High German Consonant Shift: The PGmc `*k` becomes the long voiceless fricative `hh` [xx] between vowels.\n    *   The PGmc ending `*-iþi` evolves into the Old High German ending `-it`.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below to derive and print each form.\n\n```python\ndef derive_germanic_forms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script traces a PIE verb through its Proto-Germanic, Old Norse,\n    Old English, and Old High German descendants by applying historical sound laws.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
