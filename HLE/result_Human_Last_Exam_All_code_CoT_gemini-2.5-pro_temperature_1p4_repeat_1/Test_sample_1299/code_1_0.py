# This script is designed to output the symbolic expressions for the problem.
# It does not compute a numerical value, as 'l' and its prime exponents 'e_i' are symbolic.

# Part A asks for the cardinality of U_l in terms of l.
# Based on the analysis, |U_l| = |T_l|.
# The expression for |T_l| in terms of l is tau(l^2) - 1 + delta_{1,l},
# where tau is the divisor function and delta_{1,l} is the Kronecker delta.
# We will represent tau as tau and the Kronecker delta as delta.
# The numbers in the equation are 2 and 1.
answer_A = "tau(l^2) - 1 + delta_{1,l}"

# Part B asks for the cardinality of T_l in terms of the exponents e_i in the prime
# factorization of l = p_1^{e_1} * ... * p_s^{e_s}.
# This is equivalent to tau(l^2) - 1 + delta_{1,l}.
# tau(l^2) = (2*e_1 + 1) * ... * (2*e_s + 1).
# The delta term is 1 if l=1 (which means s=0) and 0 otherwise.
# We will use Π to denote the product.
# The numbers in the equation are 2 and 1.
answer_B = "(Π_{i=1 to s} (2*e_i + 1)) - 1 + delta_{s,0}"

# The problem asks for the answer in the format A)[Expression] B)[Expression].
# We will now print the final answer string.
