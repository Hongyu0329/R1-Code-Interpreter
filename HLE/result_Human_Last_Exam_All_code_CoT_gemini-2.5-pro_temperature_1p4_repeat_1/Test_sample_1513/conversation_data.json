    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this geographical riddle.\n\nFirst, I will break down the user's query into key constraints:\n1.  It must be an island town.\n2.  It must be more than 500 kilometers from the nearest inhabited island, indicating extreme isolation.\n3.  It must be situated on a bay created by a volcanic caldera.\n4.  The town and the bay must have the same name.\n\nNext, I will use these constraints to identify the location. The most critical clue is the extreme isolation (>500 km). This narrows down the possibilities to a few of the world's most remote inhabited islands. I will then check these candidates against the other criteria (volcanic origin, caldera bay, shared name).\n\nMy research points to Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui). It is the most remote inhabited island in the world, its bay and town are both named Hanga Roa, and the entire island is volcanic, with its coastline shaped by its volcanic history, including several calderas.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script that presents these facts and prints the name of the town as the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_geography_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies an island town based on a set of geographical clues\n    and prints the details and the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Riddle's Clues ---\n    # The clue specifies a distance greater than 500 kilometers.\n    required_distance_km = 500\n\n    # --- Identified Location's Data ---\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n    island_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n    geological_feature = \"volcanic island with calderas\"\n    \n    # Easter Island's nearest inhabited neighbor (Pitcairn Island) is 2075 km away.\n    actual_distance_km = 2075\n\n    # --- Verification and Output ---\n    print(\"Finding the island town based on the clues...\")\n    print(f\"Clue 1: More than {required_distance_km} km from another inhabited island.\")\n    print(f\"Check: The nearest inhabited island is {actual_distance_km} km away. This satisfies the condition.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Clue 2: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\")\n    print(f\"Check: The town sits on a bay on a {geological_feature}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Clue 3: The town and the bay share the same name.\")\n    print(f\"Check: The town is '{town_name}' and the bay is '{bay_name}'. This satisfies the condition.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The island town that fits all the descriptions is:\")\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_geography_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
