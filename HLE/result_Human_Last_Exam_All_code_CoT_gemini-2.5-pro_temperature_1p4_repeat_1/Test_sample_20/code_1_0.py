def solve_subgradient_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the subgradient of the squared Wasserstein distance functional at its minimum.

    The functional is J(mu) = (1/2) * W(mu, nu)^2.
    The minimum of J is at mu = nu, where J(nu) = 0.

    We investigate the subgradient of J at this minimum point nu.
    Let V be a tangent vector at nu that represents an element of the subgradient of J at nu.
    By definition of the subgradient for a geodesically convex function on a metric space,
    for any other measure rho, the following inequality must hold:
      J(rho) - J(nu) >= <V, exp_nu^{-1}(rho)>
    where < , > is the inner product on the tangent space at nu, and exp_nu^{-1}(rho) is the
    initial velocity of the geodesic from nu to rho.

    Let's consider a geodesic starting at nu with an arbitrary initial velocity W.
    A point on this geodesic at time t is rho_t.
    - The initial velocity is exp_nu^{-1}(rho_t) = t * W.
    - The distance is W(rho_t, nu) = t * ||W||.
    - The functional value is J(rho_t) = (1/2) * W(rho_t, nu)^2 = (1/2) * (t * ||W||)^2.
    - The value at the minimum is J(nu) = 0.

    This script will symbolically derive the consequence of this inequality.
