    # Final Conclusion
    conclusion = """The central issue connects the thoracic mass to the patient's hoarseness.
The vagus nerve (CN X) and its recurrent laryngeal branch pass through the thorax and control the muscles of the larynx.
A mass in this area can cause compression, leading to vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness.
The Cricothyroid muscle is a key muscle of the larynx involved in voice production.
Therefore, it is the most important anatomical structure to consider in this patient's presentation."""
