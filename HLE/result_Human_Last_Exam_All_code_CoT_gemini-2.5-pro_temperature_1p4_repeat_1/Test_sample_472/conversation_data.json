    "This is a line of early Latin poetry, most likely an iambic senarius from a comic playwright like Caecilius Statius. Scanning this type of verse is more complex than classical hexameter because the rules are more flexible, allowing for various substitutions and contractions to fit the meter.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for scanning the line:\n\n1.  **Identify the Meter**: The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" does not fit the pattern of a dactylic hexameter. Its structure is consistent with an **iambic senarius**, which consists of six iambic feet (˘¯, or S L). The basic pattern is `x L | x L | x L | x L | x L | x L`, where 'x' can be a long or short syllable. Substitutions (like a trochee, spondee, or pyrrhic) are common.\n\n2.  **Syllable Count and Contractions**: An iambic senarius has 12 syllables. The given line, \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\", has 15 syllables. To make it fit the 12-syllable meter, we must assume two common contractions found in early Latin:\n    *   **`bene esse` -> `ben'sse`**: This complex contraction reduces three syllables (`be-ne es-`) to two (`bens-se`, scanned as Long-Short or `L S`).\n    *   **`soli` -> `sol`**: The word `soli` is reduced to a single long syllable (`L`) through syncope.\n\n3.  **Determine Syllable Quantities**: After applying the contractions, the line becomes:\n    `et tibi ben'sse sol quom sibi sit male`\n    We can now determine the quantity (Long 'L' or Short 'S') of each syllable:\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by `t`). -> **L**\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both are short. -> **S S**\n    *   `ben'sse`: Scanned as `bens-se`. `bens` is long by position; `se` is short. -> **L S**\n    *   `sol`: Long by nature. -> **L**\n    *   `quom`: Long (diphthong). -> **L**\n    *   `si-bi`: Both are short. -> **S S**\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by `m`). -> **L**\n    *   `ma-le`: Both are short. The final syllable is anceps (can be L or S), but here it's scanned as part of a pyrrhic foot (S S). -> **S S**\n\n4.  **Group into Feet**: Now we group the resulting 12-syllable sequence into six iambic feet, allowing for substitutions:\n    *   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> `L S` (A trochee, a common substitution in the first foot).\n    *   **Foot 2**: `bi bens` -> `S L` (A perfect iamb).\n    *   **Foot 3**: `se sol` -> `S L` (A perfect iamb).\n    *   **Foot 4**: `quom si` -> `L S` (A trochee, a valid substitution).\n    *   **Foot 5**: `bi sit` -> `S L` (A perfect iamb).\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> `S S` (A pyrrhic, a common resolution of an iamb).\n\nThe final scansion is a consistent iambic senarius.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the scansion of the provided Latin line.\n# The line is an iambic senarius, and its scansion requires understanding\n# early Latin contractions and metrical substitutions.\n\n# The analyzed line is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n# Feet are separated by a space.\n\n# Foot 1: et ti (L S)\n# Foot 2: bi ben'sse (part 1) (S L)\n# Foot 3: ben'sse (part 2) sol (S L) -- Correction from thought process\n# The thought process had a mistake in syllabifying the feet for the final code.\n# Let's re-verify the feet based on the 12-syllable sequence:\n# Syllables: et, ti, bi, bens, se, sol, quom, si, bi, sit, ma, le\n# Sequence:  L,  S,  S,  L,   S,  L,   L,    S,  S,  L,   S,  S\n\n# Let's regroup into 6 feet (2 syllables each):\n# Foot 1: et ti -> L S\n# Foot 2: bi bens -> S L\n# Foot 3: se sol -> S L\n# Foot 4: quom si -> L S\n# Foot 5: bi sit -> S L\n# Foot 6: ma le -> S S\n# This grouping is consistent and correct.\n\nscansion = \"L S S L S L L S S L S S\"\nfeet = scansion.split()\n\n# Adding spaces to represent the six feet\nfinal_scansion = \" \".join(feet[i:i+2]) for i in range(0, len(feet), 2)\nprint(\" \".join(final_scansion))\n\n```\n<<<L S S L S L L S S L S S>>>"
