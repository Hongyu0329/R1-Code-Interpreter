# This script prints the scansion of the provided Latin line.
# The line is an iambic senarius, and its scansion requires understanding
# early Latin contractions and metrical substitutions.

# The analyzed line is "et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male".
# Feet are separated by a space.

# Foot 1: et ti (L S)
# Foot 2: bi ben'sse (part 1) (S L)
# Foot 3: ben'sse (part 2) sol (S L) -- Correction from thought process
# The thought process had a mistake in syllabifying the feet for the final code.
# Let's re-verify the feet based on the 12-syllable sequence:
# Syllables: et, ti, bi, bens, se, sol, quom, si, bi, sit, ma, le
# Sequence:  L,  S,  S,  L,   S,  L,   L,    S,  S,  L,   S,  S

# Let's regroup into 6 feet (2 syllables each):
# Foot 1: et ti -> L S
# Foot 2: bi bens -> S L
# Foot 3: se sol -> S L
# Foot 4: quom si -> L S
# Foot 5: bi sit -> S L
# Foot 6: ma le -> S S
# This grouping is consistent and correct.

scansion = "L S S L S L L S S L S S"
feet = scansion.split()

# Adding spaces to represent the six feet
final_scansion = " ".join(feet[i:i+2]) for i in range(0, len(feet), 2)
print(" ".join(final_scansion))
