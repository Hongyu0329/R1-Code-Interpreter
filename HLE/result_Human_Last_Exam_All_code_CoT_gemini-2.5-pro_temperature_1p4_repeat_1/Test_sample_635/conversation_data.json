    "To calculate a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that $H(s) = D(s)^{-1}N(s)$, with $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ being left coprime. Two polynomial matrices are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. The degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ must also be minimal, which corresponds to the McMillan degree of $H(s)$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find such a factorization:\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: Start by expressing $H(s)$ with a common denominator for each row to get an initial, but not necessarily coprime, left factorization $H(s) = D_1(s)^{-1}N_1(s)$.\n    $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & \\frac{s+1}{s+1} \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & \\frac{0}{s^2-1} \\end{bmatrix}$\n    By taking the denominator of each row, we can write:\n    $D_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N_1(s) = D_1(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n2.  **Check for Coprimeness**: We check if $D_1(s)$ and $N_1(s)$ are left coprime. We form the matrix $M_1(s) = [D_1(s) \\quad N_1(s)]$ and check its rank at the roots of $\\det(D_1(s))$.\n    $\\det(D_1(s)) = (s+1)(s^2-1) = (s+1)^2(s-1)$. The roots are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    At $s=-1$, the matrix $M_1(-1) = [\\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}]$ has rank 1, which is less than 2. Thus, the factorization is not coprime, and there is a common left divisor related to the factor $(s+1)$.\n\n3.  **Extract Common Divisor**: We perform elementary row operations on $M_1(s)$ to extract the common divisor. The left nullspace of $M_1(-1)$ is spanned by the vector $v = [1, 1]$. We use this vector to form a unimodular matrix $U = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and multiply $M_1(s)$ by it. This operation isolates the common factor $(s+1)$ in one row.\n    $[D_2(s) \\quad N_2(s)] = U \\cdot [D_1(s) \\quad N_1(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ s+1 & s^2-1 & s+1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    The second row is now divisible by $(s+1)$.\n\n4.  **Final Factorization**: We divide the second row by $(s+1)$ to get the final coprime matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    Checking for coprimeness again shows that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full rank for all $s$. The degree of $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$ is 2, which matches the McMillan degree of $H(s)$. Thus, this is a valid left coprime factorization.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and derive the final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) for the given transfer function matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Step 1: Find an initial, non-coprime factorization D1(s), N1(s)\n    # This is done by finding a common denominator for each row.\n    d1 = s + 1\n    d2 = s**2 - 1\n    D1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [d1, 0],\n        [0, d2]\n    ])\n    N1 = sympy.simplify(D1 * H)\n\n    # Step 2: Check for coprimeness by examining the rank at the roots of det(D1(s))\n    # det(D1(s)) = (s+1)*(s^2-1), roots are s=1, s=-1.\n    M1 = D1.row_join(N1)\n    \n    # At s = -1, the matrix M1 loses rank\n    M1_at_minus_1 = M1.subs(s, -1)\n    \n    # Step 3: Extract the common left divisor\n    # Find the left null space of M1 at s = -1\n    # The nullspace of M.T gives the left nullspace of M\n    left_nullspace_basis = M1_at_minus_1.T.nullspace()\n    \n    # The basis vector is [1, 1].
