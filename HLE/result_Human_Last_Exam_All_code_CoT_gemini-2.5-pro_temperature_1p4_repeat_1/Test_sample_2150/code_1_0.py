# The three clues point to three distinct cities. Here is the step-by-step deciphering process.

# 1. Deciphering the first city:
# The first clue refers to Irving Wallace's novel, "The Miracle".
# This book focuses on the 1858 apparitions of the Virgin Mary, often referred to as the "lady in white,"
# to a young girl named Bernadette Soubirous. These events took place in the French town of Lourdes.
city_1 = "Lourdes"

# 2. Deciphering the second city:
# The second clue mentions a poem by Yuri Krasnokutsky. The line "a cold stream flowing through the blood of 'X'"
# is a metaphorical reference to the poem "Kholodny Yar" (Холодний Яр, meaning "Cold Ravine").
# Kholodny Yar is a historic forest area in Ukraine, the site of many bloody rebellions, hence the "blood" metaphor.
# The city most closely associated with this historic site is Chyhyryn, the former Cossack capital.
city_2 = "Chyhyryn"

# 3. Deciphering the third city:
# The third clue mentions "Dolac," which is the main open-air market in Zagreb, Croatia.
# Its well-known nickname is "Trbuh Zagreba," which translates to the "Belly of Zagreb."
# The name "Zagreb" is the toponym in the nickname. The term "Belly of a city" for a market
# has a famous literary analogue in Émile Zola's novel "Le Ventre de Paris" ("The Belly of Paris").
# The novel is set in the bustling Les Halles market in Paris. Therefore, the city of the analogue is Paris.
city_3 = "Paris"

# Now, we will format and print the final trilogy as requested.
# The final result is composed of the three cities we found:
print(f"{{{city_1}, {city_2}, {city_3}}}")
