    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we will use logarithms. The number is extremely small, so direct computation is not feasible.\n\n### Plan\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We are looking for the first two non-zero digits of $N$. When $N$ is written in scientific notation, it has the form $d \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le d < 10$ is the significand and $k$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are the first two digits of $d$.\n\nTo find $d$, we take the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$M = \\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nFrom this, we can express $N$ as $N = 10^M$.\nAny real number $M$ can be written as the sum of its integer part and its fractional part: $M = \\lfloor M \\rfloor + \\{M\\}$, where $\\lfloor M \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $M$, and $0 \\le \\{M\\} < 1$ is the fractional part.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $N$:\n$N = 10^{\\lfloor M \\rfloor + \\{M\\}} = 10^{\\{M\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor M \\rfloor}$\n\nThis is the scientific notation for $N$. The significand is $d = 10^{\\{M\\}}$, and the exponent is $k = \\lfloor M \\rfloor$. Since $0 \\le \\{M\\} < 1$, we have $10^0 \\le 10^{\\{M\\}} < 10^1$, which means $1 \\le d < 10$.\n\nThe task is now reduced to these steps:\n1.  Calculate the integer $X = 7^{13}$.\n2.  Calculate $M = -X \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$ using high precision. The value $\\log_{10}(e)$ is irrational, so we need enough precision to determine the fractional part of $M$ accurately.\n3.  Find the fractional part of $M$, which is $\\{M\\} = M - \\lfloor M \\rfloor$.\n4.  Compute the significand $d = 10^{\\{M\\}}$.\n5.  Extract the first two digits of $d$. The first digit is $\\lfloor d \\rfloor$, and the second digit is $\\lfloor (d - \\lfloor d \\rfloor) \\cdot 10 \\rfloor$.\n\nWe will use the `mpmath` library in Python for the required high-precision floating-point arithmetic.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef solve_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for the calculation. 50 decimal places are sufficient.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 50\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate X = 7^13. Python's integers have arbitrary precision.\n    X = 7**13\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate M = -X * log10(e)\n    # mpmath.log10(mpmath.e) provides a high-precision value of log10(e)\n    log10_e = mpmath.log10(mpmath.e)\n    M = -X * log10_e\n\n    # Step 3: Find the fractional part of M, {M} = M - floor(M)\n    k = mpmath.floor(M)\n    frac_M = M - k\n\n    # Step 4: Compute the significand d = 10^{M}\n    d = mpmath.power(10, frac_M)\n\n    # Step 5: Extract the first two digits of d\n    d1 = int(mpmath.floor(d))\n    d2 = int(mpmath.floor((d - d1) * 10))\n\n    # Print the details of the calculation as requested\n    print(\"The problem is to find the first two non-zero digits of N = e^(-7^13).\")\n    print(\"We analyze this using base-10 logarithms.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
