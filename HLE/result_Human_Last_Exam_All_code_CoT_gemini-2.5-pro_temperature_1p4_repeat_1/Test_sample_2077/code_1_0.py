    # C_m0 = (G_F**2 * Q_W**2 * F**2 * M**3) / (pi * (E_nu + 2*M)**2)
    # The series expansion of C_m0 around M=oo (or E_nu=0) gives the leading term:
    C_approx_derived = sp.series(C_m0, E_nu, 0, 1).coeff(E_nu, 0)

    # For the bracket B, after setting m_nu=0:
    # B_m0 = 1 - T/E_nu - M*T/(2*E_nu**2)
    # To compare terms, we note T is at most of order E_nu^2/M.
    # The ratio (T/E_nu) / (M*T/(2*E_nu**2)) = 2*E_nu/M.
    # Since E_nu << M, this ratio is small, so we neglect the T/E_nu term.
