# The problem presents a logical paradox and asks for the most logical resolution.
# We have identified Choice C as the correct answer. This script demonstrates why.

# --- Propositions from Choice C ---
# P: The dog detects an intruder.
# Q: The dog barked.
# R: The dog was asleep.

# --- Known Facts from the Story ---
# We are given verifiable proof that "The dog detected an intruder, but the dog did not bark."
# This means P is True, and Q is False.
P = True
Q = False

print("Step 1: Define the known facts from the story.")
print(f"Fact: The dog detected an intruder. Therefore, P = {P}")
print(f"Fact: The dog did not bark. Therefore, Q = {Q}\n")

# --- The Logical Argument from Choice C ---
# The argument is: [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P),∴R
# This breaks down into two main premises leading to a conclusion.

# Premise 1 (The new rule): (P AND NOT R) implies Q
# In programming, A -> B is equivalent to (not A) or B.
# So, the rule is: not(P and not R) or Q

# Premise 2 (The known event): P AND NOT Q

# Conclusion: R

print("Step 2: State the refined logical rule from Answer C.")
print("Rule: If the dog detects an intruder (P) AND is not asleep (¬R), then it will bark (Q).")
print("Symbolically: (P ∧ ¬R) → Q\n")

# We need to find the value of R that makes the rule TRUE, given our known facts for P and Q.
# We will test both possibilities for R (the dog was asleep, R=True; or the dog was not asleep, R=False).

print("Step 3: Test the rule to find the value of R (the dog's state of sleep).")

# Scenario 1: Assume the dog was NOT asleep (R = False)
R_test_1 = False
rule_holds_1 = (not (P and not R_test_1)) or Q
print(f"Testing 'R = False' (dog was not asleep):")
print(f"  Is (P({int(P)}) ∧ ¬R({int(not R_test_1)})) → Q({int(Q)}) true? ... {rule_holds_1}")

# Scenario 2: Assume the dog WAS asleep (R = True)
R_test_2 = True
rule_holds_2 = (not (P and not R_test_2)) or Q
print(f"Testing 'R = True' (dog was asleep):")
print(f"  Is (P({int(P)}) ∧ ¬R({int(not R_test_2)})) → Q({int(Q)}) true? ... {rule_holds_2}\n")


print("Step 4: Conclude based on the results.")
print("The logical rule only holds true if R is True.")
print("This means the only logical explanation under this rule is that the dog was asleep.")

# Set the final derived value for R
R = True

print("The complete, resolved argument is:")
print("If (the dog detects an intruder AND is not asleep), it will bark.")
print("AND")
print("The dog detected an intruder AND did not bark.")
print("THEREFORE")
print("The dog was asleep.\n")

print("Final Proposition Values:")
print("P (detected intruder) = " + str(int(P)))
print("Q (barked) = " + str(int(Q)))
print("R (was asleep) = " + str(int(R)))
