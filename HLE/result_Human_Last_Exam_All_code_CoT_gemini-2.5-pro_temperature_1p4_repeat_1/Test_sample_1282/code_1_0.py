    This function analyzes the possibility of a finite-time blow-up for the given
    Navier-Stokes type equation.

    The analysis of the H^1-norm energy inequality leads to a differential inequality
    for the enstrophy y(t) = ||∇u(t)||_L2^2 of the form:
        dy/dt <= 2 * K * y^3 / (1+t)^3

    The solution to the corresponding ordinary differential equation can blow up in finite time if the
    initial condition y(0) = y_0 is large enough. The condition for blow-up is:
        y_0^2 > 1/K
    where K is a constant derived from functional inequalities.

    If this condition is met, the blow-up time T* is given by the formula:
        T* = sqrt((K * y_0^2) / (K * y_0^2 - 1)) - 1

    This script calculates T* for a sample set of parameters that satisfy the blow-up condition.
