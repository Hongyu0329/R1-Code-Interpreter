    "This is a knowledge-based question. My plan is to identify the single genus of mushroom that is known for producing a blue spore print. I will then use a Python script to print this name as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the name of a specific mushroom genus.\n# Based on mycological knowledge, there is one genus famous for this trait.\n# This script will store the name of that genus in a variable and print it.\n\ngenus_name = \"Lactarius\"\n\nprint(f\"The name of the single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is: {genus_name}\")\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    There is a single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print, what is its name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
