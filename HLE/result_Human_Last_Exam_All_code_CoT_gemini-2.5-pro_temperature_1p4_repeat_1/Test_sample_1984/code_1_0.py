# The differential equation is x'(t) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x.
# Equilibrium points are solutions to -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.
# Factoring the expression: -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = -x(x - 1)^2 = 0.
# The equilibrium points are x = 0 and x = 1.
# To check for stability, we analyze the derivative of f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x,
# which is f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1.
# At x = 0, f'(0) = -1 < 0, so x = 0 is a stable equilibrium.
# At x = 1, f'(1) = 0. We analyze the sign of f(x) around x=1.
# For x < 1, f(x) < 0. For x > 1, f(x) < 0.
# Since the flow to the left of x=1 is away from x=1, it is not a stable equilibrium.
# Thus, there is only one stable equilibrium point.
# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, is 1.

# We need to calculate m - 2^4048
