# Step 2: Fix k_Yuk
# The SU(4) Yukawa term contains a part that corresponds to the SU(3) Yukawa term.

# The SU(3) term is sqrt(2) * f_abc * phi*_ia * psi_bi * lambda_c
# Equating the coefficients: 2 * k_Yuk = sqrt(2)
k_Yuk = math.sqrt(2) / 2

# Step 3: Fix k_{D+F}
# The coefficient of the scalar potential is related to the normalization of the scalar kinetic term.
# The N=4 Lagrangian has a scalar kinetic term L_kin = -1/8 * (D_phi)^2.
# In a canonical N=4 SYM theory with coupling g, the potential is V = (g^2/8) * ([phi_I, phi_J])^2.
# The N=1 D-term is given as L_D = 1/2 * (f_abc * phi*_i^b * phi_i^c)^2.
# The canonical D-term potential is V_D = (g^2/2) * (f_abc * phi*_i^b * phi_i^c)^2.
# Comparing L_D to V_D implies g = 1.
# The term L_{F+D} represents the full potential V, so its coefficient k_{D+F} is the overall normalization factor.
# With g=1, V = 1/8 * ([phi_I, phi_J])^2.
# Therefore, k_{D+F} = 1/8.
