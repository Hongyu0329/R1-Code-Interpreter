# Let p be the truth value of a quantum proposition P.
p = sympy.Symbol('p')

# Based on the problem's logic, we derived the condition for P to be a
# Quantum Temporal Fixed Point (QTFP). The derivation using fuzzy logic rules
# simplifies the complex temporal expressions to an equation for p.
# The condition is that the value of (P equivalence P) equals the value of (P xor P).
# This leads to the equation: max(p, 1-p) = min(p, 1-p).
# This equality only holds if the arguments are equal.
# So, we have the final equation:
# p = 1 - p
# Rearranging this gives:
final_equation = sympy.Eq(2 * p, 1)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The numbers are the coefficient of p and the constant on the right side.
coeff = final_equation.lhs.args[0]
const = final_equation.rhs

# Solving this equation for p:
