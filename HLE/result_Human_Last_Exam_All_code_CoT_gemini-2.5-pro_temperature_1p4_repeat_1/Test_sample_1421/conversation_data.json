    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start by defining the partition function `Z` as a path integral over anti-commuting variables called Grassmann fields (`ψ` and `ψ̄`), which are necessary to describe fermions.\n2.  The integrand will be the exponential of the negative Euclidean action, `exp(-S)`.\n3.  I will then define the Euclidean action `S` as the integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over imaginary time `τ` (from `0` to `β`) and `d`-dimensional space.\n4.  I will provide a common form for the fermionic Lagrangian density.\n5.  Finally, I will state the crucial anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time that the Grassmann fields must satisfy, which is a direct consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics.\n\nI will implement this plan in a Python script that prints the complete formula with explanations for each component.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism.\n    The formula is built step-by-step with explanations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is a path integral over Grassmann fields:\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Main formula for Z\n    print(\"Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - Z: The partition function.\")\n    print(\"  - ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ: A functional integral over all configurations of the anti-commuting\")\n    print(\"    Grassmann fields ψ(x, τ) and ψ̄(x, τ).\")\n    print(\"  - S[ψ̄, ψ]: The Euclidean action for the system.\\n\")\n\n    # Formula for the action S\n    print(\"The Euclidean action S is the integral of the Lagrangian density L over imaginary time τ and space:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"  S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫[from 0 to β] dτ ∫ dᵈx * L(ψ̄, ψ)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  - β: The inverse temperature, equal to 1 / (k_B * T).
