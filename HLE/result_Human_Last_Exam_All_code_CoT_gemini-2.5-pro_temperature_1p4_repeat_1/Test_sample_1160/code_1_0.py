    This function explains the derivation and calculates the final limit.
    The problem is to find the limit of ln(1/p_n)/ln(n) as n -> infinity.
    p_n is the probability that a simple random walk starting at (n,0,0) escapes from the cube C_n = [0,2n]^3.

    1. Interpretation of the problem:
    The starting point (n,0,0) is on an edge of the cube C_n. A literal interpretation
    of "escaping" means the walk has a high probability (>= 2/6) of exiting on the
    first step. This makes p_n -> constant and the limit 0.
    A more standard interpretation for such problems is to calculate the harmonic measure.
    We assume "escape" means hitting a designated "far" face before any other face.
    Given the start at (n,0,0) on the intersection of faces y=0 and z=0, let's
    re-interpret the starting point to be one step inside the domain, at (n,1,1),
    and the "escape" face to be y=2n. The other five faces are absorbing.

    2. Continuous analog:
    For large n, this probability can be approximated by the solution to the Laplace
    equation nabla^2 * u(x,y,z) = 0 in the cube [0, 2n] x [0, 2n] x [0, 2n],
    with boundary conditions u=1 on the face y=2n and u=0 on the other five faces.
    We need to find the value of u at the point (n, 1, 1).

    3. Asymptotic behavior of the solution:
    The solution u(x,y,z) near a corner of the domain defined by three orthogonal planes
    with zero potential (here, faces y=0, z=0, and x=0 or x=2n) behaves like u ~ y * z.
    More precisely, if a point (x0, y0, z0) is close to faces y=0 and z=0, but far from x=0 and x=2n,
    the potential u(x0, y0, z0) has a specific scaling.
    Let L = 2n be the side length of the cube.
    The potential u(x,y,z) is approximated by the leading term of its Fourier series expansion.
    The dependence on the distance from the faces is key:
    - The dependence on y (distance from the main absorbing face y=0) is linear for small y. So u ~ y.
    - The dependence on z (distance from the side absorbing face z=0) is also linear for small z, because of the boundary at z=0. So u ~ z.
    - The x-coordinate n is in the middle of the range [0, 2n], so the dependence on x does not produce a similar small factor.

    A detailed calculation via separation of variables shows that for a starting point (x0, y0, z0) = (n, 1, 1), the probability p_n is proportional to:
    p_n ~ sin(pi * x0 / (2n)) * sin(pi * z0 / (2n)) * sinh(gamma * y0)
    For x0=n, sin(pi*n/(2n)) = sin(pi/2) = 1.
    For z0=1, sin(pi*1/(2n)) ~ pi/(2n).
    For y0=1, sinh(gamma*1) ~ gamma ~ 1/(2n).
    This suggests p_n ~ 1/n * 1/n = 1/n^2.

    4. Calculation of the limit:
    If p_n is proportional to 1/n^2, let p_n = C/n^2 for some constant C.
    Then 1/p_n = (n^2)/C.
    ln(1/p_n) = ln(n^2 / C) = 2 * ln(n) - ln(C).
    The expression to evaluate is lim_{n->inf} (2 * ln(n) - ln(C)) / ln(n).
    This simplifies to lim_{n->inf} (2 - ln(C)/ln(n)).
    As n -> infinity, ln(n) -> infinity, so ln(C)/ln(n) -> 0.
    The limit is 2.
