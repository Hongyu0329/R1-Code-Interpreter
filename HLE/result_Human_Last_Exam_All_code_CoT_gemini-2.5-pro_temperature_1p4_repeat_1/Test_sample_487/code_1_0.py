# Parameters for the calculation
# k: rank of the invariant part of the Picard lattice of S under rho*
# N: number of connected components of the fixed locus of rho
# Nf: number of fixed points of the involution psi on C

# We want to maximize h_1_1 = k + 1 + N * Nf

# Choice for the involution on C (genus 2 curve)
# The number of fixed points Nf can be 2 or 6.
# To maximize h_1_1, we choose the largest value for Nf.
Nf = 6

# Relation between k and N for non-symplectic involutions on K3 surfaces
# From analysis, the trend that maximizes h_1_1 is k + N = 12,
# where k can range from 2 to 10.
# The expression to maximize is h_1_1(k) = k + 1 + 6 * (12 - k) = 73 - 5k.
# To maximize this, we must minimize k.
k_min = 2

# The minimal value for k for a non-symplectic involution is 2.
k = k_min

# The corresponding number of components N
N = 12 - k

# Calculate the maximal h^{1,1}
h_1_1_max = k + 1 + N * Nf

# The question asks to output each number in the final equation.

print(f"To maximize this, we choose the hyperelliptic involution on C, which gives Nf = {Nf}.")
print(f"The optimal relation between k and N is N = 12 - k.")
print(f"The expression becomes h^{{1,1}}(M) = k + 1 + 6 * (12-k) = 73 - 5k.")
print(f"To maximize this, we must take the minimal possible value for k, which is k = {k}.")
print(f"This gives N = 12 - {k} = {N}.")
print(f"The final calculation is: h^{{1,1}}(M) = {k} + 1 + {N} * {Nf} = {h_1_1_max}")

# Final Answer
