    "This is a chess problem that can be solved by analyzing the position and finding the best move for White.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the initial position**: I will examine the board state from the provided FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation). This includes looking at the material balance, pawn structure, king safety, and the activity of the pieces for both White and Black.\n2.  **Identify White's threats and opportunities**: The most prominent feature for White is the advanced passed pawn on d6. This pawn is a significant threat to promote.\n3.  **Identify Black's threats and defenses**: Black's queen on c5 is very active. It prevents the White queen from attacking the Black king and also puts pressure on White's d6 pawn.\n4.  **Evaluate candidate moves for White**: I will consider several possible moves for White. The most forcing moves, like checks and captures, are usually the first to be considered.\n5.  **Select the best move**: I'll analyze the consequences of the most promising candidate move. In this case, trading queens appears to be a powerful idea, as it simplifies the position into a pawn endgame where White's advantages (better king position and pawn structure) become decisive.\n6.  **Formulate the final answer**: The best move will be presented in standard chess notation. The Python code below will print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess position and determines the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the chess position from FEN:\", fen)\n    print(\"White to move.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Position Analysis ###\")\n    print(\"White has a Queen on f2, a King on g1, and pawns on a4 and d6.\")\n    print(\"Black has a Queen on c5, a King on b6, and pawns on a5 and d7.\")\n    print(\"The material is equal.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Strategic Assessment ###\")\n    print(\"White's key advantage is the powerful passed pawn on d6.
