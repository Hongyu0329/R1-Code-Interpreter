    Identifies the indices of organisms that are mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis
    from a predefined list.
    
    A mutualistic relationship is identified for:
    - Adult pollinators (butterflies, bees, wasps) who feed on nectar and aid reproduction.
    - Adult ants that feed on nectar and protect the plant from herbivores.
    
    Larval stages are generally not mutualists; they are either herbivores (antagonistic)
    or do not interact with the plant at all.
