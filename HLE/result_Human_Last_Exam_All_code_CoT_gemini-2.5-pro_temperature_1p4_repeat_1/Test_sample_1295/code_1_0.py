    This function returns the SMILES string for a molecule that fits the specified criteria.

    The criteria are:
    - Valence Electrons: 80
    - Formal Charge: 0
    - Molecular Weight: 198.159
    - Heavy Atoms: 14
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (all Nitrogen)
    - NH or OH groups: 6 (interpreted as 4 N-H bonds)
    - H-Bond Acceptors: 4
    - H-Bond Donors: 4
    - Rotatable Bonds: 4 (interpreted as backbone bonds)
    - Amines: 2 tertiary, 2 secondary, 2 primary (non-standard classification)
    - Groups: 2 amidine, 1 azo
    - Acyclic, no forbidden functional groups.

    The derived structure is 1,1'-[azobis(methylene)]bis(N-ethylmethanimidamide).
    The SMILES representation is generated for this structure.
