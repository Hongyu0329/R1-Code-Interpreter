    Solves the optimization problem to find min(1000m + n).

    The problem states that there exists a polynomial map F from R^(3x5) to C^(n x n)
    of degree m, such that det(F) = 0 defines the set S.
    The set S is the set of 5-point configurations that are either coplanar
    or lie on a cone with one point as the apex.

    1. The degree of det(F) is at most m*n.
    2. The condition for the set S defines a single hypersurface whose
       defining polynomial has a known degree d. Based on results from
       algebraic geometry (discriminants of tensors), the degree d = 6.
    3. We must therefore satisfy the condition m * n >= d, where d=6.
    4. We want to minimize the expression 1000*m + n for positive integers m and n.
