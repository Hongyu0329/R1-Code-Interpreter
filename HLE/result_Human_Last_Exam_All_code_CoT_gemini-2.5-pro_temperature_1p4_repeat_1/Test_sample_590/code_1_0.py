  This function calculates the number of positive eigenvalues for the given stability operator L.
  
  Based on the analysis of the operator's spectral properties:
  1. The operator is decomposed by separation of variables into a series of 1D radial operators L_k.
  2. Each L_k is transformed into a Schrödinger operator H_k = -d^2/ds^2 + V_k(s).
  3. The potential V_k(s) decays at infinity like C/s^2.
  4. By Kato's theorem, a Schrödinger operator with a potential that satisfies lim |s|V(s) -> 0 as |s| -> infinity has no positive eigenvalues. Our potential satisfies this.
  5. Thus, there are no positive eigenvalues for any mode k.
  
  The total number of positive eigenvalues is the sum over all modes, which is 0.
