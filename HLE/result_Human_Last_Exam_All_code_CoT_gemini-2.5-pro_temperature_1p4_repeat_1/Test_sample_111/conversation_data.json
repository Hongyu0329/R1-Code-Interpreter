    "This is a historical question rather than a computational one. The most reliable way to answer this is by consulting historical records and literary analysis. I will provide a Python script that lays out the known facts and the reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Establish Geoffrey Chaucer's known location and occupation during that period.\n3.  Reference the key piece of literary evidence, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" which Chaucer wrote in her memory.\n4.  Synthesize these facts to conclude Chaucer's location.\n5.  Print the logical deduction and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the historical facts to determine Chaucer's\n    location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key historical facts\n    blanche_death_year = 1368\n    blanche_husband = \"John of Gaunt\"\n    chaucer_known_role = \"Esquire to King Edward III's household\"\n    chaucer_primary_location = \"England\"\n    commemorative_work = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n\n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\")\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {blanche_death_year}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's status and location at that time.\")\n    print(f\"During the late 1360s, Chaucer was established in royal service in England.\")\n    print(f\"He was an {chaucer_known_role}, which required his presence at the English court.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Consider the primary literary evidence.\")\n    print(f\"Chaucer wrote the poem '{commemorative_work}' as an elegy, or poem of remembrance, for Blanche.\")\n    print(f\"This work was written for her grieving husband, {blanche_husband}, who was Chaucer's patron.\")\n    print(\"The creation of such a personal and timely work strongly implies Chaucer was in England and part of the court circle when the death occurred.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"Based on his court duties and the writing of 'The Book of the Duchess', historical consensus places Chaucer in England at the time of Blanche's death.\")\n    print(\"His documented travels to France were generally for specific diplomatic missions, and his significant journeys to Italy occurred later in the 1370s.\")\n    \n# Execute the function to display the reasoning\nsolve_historical_question()\n\n# The final answer choice\nfinal_answer = \"C\"\n# sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\") # The instruction format is not well handled by all environments.\n# The instruction format '<<<' and '>>>' might be problematic in some environments,\n# so the final answer is printed in a clear format.\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(\"<<<C>>>\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
