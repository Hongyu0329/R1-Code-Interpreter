    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Curve:** The curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `x(t) = cos(9t)` is equivalent to `sin(9t + π/2)`, so we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n\n2.  **Check Properties:** We check the properties of `a` and `b` to find the correct formula for the number of self-intersections.\n    *   `a = 9` and `b = 5` are integers.\n    *   We find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`: `gcd(9, 5) = 1`. Since the GCD is 1, the numbers are coprime, and the curve is a closed loop that completes its pattern over the interval `t` in `[0, 2π]`.\n    *   We check the parity of `a` and `b`: both 9 and 5 are odd numbers.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** For a Lissajous curve `x = cos(at), y = sin(bt)` where `a` and `b` are coprime and both are odd integers, the number of self-intersection points `N` is given by the formula:\n    `N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** We substitute our values `a = 9` and `b = 5` into the formula:\n    `N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    `N = 8 * 4 / 2`\n    `N = 32 / 2`\n    `N = 16`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters 'a' and 'b' from the parametric equations\n# x(t) = cos(a*t), y(t) = sin(b*t)\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# For a Lissajous curve where 'a' and 'b' are coprime odd integers,\n# the number of self-intersections is given by the formula (a-1)*(b-1)/2.\n\n# Calculate the intermediate values for the final equation\nval_a_minus_1 = a - 1\nval_b_minus_1 = b - 1\nnumerator = val_a_minus_1 * val_b_minus_1\nnum_intersections = int(numerator / 2)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested\nprint(\"The number of self-intersection points is calculated using the formula N = (a-1)*(b-1)/2.\")\nprint(\"Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {val_a_minus_1} * {val_b_minus_1} / 2 = {numerator} / 2 = {num_intersections}\")\n\n# Print the final answer clearly\nprint(f\"\\nThe number of self-intersection points is: {num_intersections}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
