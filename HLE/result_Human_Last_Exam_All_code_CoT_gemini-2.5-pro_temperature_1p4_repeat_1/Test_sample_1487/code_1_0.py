# Based on the derivation, the expression simplifies significantly.
# The term ||alpha||^2 is (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1).
# The expression is (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15.
# Let's substitute ||alpha||^2 into the expression:
# (2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
# This cancels out to 1 + 10^15.

# Let's define the two numbers in the final simplified equation.
first_number = 1
second_number = 10**15

# Calculate the final result.
result = first_number + second_number

# As requested, we print the numbers in the final equation.
# The final equation is 1 + 10^15 = 1000000000000001.
print(f"The final simplified equation is: {first_number} + {second_number}")

# Print the final result.
print(f"The final value is: {result}")
