    # The chemical question is about the Si-N bond length in molecules like Me3Si-NHMe.
    # The bond is shorter than a calculated single bond. We must find the correct explanation.
    
    # Step 1: Analyze the key phenomenon.
    # A shorter bond implies a stronger interaction, often due to partial multiple-bond character.
    
    # Step 2: Consider the electronic structures of Si and N.
    # Nitrogen has a lone pair in a 2p orbital.
    # Silicon, being a 3rd-period element, has vacant, accessible 3d orbitals.
    
    # Step 3: Identify the interaction.
    # The lone pair from nitrogen's 2p orbital can donate electron density into an
    # empty 3d orbital of silicon. This is called pπ-dπ back-bonding.
    # This creates a partial pi (π) bond in addition to the sigma (σ) bond.
    
    # Step 4: Evaluate the result of this interaction.
    # This additional bonding character strengthens and shortens the overall Si-N bond.
    
    # Step 5: Match this reasoning with the provided answer choices.
    # Choice A correctly describes this pπ-dπ back-bonding.

The best explanation is the formation of a partial pi bond through pπ-dπ back-bonding.
Nitrogen's 2p lone pair orbital overlaps with an empty 3d orbital on silicon.
This creates partial double bond character, which strengthens and shortens the Si-N bond.
This matches choice A.
