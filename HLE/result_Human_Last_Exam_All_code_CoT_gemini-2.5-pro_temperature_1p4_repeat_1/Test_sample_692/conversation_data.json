    "Here is a plan to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Artifacts:** Research and compile a list of major archaeological artifacts that contain early dated inscriptions from pre-Columbian America. This includes artifacts from civilizations like the Maya, Zapotec, and Epi-Olmec.\n2.  **Establish Dates:** For each artifact, find its associated date. This involves converting dates from ancient calendar systems (like the Mesoamerican Long Count or the 260-day ritual calendar) into the proleptic Gregorian calendar, usually expressed in BCE (Before Common Era).\n3.  **Compare and Identify the Earliest:** Compare the BCE dates of all identified artifacts. The artifact with the highest BCE value represents the earliest recorded date.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be used to execute this logic.\n    *   It will store the artifacts and their dates in a data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).\n    *   The script will then programmatically find the entry with the earliest date.\n    *   Finally, it will print the details of this discovery, including the site, the artifact, the culture, the specific calendar notation, and its estimated date in BCE.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian\n    civilization by comparing several key archaeological finds.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on key archaeological finds with early recorded dates.\n    # BCE dates are stored as negative numbers for easy chronological sorting.\n    # The higher the absolute value, the earlier the date.\n    artifacts = [\n        {\n            \"site\": \"Tres Zapotes, Mexico\",\n            \"artifact\": \"Stela C\",\n            \"culture\": \"Epi-Olmec\",\n            \"year_bce\": 32,\n            \"date_notation\": \"Long Count date 7.16.6.16.18\",\n            \"note\": \"For a long time, this was considered one of the oldest Long Count dates.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"site\": \"Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\",\n            \"artifact\": \"Stela 2\",\n            \"culture\": \"Epi-Olmec\",\n            \"year_bce\": 36,\n            \"date_notation\": \"Long Count date 7.16.3.2.13\",\n            \"note\": \"Holds the record for the oldest known date from the Long Count calendar system.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"site\": \"San Bartolo, Guatemala\",\n            \"artifact\": \"Mural Fragments\",\n            \"culture\": \"Maya\",\n            \"year_bce\": 250, # This is an approximate date from radiocarbon dating\n            \"date_notation\": \"Day '7 Deer' from the 260-day ritual calendar\",\n            \"note\": \"Represents the earliest definitive evidence of a Mesoamerican calendar date, published in 2022.\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # Find the artifact with the largest BCE year (i.e., the earliest date)\n    earliest_artifact = max(artifacts, key=lambda x: x['year_bce'])\n\n    site = earliest_artifact[\"site\"]\n    date_notation = earliest_artifact[\"date_notation\"]\n    year = earliest_artifact[\"year_bce\"]\n\n    # Extracting numbers from the date notation for the final output string.\n    # This interprets the user's request to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    numbers_in_date = [s for s in date_notation.split() if s.isdigit()]\n\n    print(f\"The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization was found at {site}.\")\n    print(f\"The inscription is a date from the 260-day ritual calendar.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Date Details ---\")\n    print(f\"Recorded Date: '{date_notation}'\")\n    print(f\"Estimated Year: Approximately {year} BCE\")\n    # Fulfills the requirement to output the numbers in the \"equation\" or notation.\n    print(f\"The key number from the notation is: {numbers_in_date[0]}\")\n    print(f\"The year associated with the finding is: {year}\")\n\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<The earliest known date recorded is the glyph \"7 Deer\" found on mural fragments at San Bartolo, Guatemala, dated to approximately 250 BCE.>>>"
