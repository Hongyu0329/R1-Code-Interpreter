    # Mom
    print("\n1. Word for 'Mom':")
    print(f"   - In {language1}: The formal word is 'Anne', but the nursery word 'Mama' is universally used by children.")
    print(f"   - In {language2}: The formal word is 'Nanay', but 'Mama' is a very common alternative, likely from Spanish influence.")
    print("   - Result: The word 'Mama' provides a strong similarity.")

    # Dad
    print("\n2. Word for 'Dad':")
    print(f"   - In {language1}: The word is 'Baba'.")
    print(f"   - In {language2}: The formal word is 'Tatay', but 'Papa' is a common alternative, also from Spanish influence.")
    print("   - Result: Turkish 'Baba' and the common Tagalog alternative 'Papa' are phonetically very similar.")

    # Broom
    print("\n3. Word for 'Broom':")
    print("   - This is the misleading part of the riddle.")
    print(f"   - In {language1}: The word for broom is 'süpürge'.")
    print(f"   - In {language2}: The word for broom is 'walis'.")
    print("   - Result: These two words are completely different. The riddle's premise that 'broom' is also similar is factually incorrect, which is what makes it a clever puzzle.")

    # Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The two cultures have no significant history of direct contact, fulfilling that criterion.")
    print("Despite the inaccuracy regarding 'broom', the striking similarity in the widely used words for 'mom' and 'dad' makes Turkish and Tagalog the accepted answer to this classic riddle.")
