    "Here is a plan to find the value of $K$:\n1.  The problem provides an asymptotic formula for the slice rank of a specific tensor: $SR(T_n) = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n2.  The tensor is given by $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$ on the space $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n3.  A standard technique to find a lower bound on the slice rank is to analyze the dimension of the space of matrix slices. We fix one variable, say $x \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$, and view the tensor as a collection of matrices $M_x(y,z)$. The dimension of the vector space spanned by these matrices provides a lower bound on the slice rank.\n4.  Let's define the matrices $M_x(y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. These are $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrices.\n5.  Let's analyze the vector space spanned by these matrices. Let $S_i$ be the $2 \\times 2$ matrix for the term $(y_i+z_i)$, so $S_i = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Let $I_i$ be the $2\\times 2$ identity matrix. The term $(x_i+y_i+z_i)$ corresponds to $S_i$ if $x_i=0$, and $I_i+S_i$ if $x_i=1$. Let $J$ be the $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix of all ones.\n    The matrix slice for a given $x$ is $M_x = \\left(\\bigotimes_{i=1}^n (x_i I_i + S_i)\\right) - J$.\n6.  The space spanned by the first part, $\\left\\{\\bigotimes_{i=1}^n (x_i I_i + S_i) \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\right\\}$, is the algebra generated by the matrices $S_1, \\dots, S_n$. The matrices $I_i$ and $S_i$ are linearly independent. Thus, the tensor products of these matrices form a basis for a space of dimension $2^n$.\n7.  The space spanned by $\\{M_x\\}_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}$ is therefore the span of this $2^n$-dimensional space and the matrix $J$. The matrix $J$ is not in the span of the other matrices because the $2 \\times 2$ all-ones matrix $J_1$ cannot be written as a linear combination of $I_1$ and $S_1$.\n8.  Thus, the dimension of the space spanned by the matrix slices $\\{M_x\\}$ is $2^n + 1$. This gives a lower bound for the slice rank: $SR(T_n) \\ge 2^n + 1$.\n9.  Now we compare this lower bound with the given asymptotic formula.\n    $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)} \\ge 2^n + 1$.\n    For large $n$, this implies the base of the exponent on the left must be at least as large as the base on the right.\n    $3/2^K \\ge 2$.\n10. It is a known phenomenon that for many natural tensor constructions, such as this one (a tensor power perturbed by a rank-1 tensor), the lower bound obtained by this method is asymptotically tight. Assuming this is the case, we can equate the bases.\n    $3/2^K = 2$.\n11. From this equation, we can solve for $K$:\n    $2^K = 3/2$.\n    $K = \\log_2(3/2) = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3) - 1$.\n12. I will write a Python script to compute this value and show the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: The problem provides the slice rank formula SR = (3/2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).\n# Step 2: We derived a lower bound for the slice rank, SR >= 2^n + 1.\n# Step 3: We assume the asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is determined by this lower bound.\n# This leads to the equation: 3 / (2^K) = 2.\n# We solve for K.\n\n# 3 / (2**K) = 2  => 2**K = 3/2\n# K = log2(3/2)\n\nK = math.log2(3) - math.log2(2)\n\nprint(\"The final equation is 3 / (2^K) = 2.\")\nprint(\"Solving for K, we get 2^K = 3/2.\")\nprint(\"This gives K = log2(3/2) = log2(3) - 1.\")\nprint(f\"The value of K is: {K}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.5849625007211562>>>"
