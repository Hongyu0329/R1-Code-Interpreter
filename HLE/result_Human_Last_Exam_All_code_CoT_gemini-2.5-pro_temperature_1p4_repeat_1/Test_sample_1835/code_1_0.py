    This script models the Generality Constraint (GC) to answer the user's question.
    The GC posits that thought components (like subjects and predicates) are recombinable.
    We extend this to logical operators like the universal quantifier.

    - 'Fa' means you understand a predicate 'F' and a subject 'a'.
    - '∀x' means you understand the concept of universal quantification.
    - The GC implies you can combine the predicate 'F' with the quantifier '∀x'
      to form the new thought '∀x Fx'.
