    "My plan to find the closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ is as follows:\n\n1.  **Recognize the structure of the sum.** The sum is a convolution of two sequences, $a_k = (2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions of these sequences, i.e., $S_n = [x^n](A(x)B(x))$.\n\n2.  **Find the generating functions.**\n    *   The generating function for $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$ is well-known: $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n    *   The generating function for $a_k$ can be derived from $B(x)$ by applying the differential operator $D_1 = 2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1$. We have $A(x) = D_1^5 B(x)$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the product of generating functions.** I will carry out the repeated application of the operator $D_1$ to find a closed form for $A(x)$, which will be of the form $P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-11/2}$ where $P_5(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 4. Then, I will compute the product $A(x)B(x) = P_5(x)(1-4x)^{-6}$.\n\n4.  **Extract the coefficient of $x^n$.** Using the generalized binomial theorem, $[x^k](1-z)^{-N} = \\binom{k+N-1}{k}z^k$, I will find the expression for $S_n$.\n\n5.  **Simplify the expression.** The resulting expression for $S_n$ will be a sum of several binomial coefficient terms. I will simplify this sum into a more compact polynomial expression in $n$.\n\n6.  **Provide the final code.** The Python code will print the final closed-form equation and include a function to compute the sum for a given integer $n$, demonstrating the formula's usage.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum_closed_form(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum S_n for a given integer n using the derived closed-form formula.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): A non-negative integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The value of the sum.
