    This function explains and prints the solution to the given set theory problem.
    The problem asks for the order type of the set X of possible cofinalities for
    the cardinality of the continuum, under specific assumptions.

    Based on the analysis:
    1. The set X contains all regular cardinals lambda such that omega < lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    2. The order type of this set of cardinals corresponds to the order type of their indices.
    3. The set of these indices is the set of all successor ordinals and all regular limit ordinals
       that are less than the ordinal delta = omega_{omega+5}.
    4. The order type of this set of ordinals is delta itself.
    
    The final answer is the ordinal omega_{omega+5}. This script will print this expression.
