    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes in a Coordinate System:** I will define the first cube in a standard 3D coordinate system. To make the calculations straightforward, I'll place one of its corners at the origin (0, 0, 0). This means the first cube occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Position of the Second Cube:** The problem states the second cube is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal. The main diagonal of our first cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite corner (1, 1, 1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal means the second cube's starting corner is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, the second cube occupies the space where `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n3.  **Define the Intersection Region:** The volume of intersection is the region where the two cubes overlap. I will find this region by determining the overlapping range for each coordinate (x, y, and z).\n    *   For the x-coordinate, the overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   The same logic applies to the y and z coordinates, giving an overlap of `[1/2, 1]` for both.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection region is a smaller cube. The length of each side is the size of the overlapping range, which is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`. The volume of this new cube is simply its side length cubed: `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)`.\n\n5.  **Generate the Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script to automate these steps and print out the calculation for the final volume.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes of side length 1,\n    where one is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Side length of the original cubes\n    side_length = 1.0\n\n    # We define the first cube (C1) from the origin.\n    # Its coordinates range from 0 to 1 on each axis.\n    c1_min = 0.0\n    c1_max = side_length\n\n    # The shift is 1/2 along the main diagonal.
