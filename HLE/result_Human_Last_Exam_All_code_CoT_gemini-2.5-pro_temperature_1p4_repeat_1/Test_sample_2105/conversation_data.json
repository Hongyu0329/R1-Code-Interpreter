    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecule:** The starting compound is di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide. Its major reduction product, formed by cleaving the disulfide bond, is perylene-3-thiol. We will calculate the topological indices for a single molecule of perylene-3-thiol.\n2.  **Represent as a Graph:** We will use the molecule's SMILES string (`c1cc2c3c(c(S)c4ccccc4c3cc1)cc5ccccc25`) and the `rdkit` library to construct its molecular graph. As specified, we will include all hydrogen atoms in this graph representation.\n3.  **Calculate Indices:** We will use the `networkx` library for the graph calculations.\n    *   The **Wiener index (W)**, which is the sum of the shortest paths between all pairs of atoms, will be calculated using a built-in `networkx` function.\n    *   The **Szeged index (Sz)** will be calculated by implementing its definition. We'll iterate over every bond (edge) in the molecule. For each bond connecting atoms `u` and `v`, we'll count the number of atoms closer to `u` (`n_u`) and the number of atoms closer to `v` (`n_v`). The Szeged index is the sum of the products (`n_u * n_v`) over all bonds.\n4.  **Compute Ratio and Output:** Finally, the code will compute the ratio of the Szeged index to the Wiener index and print the final equation showing all values.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\ndef calculate_molecular_indices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for perylene-3-thiol, including hydrogens.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the molecule and construct the graph.\n    # The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol.\n    # Its SMILES string is used to generate the molecular graph.\n    smiles = \"c1cc2c3c(c(S)c4ccccc4c3cc1)cc5ccccc25\"\n    \n    # Create an RDKit molecule object from the SMILES string.\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if mol is None:\n        print(\"Error: Could not create molecule from the provided SMILES string.\")\n        return\n\n    # Add explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecule as required.\n    mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    \n    # Create an empty NetworkX graph.\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    \n    # Add atoms from the molecule as nodes in the graph.\n    G.add_nodes_from(range(mol_h.GetNumAtoms()))\n    \n    # Add bonds from the molecule as edges in the graph.\n    for bond in mol_h.GetBonds():\n        G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx())\n\n    print(f\"The analysis is for perylene-3-thiol (C20H12S).\")\n    print(f\"The molecular graph contains {mol_h.GetNumAtoms()} atoms (vertices), including hydrogens.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate Wiener Index (W).\n    # This is the sum of shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes.\n    wiener_index = nx.wiener_index(G)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate Szeged Index (Sz).\n    szeged_index = 0\n    # Pre-calculate all-pairs shortest path lengths for efficiency.\n    path_lengths = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))\n\n    # Iterate over each edge (bond) in the graph.\n    for u, v in G.edges():\n        n_u = 0  # Counter for nodes closer to u\n        n_v = 0  # Counter for nodes closer to v\n        \n        # For each node w, determine if it's closer to u or v.\n        for w in G.nodes():\n            dist_wu = path_lengths[w][u]\n            dist_wv = path_lengths[w][v]\n            if dist_wu < dist_wv:\n                n_u += 1\n            elif dist_wv < dist_wu:\n                n_v += 1\n        \n        # Add the product of the counts to the Szeged index.\n        szeged_index += n_u * n_v\n\n    # Step 5: Compute and print the ratio.\n    if wiener_index == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Wiener index is zero, so the ratio cannot be calculated.\")\n        return\n\n    ratio = szeged_index / wiener_index\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Result ---\")\n    print(f\"Szeged index (Sz) / Wiener index (W) = {szeged_index} / {wiener_index} = {ratio}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        calculate_molecular_indices()\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Required libraries are not installed.
