    "This is a classic literary riddle. My plan is to deduce the answer by breaking down the clues and finding the single poet who fits all the criteria.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues**: The key pieces of information are: \"English poet\", \"Vienna\", \"wide boulevards\", and \"Russian translation of an essay\".\n2.  **Find the Poet**: I will search for a famous English poet who has a strong, well-known connection to Vienna. The most prominent candidate is W. H. Auden, who spent his final years in Austria and died in Vienna.\n3.  **Find the Essayist**: The reference to a \"Russian translation\" and a literary context strongly points towards the work of Joseph Brodsky, a Russian-American poet and essayist. Brodsky was a great admirer and friend of Auden and wrote extensively about him, often connecting him to Vienna.\n4.  **Connect the Pieces**: The essay is likely one by Brodsky. When describing Vienna, a place inextricably linked with Auden for him, he would have found a way to subtly reference the poet. This is where the \"surname appears\". The wide boulevards of Vienna provide the setting for this literary nod.\n5.  **Construct the Code**: My python script will walk through this logical deduction, explaining each step and finally printing the surname of the poet.\n\n```python\ndef solve_literary_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a literary riddle by deducing the identity of a poet based on a series of clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Deconstruct the riddle into its core components.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the clues from the riddle.\")\n    clues = {\n        \"Nationality\": \"English\",\n        \"Occupation\": \"Poet\",\n        \"Location\": \"Vienna\",\n        \"Context\": \"Describing wide boulevards in a Russian translation of an essay.\"\n    }\n    for key, value in clues.items():\n        print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the most likely poet based on the clues.\n    # W.

H. Auden.
