# Step 1: Use boundary conditions to determine the initial state (x_0^1, x_0^2).
# From the periodicity of the system (period 3), the condition x_2025^2 = 10^20
# simplifies to x_0^2 = 10^20, since 2025 is a multiple of 3.
x0_2 = 10.0**20

# Step 2: Use the second boundary condition. As explained in the plan,
# assuming a typo in the problem statement to ensure a unique solution,
# we derive the relationship x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 3: The value to be found has been shown to be equivalent to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
# Calculate this value.
result = x0_1**2 + x0_2**2

# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number, as requested.
# We format the numbers in scientific notation for clarity.
print("Based on the derivation, the calculation is:")
