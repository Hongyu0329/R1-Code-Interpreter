    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics, denoted as `a(n)`, is given by the double factorial `(2n-1)!!`.\n2.  **Set the Value of n:** The problem asks for `a(3)`, so we will set `n=3`.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** We will substitute `n=3` into the formula: `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = (6 - 1)!! = 5!!`. The double factorial `5!!` is calculated as the product of all integers from 5 down to 1 with the same parity, which is `5 * 3 * 1`.\n4.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out the full equation and the final answer as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_feynman_diagrams(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n - 1)!!.\n    This function prints the calculation step-by-step for a(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the base of the double factorial\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of diagrams, a({n}), is given by the formula (2*n - 1)!!.\")\n    print(f\"For n={n}, this is ({2}*{n} - 1)!! = {k}!!.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n\n    # Calculate the double factorial and create the equation string\n    result = 1\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    # Iterate from k down to 1 with a step of -2\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        equation_parts.append(str(i))\n\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {result}\")\n    \n    return result\n\n# We need to find a(3)\nn_value = 3\nfinal_answer = calculate_feynman_diagrams(n_value)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
