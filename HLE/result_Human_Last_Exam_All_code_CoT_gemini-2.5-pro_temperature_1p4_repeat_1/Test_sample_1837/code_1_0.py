# Step 1: Define physical constants and given measurements
# --- Constants
h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant (J*s)
c = 299792458.0   # Speed of light (m/s)
k = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant (J/K)

# --- Given measurements
lambda_val = 400e-9  # Wavelength in meters (400 nm)
B_val = 1.2e15       # Spectral radiance in W/(m^2 * sr * m)
T_measured = 9000.0  # Temperature in Kelvin

# Step 2: Use Planck's Law to calculate the expected temperature
# Formula: T = (h*c) / (λ*k * ln( (2*h*c^2 / (λ^5 * B)) + 1 ))

# Step 3: Print the calculation step-by-step
print("Calculating the expected temperature T assuming wavelength (λ) and spectral radiance (B) are correct.")
print("The formula to solve for T is:")
print("T = (h*c) / (λ*k * ln( (2*h*c^2 / (λ^5 * B)) + 1 ))")
print("-" * 30)

# Calculate intermediate terms for clarity
hc = h * c
hc_over_k = hc / k
two_h_c_sq = 2 * h * c**2
lambda_5_B = lambda_val**5 * B_val
lambda_k = lambda_val * k

print("Substituting the numerical values into the formula:")
print(f"T = ({hc:.6e}) / ({lambda_k:.6e} * ln( ({two_h_c_sq:.6e} / {lambda_5_B:.6e}) + 1 ))")

# Calculate the argument of the natural logarithm
log_argument = (two_h_c_sq / lambda_5_B) + 1
print(f"T = ({hc/lambda_k:.1f}) / ln({log_argument:.4f})")

# Calculate the natural logarithm
log_result = math.log(log_argument)
print(f"T = {hc/lambda_k:.1f} / {log_result:.4f}")

# Final calculation for Temperature
T_calculated = (hc / lambda_k) / log_result
print("-" * 30)
print(f"The calculated temperature is {T_calculated:.0f} K.")

# Compare calculated T with measured T to confirm there is an error
# A measured T of 9000 K is significantly different from the calculated T.
# The calculated value of ~15182 K is a typical temperature for a DB white dwarf star,
# making the original temperature measurement the most likely error.
# The final answer format is Xv where X is the quantity and v is the corrected value.
