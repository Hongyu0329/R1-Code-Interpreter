    "The task is to find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Group Structure:** First, we determine the structure of such a group $G$. The classification of reductive groups over a field depends on the split group of the same type and the Galois action on the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has a trivial automorphism group. This implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over any field is an 'inner form' of the split group. Over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, Lang's theorem implies that all inner forms of a given split group are isomorphic. Therefore, any reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is the unique (up to isomorphism) split group of type $E_8$.\n\n2.  **Counting Tori:** For a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, $W$. This is a classical result in the theory of reductive groups.\n\n3.  **Weyl Group of E8:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$. The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the group $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Number:** The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ is a well-known result from the mathematical literature on reflection groups and Lie theory. This number has been computed and is a constant, independent of the field size $q$. This value is 112. It's a non-trivial computation, originally carried out using extensive character theory calculations and later verified by computer algebra systems.\n\n5.  **Final Code:** I will provide a Python script that states this established number as the solution.\n\n```python\n# The number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8\n# over the finite field Fq is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in\n# its Weyl group, W(E8). This is because any such group is split,\n# and for split groups, this correspondence holds.\n# The number of conjugacy classes in W(E8) is a known mathematical constant.\n\nnum_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n\n# The problem boils down to stating this known number.\n# The \"equation\" is the equality between the number of tori and the number of conjugacy classes.\nprint(f\"Number of Fq-rational maximal tori in G(type E8) = Number of conjugacy classes in W(E8) = {num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8}\")\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
