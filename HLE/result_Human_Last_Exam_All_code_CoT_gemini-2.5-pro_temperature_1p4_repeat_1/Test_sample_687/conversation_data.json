    "To solve this problem, I will use the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality, which provides a lower bound on the minimum number of Seifert circles of a knot from its HOMFLY polynomial.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Retrieve the HOMFLY polynomial**: The HOMFLY polynomial, denoted $P(a, z)$, is a powerful knot invariant. I will use the `spherogram` Python library to get this polynomial for the specified knot, $9_{23}$.\n2.  **Calculate the a-span**: The inequality uses the \"span\" of the first variable, `a`, in the polynomial. The span is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of `a` found in the polynomial terms.\n3.  **Apply the Morton-Franks-Williams Inequality**: The inequality states that the minimum number of Seifert circles, `s`, for any diagram of a knot is bounded by the formula: `s >= span_a(P) / 2 + 1`.\n4.  **Compute the Bound**: By substituting the calculated span of `a` for the $9_{23}$ knot into the inequality, I will determine the numerical value of the lower bound.\n5.  **Present the Result**: The Python script will carry out these calculations and print each step, including the polynomial itself, the calculation of the span, and the final application of the inequality to find the answer.\n\n```python\n# Note: This script requires the 'spherogram' library.\n# You can install it using pip: pip install spherogram\n# Spherogram may have dependencies (like the SnapPy kernel) that also need to be installed.\n\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_seifert_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    for the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the knot\n        knot = spherogram.Knot(9, 23)\n\n        print(f\"Finding a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the {knot.name()} knot.\")\n        print(\"The method uses the Morton-Franks-Williams inequality on the HOMFLY polynomial.\\n\")\n\n        # 1.
