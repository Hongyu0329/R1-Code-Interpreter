    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S, 2R) designation for substituents on adjacent carbons (C1 and C2) in a cyclohexane ring means they are **cis** to each other.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, bulky base.\n    *   The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** mechanism.\n\n2.  **Analyze E2 Mechanism Requirements:**\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and a beta-proton (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be **anti-periplanar**. For a cyclohexane ring, this means both groups must be in **axial** positions.\n\n3.  **Examine the Chair Conformations:**\n    *   The substrate, *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, exists in equilibrium between two chair conformations. For the E2 reaction to happen, the Bromine atom must be in an axial position.\n    *   Let's consider the conformation where Br is axial. Because the methyl group is *cis* to the Br group, the methyl group must also be in an axial position.\n    *   So, the reactive conformer has both **Br axial** and the **methyl group axial**.\n\n4.  **Identify Available Beta-Protons:**\n    *   The beta-carbons are C2 and C6. We need to find an **axial** proton on either of these carbons.\n    *   **At C2:** This carbon has the axial methyl group. Therefore, the other substituent, the C2-proton, must be in the **equatorial** position. Since this proton is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial Bromine. Elimination cannot occur towards C2. This means the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene, **cannot be formed**.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two protons. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial proton at C6 is anti-periplanar** to the axial Bromine at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The base (tert-butoxide) will abstract the only available anti-periplanar proton, which is the axial proton on C6.\n    *   This abstraction leads to the formation of a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6.\n    *   The resulting alkene is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the product of the given chemical reaction.\n    Reaction: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\n    This is an E2 elimination reaction where the product is determined by the\n    anti-periplanar requirement of the leaving group and a beta-proton.\n    The only possible product due to stereochemical constraints is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    print(f\"The name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
