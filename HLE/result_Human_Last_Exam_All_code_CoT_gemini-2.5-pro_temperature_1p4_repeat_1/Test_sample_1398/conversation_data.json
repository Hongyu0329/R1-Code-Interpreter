    "My thought process to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I first examine the relationship between the input and output grids provided in the examples. My goal is to find a consistent rule that transforms any input grid into its corresponding output grid.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I'll look at individual cells. For a given cell at position `(row, col)`, its output value might depend on its own input value, or the values of its neighboring cells. A common pattern in such grid problems involves counting the \"on\" (value 1) neighbors for each cell. I'll consider the 8 cells immediately surrounding a target cell (the Moore neighborhood).\n\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:** Let's test the idea that the output value of a cell is determined solely by the number of its neighbors with a value of 1.\n    *   In *Input Grid 1*, the cell at `(0,0)` has 2 neighbors that are 1s (`(0,1)` and `(1,0)`). The output at `(0,0)` is 1.\n    *   In *Input Grid 1*, the cell at `(0,1)` has 1 neighbor that is a 1 (`(1,0)`). The output at `(0,1)` is 0.\n    *   In *Input Grid 5*, the cell at `(0,1)` has 2 neighbors that are 1s (`(1,1)` and `(1,2)`). The output at `(0,1)` is 1.\n    *   In *Input Grid 5*, the cell at `(2,2)` has 8 neighbors that are 1s. The output at `(2,2)` is 0.\n    *   In *Input Grid 3*, the cell at `(1,1)` has 4 neighbors that are 1s. The output at `(1,1)` is 0.\n\n    Based on these observations, a clear pattern emerges:\n    *   If a cell has 1 neighbor, the output is 0.\n    *   If a cell has 2 neighbors, the output is 1.\n    *   If a cell has 3 neighbors, the output is 1 (I can verify this with other cells, e.g., cell `(1,2)` from Input 1 has 3 neighbors and its output is 1).\n    *   If a cell has 4 neighbors, the output is 0.\n    *   If a cell has 8 neighbors, the output is 0.\n\n    The rule appears to be: The output cell's value is 1 if and only if it has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors with a value of 1 in the input grid. Otherwise, the output is 0. The original value of the cell itself does not affect the outcome. This rule is very similar to the \"survival/birth\" conditions in Conway's Game of Life.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:** Now I will apply this confirmed rule to the 6th input grid. I will calculate the number of neighbors for each cell and determine its new value.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will:\n    *   Take the 6th input grid.\n    *   Create a new grid for the output.\n    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.\n    *   For each cell, count its \"on\" neighbors, being careful not to go beyond the grid boundaries.\n    *   Apply the rule: if the neighbor count is 2 or 3, the output cell is 1; otherwise, it's 0.\n    *   Print the final calculated grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grid_puzzle(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the grid puzzle based on the neighbor counting rule.\n    A cell's new state is 1 if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, and 0 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Create a new grid to store the output, initialized with zeros\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Count the number of live neighbors (value 1)\n            live_neighbors = 0\n            # Iterate over the 3x3 neighborhood around the cell\n            for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(rows, r + 2)):\n                for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(cols, c + 2)):\n                    # Skip the cell itself\n                    if i == r and j == c:\n                        continue\n                    # If the neighbor is within bounds and is 'live', increment count\n                    if grid[i, j] == 1:\n                        live_neighbors += 1\n            \n            # Apply the rule: new cell is 1 if live_neighbors is 2 or 3\n            if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 1\n            else:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 0\n                \n    return output_grid\n\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the grid in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    for row in grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\n# The 6th input grid\ntest_input_grid = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Solve the puzzle for the given grid\nfinal_output_grid = solve_grid_puzzle(test_input_grid)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint_grid(final_output_grid)\n```\n<<<1111010011101011000101111>>>"
