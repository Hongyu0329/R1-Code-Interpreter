    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a literary knowledge question. The character who travels to a Roman-allied city and recounts their founding myth—which is clearly that of Romulus and Remus being suckled by a she-wolf—is Thiodolf's foster-father. He tells this story to explain the nature of the Romans (or \"Welsh\" as they are sometimes called in the book) to his people.\n\nHere is a Python script that prints this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character\n    in William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes\n    a founding myth analogous to Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    character_name = \"Thiodolf's foster-father\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"In the book, Thiodolf's foster-father travels to a Roman city. \"\n        \"He later describes the religious practices and founding myths he observed, \"\n        \"including a story about two twin brothers who were founded a great city \"\n        \"after being suckled by a she-wolf. This is a clear allusion to the Roman \"\n        \"myth of Romulus and Remus.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The character in question is: {character_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Thiodolf's foster-father>>>"
