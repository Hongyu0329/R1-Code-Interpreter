    # Using astronomical units (M_sun, kpc, km/s) to keep numbers manageable.

    # M_total = (v^2 * r) / G
    # Step-by-step to show the logic:
    # v^2 = {4, 1, 4}

    # Simplified: {129, 20, -2}. Numerator 129 overflows signed char.
    # Here we simulate the "overflow protection" by approximating the value.
    # Value is (129/20) * 10^-2 = 0.0645.
    # We approximate to 0.064, which is 64/1000 = 8/125.
    # This becomes the storable frac {8, 125, 0}.

    # The hypothetical C program would need:
    # 7 frac variables (v, r, G, M_lum, M_total, ratio, percentage)
    # 3 int variables for printing
    # Memory: frac = 6D, int = 5D
    z = (7 * 6) + (3 * 5)
