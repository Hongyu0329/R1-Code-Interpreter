    "My plan is to simulate the cellular automaton step-by-step for 20 generations.\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110:** I will represent Rule 110 as a dictionary. The keys will be the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns (e.g., `(1,1,1)`, `(1,1,0)`), and the values will be the resulting state of the center cell (0 or 1). Rule 110 corresponds to the binary sequence `01101110`.\n2.  **Initialize the Grid:** I'll create a 1-dimensional list to represent the cells. To ensure the pattern has space to grow without hitting the boundaries, I'll make the list wider than the maximum possible pattern size. For 20 generations, the pattern can grow by a maximum of 20 cells to the left and 20 to the right. A width of 81 cells should be more than sufficient. I will initialize this list with all zeros, except for a single `1` in the exact center.\n3.  **Simulate Generations:** I will loop 20 times. In each loop (representing one generation):\n    *   I'll create a new, empty list for the next generation.\n    *   I'll iterate through each cell of the current generation's grid.\n    *   For each cell, I'll look at its left and right neighbors to determine its 3-cell neighborhood.\n    *   Using the Rule 110 dictionary, I will determine the cell's state in the next generation and save it to the new list.\n    *   After iterating through all cells, I'll replace the current grid with the newly computed one.\n4.  **Output the Result:** After 20 loops, the grid will hold the final pattern. I will convert this list of numbers into a binary string. To present the result clearly, I will trim any leading or trailing zeros from the string before printing it.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates Rule 110 for 20 generations starting from a single '1'\n    and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    generations = 20\n    # Set a width that is large enough for the pattern to evolve for 20 steps.\n    # Pattern grows by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    # 2*20 + 1 = 41 is the max pattern width.
