    # Its properties are known from mathematical research.

    # Step 2: State the abelianization of G.
    # The abelianization of F_tau is known to be isomorphic to Z^2 (the direct product of two integer groups).
    # Ab(G) ~= Z x Z

    # The torsion subgroup consists of all elements of finite order.
    # In Z^2, only the identity element (0, 0) has finite order.
    # Thus, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.
    # The order of this group is 1.
