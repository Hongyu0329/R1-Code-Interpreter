    # Q6 (3D, a(n)>=9n-8?): Yes, this is a known conjecture.
    # Q7 (4D, a(n)>=17n-16?): Yes, this is a known conjecture, fitting a general form.
    # Q8 (5D, a(n)<33n-32?): No, this contradicts both the infinity conjecture and the lower bound conjecture.
    # Q9 (d>=2, a(n)>=(2^d+1)(n-1)+1?): Yes, this is the general form of the conjecture.
