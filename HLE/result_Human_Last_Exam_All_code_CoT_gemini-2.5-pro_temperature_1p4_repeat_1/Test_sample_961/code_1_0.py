    Calculates the stable commutator length of the given element c in the group G.

    The calculation proceeds in these steps:
    1. Apply the additivity of scl over free products:
       scl_G(c) = sum_{i=1 to 19} scl_Fi(c_i^30)
    2. Apply the homogeneity of scl:
       scl_Fi(c_i^30) = 30 * scl_Fi(c_i)
    3. Use the known result scl_F2([a, b]) = 1/2:
       scl_Fi(c_i) = 0.5
    4. Combine and compute the final value.
