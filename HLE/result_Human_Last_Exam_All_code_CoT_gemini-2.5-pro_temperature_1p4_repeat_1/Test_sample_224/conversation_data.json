    "To find the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define a Base-17 Palindrome**: A nine-digit palindrome in base 17 has the form `d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8`, where each `d_i` is a digit from 0 to 16. The value of this number (N) in base 10 can be expressed as:\n    `N = d8*17⁸ + d7*17⁷ + d6*17⁶ + d5*17⁵ + d4*17⁴ + d5*17³ + d6*17² + d7*17¹ + d8*17⁰`\n    Note that `d8` cannot be 0 for it to be a nine-digit number.\n\n2.  **Systematic Search**: To find the largest such prime, I will start by constructing the largest possible palindrome and then iterate downwards, testing each number for primality. The first prime I find will be the largest one. The search order will be nested loops for the unique digits `d8, d7, d6, d5, d4` from 16 down to 0 (or 1 for `d8`).\n\n3.  **Search Optimization**: The search space is large, so I will apply two mathematical optimizations to prune it:\n    *   **Odd/Even Check**: For a number to be prime (and not 2), it must be odd. A number written in an odd base (like 17) is odd if and only if the sum of its digits is odd. The sum of our palindrome's digits is `2*(d8+d7+d6+d5) + d4`. For this to be odd, `d4` must be an odd digit. This cuts the search space for `d4` in half.\n    *   **Divisibility by 3 Check**: A number `N` is divisible by 3 if the alternating sum of its digits in base `b` is divisible by 3, where `b ≡ -1 (mod 3)`. Since `17 ≡ -1 (mod 3)`, we can use this trick. The criterion for `N` to be divisible by 3 is that `(2*(d8-d7+d6-d5) + d4)` is divisible by 3. I will skip any numbers that meet this criterion, as they cannot be prime.\n\n4.  **Primality Testing**: For a number `n` in the expected range (up to ~1.2 x 10¹¹), a simple trial division is too slow. I will use the deterministic Miller-Rabin primality test, which is efficient and accurate for numbers of this size.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: The Python code will implement this search logic. It will loop from the largest candidates downwards, apply the optimizations, and use the Miller-Rabin test. When it finds the first prime number, it will print the equation that shows how the number is formed from its base-17 representation, and then terminate.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a deterministic Miller-Rabin primality test.\n    It's guaranteed to be correct for n < 3,317,044,064,279,371.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    # Witnesses for the test.
