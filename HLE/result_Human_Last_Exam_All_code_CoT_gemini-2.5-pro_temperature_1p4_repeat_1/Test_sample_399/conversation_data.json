    "This is a separable ordinary differential equation. I will solve it step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Separate the variables**: Move all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n\n2.  **Integrate both sides**:\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This gives:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n\n3.  **Use the initial condition**: We are given $x(0) = -8$. Substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ to find the constant $C$.\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n\n4.  **Write the particular solution**: Substitute $C=\\frac{1}{8}$ back into the integrated equation.\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    To solve for $x(t)$, we can first get a common denominator on the right side:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x(t)} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}\n    $$\n    Now, we can solve for $x(t)$:\n    $$\n    x(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**: Substitute $t=1$ into the expression for $x(t)$.\n    $$\n    x(1) = -\\frac{8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1} = -\\frac{8}{4 - 8 + 1} = -\\frac{8}{-3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# We need to calculate x(1) using the derived formula:\n# x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\nt = 1\n\n# Define the components of the equation\nnumerator = -8\nterm_t_squared = 4 * t**2\nterm_t = -8 * t\nconstant = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = term_t_squared + term_t + constant\n\n# Check for division by zero\nif denominator == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero.\", file=sys.stderr)\nelse:\n    # Calculate the final result\n    x_1 = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Print the calculation steps as requested\n    print(\"To find x(1), we evaluate the expression x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1) at t=1.\")\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / (4*({t})^2 - 8*({t}) + {constant})\")\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({term_t_squared} + ({term_t}) + {constant})\")\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\n    print(f\"The final value is: {x_1}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
