    "To determine the number of states in the minimal Deterministic Finite-State Automaton (DFA) that recognizes the language defined by the given regular expression, a computational approach is the most reliable method due to the complexity of the expression. Manually simplifying the regular expression or constructing the automaton by hand is highly prone to error.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script with the `automata-lib` library, which is specifically designed for operations on formal languages and automata. The plan consists of the following steps:\n1.  Represent the given regular expression as a string in the script.\n2.  Use the library to parse this string and create a Nondeterministic Finite-State Automaton (NFA).\n3.  Convert this NFA into an equivalent DFA using the standard subset construction algorithm.\n4.  Minimize the resulting DFA to find the automaton with the fewest possible states.\n5.  Count the number of states in this minimal DFA and output the result.\n\nThis method automates the well-established theoretical procedures for converting a regular expression to a minimal DFA, guaranteeing an accurate result.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # We use the automata-lib library to perform the necessary conversions.\n    # If not installed, you can install it using: pip install automata-lib\n    from automata.fa.nfa import NFA\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"The 'automata-lib' library is required to run this script.\")\n    print(\"Please install it using: 'pip install automata-lib'\")\n    exit()\n\n# The language L is defined by the regular expression:\n# ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*\n# We define this regular expression as a string, removing spaces for the parser.\n# The syntax used by the library is standard for regular expressions.\nregex_string = \"((b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*(ba|bba|ca))*(b|c)*a(a|bc|cb|bbb)*\"\n\n# Step 1: Create an NFA from the regular expression.\n# The NFA.from_regex() class method parses the string and builds the corresponding NFA.\nnfa = NFA.from_regex(regex_string)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the NFA to a DFA.\n# The .to_dfa() method applies the subset construction algorithm.\ndfa = nfa.to_dfa()\n\n# Step 3: Minimize the DFA.\n# The .minify() method computes the minimal DFA using Hopcroft's algorithm.\nminimal_dfa = dfa.minify()\n\n# Step 4: Count the states of the minimal DFA.\n# The number of states is the size of the set of states in the automaton.\nnum_states = len(minimal_dfa.states)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result.\n# The final result is the number of states in the minimal DFA.\nprint(f\"The number of states in the minimal DFA is: {num_states}\")\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
