def solve_quantum_symmetries():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements about quantum symmetries and conservation laws.

    Based on a detailed analysis of each option:
    - A is False (e.g., momentum operator has a continuous spectrum).
    - B1 is False (the commutator [τ, H] is not zero for a 1/r^2 potential).
    - B2 is False (the scaling factors are incorrect).
    - C is False (the condition is both necessary and sufficient).
    - D is True (follows from [τ, H] = 0).
    - E is True (by definition of the generator of rotations).
    - F is True (this is the condition for a quantity to be a constant of motion).
    - G is True (unitarity of S implies τ is Hermitian).
    - H is False (e.g., the SHO Hamiltonian is unbounded but has a discrete spectrum).
    - I is True (from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators).
    - J is True (follows directly from [S, H] = 0).

    The true statements are D, E, F, G, I, J.
    The final answer is these letters sorted and concatenated.
