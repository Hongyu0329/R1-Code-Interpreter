# The coefficient of the F^2 term in the local heat kernel density b_4 for D^2 is a known result.
# According to T.G. van de Ven, Nucl.Phys. B378 (1992) 309-366, this coefficient is -1/12.
# This coefficient multiplies the term F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} inside the trace.
base_coefficient = sympy.Rational(-1, 12)

# The total trace is taken over the full fiber space, which is a tensor product
# of the spinor space and the gauge representation space.
# For a Dirac spinor field in 4 dimensions, the spinor space has dimension 4.
spinor_dimension = 4

# The total coefficient is the base coefficient multiplied by the spinor dimension,
# as F_{\mu\nu} acts as the identity on the spinor part.
final_coefficient = base_coefficient * spinor_dimension

# The result is the coefficient C in the expression C * tr_{V_F}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu})
# that appears in the integrand for a_4.
