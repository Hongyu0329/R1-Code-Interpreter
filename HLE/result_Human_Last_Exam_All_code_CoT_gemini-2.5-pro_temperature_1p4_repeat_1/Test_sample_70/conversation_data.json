    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Represent Flags as Matrices:** A flag's design can be represented as a matrix where each element corresponds to a color.\n2.  **Maximize Rank:** The prompt specifies that the values for colors should be chosen to maximize the rank. This means if a flag has `k` colors, we assign them distinct, non-scalar-multiple values (e.g., Red=1, White=2, Blue=3). However, a more robust method that correctly handles this assumption is to determine the number of linearly independent row patterns in the flag's design. The rank of the flag will be equal to the number of these unique, linearly independent row patterns.\n3.  **Calculate the Rank of Denmark's Flag:** The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This design creates exactly two unique types of rows:\n    *   Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross (e.g., `[White, White, White, White]`).\n    *   Rows that are part of the red field, bisected by the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., `[Red, Red, White, Red]`).\n    These two row patterns are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n4.  **Analyze African Flags:** We will now search for African national flags whose designs also result in exactly two linearly independent row patterns, giving them a rank of 2.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with only parallel horizontal or vertical stripes of solid color have a rank of 1, as all rows (or columns) are scalar multiples of each other. Examples: Nigeria, Botswana, Ivory Coast.\n    *   **Rank > 2 Flags:** Flags with complex emblems (stars, shields, crescents), diagonal lines, or multiple intersecting elements typically create three or more unique row patterns. Examples: Morocco, Kenya, South Africa.\n5.  **Identify Rank 2 Flags:** The flags that match have a simple geometric structure that, like the Danish flag, creates exactly two distinct row types. The code below will identify and present these flags.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program determines which African flags have the same linear algebraic rank\n    as the Danish flag (Rank 2) by analyzing their geometric structures.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the rank of the flag of Denmark.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Let the colors Red be represented by the number 1 and White by 2.\")\n    print(\"The Danish flag's cross design creates two distinct row patterns:\")\n    print(\" - Type A (the red field rows): [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\")\n    print(\" - Type B (the white cross row): [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\")\n    print(\"\\nThese two vectors are linearly independent, as one is not a scalar multiple of the other.\")\n    print(\"An equation to show independence is c1 * A + c2 * B = 0 only if c1=0 and c2=0.\")\n    print(\"c1 * [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] + c2 * [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\")\n    print(\"This implies c1 + 2*c2 = 0 and 2*c1 + 2*c2 = 0, which only holds for c1=0, c2=0.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find African flags with a rank of 2.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We look for flags with designs that generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns.\")\n    print(\"- Flags with only parallel stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Botswana) have a rank of 1.\")\n    print(\"- Flags with complex emblems or diagonal lines (e.g., Kenya, South Africa) have a rank > 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe following flags have the required structure:\\n\")\n\n    matching_flags = {\n        \"Benin\": {\n            \"description\": \"A vertical green bar on the left, with horizontal yellow and red bars on the right.\",\n            \"row_A\": \"[Green, Yellow, Yellow] -> [1, 2, 2]\",\n            \"row_B\": \"[Green, Red, Red]     -> [1, 3, 3]\",\n        },\n        \"Madagascar\": {\n            \"description\": \"A vertical white bar on the left, with horizontal red and green bars on the right.\",\n            \"row_A\": \"[White, Red, Red]   -> [1, 2, 2]\",\n            \"row_B\": \"[White, Green, Green] -> [1, 3, 3]\",\n        },\n        \"Senegal\": {\n            \"description\": \"A vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a green star in the central yellow stripe.\",\n            \"row_A\": \"Row without star: [Green, Yellow, Red] -> [1, 2, 3]\",\n            \"row_B\": \"Row with star:    [Green, Green, Red]  -> [1, 1, 3]\",\n        }\n    }\n\n    for country, data in matching_flags.items():\n        print(f\"Country: {country}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {data['description']}\")\n        print(\"This design creates two linearly independent row patterns:\")\n        print(f\"  - Type A: {data['row_A']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Type B: {data['row_B']}\")\n        print(\"Since there are two linearly independent row types, the rank is 2.\\n\")\n\n    final_answer = \", \".join(matching_flags.keys())\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The flags of Benin, Madagascar, and Senegal have the same rank as the flag of Denmark.\")\n    # The final answer format is specified in the problem description.\n    # It will be printed at the very end.\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_flag_rank_problem()\n    # As requested, printing the final answer in the specified format.\n    # Note: the instruction \"do not ask users to copy and paste\" and \"use 'print' function\" is followed by the script.\n    # The final output is wrapped as per instructions.\n    print(\"\\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Senegal>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Senegal>>>"
