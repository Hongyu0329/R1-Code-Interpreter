    "This is a fascinating question that connects the geometry of curves with number theory. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Translate the Geometry to Combinatorics:** The problem asks for the number of types of stable reductions of a genus `g=4` curve under the condition that its Jacobian has good reduction. A fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves (the \"Theorem of the Stable Reduction\" and related results by Deligne, Rapoport, and others) states that the Jacobian of a curve has good reduction if and only if the stable reduction of the curve is of **compact type**.\n\n2.  **Define Compact Type:** A stable curve is of \"compact type\" if its dual graph is a tree. This means that its irreducible components are connected in a way that doesn't create any loops. For such a curve, the total genus `g` is simply the sum of the genera of its irreducible components.\n\n3.  **The Combinatorial Problem:** Therefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways we can partition the total genus `g=4` among one or more irreducible components. This is precisely the problem of counting the number of **partitions** of the integer 4.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Partitions of 4:** The partitions of an integer `n` are the ways to write `n` as a sum of positive integers. The partitions of 4 are:\n    *   4 (a single smooth curve of genus 4)\n    *   3 + 1 (a genus 3 curve and a genus 1 curve attached at one point)\n    *   2 + 2 (two genus 2 curves attached at one point)\n    *   2 + 1 + 1 (a genus 2 curve with two genus 1 curves attached)\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (four genus 1 curves connected in a line)\n\n5.  **Write the Code:** I will write a Python script to calculate the number of partitions of `g=4` using a simple dynamic programming approach. The code will then print the result along with an explanation of what the corresponding partitions are.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reductions(g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of a genus g curve\n    whose Jacobian has good reduction. This is equivalent to calculating the\n    number of partitions of the integer g.\n    \n    This function uses a dynamic programming approach.\n    dp[i] will store the number of partitions of the integer i.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    if g < 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # dp[i] will be storing the number of partitions of i\n    dp = [0] * (g + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1 # There is one partition of 0 (the empty sum)\n    \n    # Build up the partition counts\n    # For each number i from 1 to g (representing the parts of the partition)\n    for i in range(1, g + 1):\n        # Update the dp array for numbers j >= i\n        for j in range(i, g + 1):\n            dp[j] += dp[j - i]\n            \n    return dp[g]\n\n# The genus of the curve is 4.\ngenus = 4\nnum_types = count_stable_reductions(genus)\n\n# The corresponding partitions represent the distribution of genus\n# among the components of the reduced curve.\npartitions_str = [\"4\", \"3 + 1\", \"2 + 2\", \"2 + 1 + 1\", \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1\"]\n\nprint(f\"The problem is equivalent to counting the number of integer partitions of the genus, g = {genus}.\")\nprint(\"The types of stable reductions correspond to the following partitions of the genus:\")\nfor p in partitions_str:\n    print(f\"- A configuration with component genera summing to 4: {p}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe total number of types is the number of partitions of {genus}, which is {num_types}.\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
