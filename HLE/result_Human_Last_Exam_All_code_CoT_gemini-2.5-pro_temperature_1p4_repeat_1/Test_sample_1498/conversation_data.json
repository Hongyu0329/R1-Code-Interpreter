    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nThe task is to identify the specific couplets (bayt) in the famous Islamic poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (The Creed of the Laymen), that list the names of the Prophets.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the exact starting and ending lines in the poem that enumerate the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran.\n2.  I will use the standard numbering of the couplets for the poem.\n3.  Then, I will write a Python script that states this range clearly.\n4.  The script will then print each specific line within that range, along with its corresponding number, to provide the complete details as requested. The script will also include transliterations of the Arabic text for easier reading.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the couplets (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that mention the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    start_bayt = 28\n    end_bayt = 31\n\n    # Dictionary containing the relevant bayts (couplets) with Arabic text and transliteration.\n    # The symbol '۞' is used here to mark the end of the first hemistich (half-line).\n    prophets_bayts = {\n        28: {\n            \"arabic\": \"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ ۞ صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Hum Ādamun Idrīsu Nūhun Hūdu maʿ ۞ Sālih wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ\"\n        },\n        29: {\n            \"arabic\": \"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا ۞ يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Lūṭun wa Ismāʿīlu Ishāqu kadhā ۞ Yaʿqūbu Yūsufu wa Ayyūbu-ḥtadhā\"\n        },\n        30: {\n            \"arabic\": \"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ ۞ ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Shuʿaybu Hārūnu wa Mūsā walyasaʿ ۞ Dhul-Kifli Dāwūdu Sulaymānu-ttabaʿ\"\n        },\n        31: {\n            \"arabic\": \"إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ۞ عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\",\n            \"transliteration\": \"Ilyāsu Yūnus Zakariyyā Yaḥyā ۞ ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātimun daʿ ghayyā\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere are the specific lines:\\n\")\n\n    for number in range(start_bayt, end_bayt + 1):\n        bayt_info = prophets_bayts[number]\n        print(f\"Bayt {number}:\")\n        print(f\"  Arabic: {bayt_info['arabic']}\")\n        print(f\"  Transliteration: {bayt_info['transliteration']}\\n\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_prophets_in_poem()\n```\n<<<from Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
