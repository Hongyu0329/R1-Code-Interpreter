    "My plan to solve this problem is to use Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory to determine the stereochemical outcome of the given electrocyclic reaction. The plan involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactant and Reaction:** Identify the reaction as an electrocyclic ring closure of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene under thermal conditions. The reacting pi-system is an octatetraene.\n2.  **Count Pi Electrons:** Determine the number of electrons in the conjugated system to classify it according to Woodward-Hoffmann rules (4n or 4n+2).\n3.  **Apply FMO Theory:** For a thermal reaction, the outcome is governed by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). I will determine the symmetry of the HOMO for the octatetraene system.\n4.  **Determine Rotation Mode:** Based on the HOMO's symmetry at its termini, deduce whether the ring closure must be conrotatory or disrotatory to form the new sigma bond.\n5.  **Analyze Reactant Stereochemistry:** Determine the relative positions of the methyl substituents at the ends of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) based on the given E/Z notation.\n6.  **Predict Product Stereochemistry:** Trace the movement of the methyl groups during the predicted rotation (conrotatory or disrotatory) to determine whether the final product is the *cis*-isomer (A) or the *trans*-isomer (B).\n7.  **Calculate the Ratio:** Based on the stereospecificity predicted by FMO theory, state the theoretical ratio of product A to product B.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this step-by-step analysis and the final predicted ratio.\n\n```python\ndef solve_electrocyclization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the pericyclic reaction problem using Frontier Molecular Orbital theory.\n    This function prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final predicted product ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Product identifiers\n    product_A = \"cis-isomer A\"\n    product_B = \"trans-isomer B\"\n    reactant = \"(2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene\"\n\n    # Step-by-step reasoning using print statements\n    print(\"Analysis of the thermal electrocyclization of {}:\".format(reactant))\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the reacting system.\")\n    print(\"The reaction is an electrocyclic ring closure of a substituted octatetraene system.\")\n    print(\"The cyclization occurs between C2 and C9 of the decatetraene chain.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the number of pi electrons.\")\n    print(\"The conjugated system is a tetraene, which has 4 pi bonds.\")\n    num_pi_electrons = 4 * 2\n    print(\"Therefore, the number of pi electrons is {}.\".format(num_pi_electrons))\n    print(\"This is a 4n system, where n=2.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory for thermal conditions.\")\n    print(\"For a thermal pericyclic reaction, the stereochemistry is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO).\")\n    print(\"For an 8-pi-electron system, the HOMO is the Psi-4 orbital.\")\n    print(\"According to FMO theory, the p-orbitals at the termini of the HOMO (Psi-4) have lobes of opposite phase.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Determine the mode of ring closure.\")\n    print(\"To form a sigma bond, the terminal lobes must overlap in-phase.\")\n    print(\"Since the lobes of same phase are on opposite sides of the polyene plane, the termini must rotate in the same direction.\")\n    print(\"This mode of rotation is called conrotatory.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Analyze the stereochemistry of the reactant.\")\n    print(\"The reactant is {}.\".format(reactant))\n    print(\"- The 2Z stereochemistry means the methyl group at C2 is directed 'inward' relative to the curve of the carbon backbone.\")\n    print(\"- The 8E stereochemistry means the methyl group at C9 is directed 'outward'.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 6: Predict the product stereochemistry.\")\n    print(\"During a conrotatory closure:\")\n    print(\"- The 'inward' methyl group at C2 rotates to one face of the new ring (e.g., 'up').\")\n    print(\"- The 'outward' methyl group at C9 rotates to the opposite face of the new ring (e.g., 'down').\")\n    print(\"This leads to a product where the two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the ring.\")\n    print(\"This is the {}.\".format(product_B))\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 7: Conclude the predicted ratio.\")\n    print(\"FMO theory predicts that this reaction is stereospecific, yielding only the trans-isomer.\")\n    print(\"The formation of the {} is considered 'forbidden' under these conditions.\".format(product_A))\n\n    # Final result in the required format\n    ratio_A = 0\n    ratio_B = 100\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 70)\n    print(\"Final Predicted Ratio based on FMO Theory:\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the product ratio is:\")\n    print(\"Ratio {A} : {B} = {val_A} : {val_B}\".format(A=product_A.split('-')[0], B=product_B.split('-')[0], val_A=ratio_A, val_B=ratio_B))\n    print(\"=\" * 70)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_electrocyclization()\n    # The final answer for the ratio is embedded in the output.\n    # To extract the numerical answer as requested by the format:\n    # A is cis, B is trans.
