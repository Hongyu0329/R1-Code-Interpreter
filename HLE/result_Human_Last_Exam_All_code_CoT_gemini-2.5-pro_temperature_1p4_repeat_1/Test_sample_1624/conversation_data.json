    "My plan is to solve this topology problem by breaking it down into a sequence of logical deductions. I will present this reasoning in the form of a Python script, as requested. The script will use `print` statements to explain each step of the proof.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process that the code will follow:\n\n1.  **Analyze `U`**: The properties of the subset `U` are key. Since every point in `U` has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb R$, `U` is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. A crucial theorem states that every manifold is second-countable (i.e., has a countable basis for its topology).\n2.  **`U` is Separable**: Any second-countable space is also separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this subset `D`.\n3.  **Extend to `X`**: We are given that `U` is dense in `X`. Since `D` is dense in `U` and `U` is dense in `X`, it follows that `D` is dense in `X`. This means `X` is also a separable space.\n4.  **Cardinality of `X`**: `X` is a separable metric space. It's a standard result that any separable metric space has a countable basis (is second-countable). For any second-countable Hausdorff space (which metric spaces are), its cardinality can be at most `c`, the cardinality of the continuum. This is because we can define an injective (one-to-one) map from the space into the power set of its countable basis.\n5.  **Conclusion**: This establishes an upper bound on the cardinality of `X`. The script will conclude by stating this fact and printing the components of the final inequality, `|X| <= c`, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to the user's topology problem step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Cardinality of Space X ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Analyzing the properties of the subset U.\")\n    print(\"From the problem statement:\")\n    print(\"  - X is a connected metric space.\")\n    print(\"  - U is a dense open subset of X.\")\n    print(\"  - Every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe last property means that U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental theorem of topology states that every manifold is second-countable, meaning it has a countable basis for its topology.\")\n    print(\"Any second-countable space is also separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset.
