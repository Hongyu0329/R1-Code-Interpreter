    "To solve this problem, we need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the System and Goal:**\n    *   System matrices are `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]` and `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`.\n    *   The closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`.\n    *   The desired eigenvalues (poles) are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    *   A system with the desired eigenvalues has a characteristic polynomial of the form `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`.\n    *   Expanding this gives: `(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = (s + 1 - j)(s + 1 + j) = (s + 1)² - j² = s² + 2s + 1 + 1 = s² + 2s + 2`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    *   For a 2x2 matrix `M`, the characteristic polynomial is `s² - trace(M)s + det(M) = 0`.\n    *   We let `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]` and calculate `A_cl = A + BF`.\n    *   `A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`.\n    *   We then find the trace and determinant of `A_cl` in terms of `f1, f2, f3, f4`.\n\n4.  **Equate Coefficients and Solve:**\n    *   By comparing the desired polynomial (`s² + 2s + 2`) with the actual polynomial from `A_cl`, we get two equations:\n        *   `-trace(A_cl) = 2`\n        *   `det(A_cl) = 2`\n    *   This results in a system of two linear equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). Since there are more unknowns than equations, there are infinite solutions.\n    *   To find one particular solution, we can simplify the problem by setting `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This reduces the system to two equations with two unknowns (`f1, f2`), which can be easily solved.\n\n5.  **Construct F and Verify:**\n    *   Once we find the values for `f1, f2, f3, f4`, we construct the matrix `F`.\n    *   Finally, we calculate `A_cl = A + BF` with our computed `F` and find its eigenvalues to confirm they match the desired locations.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# 1. Define system matrices\nA = np.array([[-1, 1],\n              [1, 0]])\nB = np.array([[1, 2],\n              [1, 0]])\n\n# 2. Define desired eigenvalues and characteristic polynomial coefficients\n# Desired polynomial is s^2 + 2s + 2\n# From s^2 - trace(A_cl)s + det(A_cl), we need:\n# trace(A_cl) = -2\n# det(A_cl) = 2\n\n# 3. Set up and solve the system of equations for F\n# The equations for the elements of F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] are:\n# trace: -1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -2  =>  f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1\n# det: -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2\n\n# To find a simple solution, we assume f3=0 and f4=0.\n# The system simplifies to:\n# 1) f1 + f2 = -1\n# 2) -1 - f1 - 2*f2 = 2  => f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n\n# We can solve this system [[1, 1], [1, 2]] * [f1, f2]^T = [-1, -3]^T\ncoeffs = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2]])\nvals = np.array([-1, -3])\nsolution = np.linalg.solve(coeffs, vals)\nf1, f2 = solution[0], solution[1]\nf3, f4 = 0.0, 0.0 # Our assumption\n\n# 4.
