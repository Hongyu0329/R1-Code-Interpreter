Step-by-step reasoning to find the maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points.

Let X be a compact, connected metric space.
Let D be the set of dispersion points of X. We want to find the maximum value of |D|.

A point x is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.
A space is totally disconnected if its only connected components are single points.

1.  Can |D| be 0?
    Yes. The closed interval X = [0, 1] is a compact connected metric space. If we remove any point x from X, the remaining space is either still connected (if x is 0 or 1) or has two connected components (if x is in (0, 1)). In no case is X \\ {x} totally disconnected. So, for X = [0, 1], the set of dispersion points is empty, |D| = 0.

2.  Can |D| be 1?
    Yes. Although non-trivial to construct, examples of compact connected metric spaces with exactly one dispersion point exist. One such space is constructed with a point p, and a countable set of points C, such that X \\ {p} = C and C is totally disconnected. Thus, |D| = 1 is possible.

3.  Can |D| be 2 or more? Let's assume for contradiction that |D| >= 2.
    Let p and q be two distinct dispersion points in X.

    a. By definition, Y = X \\ {p} is a totally disconnected space.
       Since X is a compact Hausdorff space (as it's a metric space), Y is a locally compact Hausdorff space. A key theorem states that in a locally compact, Hausdorff, totally disconnected space, any two distinct points can be separated by a partition of the space into two disjoint clopen (closed and open) sets.

    b. Let's take two distinct points in Y: the point q and any other point z. According to the theorem, we can find a partition of Y, say Y = U U V, such that q is in U, z is in V, and both U and V are clopen subsets of Y.

    c. Because Y = X \\ {p} is an open subset of X, and U and V are open in Y, they are also open in X.

    d. Now, consider the closures of U and V in the full space X, denoted cl_X(U) and cl_X(V).
       If cl_X(U) = U, then U would be a non-empty, proper subset of X that is both open and closed. This would contradict the fact that X is connected.
       Therefore, the closure must include the only point missing from Y, which is p. So, we must have cl_X(U) = U U {p} and cl_X(V) = V U {p}. This shows that p acts as a "joining point" for any partition of X \\ {p}.

    e. We can repeat the exact same argument for the dispersion point q. The space Z = X \\ {q} is totally disconnected. The points p and z are in Z. We can find a partition of Z into two clopen (in Z) sets, U' and V', such that p is in U' and z is in V'. By the same logic as in (c) and (d), V' is open in X and cl_X(V') = V' U {q}.

    f. Now we find the contradiction. Consider the set O = V intersect V'.
       - O is open in X, because V and V' are open in X.
       - O is non-empty, because z is in both V and V'.
       - Let's analyze the closure of O in X:
         cl_X(O) = cl_X(V intersect V') which is a subset of (cl_X(V) intersect cl_X(V')).
         cl_X(O) is a subset of (V U {p}) intersect (V' U {q}).
         Expanding this intersection: (V intersect V') U (V intersect {q}) U ({p} intersect V') U ({p} intersect {q}).
         - (V intersect {q}) is empty, because q is in U, the complement of V in Y.
         - ({p} intersect V') is empty, because p is in U', the complement of V' in Z.
         - ({p} intersect {q}) is empty as they are distinct points.
         - So, the closure simplifies: cl_X(O) is a subset of (V intersect V') = O.
         - This implies cl_X(O) = O.

    g. We have found a set O which is non-empty (contains z) and is both open and closed in X. Since X is connected, it cannot have a proper non-empty clopen subset. The set O is proper because it does not contain p or q. This is a contradiction.

4. Conclusion
   The assumption that |D| >= 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a compact connected metric space can have at most one dispersion point.
