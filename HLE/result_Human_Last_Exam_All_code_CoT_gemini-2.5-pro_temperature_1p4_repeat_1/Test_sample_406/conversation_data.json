    "This problem asks for the conditions under which a set of three functions has a \"tripled fixed point.\" This is a concept from a branch of mathematics called fixed-point theory, often used in proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of equations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the conditions based on a generalization of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### **1. Defining the Mathematical Framework**\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the objects we're working with.\n\n*   **Spaces**: Let `X`, `Y`, and `Z` be non-empty sets. We need a way to measure distances within these sets, so we assume they are metric spaces, denoted `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)`. For the theorem to work, these spaces must be **complete**. A complete metric space is one in which every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space.\n*   **Functions**: The functions are given as:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfy the following three equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n### **2. The Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a fixed point are guaranteed if the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` are \"contractive\" in a specific way on their respective complete metric spaces. This is formalized in the following conditions.\n\n*   **Condition 1: Complete Metric Spaces**\n    As mentioned above, `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Joint Contraction Mapping**\n    The functions must jointly satisfy a set of inequalities. This means there must exist nine non-negative constants (`α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`, `β₁`, `β₂`, `β₃`, `γ₁`, `γ₂`, `γ₃`) such that the following hold for any points `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v, y', v' ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z`:\n\n    i.  `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ α₁·d_X(x, u) + α₂·d_Y(y, v) + α₃·d_Z(z, w)`\n    ii. `d_Y(G(y, x, y'), G(v, u, v')) ≤ β₁·d_Y(y, v) + β₂·d_X(x, u) + β₃·d_Y(y', v')`\n    iii. `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ γ₁·d_Z(z, w) + γ₂·d_Y(y, v) + γ₃·d_X(x, u)`\n\n*   **Condition 3: The Contraction Constant**\n    The sum of these constants, grouped in a particular way, must be less than 1. Let:\n    *   `k_x = α₁ + β₂ + γ₃`\n    *   `k_y = α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂`\n    *   `k_z = α₃ + γ₁`\n\n    The crucial condition is that the largest of these sums must be less than 1:\n    `k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z) < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are met, then there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n### **Python Code for Condition Checking**\n\nBelow is a Python script that demonstrates how to check the final numerical condition (`k < 1`). It defines a function that takes the nine constants, calculates `k_x`, `k_y`, and `k_z`, and determines if the condition for a unique fixed point is satisfied.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions(alpha, beta, gamma):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the contractive condition for an FGH-tripled fixed point theorem.\n\n    This theorem provides conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a point (x, y, z)\n    in complete metric spaces (X, Y, Z) such that:\n    F(x, y, z) = x\n    G(y, x, y) = y\n    H(z, y, x) = z\n\n    The core condition is that the functions F, G, H must be contractive\n    with constants alpha, beta, gamma, whose grouped sum is less than 1.\n\n    Args:\n        alpha (list or tuple): A list of 3 floats [α₁, α₂, α₃] >= 0.\n        beta (list or tuple): A list of 3 floats [β₁, β₂, β₃] >= 0.\n        gamma (list or tuple): A list of 3 floats [γ₁, γ₂, γ₃] >= 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not all(c >= 0 for c in alpha + beta + gamma):\n        print(\"Error: All contractive constants must be non-negative.\")\n        return\n\n    # Unpack constants for clarity\n    alpha_1, alpha_2, alpha_3 = alpha\n    beta_1, beta_2, beta_3 = beta\n    gamma_1, gamma_2, gamma_3 = gamma\n\n    # The theorem requires a contraction on the product space X x Y x Z.\n    # We define an operator T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)).\n    # The condition for T to be a contraction is that max(k_x, k_y, k_z) < 1.\n    \n    # Calculate k_x, the coefficient for the distance in X\n    print(\"Calculating k_x...\")\n    print(f\"k_x = α₁ + β₂ + γ₃\")\n    k_x = alpha_1 + beta_2 + gamma_3\n    print(f\"k_x = {alpha_1} + {beta_2} + {gamma_3} = {k_x:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate k_y, the coefficient for the distance in Y\n    print(\"Calculating k_y...\")\n    print(f\"k_y = α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂\")\n    k_y = alpha_2 + beta_1 + beta_3 + gamma_2\n    print(f\"k_y = {alpha_2} + {beta_1} + {beta_3} + {gamma_2} = {k_y:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate k_z, the coefficient for the distance in Z\n    print(\"Calculating k_z...\")\n    print(f\"k_z = α₃ + γ₁\")\n    k_z = alpha_3 + gamma_1\n    print(f\"k_z = {alpha_3} + {gamma_1} = {k_z:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    # The overall contraction constant k is the maximum of these\n    k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z)\n    \n    print(\"Final Check:\")\n    print(f\"k = max(k_x, k_y, k_z) = max({k_x:.4f}, {k_y:.4f}, {k_z:.4f}) = {k:.4f}\")\n\n    if k < 1:\n        print(f\"Result: Condition met (k = {k:.4f} < 1).\")\n        print(\"A unique FGH-tripled fixed point exists, provided the spaces are complete.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Result: Condition NOT met (k = {k:.4f} >= 1).\")\n        print(\"This theorem does not guarantee the existence of a unique FGH-tripled fixed point.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example 1: A set of constants that satisfy the condition\n    print(\"--- Example 1: Condition Met ---\")\n    alpha_coeffs_1 = [0.2, 0.1, 0.1]\n    beta_coeffs_1 = [0.15, 0.2, 0.1]\n    gamma_coeffs_1 = [0.2, 0.1, 0.25]\n    check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions(alpha_coeffs_1, beta_coeffs_1, gamma_coeffs_1)\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Example 2: A set of constants that do NOT satisfy the condition\n    print(\"--- Example 2: Condition Not Met ---\")\n    alpha_coeffs_2 = [0.4, 0.3, 0.2]\n    beta_coeffs_2 = [0.2, 0.4, 0.2]\n    gamma_coeffs_2 = [0.3, 0.5, 0.4]\n    check_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions(alpha_coeffs_2, beta_coeffs_2, gamma_coeffs_2)\n```\n<<<The primary conditions are: 1. The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces. 2. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a joint contractive property defined by nine non-negative constants (αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ). 3. The crucial numerical condition on these constants is that `max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`. If these conditions hold, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.>>>"
