The primary conditions are: 1. The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces. 2. The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a joint contractive property defined by nine non-negative constants (αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ). 3. The crucial numerical condition on these constants is that `max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + β₃ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`. If these conditions hold, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist.
