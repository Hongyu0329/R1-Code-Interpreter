    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a misunderstanding. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" has been part of his name since birth, not a name he adopted or started publicly identifying with in a specific year. Therefore, there is no year to report.\n\nI will write a Python script to print an explanation addressing this.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_origin():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the origin of \"Azikiwe\" in Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n  \"\"\"\n  full_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\"\n  explanation = (\n      f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is a part of former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full birth name: {full_name}.\\n\"\n      \"It is not a name he adopted or started to publicly identify with at a later date.\\n\"\n      \"Therefore, there is no specific year when he 'publicly identified himself as Azikiwe' \"\n      \"because it has always been one of his given names.\"\n  )\n  print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_origin()\n```\n<<<The event described in the question never occurred as \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of Goodluck Jonathan's full name.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
