    "This is a chess puzzle that requires finding the shortest forced checkmate for White, assuming Black plays the best defensive moves to prolong the game.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** I will examine the FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`. The key features are the White Queen-Knight-Bishop attack on Black's kingside versus Black's Rook on e1 pinning White's f1-Rook.\n2.  **Identify White's winning move:** The decisive move is `1. Qxf7+`. This initiates a forcing sequence of checks.\n3.  **Analyze Black's defense:** Black's only legal response to the check is `1... Kh7`.\n4.  **Find the critical continuation:** White's next move, `2. Bg6+`, creates two possibilities for Black.\n5.  **Determine optimal play:** Black can either allow a mate in 4 moves by playing `2... Kh8` or prolong the game by playing `2... hxg6`, which leads to a mate in 7 moves. An optimal defender will choose the latter.\n6.  **Lay out the mating sequence:** I will detail the full 7-move sequence that leads to a smothered checkmate.\n7.  **Provide the final answer:** The number of moves for White to win is the length of this longest-best defensive line for Black, which is 7.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess FEN and determines the number of moves for White to win\n    assuming optimal play from both sides.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the chess position from FEN: {fen}\")\n    print(\"White is to move and can force a checkmate.\")\n    print(\"The solution involves a primary line of attack and Black's best defense to prolong the game.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: White's best move is 1.
