    "To solve this problem, I will use the `networkx` library in Python, which is a powerful tool for graph analysis.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Generate Graphs**: I will use the built-in `graph_atlas_g()` function from `networkx` to get a list of all simple nonisomorphic graphs with a small number of vertices.\n2.  **Filter by Size**: I'll iterate through this list and select only the graphs that have exactly 5 vertices.\n3.  **Check Connectivity**: For each 5-vertex graph, I will check if it is \"2-vertex-connected\". A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. The `networkx` function `is_k_vertex_connected(G, 2)` is perfect for this check.\n4.  **Count and Output**: I will count how many of these graphs satisfy the condition and print the final number.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices we are interested in.\n    n = 5\n\n    # Initialize a counter for the graphs that meet the criteria.\n    count = 0\n\n    # networkx.graph_atlas_g() returns a list of all nonisomorphic\n    # graphs for small numbers of vertices (up to 7).\n    # We iterate through this atlas to find our graphs.\n    all_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # We filter for graphs with exactly 5 vertices and then\n    # check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    for G in all_graphs:\n        if G.number_of_nodes() == n:\n            # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is at least 2.\n            # The networkx function is_k_vertex_connected checks this.\n            # A graph must have at least k+1 (i.e., 3) vertices to be k=2 connected.\n            # Our graphs have 5 vertices, so this condition is met.\n            if nx.is_k_vertex_connected(G, 2):\n                count += 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {n} vertices is:\")\n    print(count)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
