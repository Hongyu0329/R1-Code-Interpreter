    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question. I will use a Python script to find the answer.\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  I will define a data structure, such as a dictionary, to hold information about the book \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\".\n2.  This data structure will contain the name of the main character.\n3.  It will also contain the name of the character they marry.\n4.  The script will then access this data and print the answer in a full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script contains information about Jacek Dukaj's novel\n    \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonalosc\" to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data representing the book's key relationships\n    book_data = {\n        \"title\": \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\",\n        \"author\": \"Jacek Dukaj\",\n        \"main_character\": {\n            \"name\": \"Adam Zamoyski\",\n            \"spouse\": \"Angelina\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Retrieve the names from the data structure\n    main_character_name = book_data[\"main_character\"][\"name\"]\n    spouse_name = book_data[\"main_character\"][\"spouse\"]\n\n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"In Jacek Dukaj's novel 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość', the main character, {main_character_name}, marries {spouse_name}.\")\n\nfind_character_info()\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"
