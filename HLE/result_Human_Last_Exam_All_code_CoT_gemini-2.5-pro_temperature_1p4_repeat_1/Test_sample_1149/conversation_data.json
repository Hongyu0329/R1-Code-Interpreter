    "Based on the scientific description of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull, I will provide the answer.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Reference the primary scientific literature describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  Identify the specific passage that details the anatomy of the lacrimal recess.\n3.  Store the number of depressions mentioned in the literature in a variable.\n4.  Write a Python script to print the answer in a clear statement.\n\n```python\n# This script is designed to answer the user's question about the anatomy of Irritator challengeri.\n# The information is sourced from the scientific paper by Sues et al. (2002), which described the holotype skull.\n\n# According to the scientific literature, the lacrimal recess contains a specific number of subsidiary depressions.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# The following line will print the final answer in a sentence.\n# The final equation is simply the number itself.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
