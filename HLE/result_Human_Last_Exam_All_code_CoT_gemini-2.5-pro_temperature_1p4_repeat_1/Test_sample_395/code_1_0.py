    # We construct a family of sets that satisfies the given conditions. This construction is known
    # to yield the minimum possible size for the union.
    # 1. Let's assume there is a single, central element 'c' that is a member of every set A_i.
    # 2. Each set A_i consists of 'c' and 44 other elements, which we'll call the set B_i.
    #    So, A_i = B_i U {c}, and |B_i| = 45 - 1 = 44.
    # 3. For the intersection condition |A_i intersect A_j| = 1 to hold (for i != j), the sets B_i and B_j
    #    must be disjoint. If they shared an element, the intersection of A_i and A_j would contain
    #    that element plus 'c', making its size at least 2.
    # 4. With this setup, the union of all sets is the union of all the disjoint B_i sets, plus the
    #    single central element 'c'.
    # 5. The total size of the union is the sum of the sizes of all B_i sets plus 1 (for 'c').
    #    Size = (number of sets * size of each B_i) + 1 = n * (k - 1) + 1.

    # This can be proven to be the minimum possible size using combinatorial arguments.
