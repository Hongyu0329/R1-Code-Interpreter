# The task is to identify the best counseling options for a mother whose adolescent son has started vaping.

# Option I is incorrect because it normalizes vaping for an adolescent, whereas the goal should be complete cessation of nicotine.
# Option II is a good choice. It suggests using Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), a safer and evidence-based method to help with nicotine cessation.
# Option III is also a good choice. It correctly highlights that the risks of vaping for adolescents are not well understood and that the goal should be complete cessation.
# Option IV is incorrect because framing vaping as having "clear benefits" for children is misleading and inappropriate.
# Option V is a potential second-line treatment, but II and III are the most critical and primary counseling points.

# The best combination of options is II and III.
# We need to find the answer choice that corresponds to this combination.
# Looking at the answer choices, J corresponds to (II, III).
