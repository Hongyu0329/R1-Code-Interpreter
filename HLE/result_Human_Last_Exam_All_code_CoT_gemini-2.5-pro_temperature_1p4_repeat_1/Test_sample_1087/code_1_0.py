    Calculates the largest real number r for the given geometric problem.

    The problem is equivalent to finding a configuration of 5 points in a unit square
    such that the graph of their distances, when partitioned by r, forms a C5.
    The optimal configuration is believed to be a regular pentagon of maximum possible size
    within the square.

    The largest value for r in this configuration is the length of the pentagon's
    diagonal, which is sin(72Â°). The exact formula for this is:
    r = sqrt((5 + sqrt(5)) / 8)
