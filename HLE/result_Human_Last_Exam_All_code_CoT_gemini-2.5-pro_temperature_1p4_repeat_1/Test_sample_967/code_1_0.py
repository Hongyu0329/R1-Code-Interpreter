# Step-by-step computation of the first l2-Betti number.

# Plan:
# 1. Determine the properties of the underlying graph Gamma, which is the line graph
#    of the Petersen graph, and compute its first Betti number, b_1(Gamma).
# 2. Compute the sum of the first l2-Betti numbers of the vertex groups.
# 3. Compute the sum of the first l2-Betti numbers of the edge groups.
# 4. Apply the formula for the first l2-Betti number of the fundamental group of a graph of groups.

# Step 1: Analyze the graph Gamma
# The Petersen graph (P) has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It is a 3-regular graph.
petersen_vertices = 10
petersen_edges = 15
petersen_degree = 3

# The line graph Gamma = L(P) has vertices corresponding to the edges of P.
gamma_vertices = petersen_edges

# The degree of a vertex in L(P) corresponds to an edge in P. An edge (u,w) in P
# is adjacent to (deg(u)-1) other edges at u and (deg(w)-1) other edges at w.
# Since P is 3-regular, each vertex in Gamma has degree (3-1) + (3-1) = 4.
gamma_degree = (petersen_degree - 1) * 2

# The number of edges in a graph is (sum of degrees) / 2.
gamma_edges = (gamma_vertices * gamma_degree) / 2

# The line graph of a connected graph is connected. The first Betti number of
# a connected graph Gamma is b_1(Gamma) = |E| - |V| + 1.
betti1_gamma = int(gamma_edges - gamma_vertices + 1)

# Step 2 & 3: Analyze the l2-Betti numbers of the groups
#
# For g >= 2, Mg is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. For the fundamental group
# of any such manifold, the first l2-Betti number is 0.
# b_1^(2)(pi_1(M_g)) = 0.
#
# N_g is an index-g subgroup of pi_1(M_g). By the scaling property of l2-Betti
# numbers, b_1^(2)(N_g) = g * b_1^(2)(pi_1(M_g)) = g * 0 = 0.
# This holds for any g >= 2, including g=100.
#
# Vertex groups G_v:
# For v=v_1, G_v1 = N_100, so b_1^(2)(G_v1) = 0.
# For v=v_i (i>1), G_vi is a free product of N_g groups. Since b_1^(2) is
# additive for free products of infinite groups and b_1^(2)(N_g) = 0 for each
# factor, b_1^(2)(G_vi) = 0.
# Therefore, the sum over all vertex groups is 0.
sum_betti1_Gv = 0

# Edge groups G_e:
# Each edge group is isomorphic to some N_g.
# Therefore, b_1^(2)(G_e) = 0 for all edges e.
# The sum over all edge groups is 0.
sum_betti1_Ge = 0

# Step 4: Final Calculation
# The formula for the first l2-Betti number of the fundamental group G is:
# b_1^(2)(G) = sum(b_1^(2)(G_v)) - sum(b_1^(2)(G_e)) + b_1(Gamma)
final_result = sum_betti1_Gv - sum_betti1_Ge + betti1_gamma
