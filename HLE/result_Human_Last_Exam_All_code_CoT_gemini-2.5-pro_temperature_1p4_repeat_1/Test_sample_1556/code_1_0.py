# The input state is |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩.
# The probability of measuring |0⟩ from the input state is P_in(0) = |α|².
# After applying circuit B, the output state |ψ_out⟩ is measured.
# The probability of measuring |0⟩ from the output state is given as P_out(0) = 0.36.

# Property 3 of the circuit B is B² = I. This means the circuit is its own inverse.
# Applying the circuit to the input state transforms the probabilities: P_out(0) = T(P_in(0)).
# Because the circuit is its own inverse, applying it to the output state must return the input state.
# This implies the probability transformation is also its own inverse: P_in(0) = T(P_out(0)).

# The simplest transformation that is its own inverse is a probability swap: T(p) = 1 - p.
# This assumes that the effect of the circuit is to map P_in(0) to P_out(1), and P_in(1) to P_out(0).
# So, we adopt the rule: P_out(0) = 1 - P_in(0).
# Let's write the equation based on this rule.

p_out_0 = 0.36
# The equation is P_out(0) = 1 - |α|²
# We need to solve for |α|²

alpha_squared = 1 - p_out_0

# Print the final equation with all the numbers.
# We want to show |α|² = 1 - 0.36
print(f"|α|² = 1 - {p_out_0}")

# Print the final calculation step.
print(f"|α|² = {alpha_squared}")
