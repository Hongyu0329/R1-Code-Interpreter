    This function determines the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces,
    F, with the property that every infinite topological space has a subspace
    homeomorphic to some element of F.

    Based on the analysis of the structure of infinite topological spaces, we can
    classify them based on their separation axioms and specialization preorders.
    This leads to five fundamental types of infinite topological structures that can
    appear as subspaces.
