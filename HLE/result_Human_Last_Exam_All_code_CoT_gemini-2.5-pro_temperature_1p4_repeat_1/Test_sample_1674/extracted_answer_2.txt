Yes, the theory can fail to hold. As demonstrated by the simulation, adding a birefringent medium creates a combined system. The original inverse matrix, designed for just the random medium, is no longer the correct inverse for this new combined system. This is because the matrix operators for the birefringent medium and the random medium do not generally commute.
