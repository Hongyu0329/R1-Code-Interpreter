    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\nThe function $p(x)$ is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nSince the definition of $p(x)$ changes at $x=3$, which is within our integration range of $[0, 4]$, we must split the integral into two parts:\n1.  The integral of the first function definition from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n2.  The integral of the second function definition from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe total integral will be the sum of these two parts:\n$\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy` library to perform numerical integration for each part and then sums the results to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the range [0, 3]\ndef p1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Represents p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the range [3, 5]\ndef p2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Represents p(x) for 3 <= x <= 5\n  \"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Calculate the integral of the first part from 0 to 3\n# The quad function returns the integral and an estimated error\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Calculate the integral of the second part from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the results in a formatted equation\nprint(f\"The integral from 0 to 3 is: {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"The integral from 3 to 4 is: {integral2}\")\nprint(f\"The total integral from 0 to 4 is: {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4685020448398>>>"
