    # In CCSD (Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles), the cluster operator T is T = T1 + T2.

    # The structure of H_bar is determined by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (CBH) expansion.
    # A fundamental result in many-body theory is that because H and T are limited to
    # two-body operators, the CBH expansion for H_bar is finite and results in an
    # operator that contains at most four-body terms.

    # According to Slater's rules, a k-body operator can only connect two Slater determinants
    # that differ by at most k spin-orbitals.
    # This means H_bar, being a max four-body operator, can only connect the reference
    # determinant |Phi> to other determinants that are at most quadruply excited.

    # Therefore, the matrix element <Phi_I | H_bar | Phi> can be non-zero only if |Phi_I>
    # represents a single, double, triple, or quadruple excitation.

    # The CCSD method itself finds the amplitudes by forcing the matrix elements for
    # single (n=1) and double (n=2) excitations to be zero.
    # The matrix elements for triple (n=3) and quadruple (n=4) excitations are generally non-zero.
    
    # The question asks for which OTHER determinants the matrix element is zero.
    # This means we are looking for the excitation levels for which the matrix element is
    # identically zero due to the structure of H_bar.
