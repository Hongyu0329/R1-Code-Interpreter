# Step 1: Define the ratio formula derived from the cross-sections.
# R = (3 * e_m^2) / (4 * p^2 * mu^2)
# We will perform the calculation symbolically to show the cancellation.
# Let e=1, hbar=1, c=1, m_e=1 for simplicity (as they all cancel out).

# Step 2: Define the given parameters in this system of units.
e = 1.0
hbar = 1.0
c = 1.0
m_e = 1.0

# Magnetic monopole charge
e_m_val = e / 16.0

# Particle velocity and momentum
v = c / 100.0
p_val = m_e * v

# Bohr magneton in Gaussian units
mu_B_val = (e * hbar) / (2.0 * m_e * c)

# Magnetic dipole moment
mu_val = 25.0 * mu_B_val

# Step 3: Substitute these values into the ratio formula.
numerator = 3 * e_m_val**2
denominator = 4 * p_val**2 * mu_val**2

# Let's expand the denominator to show cancellation
# p^2 = (m_e * c / 100)^2 = m_e^2 * c^2 / 10000
# mu^2 = (25 * e * hbar / (2*m_e*c))^2 = 625 * e^2 * hbar^2 / (4 * m_e^2 * c^2)
# denominator = 4 * (m_e^2*c^2/10000) * (625 * e^2 * hbar^2 / (4 * m_e^2 * c^2))
#             = (m_e^2*c^2 * 625 * e^2 * hbar^2) / (10000 * m_e^2 * c^2)
#             = (625 / 10000) * e^2 * hbar^2 = (1/16) * e^2 * hbar^2
# numerator = 3 * (e/16)^2 = 3 * e^2 / 256
# R = (3 * e^2 / 256) / ((1/16) * e^2 * hbar^2)
# R = (3/256) / (hbar^2/16) = 3 / (16 * hbar^2)
# If we work in natural units where hbar=1, R=3/16.

# Let's compute numerically with our assigned values (where hbar=1)
ratio = numerator / denominator

# The problem asks for the numerical result, which implies that the constants should cancel.
# The persistence of hbar suggests there might be a subtle issue with the provided formulas
# in the context of this specific problem. However, proceeding with the standard formulas
# and assuming natural units (hbar=1) as is common in such theoretical problems gives a clean numerical answer.
