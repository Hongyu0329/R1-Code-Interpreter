    # (e.g., by using placement new to construct a derived class object).
    # Because the type is no longer known at compile-time, devirtualization is not possible.
    # A real virtual dispatch is required, which involves loading the virtual table
    # pointer (vptr) from the object to find the vtable. This is one load.

    # Just like in the first case, the compiler now knows the exact dynamic type
    # of the object pointed to by 'b' (which is the same location as 'a') is 'B'.
    # The compiler can again perform devirtualization and convert b->foo() into
    # a direct call to B::foo().
