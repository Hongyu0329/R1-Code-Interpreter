    "To find the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas, we must determine the dimension of the corresponding bosonic target manifold.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is described by a manifold of matrices. This manifold is the symmetric space `O(2N) / (O(N) x O(N))`, where `N` is the number of replicas.\n2.  **Determine the Dimension:** The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is equal to its dimension. The dimension of a quotient space `G/H` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n3.  **Use the Formula for Dimension of O(n):** The dimension of an orthogonal group `O(n)` is given by the formula: `dim(O(n)) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   We are given `N = 2` replicas.\n    *   The numerator group is `G = O(2*N) = O(4)`.\n    *   The denominator group is `H = O(N) x O(N) = O(2) x O(2)`. The dimension of a direct product of groups is the sum of the dimensions of the individual groups, so `dim(H) = dim(O(2)) + dim(O(2))`.\n    *   We will calculate `dim(O(4))` and `dim(O(2))` and then find the difference to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model in symmetry class D with a specified number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem specifies two replicas for the disordered system.\n    N = 2\n\n    # The formula for the dimension of the orthogonal group O(n) is n*(n-1)/2.\n    def dim_O(n):\n        return n * (n - 1) // 2\n\n    # The bosonic manifold for symmetry class D is O(2N) / (O(N) x O(N)).\n    # We calculate the dimension of the numerator group, O(2N).\n    numerator_n = 2 * N\n    dim_numerator = dim_O(numerator_n)\n\n    # We calculate the dimension of the denominator group, O(N) x O(N).\n    # Its dimension is dim(O(N)) + dim(O(N)).\n    denominator_n = N\n    dim_denominator_single = dim_O(denominator_n)\n    dim_denominator_total = 2 * dim_denominator_single\n\n    # The number of variables is the dimension of the manifold, which is\n    # the difference between the dimensions of the numerator and denominator groups.\n    num_variables = dim_numerator - dim_denominator_total\n\n    print(\"Calculation for the number of bosonic variables in the sigma-model for class D with N=2 replicas:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"The target manifold is the symmetric space O(2N) / (O(N) x O(N)), with N = {N}.\")\n    print(f\"The dimension is calculated as: dim(O(2N)) - (dim(O(N)) + dim(O(N))).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(f\"1.
