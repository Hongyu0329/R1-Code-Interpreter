    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to find the pattern in the sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence**: The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship**: A common pattern in such sequences is of the form `a_n = C * a_{n-1} + k`, where `C` is a constant multiplier and `k` is an added value (which could be constant or a sequence itself). Since the numbers are roughly doubling, let's try a multiplier of `C=2`.\n3.  **Calculate the added values (k)**:\n    *   `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n    *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n4.  **Analyze the sequence of added values**: The sequence of added values, `k`, is `[7, 1, 5, 17]`. This sequence doesn't have an immediately obvious pattern. However, in number series problems, sometimes the pattern doesn't start until the second or third term.\n5.  **Look for a pattern within the `k` sequence**: Let's ignore the first term `7` and look at the sub-sequence `[1, 5, 17]`.\n    *   Find the differences between these terms:\n        *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n        *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n6.  **Identify the second-level pattern**: The sequence of differences is `[4, 12]`. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n7.  **Predict the next terms based on the pattern**:\n    *   The next difference should be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next term in the `k` sequence (`[1, 5, 17, ...]`) would be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n8.  **Calculate the final number**: Using the rule `a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + k_{n-1}`, the next number in the original sequence is:\n    *   `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code automates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the sequence to find the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    seq = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The given sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, seq))}, ...\")\n\n    # Step 1: Assume a pattern of a_n = 2 * a_{n-1} + k and find the sequence 'k'.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: We assume a pattern of the form 'next_term = 2 * current_term + k' and find the values of 'k'.\")\n    k_seq = []\n    for i in range(len(seq) - 1):\n        k_val = seq[i+1] - 2 * seq[i]\n        k_seq.append(k_val)\n        print(f\"{seq[i+1]} = 2 * {seq[i]} + {k_val}\")\n\n    # The full sequence 'k' is [7, 1, 5, 17].
