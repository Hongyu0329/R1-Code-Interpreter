# The user wants to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, statement D is the most accurate description.
# A: Incorrect. Defines NP, not IP.
# B: Incorrect. GNI is a key example.
# C: Incorrect. MIP*=RE shows entanglement is very powerful.
# E: Incorrect. Amplification makes the classes robust to specific probability values.
# F: Incorrect. Two provers are more powerful (MIP=NEXP > IP=PSPACE).
# G: Incorrect. IP=PSPACE, which is much larger than NP.
# H: Incorrect. Standard alphabet is binary, not trinary.
# I: Incorrect. Soundness definition is wrong.
# J: Too specific and definitional, not a general statement.
# D: Correctly describes the computational asymmetry between a poly-time verifier
#    and a powerful (super-polynomial/exponential) prover, which is the standard model.

print("2. The prover is assumed to be much more powerful (often modeled as computationally unbounded or having exponential time/space capabilities) to be able to find the proof/answers the verifier needs.")
