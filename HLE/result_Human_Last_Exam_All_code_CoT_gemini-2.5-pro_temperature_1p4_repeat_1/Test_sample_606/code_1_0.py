    Analyzes the effect of a new particle decaying into neutrinos on N_eff.

    The effective number of neutrino species, N_eff, is a measure of the
    relativistic energy density in the early universe, relative to the photon
    energy density. It is defined by the relation for the total radiation density rho_R:
    rho_R = rho_gamma * (1 + (7/8) * (4/11)^(4/3) * N_eff)
    
    This essentially means N_eff counts the number of relativistic species, weighted
    appropriately.
