    # Step 1: Determine delta_2, the infimum of X.
    # The set X consists of regular cardinals lambda for which a tower of length lambda exists.
    # The infimum of X, delta_2, is the smallest such length. This is known as the
    # tower number on omega_1, denoted t(omega_1).
    # A major result in set theory by Saharon Shelah states that if 2^omega_1 = omega_2,
    # then t(omega_1) = omega_2.
    # We represent the cardinal omega_2 as a string.
    delta_2_str = "omega_2"

    # Step 2: Determine delta_1, the supremum of X.
    # Let lambda be a regular cardinal in X. We can show that lambda must be less than
    # or equal to 2^omega_1, which is omega_2. The reasoning is that if lambda > omega_2,
    # then by the pigeonhole principle, some element in the tower's representation
    # within the poset P(omega_1)/countable (of size omega_2) must repeat lambda-many
    # times, which allows for the construction of a pseudo-intersection,
    # contradicting the definition of a tower.
    # So, any lambda in X satisfies lambda <= omega_2.
    # Since we found that the minimum possible value for lambda is omega_2 (from Step 1),
    # the set X can only contain one element.
    # Therefore, X = {omega_2}.
    # The supremum of a set with a single element is the element itself.
    delta_1_str = "omega_2"

    # Step 3: Calculate the sum using cardinal arithmetic.
    # The sum is delta_1 + delta_2. In cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite
    # cardinal k, k + k = k.
    # Thus, omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
    result_str = "omega_2"

    # Step 4: Output the final equation with each term.
    # The "numbers" in the equation are the cardinals themselves.
    print("The final equation is delta_1 + delta_2 = result.")
    print(f"Based on set theory principles, delta_1 is {delta_1_str} and delta_2 is {delta_2_str}.")
    print("The final sum, using cardinal arithmetic, is:")
    print(f"{delta_1_str} + {delta_2_str} = {result_str}")
