# Number of visible trees that can act as blockers.
# According to the problem, these are A, B, C, and D.
num_visible_trees = 4

# The position of each child is determined by a unique pair of blocking assignments.
# 1. Choose a tree from the visible set to block tree E.
#    There are 'num_visible_trees' choices.
choices_for_blocker_of_E = num_visible_trees

# 2. Choose a different tree from the visible set to block tree F.
#    Since the blocker for F cannot be the same as the blocker for E,
#    there is one less choice.

# The maximum number of children is the product of these choices,
# which corresponds to the number of permutations of size 2 from the set of 4 visible trees.
max_children = choices_for_blocker_of_E * choices_for_blocker_of_F
