    # D: "...System RP increases the resistance ... by destroying the molecule with the mass of 500 Da..."
    # FALSE. RP system is needed for the CREATION of the molecule, not its destruction (Conclusion 4). So D is False.

    # E: "...molecule ... is produced by a bacterial enzyme in bacteria not infected..."

    # H: "System RP increases the resistance ... because the enzymes XY1 or XY2 can synthesize their products only in the presence of the system RP."
    # Both clauses are factually true statements from our conclusions. However, the causal link "because" is flawed. The resistance (Conclusion 1) is demonstrated with the deltaXY phage, which has no enzymes. Therefore, the resistance is not CAUSED BY the enzyme's dependency on the RP system. So H is logically incorrect.
