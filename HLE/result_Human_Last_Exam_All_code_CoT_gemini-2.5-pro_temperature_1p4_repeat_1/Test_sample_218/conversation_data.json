    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Irreps and Partitions**: The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are uniquely identified by the integer partitions of $n$. For this problem, $n=25$.\n2.  **Generate Partitions**: The first step is to generate all possible integer partitions of the number 25. A partition of 25 is a way of writing 25 as a sum of positive integers, like $23+2$ or $10+5+5+5$.\n3.  **Hook-Length Formula**: For each partition, we can calculate the dimension of its corresponding irrep using the Hook-Length Formula. The formula is:\n    $d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where $\\lambda$ is the partition, $Y(\\lambda)$ is its Young diagram, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell at row $i$ and column $j$ in the diagram. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of the cell, plus the number of cells below it, plus one for the cell itself.\n4.  **Count**: We will then iterate through each partition of 25, compute the dimension of its irrep, and check if the dimension is strictly less than 500,000. We will count how many such irreps exist.\n5.  **Output**: Finally, the code will print each partition and its dimension that satisfies the condition, and then print the total count.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, min_part=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n.\n    This function recursively finds all combinations of integers that sum up to n.\n    It yields partitions as lists of integers in non-decreasing order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(min_part, n + 1):\n        for p in generate_partitions(n - i, i):\n            yield [i] + p\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irrep of S_n corresponding to a given partition\n    using the Hook Length Formula.\n    The partition is a list of integers that sum to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # The standard Hook Length Formula is applied to Young diagrams where\n    # parts are arranged in non-increasing order.
