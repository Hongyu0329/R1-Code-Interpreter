    print("(a) Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("1. An even lattice (where all vector norms are even) and an odd lattice (like Z^n) belong to different genera.")
    print("2. Farness of 1 means being in the same genus as Z^n. Since Z^12 is odd, an even lattice of rank 12 cannot have farness 1.")
    print("3. The 'neighboring' construction can create an even unimodular lattice from an odd one (like Z^12) in one step. Such a lattice is a 2-neighbor of Z^12.")
    print("4. Since the farness must be > 1, and a 2-neighbor exists, the smallest possible farness ('the farness') can be exactly 2.")

    # --- Part (b) ---
    print("(b) Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3. Can L have a vector x such that x.x is divisible by 6 and x is a 3-primitive vector?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("1. far(L)=3 implies L is isometric to a lattice with inner product (v.w)/3, where v, w are vectors from an integer lattice L_int which is a subgroup of Z^14 of index 3.")
    print("2. The condition x.x = 0 (mod 6) means (v.v)/3 is a multiple of 6, so v.v must be a multiple of 18.")
    print("3. 'x is 3-primitive' means v cannot be written as 3u for any vector u in L_int.")
    print("4. Let's construct an example. Choose L_int = {z in Z^14 | z_1 is a multiple of 3}.")
    print("5. Choose the vector v = (3, 3, 3, 3, 0, ..., 0). This v is in L_int.")

    x_dot_x = v_dot_v / 3
    print(f"   The squared norm of the corresponding vector x is x.x = {v_dot_v}/3 = {x_dot_x}.")
    print(f"   Is {x_dot_x} divisible by 6? Yes, {int(x_dot_x)} mod 6 = {int(x_dot_x) % 6}.")
    print("6. Now check the 3-primitive condition. The vector v/3 = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0).")
    print("   The first component is 1, which is not divisible by 3. Thus, v/3 is not in L_int.")

    # --- Part (c) ---
    print("(c) If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24, what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("1. This question asks for the farness, far(L), of the Niemeier lattice L = N(D_24).")
    print("2. The farness is the product of p-farnesses for primes p dividing the determinant of the root system's Cartan matrix.")
    det_D24 = 4
    print(f"3. The determinant of the D_24 root system is det(D_24) = {det_D24}.")
    print("4. The only prime dividing 4 is p=2. So, far(L) = far_2(L).")
    print("5. According to established results in lattice theory (e.g., Bachoc, Coulangeon, Nebe 2016), the 2-farness of N(D_24) is 2.")
