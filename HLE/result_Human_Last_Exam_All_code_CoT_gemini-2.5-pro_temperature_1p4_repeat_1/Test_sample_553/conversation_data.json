    "This is a great music theory question! The Beatles were masters of using unconventional chord progressions. The song you're looking for is \"Michelle\".\n\nHere's a breakdown of the harmony and the Python code to print the explanation.\n\nThe song's verse is primarily in the key of F minor.\n*   The **tonic** chord (the \"home\" chord, or 'i') in this key is **F minor**.\n*   The fifth note of the F minor scale is C. A minor chord built on this note is the **minor fifth** chord (or 'v'), which is **C minor**.\n\nThe song's verse contains a prominent and memorable chord change from the tonic F minor to the minor fifth C minor, particularly on the line \"these are words that go together well...\". This i -> v progression is unusual in pop music and is one of the things that makes the song's harmony so unique.\n\n```python\ndef explain_beatles_harmony():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains which Beatles song starts with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F minor (i)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    explanation = f\"\"\"The song by The Beatles that features a distinctive move from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"{song_title}\".\n\nHere is the harmonic breakdown:\n\n1.  The song's verse is in the key of {key}.\n2.  The tonic chord (i) is {tonic_chord}.\n3.  The minor fifth chord (v) in this key is {minor_fifth_chord}.\n\nThe song famously uses the progression from {tonic_chord} to {minor_fifth_chord}, creating its unique, sophisticated sound.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_beatles_harmony()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
