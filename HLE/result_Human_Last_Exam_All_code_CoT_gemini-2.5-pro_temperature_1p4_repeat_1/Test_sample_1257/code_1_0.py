    This function explains the solution to the cube placement puzzle.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of colors required to construct
    an infinite x,y plane based on a set of rules.

    1.  Can the plane be built with 1 color?
        - An all-White plane would require placing White cubes next to each other.
        - A White cube can be placed next to another White cube only if it has a second, different-colored neighbor or an Orange neighbor in the z-direction.
        - The Orange neighbor rule leads to a paradox: to place White(x,y,0), you need Orange(x,y,1), but to place Orange(x,y,1), you need White(x,y,0) to exist first.
        - Therefore, a single-color plane is not constructible. The cardinality must be greater than 1.

    2.  Can the plane be built with 2 colors?
        - Let's try with White and Blue.
        - Start with the initial White cube at (0,0,0).
        - To enable flexible building, we place a single "helper" Orange cube at (0,0,1). This cube is NOT in the plane we are constructing.
        - Now, we can place a Blue cube at (1,0,0) in our plane, as it can attach to the White cube at (0,0,0).
        - We can also place a White cube at (0,1,0), because this spot is adjacent to two different colored cubes: White(0,0,0) and our helper Orange(0,0,1).
        - With both White and Blue cubes in our plane, we can continue expanding. A new White cube can be placed at any location adjacent to an existing White and an existing Blue cube.
        - This proves that a plane can be filled with a combination of White and Blue cubes.

    3.  Conclusion:
        - The minimum number of colors required to construct the plane is 2.
        - The set of colors used is {White, Blue}.
