# Plan:
# 1. Start with the chemical formula of a representative nanocar, which is C244H132.
# 2. The prefix "perfluoro-" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).
# 3. The number of fluorine atoms will therefore be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.

# Number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule (C244H132).
num_hydrogens = 132

# In a perfluoronanocar, each hydrogen atom is replaced by one fluorine atom.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.
num_fluorines = num_hydrogens

print("A representative nanocar molecule has the chemical formula C244H132.")
print("The 'perfluoro-' prefix indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.")
print("\nTherefore, the calculation is as follows:")
print(f"Number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar = {num_hydrogens}")
print(f"Number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar = Number of hydrogen atoms")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"Number of Fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}")
