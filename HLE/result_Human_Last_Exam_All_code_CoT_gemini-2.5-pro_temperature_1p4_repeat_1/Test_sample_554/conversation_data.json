    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Molecule:** The term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules designed to resemble cars on a nanoscale. I will use the first synthesized nanocar from Professor James Tour's group as a representative example. This molecule has the chemical formula C244H132.\n2.  **Interpret the Chemical Prefix:** The prefix \"perfluoro-\" in chemistry indicates that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Atoms:** Based on the \"perfluoro-\" prefix, the number of fluorine atoms in the \"perfluoronanocar\" will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to assign the number of hydrogens from the formula and print the reasoning, the final calculation, and the resulting number of fluorine atoms.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Start with the chemical formula of a representative nanocar, which is C244H132.\n# 2. The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n# 3. The number of fluorine atoms will therefore be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n# Number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule (C244H132).\nnum_hydrogens = 132\n\n# In a perfluoronanocar, each hydrogen atom is replaced by one fluorine atom.\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms.\nnum_fluorines = num_hydrogens\n\nprint(\"A representative nanocar molecule has the chemical formula C244H132.\")\nprint(\"The 'perfluoro-' prefix indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the calculation is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar = {num_hydrogens}\")\nprint(f\"Number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar = Number of hydrogen atoms\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = {num_fluorines}\")\n\n```\n<<<132>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
