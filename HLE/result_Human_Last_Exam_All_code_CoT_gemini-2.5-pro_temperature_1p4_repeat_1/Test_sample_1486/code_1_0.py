# Plan:
# 1. Identify the number of cabrioles devants in the first diagonal sequence.
# 2. Identify the number of cabrioles devants in the second diagonal sequence.
# 3. Sum these two numbers to get the total.
# 4. Print the final equation and the result.

# Step 1 & 2: Count the cabrioles in each sequence from the performance.
first_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles = 4
second_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles = 4

# Step 3: Calculate the total.
total_cabrioles = first_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles + second_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles

# Step 4: Print the full equation as the output.
print(f"Maria Khoreva executed {first_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles} + {second_diagonal_sequence_cabrioles} = {total_cabrioles} cabrioles devants in total.")
