    "The task is to determine the oligomeric state of five specific coiled-coil protein sequences. These are well-characterized designed peptides, and their oligomeric state (i.e., whether they form dimers, trimers, etc.) is governed by the identity of the amino acid residues at the core positions of the coiled-coil structure.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem programmatically:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Heptad Repeat**: Coiled-coils are characterized by a seven-residue (heptad) repeat, commonly denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions form the hydrophobic core that holds the structure together. The specific amino acids in these positions dictate the number of helices that can pack together favorably.\n2.  **Identify the Core Residues**: For each sequence, we need to identify which residues are at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Based on the standard coiled-coil register, these sequences follow a `gabcdefg` pattern starting from the first residue. This means 'a' positions are at indices 1, 8, 15, 22, etc., and 'd' positions are at 4, 11, 18, 25, etc. (using 0-based indexing).\n3.  **Determine the Dominant Core Type**: Some sequences contain minor variations. We will find the most frequent residue at the 'a' positions and the most frequent at the 'd' positions to determine the dominant `(a, d)` pair for each peptide.\n4.  **Apply Known Rules**: Based on foundational research in protein design, a set of rules correlates the dominant `(a, d)` pair to a specific oligomeric state:\n    *   `(I, A)` → Dimer (2)\n    *   `(I, L)` → Trimer (3)\n    *   `(I, I)` → Tetramer (4)\n    *   `(I, Q)` → Pentamer (5)\n    *   `(I, T)` → Heptamer (7)\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that automates this process. The script will take the list of sequences, apply the rules above, and print the resulting list of oligomeric states.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_states(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on dominant\n    core 'a' and 'd' residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Rules based on seminal protein design literature for (a, d) pairs.\n    # I=Isoleucine, A=Alanine, L=Leucine, Q=Glutamine, T=Threonine\n    prediction_rules = {\n        ('I', 'A'): 2,  # Dimer\n        ('I', 'L'): 3,  # Trimer\n        ('I', 'I'): 4,  # Tetramer\n        ('I', 'Q'): 5,  # Pentamer\n        ('I', 'T'): 7,  # Heptamer\n    }\n    \n    oligomeric_states = []\n    \n    for seq in sequences:\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        \n        # Extract 'a' position residues (indices 1, 8, 15, 22...)\n        for i in range(1, len(seq), 7):\n            a_residues.append(seq[i])\n            \n        # Extract 'd' position residues (indices 4, 11, 18, 25...)\n        for i in range(4, len(seq), 7):\n            d_residues.append(seq[i])\n            \n        # Determine the dominant (most common) residue at each position\n        # This handles minor mutations within the sequence\n        dominant_a = collections.Counter(a_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n        dominant_d = collections.Counter(d_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n        \n        core_pair = (dominant_a, dominant_d)\n        \n        # Look up the oligomeric state from the rules\n        state = prediction_rules.get(core_pair, \"Unknown\")\n        oligomeric_states.append(state)\n        \n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the sequence of predicted states.\n    # Sequence 1: ('I', 'A') -> 2\n    # Sequence 2: ('I', 'L') -> 3\n    # Sequence 3: ('I', 'I') -> 4\n    # Sequence 4: ('I', 'Q') -> 5\n    # Sequence 5: ('I', 'T') -> 7\n    # Final Result: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\n    \n    print(\"The predicted oligomeric states are:\")\n    # Print each number, separated by commas\n    print(*oligomeric_states, sep=\", \")\n\n# The list of coiled-coil sequences to analyze\nprotein_sequences = [\n    \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n    \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n    \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n    \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n    \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\"\n]\n\npredict_oligomeric_states(protein_sequences)\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"
