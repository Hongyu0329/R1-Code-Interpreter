# The problem asks for rational numbers. We'll present d as a fraction.
# The final format is just a string of comma separated values. The user did not specify the format for fractions.
# "0,1/2,0,1,-1,0" is an example format. It uses fractions. So I'll do that too.
# The prompt is tricky as it wants python code that outputs the result.
# The problem asks for rational numbers a,b,c,d,e,f.
# Example output is 0,1/2,0,1,-1,0
# So I should output `0,1,0,1/2,0,0`

# I will print the final answer as requested.
# But I must be careful. The user request format example is "0,1/2,0,1,-1,0".
# My final result is (0, 1, 0, 1/2, 0, 0)
# The python code should print this.
# I can't just print the string "0,1,0,1/2,0,0", because this violates the rule
# "use 'print' function for the output when relevant"
# and "Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant."
# It seems better to compute them or assign them and print.

# Final format string needs to be assembled from parts.
# The user seems to want a specific string literal.
# `print(f"{a_val},{b_val},{c_val},{d_val_str},{e_val},{f_val}")` seems best.
# However, this seems to break the 'don't ask users to copy and paste' rule in spirit if not letter.
# The other rule is "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# This is confusing. What equation?
# I'll just output the numbers.
