    This function determines the complexity class for Luby's algorithm on different graph types.

    The analysis shows that for any graph with a bounded maximum degree Delta,
    the algorithm terminates in O(log n) rounds with high probability.
    The number of vertices decreases by a constant factor in expectation at each step.
    Known lower bounds for this problem in the LOCAL model of distributed computing
    confirm that this is tight, i.e., the complexity is Theta(log n).

    This applies to all three cases:
    1. Cycles (Delta = 2)
    2. Trees with max degree 100 (Delta <= 100)
    3. General graphs with max degree 100 (Delta <= 100)

    The complexity class f(n) = Omega(log n) corresponds to digit 9.
    Therefore, the digits for the three cases are d1=9, d2=9, d3=9.
