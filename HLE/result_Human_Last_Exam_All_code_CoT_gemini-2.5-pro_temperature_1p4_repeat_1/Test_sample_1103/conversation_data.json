    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of negative fundamental discriminants `d` for which the ideal class number `h(d)` of the imaginary quadratic field `Q(sqrt(d))` is exactly 48.\n\nThis is a well-known problem in computational algebraic number theory. The complete list of such discriminants has been computed and is available in mathematical databases. The result was established by Mark Watkins in his work on class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields.\n\nInstead of just stating the known result, I will provide a Python script that computationally verifies this count. This script uses the `cypari2` library, which is a Python interface to the powerful PARI/GP number theory library. This is the standard tool for such calculations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Iterate:** The script will loop through negative integers `d` starting from -1.\n2.  **Check for Fundamental Discriminant:** For each `d`, it will use PARI/GP's `isfundamental()` function to check if it's a fundamental discriminant.\n3.  **Calculate Class Number:** If `d` is fundamental, it will calculate its class number using PARI/GP's `qfbclassno()` function.\n4.  **Count:** It will count every instance where the class number is exactly 48.\n5.  **Set a Bound:** Based on known results, the largest absolute value of a discriminant with class number 48 is 630,527. The script will search up to 650,000 to ensure all are found.\n6.  **Output:** The script will print the final count. As requested, I will also print the list of the individual discriminants found, as these are the numbers that contribute to the final count.\n\n**Note:** To run the following code, you will need to install the `cypari2` library. You can do this by running `pip install cypari2` in your terminal. The computation may take a few minutes to complete.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom cypari2 import pari\n\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48.\n    \n    This script iterates through negative integers, checks if they are fundamental\n    discriminants, and if so, computes their class number.
