    print(f"1. Option A ({options['A']}): This process tends to homogenize gene copies, which counteracts divergence. So, it's incorrect.")
    
    print(f"2. Option B ({options['B']}): This is the most common fate, but it leads to one gene copy becoming non-functional (a pseudogene). This is a mechanism for gene *loss*, not retention of a functional gene. So, it's incorrect.")
    
    print(f"3. Option C ({options['C']}): In this model, one gene copy is preserved while the other accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This clearly explains both the *retention* (due to the new function's benefit) and *divergence* (the new function itself). This is a strong candidate.")

    print(f"4. Option D ({options['D']}): In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions, and each duplicated copy specializes in a subset of those original functions. While this explains retention, 'Neofunctionalization' is a classic model representing a more profound divergence to a novel role.")

    print(f"5. Option E ({options['E']}): This is a large-scale process of species diversification, not a specific molecular mechanism for gene retention. So, it's incorrect.")
