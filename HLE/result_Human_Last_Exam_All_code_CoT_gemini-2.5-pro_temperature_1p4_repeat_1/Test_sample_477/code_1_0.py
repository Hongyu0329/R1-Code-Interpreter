    question = "What is the impact of knocking out LIG1 on CTG somatic instability in the context of Myotonic dystrophy?"

    explanation = """
    1.  Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) and CTG Repeats: DM1 is a genetic disorder caused by an unstable expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. Somatic instability refers to the tendency for this repeat tract to expand further in an individual's somatic (body) cells over time, which correlates with disease severity.

    2.  The Role of DNA Ligase I (LIG1): LIG1 is a crucial enzyme that joins DNA fragments together. It plays a vital role in DNA replication (joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand) and in DNA repair pathways.

    3.  Mechanism of Instability and LIG1's Role: The prevailing model for CTG expansion involves the formation of secondary structures like hairpins by the CTG repeats during DNA replication. The DNA repair and replication machinery attempts to process these unusual structures. This process, however, is error-prone and can lead to an increase in the repeat count. LIG1 is a key component of this machinery.

    4.  Impact of LIG1 Reduction: Scientific studies, particularly using mouse models for DM1, have demonstrated that reducing the level or activity of LIG1 significantly suppresses age-dependent somatic expansion of CTG repeats. While the exact mechanism is complex, it is thought that the absence of LIG1 may either shift DNA processing to a different, less expansion-prone pathway or that LIG1 is a necessary component of the primary pathway that *causes* the expansions.

    5.  Conclusion: Therefore, knocking out or reducing the function of LIG1 leads to a reduction in CTG somatic instability.
