    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion. An irreducible quartic polynomial has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct the Resolvent Cubic ($R(y)$):** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze the Roots of the Resolvent Cubic:** Based on whether the resolvent cubic is irreducible, has one rational root, or splits completely into three rational roots, we can identify the group structure.\n    *   If the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n    *   If the resolvent has one rational root, the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n    *   If the resolvent has three rational roots, the group is $V_4$.\n5.  **Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$:** If the resolvent has exactly one rational root, we can distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4) by checking if the irrational roots of the resolvent lie in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the Python script below, which uses the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform the calculations and guide us to the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.abc import x, y\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the polynomial and check for irreducibility\n    p_coeffs = {'x**4': 1, 'x**3': 0, 'x**2': 0, 'x': 8, 'c': 14}\n    P = p_coeffs['x**4'] * x**4 + p_coeffs['x'] * x + p_coeffs['c']\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = {P}\")\n    \n    # We check irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion.\n    # For the prime p=2:\n    # - 2 divides all coefficients (8, 14) except the leading one (1).\n    # - 2^2 = 4 does not divide the constant term 14.\n    # Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\n    is_irred = sympy.is_irreducible(P, domain='Q')\n    print(f\"Is the polynomial irreducible over Q?
