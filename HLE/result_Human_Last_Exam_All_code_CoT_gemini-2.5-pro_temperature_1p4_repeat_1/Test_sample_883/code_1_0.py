    print(f"In the presence of Al1, the kcat increases to {kcat_al1}/second.")
    print("Conclusion: Since Al1 significantly increases the reaction rate, it functions as an allosteric activator.")

    print(f"Adding a high concentration of substrate (500 mM) does not restore the activity; the kcat remains at {kcat_rga1_high_substrate}/second.")
    print("Conclusion: Because high substrate levels cannot outcompete the inhibitor, Rga1 is not a competitive inhibitor. This behavior is the hallmark of an irreversible inhibitor (or a non-competitive one).")

    print("\n3. Interaction of Al1 and Al2:")
    print(f"The kcat with the activator Al1 is {kcat_al1}/second, while the kcat with the inhibitor Al2 is {kcat_al2}/second.")

    print("- Choice D is incorrect because XAG1 is a reversible inhibitor (activity was restored from 10 to 450 by high substrate), not irreversible.")
    print("- Choice C correctly identifies Al1 and Al2 as allosteric modulators, correctly infers that they bind the same site, and correctly identifies Rga1 as an irreversible inhibitor based on the data.")
