    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues**: I will break down the provided text into key pieces of information:\n    *   The subject is a man described by poet Andrei Voznesensky as a \"joy-discovering sailor.\"\n    *   Voznesensky wrote a poem asking where the man's grave was.\n    *   The location of the grave was discovered in the late 1980s.\n2.  **Research and Connection**: I will connect these clues to a specific historical figure.\n    *   I'll identify the poem by Voznesensky that fits the description.\n    *   I'll identify the explorer the poem is about.\n    *   I'll cross-reference this explorer with the historical fact that his grave was lost and then rediscovered around the late 1980s/early 1990s.\n3.  **Code Formulation**: I will create a Python script that programmatically outlines this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by analyzing the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The poetic description by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    poem_question = \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n\n    # Clue 2: The historical fact about the grave's discovery.\n    discovery_period = \"the late 1980s\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided clues.\")\n    print(f\" - The man was the subject of a poem by {poet}.\")\n    print(f\" - The poet wondered about the location of the man's lost grave.\")\n    print(f\" - The grave was finally discovered in {discovery_period} (specifically, in 1991).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Connecting the clues to a person.\")\n    print(\" - The poem in question is 'Saga' by Voznesensky.\")\n    print(\" - The poem is about Vitus Bering, a famous Danish explorer in Russian naval service.\")\n    print(\" - Vitus Bering died in 1741 on an island that was later named after him.\")\n    print(\" - For over 250 years, the exact location of his grave was unknown.\")\n    print(\" - In 1991, a Danish-Russian expedition found and identified his remains on Bering Island, fitting the timeline.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Determine the final answer\n    last_name = \"Bering\"\n\n    print(\"Step 3: State the final answer.\")\n    print(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n\n# Execute the solver function\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Bering>>>"
