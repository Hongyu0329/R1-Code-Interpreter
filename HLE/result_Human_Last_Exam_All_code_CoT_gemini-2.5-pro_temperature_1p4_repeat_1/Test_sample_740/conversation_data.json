    "An integral equation of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy` is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The given equation, `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)`, fits this form.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Kernel:** The kernel of the integral is `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, this simplifies to a polynomial:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This is a \"degenerate\" or \"separable\" kernel, which means the integral equation can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Linear System:** Let's define the moments of the unknown function `u(y)` as `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. Substituting the simplified kernel into the integral equation gives:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    This shows that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. We can now derive a system of equations for the coefficients `c_k` by substituting this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `c_j`:\n    `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}) dy`\n    `c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j dy + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k ∫₀¹ y^{j+n-1-k} dy`\n    `c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k / (j+n-k)`\n    This is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`. In matrix form, it can be written as `(I - λA)C = b`, where `C` is the vector of `c_j`, `b` is a vector with entries `b_j = 1/(j+1)`, and `A` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `A_{jk} = 1/(j+n-k)` (for 0-indexed `j` and `k`).\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution:** According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has:\n    *   A unique solution for `C` if the determinant `det(I - λA) ≠ 0`.\n    *   No solution or infinitely many solutions if `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n    The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` is equivalent to `det(A - (1/λ)I) = 0`, which means `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The corresponding values of `λ` are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\n    For a characteristic value `λ`, the system has no solution if the vector `b` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator `(I - λA)ᵀ`. It can be shown (as demonstrated for `n=1,2` in the thought process) that this condition holds for all characteristic values of this specific problem.\n\n4.  **Find the Characteristic Values:** The problem thus reduces to finding the values of `λ` for which `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. These are simply the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of `A`. Since the problem is stated for a general integer `n`, the solution will be a set of `n` values that depend on `n`. The following Python code calculates these values numerically for a given `n`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given integer n, this function calculates the values of λ for which the\n    integral equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy (xⁿ - yⁿ)/(x-y) u(y) has no solutions.\n\n    The method involves converting the integral equation into a system of linear\n    equations (I - λA)c = b.
