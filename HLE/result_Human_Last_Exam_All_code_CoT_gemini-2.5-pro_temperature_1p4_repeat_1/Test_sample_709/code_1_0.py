    print("'Oy'       => An existential particle, meaning 'There is' or 'There was'.")
    print("'ox'       => The number 'three'.")
    print("'k`op'      => Means 'word', 'language', 'talk', or 'discussion'.")
    print("'ta'       => A preposition, meaning 'in' or 'at'.")
    print("'batz`i k`op' => Literally 'true language'; it's the name for the Tzotzil language itself, often translated as 'native language'.")
    print("'jna'      => Means 'my house'. It is formed from 'j-' (first-person possessive 'my') + 'na' ('house').")
    print("'junabi'   => Means 'last year'. It is formed from 'jun' ('one') + 'abil' ('year').")
    print("--------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Step 2: Assembling a literal translation based on the parts:")
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("A direct, literal translation would be: \"There was three talk/words in the native language at my house last year.\"")
    print("--------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluating the multiple-choice answers:")
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("A, B, F, G are incorrect. They contain wrong locations ('our village', 'house of God') or incorrect time references ('are', 'yesterday'), which contradict 'ta jna' (at my house) and 'junabi' (last year).")
    print("C and E use completely incorrect vocabulary.")
    print("This leaves D and H as the only plausible options.")
    print("\nComparing D and H:")
    print("D. There was talk in Tzotzil at my house last year.")
    print("H. There was talk in my native language at my house last year.")
    print("\nBoth options correctly translate almost every part of the sentence: the past tense ('was'), the activity ('talk'), the location ('at my house'), and the time ('last year').")
    print("However, both options omit the number 'ox' (three). This implies that the phrase ''ox k'op' is being treated idiomatically as 'a conversation' or 'some talk'.")
    print("\nChoosing the BEST fit: Option H is marginally better because the translation 'my native language' acknowledges the possessive pronoun 'j-' (my) that appears in 'jna' (my house), thus capturing more of the original sentence's grammatical information.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The most accurate translation among the choices, despite omitting the number 'three', is H.")
    print("H. There was talk in my native language at my house last year.")
