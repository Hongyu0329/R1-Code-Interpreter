    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. This method involves creating a stacked matrix from the two given matrices and then reducing it to a specific form using elementary row operations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Matrices**: Represent the given polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using a symbolic mathematics library in Python.\n2.  **Stack Matrices**: Form a single 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2. `M = [P1; P2]`.\n3.  **Row Reduction**: Apply a sequence of elementary row operations to `M`. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n    The goal is to transform `M` into a block matrix of the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix in row-echelon form and `0` is a 2x2 zero matrix.\n4.  **Extract GCRD**: The resulting non-zero 2x2 matrix `G` is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n5.  **Normalize**: The GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). We can normalize `G` to obtain a simpler, canonical form (like the identity matrix, if possible).\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"P1 =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2 =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nInitial stacked matrix M:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n\n    # Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    # We use rows of P2 (M[2,:] and M[3,:]) to eliminate elements in rows of P1 (M[0,:] and M[1,:]).\n    # Notation: M.row_op(i, f) transforms row i to f(M.row(i), i)\n    # Let's use R3 (M[3,:]) which has a 1 in the second column to clear that column.\n    \n    # R0 -> R0 + s*R3\n    M.row_op(0, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M[3, j]))\n    \n    # R1 -> R1 - s^2*R3\n    M.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - s**2 * M[3, j]))\n\n    print(\"\\nAfter clearing elements using R3:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n    # M is now [[0, 0], [s**3 - 1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n    # Now use polynomial division on the first column for rows 1 and 2.\n    # R1 -> R1 - s^2*R2\n    M.row_op(1, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - s**2 * M[2, j]))\n    \n    print(\"\\nAfter polynomial division (R1 -> R1 - s^2*R2):\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n    # M is now [[0, 0], [-1, 0], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n    \n    # Now use the new R1 = [-1, 0] to clear the first column of other rows.\n    # R2 -> R2 + s*R1\n    M.row_op(2, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val + s * M[1, j]))\n    \n    # R3 -> R3 - (s+1)*R1\n    M.row_op(3, lambda val, j: sympy.expand(val - (s + 1) * M[1, j]))\n    \n    print(\"\\nAfter final clearing of the first column:\")\n    sympy.pprint(M)\n    # M is now [[0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the non-zero rows to form the GCRD.\n    # The non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and [0, 1].\n    G_unnormalized = sympy.Matrix([M.row(1), M.row(3)])\n\n    print(\"\\nUnnormalized GCRD matrix G:\")\n    sympy.pprint(G_unnormalized)\n\n    # Step 4: Normalize the GCRD.\n    # The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix.\n    # We can multiply the first row by -1 to make the leading entry positive.\n    # This corresponds to left-multiplying by [[-1, 0], [0, 1]].\n    normalizer = sympy.Matrix([[-1, 0],[0, 1]])\n    G_normalized = normalizer * G_unnormalized\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal normalized GCRD:\")\n    sympy.pprint(G_normalized)\n    \n    # Printing the final answer in the requested format\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"GCRD = [[{G_normalized[0,0]}, {G_normalized[0,1]}], [{G_normalized[1,0]}, {G_normalized[1,1]}]]\")\n\n\nsolve_gcrd()\n```\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
