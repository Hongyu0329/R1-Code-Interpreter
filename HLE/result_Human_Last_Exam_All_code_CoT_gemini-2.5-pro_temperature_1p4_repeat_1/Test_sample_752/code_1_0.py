    Solves the problem of finding the cardinality of [Γ(F)](∙,∙) for n=9.

    The problem asks for the cardinality of the value of the coclassifier functor Γ(F)
    for a specific functor F related to the symmetric group Σn.

    The category C is the delooping of Σn, which has one object (∙) and Σn as its set of morphisms.
    The functor F: C^op x C -> Set maps (∙,∙) to the set Σn, with an action
    F(f^op, g)(x) = gxg⁻¹, derived from the trivial left action and conjugation right action.

    The value of the coclassifier at (∙,∙), denoted [Γ(F)](∙,∙), can be calculated
    using a coend formula, which results in a set of equivalence classes.
    The calculation can be summarized as follows:
    1.  The formula for the coclassifier object is:
        [Γ(F)](∙,∙) = ∫^{C,D} C(∙,C) × F(C,D) × C(D,∙)
    2.  This coend can be computed iteratively. The first coend ∫^{C} C(∙,C) × F(C,D)
        simplifies due to the trivial left action of F, resulting in a set of size n!.
        The resulting profunctor K has an action identical to F.
    3.  The second coend ∫^{D} K(∙,D) × C(D,∙) involves quotienting the set Σn × Σn
        by the equivalence relation (k, v) ~ (gkg⁻¹, vg⁻¹) for any g in Σn.
    4.  To count the number of equivalence classes, we can find a canonical representative
        for each class. The function ψ(k, v) = vkv⁻¹ is an invariant under this relation:
        ψ(gkg⁻¹, vg⁻¹) = (vg⁻¹)(gkg⁻¹)(vg⁻¹)⁻¹ = vg⁻¹gkg⁻¹gv⁻¹ = vkv⁻¹.
    5.  This means all elements in an equivalence class are mapped to the same element by ψ.
        The map ψ is surjective onto Σn (e.g., for any x in Σn, ψ(x, e) = x).
    6.  Therefore, the set of equivalence classes is in bijection with Σn.
    7.  The cardinality is |Σn| = n!.

    For n=9, the cardinality is 9!.
