Function f(w):
Let P be the formula ((1 ⊸ ⊥) ⊸ ⊥).
Then f(w) is P tensored with itself w times. For w=0, f(0) = 1.
f(w) = P ⊗ P ⊗ ... ⊗ P  (w times)

Formula C(W, m, b):
The formula C only needs to depend on m and b.
Let P^k denote P tensored with itself k times.
C(m, b) = (((P^b) ⊸ ⊥)^m) ⊸ ⊥
Which can be written as:
C(m, b) = ( ( (P ⊗ ... (b times) ... ⊗ P) ⊸ ⊥ ) ⊗ ... (m times) ... ⊗ ( (P ⊗ ... (b times) ... ⊗ P) ⊸ ⊥ ) ) ⊸ ⊥
