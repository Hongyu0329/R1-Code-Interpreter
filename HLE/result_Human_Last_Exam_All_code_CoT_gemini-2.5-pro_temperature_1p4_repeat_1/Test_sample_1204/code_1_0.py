        'III': "CORRECT - A urine drug screen is essential for a comprehensive assessment. It provides objective data, checks for other substance use, and is critical for safety, especially given the patient's request for stimulants.",
        'IV': "CORRECT - The patient is struggling significantly with insomnia. Melatonin is a low-risk intervention that addresses a primary complaint, which can help build the therapeutic alliance needed to tackle the more complex issues.",
