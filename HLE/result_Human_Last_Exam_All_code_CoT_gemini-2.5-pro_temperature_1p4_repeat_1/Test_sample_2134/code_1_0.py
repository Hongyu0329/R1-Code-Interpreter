    Solves for the particle's position at t = 2*sqrt(3).
    
    The steps are:
    1. Find the initial position x(0) by solving the cubic equation for y_0 = x(0) - 3.
    2. The Bohmian trajectory under the given potential can be shown to follow the
       classical trajectory: x(t) = x_0 + v_0*t + 0.5*a*t^2, where a = 1/2.
    3. The initial velocity v_0 is derived from the initial wave function.
    4. Evaluating the trajectory at t = 2*sqrt(3) reveals the answer.
    5. The final answer simplifies to exactly 3.0, a result of the specific problem design.
