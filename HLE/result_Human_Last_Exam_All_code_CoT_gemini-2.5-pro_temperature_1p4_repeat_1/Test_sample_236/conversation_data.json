    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Knots:** List all unique knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). Since the trefoil knot is not amphichiral (it is different from its mirror image), we must consider both the right-handed (3_1) and left-handed (-3_1) versions. The figure-eight knot (4_1) is amphichiral.\n\n2.  **Consider Relevant Surgeries:** An integral surgery on a knot `K` produces a homology 3-sphere (which is, by definition, an element of the homology cobordism group `Θ_3^H`) if and only if the surgery coefficient is `+1` or `-1`. Therefore, we only need to analyze these two types of surgeries for each knot.\n\n3.  **Identify Resulting Manifolds:** We will use established results from low-dimensional topology to identify the specific 3-manifolds that result from these surgeries.\n\n4.  **Determine Homology Cobordism Classes:** The resulting manifolds are grouped into equivalence classes based on homology cobordism. Two manifolds are in different classes if they have different homology cobordism invariants, such as the Rohlin invariant. Manifolds known to be non-cobordant (e.g., those with different Heegaard-Floer d-invariants or different orders in the group `Θ_3^H`) will be counted as distinct elements.\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Classes:** Finally, we will count the total number of distinct classes identified.\n\nThe following Python script systematically implements this plan by encoding these topological facts and processing each case.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_knot_surgery_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented\n    by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the knots and their relevant properties.\n    # Knots considered: Unknot (0_1), Trefoil (3_1), Figure-eight (4_1).\n    # We must also consider the mirror of the non-amphichiral trefoil.\n    knots = {\n        \"0_1\": {\"name\": \"Unknot\"},\n        \"3_1\": {\"name\": \"Right-handed Trefoil\"},\n        \"-3_1\": {\"name\": \"Left-handed Trefoil\"},\n        \"4_1\": {\"name\": \"Figure-eight knot\"},\n    }\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Map surgeries on these knots to their resulting 3-manifolds and\n    # identify their homology cobordism class.\n    # The class is given a unique identifier based on established topological results.\n    # 'P' denotes the Poincaré homology sphere Σ(2,3,5).
