def solve_matrix_model_question():

    This function provides the solution to the theoretical questions about the matrix model.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) Superintegrability in this context is a very strong property, related to the partition function
        having a simple character expansion. For the family of models Z_{-n}, this property only holds
        for n=1 and n=2. For n=3, the model is known to be integrable but not superintegrable.
    (b) Since Z_{-4} is not a superintegrable model, it cannot be generated from a simple state using
        the standard operators of the underlying W-algebra. A specific operator, denoted W_{-4},
        which lies outside this standard algebra, is therefore necessary by definition to construct
        the Z_{-4} partition function.
