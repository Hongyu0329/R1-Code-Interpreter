# Step 1: Define the constants based on the problem statement.
# Let a = 10^5 from the expressions for l1 and alpha1.
# c1 is given. We use floating-point numbers for precision.
a = 10.0**5
c1 = 10.0**4

# Step 2: Determine the gain K1.
# Based on the hypothesis that the control law is u1 = -K1 * x11,
# with K1 = alpha1 / l1.
# l1 = (1 + a)**5
# alpha1 = (1 + a)**6 * (1 - a + a**2)
# K1 = alpha1 / l1 = (1 + a) * (1 - a + a**2)
# This simplifies to the sum of cubes: 1**3 + a**3.
K1 = 1 + a**3

# Step 3: Solve for u1.
# From the matrix equation, we derive x11 = 1 + c1 * u1.
# Substituting u1 = -K1 * x11, we get x11 = 1 + c1 * (-K1 * x11).
# Solving for x11: x11 * (1 + c1 * K1) = 1 => x11 = 1 / (1 + c1 * K1).
# Now, solving for u1: u1 = -K1 * x11 = -K1 / (1 + c1 * K1).
u1 = -K1 / (1 + c1 * K1)

# Step 4: Output the numbers in the final equation and the result.
# The final equation for u1 is u1 = -K1 / (1 + c1 * K1).
# We will print the values of the components of this equation.
numerator = -K1
denominator = 1 + c1 * K1
print(f"The equation for the control u1 is derived as u1 = -K1 / (1 + c1 * K1)")
print(f"Value of K1 = {K1}")
print(f"Value of c1 = {c1}")
print(f"The final calculation is: {numerator} / {denominator}")
print(f"Result: u1 = {u1}")
