# The problem is to calculate the product of d_n for n from 1 to 8.
# Based on advanced results in knot theory, the dimension d_n is given by the formula d_n = 2^n.
# We will now write a Python script to calculate the product:
# d_1 * d_2 * d_3 * d_4 * d_5 * d_6 * d_7 * d_8

# A list to store each d_n value
d_values = []

# Loop for n from 1 to 8 to calculate each d_n
for n in range(1, 9):
    # Calculate d_n = 2^n
    d_n = 2**n
    d_values.append(d_n)

# Calculate the final product by multiplying all d_n values
final_product = 1
for d in d_values:
    final_product *= d

# Format the list of d_n values into a string for the equation
equation_str = " * ".join(map(str, d_values))

# Print the final equation with the result
print(f"The calculation is:\n{equation_str} = {final_product}")

# An alternative way to express the calculation is using the sum of exponents:
# exponent_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36
# The product is 2^36.
exponent_sum = sum(range(1, 9))
print(f"\nThis is equivalent to 2^(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8) = 2^{exponent_sum} = {2**exponent_sum}")
