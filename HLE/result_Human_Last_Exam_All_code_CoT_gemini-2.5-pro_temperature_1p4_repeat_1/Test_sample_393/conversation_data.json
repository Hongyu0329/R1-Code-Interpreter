    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The question asks for the number of Tverberg partitions for a specially constructed set of $n$ points, $X$. The key property provided is that *any* Tverberg partition of this set results in subsets whose sizes are given by a specific multiset $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$, which is a partition of the integer $n$.\n\n2.  **Connect to Combinatorics:** This special property simplifies the problem significantly. The geometric constraints of Tverberg's theorem are already satisfied by design. The problem reduces to a purely combinatorial one: counting the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ distinct items (the labeled points of $X$) into $r$ groups of specified sizes $a_1, \\dots, a_r$.\n\n3.  **The Formula:** The number of ways to partition a set of $n$ items into *ordered* groups of sizes $a_1, \\dots, a_r$ is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n    $$ \\binom{n}{a_1, \\dots, a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\dots a_r!} $$\n\n4.  **Account for Indistinguishable Groups:** A Tverberg partition is a *set* of subsets, meaning the order of the subsets does not matter. If some part sizes are identical (e.g., we have two groups of size 3), these groups are considered indistinguishable. We must correct for overcounting by dividing by the number of ways to permute these identical-sized groups. If a size $s_j$ appears $c_j$ times in the list of part sizes, we must divide the result by $c_j!$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation Plan:**\n    *   Let the input be the list of part sizes `a = [a_1, a_2, ..., a_r]`.\n    *   Calculate $n = \\sum a_i$.\n    *   Count the frequencies of each distinct part size, let them be $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$.\n    *   The final number of partitions is given by the formula:\n        $$ \\frac{n!}{(a_1! a_2! \\dots a_r!) \\cdot (c_1! c_2! \\dots c_k!)} $$\n\n6.  **Implementation:** I will write a Python function that takes the list of part sizes, performs this calculation, and prints the final count along with the full equation used to derive it, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_tverberg_partitions(partition_sizes: list[int]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Tverberg partitions for a set of n points,\n    given that all partitions have parts of the specified sizes.\n\n    The problem is equivalent to counting the number of ways to partition a set of\n    n elements into subsets of given sizes a_1, a_2, ..., a_r.\n\n    The formula is: n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!) / (c_1! * c_2! * ... * c_k!)\n    where c_j is the count of each distinct part size.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not partition_sizes:\n        print(\"The list of partition sizes cannot be empty.\")\n        return\n\n    n = sum(partition_sizes)\n    r = len(partition_sizes)\n\n    # Calculate the multinomial coefficient part: n! / (a_1! * a_2! * ... * a_r!)\n    # We do this in log space to avoid potential overflow with large numbers, though for\n    # this specific calculation, direct computation is often fine.\n    # However, direct computation is easier to show in the final string.\n    \n    numerator = math.factorial(n)\n    \n    parts_factorial_product = 1\n    for part in partition_sizes:\n        if part <= 0:\n            print(\"Error: Partition sizes must be positive integers.\")\n            return\n        parts_factorial_product *= math.factorial(part)\n\n    # Count frequencies of each part size to handle indistinguishable groups\n    size_counts = Counter(partition_sizes)\n    \n    counts_factorial_product = 1\n    for count in size_counts.values():\n        counts_factorial_product *= math.factorial(count)\n        \n    # Final result\n    try:\n        if parts_factorial_product * counts_factorial_product == 0:\n             raise ZeroDivisionError\n        result = numerator // (parts_factorial_product * counts_factorial_product)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero.
