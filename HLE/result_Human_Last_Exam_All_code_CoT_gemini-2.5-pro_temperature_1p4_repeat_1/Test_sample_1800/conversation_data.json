    "Of course. Finding the ideal stoichiometry for a catalyst is a complex task that depends on many factors, including the synthesis method, operating temperature, and pressure. However, based on extensive scientific literature, a general consensus has emerged regarding a highly effective ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that summarizes the findings from scientific literature. The script will not compute the ratio but will print a detailed explanation of the generally accepted ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions. It will explicitly state the numbers in the ratio to fulfill the request.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef get_catalyst_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints information on the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic reactions\n    based on a review of scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Ni-Ceria Nanoparticle Catalysts\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n    \n    # General Context\n    intro_text = \"\"\"\n    The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO2) catalysts is not a single, universally fixed value. It depends on synthesis methods, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and particle morphology. However, a general optimal range has been identified to maximize the crucial Ni-Ceria interface, which is believed to host the active sites for the reactions, while preventing the sintering of Ni particles.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(intro_text))\n    \n    # Specific Reactions\n    print(\"--- Ideal Ratio for Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) ---\")\n    \n    wgs_ws_text = \"\"\"\n    For both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, a relatively low nickel loading is preferred. This ensures high dispersion of Ni atoms on the ceria support and maximizes the perimeter contact between Ni and Ceria.\n    \n    Research consistently shows high catalytic activity when the atomic ratio of Ni to Ce is approximately 1 to 9.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(wgs_ws_text))\n\n    # The final equation as requested\n    print(\"The ideal atomic ratio can be expressed as:\")\n    ni_val = 1\n    ce_val = 9\n    print(f\"    Ni : Ce = {ni_val} : {ce_val}\")\n    \n    # Expressing as atomic percentage\n    total_parts = ni_val + ce_val\n    ni_atomic_percent = (ni_val / total_parts) * 100\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to a Nickel atomic loading of Ni/(Ni+Ce) = {ni_val}/{total_parts}, or {ni_atomic_percent:.1f}%.\")\n    \n    conclusion_text = \"\"\"\n    This loading balances the availability of active Ni sites with the prevention of bulk NiO formation, which is less active and prone to deactivation. While ratios up to 1:4 (20% Ni) can also be effective, the 1:9 ratio is a very common and highly cited optimum.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(conclusion_text))\n\n# Run the function to display the information\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_catalyst_info()\n```\n<<<An optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is approximately 1:9 (which corresponds to a 10% Ni atomic loading).>>>"
