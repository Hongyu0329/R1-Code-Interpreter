    # We are given alpha_i = sqrt(i), which means alpha_i^2 = i.

    # Step 2: State the solvability condition derived from perturbation analysis.
    # For a solution to the nonlinear boundary value problem to exist, the
    # initial values of the corresponding linear problem, x_i^0, must satisfy
    # a set of algebraic equations. This solvability condition is:
    # (sum_{j=1, j!=i to n} (x_j^0)^2) * (1 - e^{-T}) = alpha_i^2   for i = 1, ..., n.
    #
    # Let y_i = (x_i^0)^2 and C = 1 - e^{-T}. Let K_i = alpha_i^2 / C.
    # The system is: sum_{j!=i} y_j = K_i.
    # Solving this linear system for y_i gives:
    # y_i = (1/(n-1)) * (sum_{j=1 to n} K_j) - K_i
    #
    # For a real solution x_i^0 to exist, we must have y_i = (x_i^0)^2 >= 0.
    # This leads to the condition on the parameters alpha_i:
    # (sum_{j=1 to n} alpha_j^2) / (n-1) - alpha_i^2 >= 0 for all i.

    # Step 3: Check if this condition holds for the given n and alpha_i.
    # The sum of alpha_j^2 from j=1 to n is the sum of the first n integers:
    # sum_alpha_sq = 1 + 2 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2.
    #
    # The inequality is: (n * (n + 1) / 2) / (n - 1) - i >= 0.
    # This must hold for all i from 1 to n. The condition is strictest (most likely to fail)
    # when 'i' is largest, i.e., i = n.
    
    # We check the inequality for i = n:
    # (n * (n + 1)) / (2 * (n - 1)) - n >= 0
    # Multiplying by 2*(n-1) (which is positive for n=4048):
    # n*(n+1) - 2*n*(n-1) >= 0
    # Dividing by n (which is non-zero):
    # (n + 1) - 2*(n - 1) >= 0
    # n + 1 - 2n + 2 >= 0
    # 3 - n >= 0  or  n <= 3

    # Step 4: Draw a conclusion from the check.
    # The condition n <= 3 is not met for the given n = 4048.
