    Calculates the approximation factors for the Multicut problem with k = 10^6.
    
    The best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the Multicut problem
    on general graphs achieves an approximation factor of O(log k). There are also
    matching hardness results showing this is essentially the best possible.
    
    This means we can achieve an approximation of alpha <= log k, but not necessarily
    alpha <= sqrt(log k).
    
    We calculate the values for k = 10^6 to match them with the options.
