    "I will answer the user's question about Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\nThis is a historical question that does not require coding to solve. Based on historical and scientific records, Albert Einstein's work on statistical mechanics, which formed the basis for his Brownian motion paper, was heavily influenced by the work of a specific physicist whose major contributions were published in a volume of lectures.\n\nThe person whose lectures were a key influence was Ludwig Boltzmann. Einstein studied Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie*), which was fundamental to his own thinking on the subject. While the 1905 paper itself is famous for its lack of formal citations, the intellectual debt to Boltzmann's work is widely acknowledged by historians of science.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
