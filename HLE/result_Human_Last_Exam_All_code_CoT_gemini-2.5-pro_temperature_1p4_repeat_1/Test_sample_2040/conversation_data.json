    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will address the physics question about spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in boron nanosheets. To do this, I will break down the problem into key physical principles:\n1.  I'll explain the fundamental requirement for SPDC, which is a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$).\n2.  I'll connect this requirement to the material's crystal symmetry, noting that materials with inversion symmetry have a $\\chi^{(2)}$ of zero.\n3.  I'll research and present the known crystal structure and symmetry of common free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).\n4.  Finally, I will synthesize this information to conclude whether these nanosheets would be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nAs per your instructions, I will encapsulate this step-by-step explanation within a Python script that uses the `print()` function to display the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes and explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets\n    would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Question: Would free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC)?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Analysis Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
