    print("Its existence depends on a material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted chi(2).")

    # Step 2: Connection to Symmetry
    print("\nStep 2: The Role of Crystal Symmetry")
    print("A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics is that chi(2) is only non-zero in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry.")
    print("Materials that are 'centrosymmetric' (possess inversion symmetry) have a chi(2) that is identically zero in the bulk.")

    print("  - Ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets are typically centrosymmetric.")

    # Add an important caveat
    print("\nImportant Caveat:")
    print("This conclusion applies to an 'ideal' sheet. In real-world scenarios, factors like strain, wrinkles, edges, defects, or interactions with a substrate can locally break the inversion symmetry, potentially enabling a weak second-order nonlinear effect. However, the intrinsic property of the ideal material does not support SPDC.")
