    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: The structure of the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $N$ depends on the prime factorization of $N$.\n2.  **Decomposition of Primitive Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Order of a Character**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $o(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(o(\\chi_1), \\dots, o(\\chi_k))$.\n4.  **Counting the Characters**: We need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. This involves:\n    a. For each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$ of $N$, identifying the possible orders of primitive characters.\n    b. Filtering these characters to keep only those whose orders divide 6.\n    c. Multiplying the number of choices for each component to get the total number of tuples where the lcm of orders divides 6.\n    d. Verifying that for these tuples, the lcm is exactly 6 and not a proper divisor of 6.\n\nThis plan will be implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    This is used to find the number of characters of a specific order.\n    The number of elements of order d in a cyclic group C_k is phi(d), if d divides k.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N and order K.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    K = 6\n    \n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {K}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize N\n    factors = [4, 9, 7, 11, 13]\n    print(f\"The conductor is N = {N}.\")\n    print(f\"The prime power factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 = {factors[0]} * {factors[1]} * {factors[2]} * {factors[3]} * {factors[4]}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Character decomposition and order\n    print(\"A primitive character chi modulo N can be decomposed into a product of primitive characters:\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13\")\n    print(\"The order of chi is lcm(order(chi_4), order(chi_9), order(chi_7), order(chi_11), order(chi_13)).\")\n    print(f\"We need this lcm to be {K}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Count character choices for each component\n    print(f\"For the lcm to be {K}, the order of each component character must divide {K}.\")\n    print(\"Let's count the number of choices for each primitive component.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Modulo 4\n    m_4 = 4\n    print(f\"For modulus m = {m_4}:\")\n    print(\"There is only one primitive character, and its order is 2.
