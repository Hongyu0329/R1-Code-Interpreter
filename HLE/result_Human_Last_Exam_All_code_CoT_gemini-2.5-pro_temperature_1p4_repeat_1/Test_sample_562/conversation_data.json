    "The task is to identify the bushu (radical) of the Japanese character 謄 and provide the Hepburn Romanization of its name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Character's Visual Form**: The character 謄 is visually composed of two parts: 月 on the left and 朕 on the right. Based on its appearance, one might assume the radical is 月 (tsukihen).\n\n2.  **Consult Dictionary/Etymological Standards**: While visually the radical appears to be 月, the official radical for 謄 as used in Japanese dictionaries (and based on its etymology) is actually 言. The character 謄 is a simplified or altered form of the older character 謄. In this original form, the semantic component (the radical) is clearly 言, meaning \"words\" or \"speech\", which aligns with the character's meaning of \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\". The 朕 part is the phonetic component. Modern Japanese kanji classification systems often retain this traditional, etymological radical for dictionary lookup purposes, even if the modern character's shape has changed.\n\n3.  **Identify the Radical's Name and Transcription**:\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   When this radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called \"gonben\" (言偏).\n    *   The Hepburn transcription for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"Gonben\". I will now generate the Python code to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name.\n    \n    The kanji 謄 visually appears to have the '月' (tsukihen) radical.\n    However, its official dictionary radical is '言' (gonben), based on its\n    etymological origin from the character 謄. This is a known irregularity\n    where the modern form differs from its official classification.\n    \n    The name of the '言' radical when on the left is ごんべん (gonben).\n    \"\"\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    print(f\"The radical (bushu) of the character 謄 is 言.\")\n    print(f\"The Hepburn transcription of its name is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
