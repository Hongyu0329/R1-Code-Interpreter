    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name.
    
    The kanji 謄 visually appears to have the '月' (tsukihen) radical.
    However, its official dictionary radical is '言' (gonben), based on its
    etymological origin from the character 謄. This is a known irregularity
    where the modern form differs from its official classification.
    
    The name of the '言' radical when on the left is ごんべん (gonben).
