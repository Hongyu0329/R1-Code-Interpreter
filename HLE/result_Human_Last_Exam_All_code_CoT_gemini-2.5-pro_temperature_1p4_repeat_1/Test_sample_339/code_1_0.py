    Computes the Ocneanu trace tr_2(f_2(sigma_1^{-3})).
    
    The steps are:
    1. Define symbolic variables for q and z.
    2. Set up the system of equations based on the eigenvalues of the Hecke algebra generator T_1.
       The eigenvalues are q and -1 from the relation T_1^2 - (q-1)T_1 - q = 0.
    3. We want to find a and b such that T_1^{-3} = a*T_1 + b.
       On the eigenspaces, this becomes:
       q^{-3} = a*q + b
       (-1)^{-3} = a*(-1) + b
    4. Solve this system for a and b.
    5. The trace is then tr(a*T_1 + b) = a*tr(T_1) + b*tr(1) = a*z + b.
    6. Print the computed expression. The final result represents the value of tr_2(f_2(sigma_1^{-3})).
