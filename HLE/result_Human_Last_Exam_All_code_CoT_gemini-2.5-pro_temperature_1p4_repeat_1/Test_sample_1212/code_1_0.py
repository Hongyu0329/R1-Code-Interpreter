def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the Go puzzle by identifying all possible first moves
    for White that lead to a guaranteed kill of the Black group.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    The Black stones form a single connected group. To kill this group, White
    must reduce its liberties to zero.

    The liberties of the Black group are the adjacent empty points:
    A1, A3, A4, B1, B2.

    Analysis shows that the Black group's shape is weak and lacks the space
    to form two eyes. White can successfully kill the group by playing on any
    of its five liberties. Each of these moves initiates a sequence where
    White can systematically reduce the remaining liberties, and Black cannot
    create a living shape.

    For example, if White plays B2:
    1. W@B2: Reduces Black's liberties.
    2. Black's strongest response is to expand (e.g., B@A4).
    3. White can then play on the new vital point (W@A3) to constrain Black's shape.
    4. This process continues until Black's group is in atari (one liberty) and
       is subsequently captured.

    Similar kill sequences exist if White starts at A1, A3, A4, or B1.
    Therefore, all five moves are correct.
