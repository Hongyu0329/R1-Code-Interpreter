    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code like the toric code depends on the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The degeneracy is given by the formula GSD = 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits the code can store.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to determine the correct formula:\n\n1.  **Understand the Surface:** The problem describes a surface with `n` smooth holes (boundaries) and `m` rough holes. We'll assume the base surface is a plane or a sphere (genus g=0), which is standard unless specified otherwise.\n\n2.  **Identify Sources of Logical Information:** In the toric code, logical information is stored in states corresponding to different configurations of non-trivial operators or, equivalently, anyon charges on the boundaries.\n    *   **Smooth Holes and 'e' anyons:** A smooth boundary can be thought of as a location where electric charges ('e' anyons) can terminate. With `n` smooth holes, we can create states by distributing 'e' charges among them. Since the total charge on the surface must be trivial (i.e., add up to the vacuum), the charge on the last hole is determined by the charges on the first `n-1` holes. This gives `n-1` independent degrees of freedom, leading to a state space of dimension `2^(n-1)` (assuming n > 0).\n    *   **Rough Holes and 'm' anyons:** Similarly, a rough boundary is where magnetic charges ('m' anyons) can terminate. With `m` rough holes, there are `m-1` independent ways to distribute these charges, leading to a state space of dimension `2^(m-1)` (assuming m > 0).\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Degeneracy:** The 'e' anyon and 'm' anyon sectors are independent. Therefore, the total ground space degeneracy is the product of the dimensions of these two state spaces.\n    *   GSD = (Dimension from smooth holes) * (Dimension from rough holes)\n    *   GSD = 2^(n-1) * 2^(m-1)\n    *   GSD = 2^((n-1) + (m-1))\n    *   GSD = 2^(n + m - 2)\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** This formula, `2^(n + m - 2)`, corresponds to option B. It's important to note this derivation is most straightforward when `n ≥ 1` and `m ≥ 1`, a common implicit assumption in such problems.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates how to calculate this degeneracy for given values of `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a plane with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The formula is GSD = 2^(n + m - 2), assuming n>=1 and m>=1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem asks to choose a formula, which is 2^(n + m - 2).\n    # We will demonstrate this formula with example values for n and m.\n    # We assume n and m are at least 1, as having zero holes of one type\n    # would change the formula, and this form matches one of the options.\n\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        print(\"This formula assumes n > 0 and m > 0.\")\n        # For n=1, m>0, the GSD is 2^(m-1).\n        # For m=1, n>0, the GSD is 2^(n-1).\n        # The general formula is 2^(max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)).\n        # However, 2^(n+m-2) is one of the choices, suggesting n>=1 and m>=1 is assumed.\n        # We will proceed with the calculation to demonstrate the formula from the answer choice.\n\n    exponent = n + m - 2\n    result = 2**exponent\n\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is calculated using the formula: 2^(n + m - 2)\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n} (smooth holes) and m = {m} (rough holes):\")\n    # The final output prints the equation with all the numbers.\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{exponent} = {result}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=3 smooth holes and m=2 rough holes.\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=3, m=2)\n```\n<<<B>>>"
