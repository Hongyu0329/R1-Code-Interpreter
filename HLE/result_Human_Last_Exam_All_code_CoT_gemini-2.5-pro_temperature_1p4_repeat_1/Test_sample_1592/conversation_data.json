    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec:\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: First, I will find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of Waskaganish, Quebec.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors**: I will identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec. These are Ontario, Nunavut, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n3.  **Find Closest Points**: For each neighboring province or territory, I will determine the coordinates of a point on its border that is geographically nearest to Waskaganish.\n    *   **Ontario**: The border is a line of longitude just west of Waskaganish. I will use a point on this border at the same latitude as Waskaganish.\n    *   **Nunavut**: The closest part of Nunavut is Akimiski Island in James Bay. I will use a point on the southern coast of this island.\n    *   **New Brunswick & Newfoundland and Labrador**: I will select points on their respective borders with Quebec, although they are visually much farther away.\n4.  **Calculate Distances**: I will use the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere (the Earth), to find the distance from Waskaganish to each of the selected points.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: Finally, I will compare these calculated distances to identify which province or territory is the closest.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan. The code will also print out the numbers used in the distance calculations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_distance(name1, lat1, lon1, name2, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Haversine distance between two points and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = 6371  # Earth radius in kilometers\n\n    print(f\"\\n--- Calculating distance between {name1} and the closest point in {name2} ---\")\n    print(f\"Coordinates for {name2}: (lat={lat2}, lon={lon2})\")\n\n    # Convert degrees to radians\n    lat1_rad = math.radians(lat1)\n    lon1_rad = math.radians(lon1)\n    lat2_rad = math.radians(lat2)\n    lon2_rad = math.radians(lon2)\n\n    # Differences in coordinates\n    delta_lat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad\n    delta_lon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad\n    \n    # Haversine formula part 1: a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * sin²(Δλ/2)\n    a = math.sin(delta_lat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1_rad) * math.cos(lat2_rad) * math.sin(delta_lon / 2)**2\n    print(f\"Equation for 'a': sin²({delta_lat:.4f}/2) + cos({lat1_rad:.4f}) * cos({lat2_rad:.4f}) * sin²({delta_lon:.4f}/2)\")\n    print(f\"Result 'a': {a:.8f}\")\n\n    # Haversine formula part 2: c = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1-a))\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    print(f\"Equation for 'c': 2 * atan2(√{a:.8f}, √(1-{a:.8f}))\")\n    print(f\"Result 'c': {c:.8f}\")\n\n    # Haversine formula part 3: d = R * c\n    distance = R * c\n    print(f\"Equation for distance 'd': {R} * {c:.8f}\")\n    print(f\"Final Distance: {distance:.2f} km\")\n\n    return distance\n\ndef find_closest_province_territory():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec\n    waskaganish_name = \"Waskaganish\"\n    waskaganish_lat = 51.1939\n    waskaganish_lon = -78.7606\n    print(f\"Base location: {waskaganish_name}, Quebec (lat={waskaganish_lat}, lon={waskaganish_lon})\")\n\n    # Coordinates for the closest points in neighboring provinces/territories\n    locations = {\n        \"Ontario\": (51.1939, -79.5167),  # A point on the border due west of Waskaganish\n        \"Nunavut\": (52.6, -81.5),  # Southern coast of Akimiski Island\n        \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (52.94, -66.91),  # Labrador City, near the border\n        \"New Brunswick\": (48.05, -67.75)  # A point on the border near Edmundston\n    }\n\n    closest_location_name = None\n    min_distance = float('inf')\n\n    # Iterate through locations, calculate distance, and find the minimum\n    for name, (lat, lon) in locations.items():\n        dist = calculate_and_print_distance(waskaganish_name, waskaganish_lat, waskaganish_lon, name, lat, lon)\n        if dist < min_distance:\n            min_distance = dist\n            closest_location_name = name\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"Comparing all distances, the closest province or territory is {closest_location_name} with a distance of {min_distance:.2f} km.\")\n    \n    # Final answer in the specified format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{closest_location_name}>>>\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closest_province_territory()\n```"
