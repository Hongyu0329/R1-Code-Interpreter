# Let's imagine a non-zero derivation D.
# We don't know what D is, but we know it's a linear operator satisfying the Leibniz rule.
# Let's assume D exists and for some function f0, D(f0) is not zero.
# For example, let's say for f0(x) = x^2, D(f0)(x) = x. (This is not a real derivation on C(R), but a toy example).
# Let's represent D by a placeholder function.

# D_tilde(f) = c * D(f)
# (g * D(f)) = c * D(f)
# This implies (g - c) * D(f) = 0 for all f.

# Let's test this with a function f(x) = x^3.
f = x**3
D_f = D(f)
D_tilde_f = D_tilde(f)

# The equation is (g - c) * D(f) = 0.
# If this is to hold for some constant c, (g(x) - c) must be zero wherever D(f)(x) is not zero.
# g(x) = x + 1
# D(f)(x) = D(x^3) = 0.5 * 3 * x^2 = 1.5 * x^2
# D_tilde(f)(x) = g(x) * D(f)(x) = (x+1) * 1.5 * x^2

# Equation becomes: (x + 1 - c) * (1.5 * x**2) = 0 for all x.
# For x != 0, we need x + 1 - c = 0, which means x = c - 1.
# This cannot hold for all non-zero x.
# Therefore, g*D is not a scalar multiple of D.
# The space of derivations, if non-zero, is not 1-dimensional. Statement A is false.

# This example illustrates the core of the argument.
# We can't really "run" the final equation, but we can print the components that show the contradiction.
