    "Answering this question requires concepts from set theory, specifically the idea of ordinals and order types. The task is to find the ordinal number that represents the structure of the set of finite strings made from `{a,b,c,d}` when ordered lexicographically.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **The Set and the Order**: The set is `S`, containing all finite strings of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', like \"a\", \"b\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"bad\", etc. The order is lexicographical (dictionary order). For example, \"a\" < \"aa\" < \"ab\" < \"b\". A key property of this ordering is that any non-empty subset of strings has a smallest element, which means it is a well-ordering. The order type of a well-ordered set is an ordinal number.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Ordinal**: We need to find an ordinal `α` that is order-isomorphic to the set `S`. This means finding a one-to-one mapping from strings to ordinals that preserves the order.\n\n3.  **Self-Similarity**: Let's observe the structure of the ordered set. It starts with all strings beginning with 'a', followed by all strings beginning with 'b', and so on.\n    *   `S_a` = strings starting with 'a'\n    *   `S_b` = strings starting with 'b'\n    *   `S_c` = strings starting with 'c'\n    *   `S_d` = strings starting with 'd'\n\n    The whole set `S` is the ordered union `S_a` ∪ `S_b` ∪ `S_c` ∪ `S_d`.\n    Now consider `S_a`. It consists of strings like \"a\", \"aa\", \"ab\", etc. Each string in `S_a` is 'a' followed by some string from the set `S` itself (if we also include the empty string). This reveals a self-similar, recursive structure. This type of structure is characteristic of ordinals that are powers of `ω` (omega), the smallest infinite ordinal.\n\n4.  **The Ordinal `ω^ω`**: The structure of strings of varying lengths corresponds to the structure of ordinals in Cantor normal form. An ordinal `α < ω^ω` can be uniquely written as a polynomial in `ω` with natural number coefficients:\n    `α = c_k * ω^k + c_{k-1} * ω^{k-1} + ... + c_1 * ω + c_0`\n    This is analogous to a string of finite length. The set of all such ordinals is `ω^ω`. It is a well-known result in combinatorial set theory that for any alphabet with `n > 1` characters, the order type of the set of finite strings under lexicographical order is `ω^ω`.\n\n5.  **What is `ω^ω`?**: It is the supremum (the limit) of the sequence `ω, ω^2, ω^3, ω^4, ...`. It represents an ordering that contains copies of `ω`, copies of `ω^2`, and so on, for all finite powers of `ω`. This matches the complex nested structure of lexicographically ordered strings.\n\nThe following Python code explains and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef explain_order_type():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the reasoning behind the order type of lexicographically ordered strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    alphabet_size = 4\n    \n    print(\"Problem: What is the order type of the set of finite strings of characters {a,b,c,d} ordered lexically?\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
