# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the problem.
# For a lattice point p in Z^n, S_p is the set of neighbors q such that the
# Manhattan distance sum(|p_i - q_i|) is even.
# We are looking for pairs (n, m) where n >= 1 and m >= 0, for which a set
# P subset Z^n exists such that for all p in Z^n, |S_p intersect P| = m.

# Step 3 & 4: Determine the set of possible values for m for each n.
# Let C_n = |S_p|. A calculation shows that C_n = (3^n + (-1)^n) / 2.
# Two trivial solutions for P exist for any n:
# 1. P = emptyset. This gives |S_p intersect P| = 0 for all p. So m=0 is always possible.
# 2. P = Z^n. This gives |S_p intersect P| = |S_p| = C_n for all p. So m=C_n is always possible.
# A deeper mathematical analysis suggests that these are the *only* possible values for m.
# The core idea is that the operator that maps the set P to the function f(p)=|S_p intersect P|
# is very rigid, and for f(p) to be constant, the set P must be trivial (either empty or the whole space).
# Therefore, for each n >= 1, there are exactly two possible values for m.

# Step 5: Calculate the final sum.
# The set of pairs is S = {(n, m) | n >= 1, m in {0, C_n}}.
# The sum is Sum_{ (n, m) in S } 1/4^n.
# For each n, there are two values of m, so we add 1/4^n twice for each n.
# Sum = Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4^n + 1/4^n)
# Sum = Sum_{n=1 to infinity} 2 / 4^n
# Sum = 2 * Sum_{n=1 to infinity} (1/4)^n
# This is twice a geometric series with first term a = 1/4 and ratio r = 1/4.
# The sum of the geometric series is a / (1 - r) = (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) = 1/3.
# The total sum is 2 * (1/3) = 2/3.

# Step 6: Print the result according to the user's instructions.
# The final equation is Sum = 2 / 3. The numbers are 2 and 3.
