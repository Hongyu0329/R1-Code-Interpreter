    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the historical question. The task is to identify a specific architectural feature that was present in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" until it was removed in 1950. To solve this, I need to access historical data about Roman urban planning in the mid-20th century.\n\nAs requested, here is a Python script that frames the problem by setting up variables for the key information provided in the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_removed_feature_info(year):\n  \"\"\"\n  This function sets up the parameters for the historical query.\n  \"\"\"\n  location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n  event_description = \"A unique architectural feature was removed.\"\n  \n  # The problem specifies the year of removal.\n  # As per the instructions, we will print the number involved in the final output.\n  print(f\"Investigating a historical event in {location}.\")\n  print(f\"Description: {event_description}\")\n  print(f\"The removal occurred in the year: {year}\")\n\n# Execute the function with the year from the question.\nfind_removed_feature_info(1950)\n```\n<<<The tramway tracks>>>"
