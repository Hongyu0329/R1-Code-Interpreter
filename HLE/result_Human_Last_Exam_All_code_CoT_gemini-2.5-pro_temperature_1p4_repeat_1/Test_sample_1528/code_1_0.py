# 1. Define the hyperelliptic curve
# Define the polynomial ring over the rational numbers
P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)

# Define the polynomial f(x) from the right-hand side of the equation
f = x^6 + 4*x^5 + 6*x^4 + 2*x^3 + x^2 + 2*x + 1

# The curve is defined by y^2 = f(x). To confirm its genus is 2,
# we can check that f(x) is square-free. Its discriminant is non-zero,
# so the genus is indeed 2. This means it is not an elliptic curve.
# For such a curve, the "conductor" refers to the conductor of its Jacobian.

# Create the Hyperelliptic Curve object
C = HyperellipticCurve(f)

# 2. Compute the conductor
# Get the Jacobian of the curve
J = C.jacobian()

# Compute the conductor, which is an integer for varieties over Q
conductor_value = J.conductor()

# 3. Print the results
# As requested, we first print the numbers in the curve's equation
print(f"The curve is defined by the equation: y^2 = {f}")

# Then, we print the computed conductor
print("\nThe conductor of this curve is:")
print(conductor_value)
