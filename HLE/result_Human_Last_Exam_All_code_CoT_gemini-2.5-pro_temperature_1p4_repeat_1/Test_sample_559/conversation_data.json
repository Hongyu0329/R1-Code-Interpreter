    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will first find the equilibrium points of the system by solving for $(d, u)$ where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: I'll compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each point, I can classify them as nodes, sources, or saddles.\n3.  **Identify the Saddle Point**: A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that is often the stable or unstable manifold of a saddle point. I will identify the saddle point(s) from the classification.\n4.  **Find the Separatrix Equation**: The separatrix is a special trajectory that passes through the saddle point. I will search for an invariant curve (a solution of the form $d=f(u)$) that passes through the saddle point. Through analysis and substitution (specifically, by letting $d = y \\cdot u^2$ and solving the resulting ODE for $y$), I found a simple particular solution, $d = -u^2$.\n5.  **Verify the Solution**: I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to confirm that the equation $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant curve of the system. The script will substitute $d=-u^2$ into the original system and show that the equation holds true. Finally, the script will print the equation of the separatrix with its coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_and_verify_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the equation of the separatrix for the given system\n    of differential equations and prints the resulting equation.\n\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d(t)**2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)**2)*d(t) - u(t)**3*(1 - u(t))\n    u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)*u(t)**2\n\n    Analysis of the system reveals a saddle point at (d, u) = (-1, 1).\n    The separatrix is an invariant manifold passing through this saddle point.\n    Through analytical methods, the equation for the separatrix is hypothesized to be d = -u**2.\n    This script will programmatically verify this hypothesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Verifying the hypothesized separatrix equation...\")\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables\n    u = sp.Symbol('u')\n    \n    # The hypothesized separatrix equation is d = -u^2.\n    # We treat d as a function of u, which is in turn a function of t.\n    d = -u**2\n\n    # From the second DE, we have the expression for u'(t) in terms of u.\n    u_prime_t = (u - 1) * u**2\n\n    # The left-hand side (LHS) of the first DE is d'(t).\n    # We can calculate it using the chain rule: d'(t) = (dd/du) * u'(t).\n    dd_du = sp.diff(d, u)\n    lhs_d_prime = dd_du * u_prime_t\n\n    # The right-hand side (RHS) of the first DE is given in the problem statement.\n    # We substitute our hypothesized expression for d into it.\n    rhs_d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1 - u)\n\n    # To verify our hypothesis, we check if LHS equals RHS.\n    # This is equivalent to checking if (LHS - RHS) simplifies to zero.\n    verification_expression = lhs_d_prime - rhs_d_prime\n    simplified_verification = sp.simplify(verification_expression)\n\n    if simplified_verification == 0:\n        print(\"Verification successful.
