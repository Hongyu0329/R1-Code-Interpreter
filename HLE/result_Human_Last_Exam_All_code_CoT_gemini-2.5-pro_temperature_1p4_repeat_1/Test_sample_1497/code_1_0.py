    """
    Solves the violin timbre parameter matching problem.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  'sul ponticello' (1) excites higher harmonics, changing their decay rate, controlled by Î½. This is group (ii).
    2.  'bridge mute' (2) adds mass to the bridge, lowering the frequency (f1) and amplitude (a1) of the main body resonance. This is group (iii). The frequency f1 goes 'down'.
    3.  'helium room' (3) increases the speed of sound, shifting up the frequency of air-cavity resonances (f2). This is group (iv).
    4.  'on the E string' (4) changes the fundamental frequency of the open string, F. This is group (i).

    The final answer is a comma-separated string for variations (1), (2), (3), (4) and the direction for (2).
