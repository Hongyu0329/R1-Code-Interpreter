    "Of course. I will design a simplified version of a well-known, tightly secure, two-round threshold signature scheme and provide the implementation in Python.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Choose the Scheme:** I will model the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)** signature scheme. It is an excellent choice because:\n    *   It is based on the Schnorr signature algorithm, whose algebraic structure is well-suited for multi-party computation.\n    *   It is proven to be **tightly secure** under the discrete logarithm assumption, meaning it provides strong security guarantees without requiring overly large parameters.\n    *   Its signing protocol is optimized to consist of **only two rounds** of communication after an initial key generation phase.\n\n2.  **Explain the Phases:** The scheme consists of three main phases:\n    *   **Phase 1: Key Generation (Once per group):** A trusted dealer (or a more complex Distributed Key Generation protocol) creates a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`. It then distributes a point on this polynomial (a secret share) to each of the `n` participants. The group's public key is derived from the polynomial's constant term.\n    *   **Phase 2: Signing - Round 1 (Commitment):** Each of the `t` participating signers generates a secret one-time number (a \"nonce\") and broadcasts a public value derived from it (a \"commitment\"). This is a pre-computation round and can be done ahead of time.\n    *   **Phase 3: Signing - Round 2 (Signature Share Generation):** Once a message needs to be signed and all participants have exchanged their commitments from Round 1, each participant uses their secret share, their nonce, the message, and the collected commitments to calculate and broadcast a partial signature.\n\n3.  **Aggregation & Verification:** A designated \"aggregator\" (who can be one of the signers) collects the `t` partial signatures and combines them into a single, final signature. This final signature `(R, s)` can be verified by anyone using the single group public key, just like a standard Schnorr signature.\n\n4.  **Implementation Details:**\n    *   For simplicity, the Python code will simulate the scheme using modular arithmetic with integers instead of a full elliptic curve group. The underlying principles are identical.\n    *   A trusted dealer will be used for key generation to keep the code focused on the signing protocol.\n    *   The hash function will be simulated using Python's `hash()` function for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, a secure cryptographic hash function like SHA-256 would be used.\n    *   The code will simulate the `t` signers and the aggregator, clearly showing the two communication rounds and the final verification equation with all its numerical components.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# A simple class to represent a participant in the FROST scheme\nclass Participant:\n    def __init__(self, id, secret_share, t, group):\n        self.id = id\n        self.secret_share = secret_share\n        self.group = group\n        # Pre-computation for Round 1\n        self.nonce_d = random.randint(1, group['q'] - 1)\n        self.nonce_e = random.randint(1, group['q'] - 1)\n        self.commitment_D = pow(group['g'], self.nonce_d, group['q'])\n        self.commitment_E = pow(group['g'], self.nonce_e, group['q'])\n\ndef shamir_secret_sharing(t, n, secret, q):\n    \"\"\"Generates shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing with a trusted dealer.\"\"\"\n    if t > n:\n        raise ValueError(\"Threshold t cannot be greater than the number of participants n.\")\n    \n    # Generate a random polynomial of degree t-1\n    # f(x) = a_0 + a_1*x + ... + a_{t-1}*x^{t-1}\n    # The secret a_0 is the group's secret key\n    coeffs = [secret] + [random.randint(1, q - 1) for _ in range(t - 1)]\n    \n    # Generate shares for each participant i = 1, 2, ..., n\n    # A share is a point on the polynomial: (i, f(i))\n    shares = {}\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        y = 0\n        # Evaluate polynomial f(i)\n        for j in range(t):\n            y = (y + coeffs[j] * pow(i, j, q)) % q\n        shares[i] = y\n        \n    return shares, coeffs\n\ndef lagrange_coeff(i, S, q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Lagrange coefficient L_i for a participant i in a set S.\"\"\"\n    num = 1\n    den = 1\n    for j in S:\n        if i == j:\n            continue\n        num = (num * j) % q\n        den = (den * (j - i)) % q\n    # We use modular inverse for division\n    return (num * pow(den, -1, q)) % q\n\ndef simple_hash(*args):\n    \"\"\"A simplified non-cryptographic hash function for demonstration.\"\"\"\n    s = \"\".join(map(str, args))\n    return int(hash(s))\n\ndef design_frost_scheme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the FROST 2-round threshold signature scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
