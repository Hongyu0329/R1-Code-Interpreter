# The plan is to derive a number from each line of the haiku,
# convert those numbers to letters, and then sort the letters.

# Line 1: "An August tempest" -> The number of words is 3.
num1 = 3

# Line 2: "Twice fifteen brings winds of change" -> A singular historical event -> 1.
num2 = 1

# Line 3: "A divine one yields" -> "A divine one" (1) "yields" another -> 1 + 1 = 2.
num3_part1 = 1
num3_part2 = 1
num3 = num3_part1 + num3_part2

# As requested, we will output the numbers used in the final "equation" or derivation.

print(f"Line 2 provides the number: {num2}")
