    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color can be represented in sRGB if and only if all of its resulting R, G, and B components are within the range of [0, 1]. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented without distortion.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the Python script:\n1.  **Define Input Colors**: Create a list of the five ROMM RGB colors provided.\n2.  **Linearize ROMM RGB**: The ROMM RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). The first step is to convert them to linear values. This is done by raising each component to the power of 1.8. (This is a simplification; a more complex piecewise function exists, but for the given input values, this power function is sufficient).\n3.  **Apply Conversion Matrix**: Multiply the vector of linear ROMM RGB values by the standard conversion matrix that transforms linear ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with a D65 white point). This matrix multiplication performs the change of color primaries and also includes a chromatic adaptation step.\n4.  **Check Gamut**: After the conversion, check the resulting linear sRGB values. If all three components (R, G, and B) are between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive), the color is within the sRGB gamut. Otherwise, it is out of gamut.\n5.  **Collect and Report**: Identify the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut and present them in the specified format.\n\nThe following Python code implements this conversion and checking process.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall outside the sRGB color gamut.\n    \n    A color is outside the sRGB gamut if, after conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB,\n    any of its R, G, or B components are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
