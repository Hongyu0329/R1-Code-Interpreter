    print("This interaction generates a new signal beam, the anti-Stokes beam (frequency ω_as).\n")

    print("Step 2: Understand the CARS resonance and the governing equation.")
    print("The process provides chemical information because it is resonantly enhanced when the frequency difference (ω_p - ω_s) matches a molecular vibrational frequency (Ω) in the sample.")

    print("In broadband CARS, either the pump or the Stokes beam is spectrally broad, covering a wide range of frequencies, while the other is narrowband.")
    print("If the pump beam (ω_p) is broadband, it offers a wide continuum of frequencies.")
    print("For any given molecular vibration (Ω) in the sample, there will be a specific frequency component within the broadband pump beam that satisfies the resonance condition: ω_p - ω_s = Ω.\n")

    print("Step 4: Determine the nature of the resulting anti-Stokes signal.")
    print("Since the sample may have multiple different vibrational modes (Ω_1, Ω_2, Ω_3, ...), each mode will be excited by a different frequency slice of the broadband pump beam.")
    print("Each of these interactions will generate a corresponding anti-Stokes signal at a unique frequency (ω_as_1, ω_as_2, ω_as_3, ...).")
    print("The total output signal is therefore a broadband anti-Stokes beam composed of all these separate signal frequencies.\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclude on the information content.")
    print("This broadband anti-Stokes beam can be sent into a spectrometer, which separates the light by frequency. This allows a detector (like a CCD) to measure the intensity at each frequency.")
    print("Therefore, the broadband anti-Stokes beam explicitly contains distinguishable information about the various vibrational modes present in the sample.\n")
