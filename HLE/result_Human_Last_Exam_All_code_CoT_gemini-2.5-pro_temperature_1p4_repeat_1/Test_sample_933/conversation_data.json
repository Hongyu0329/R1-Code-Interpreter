    "To determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), we need to review the known methods for its production.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  Identify the primary synthesis method for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄). The most common method is the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) with fluorine gas (F₂).\n2.  The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is: `Xe + 2F₂ → XeF₄`.\n3.  Research the reaction conditions. The synthesis of XeF₄ is highly dependent on temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants.\n4.  According to established chemical literature, the synthesis of XeF₄ is typically performed by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (in a 1:5 molar ratio) in a sealed nickel container.\n5.  The optimal temperature for this reaction to proceed efficiently is approximately 400 °C at a pressure of about 6 atmospheres.\n6.  Let's evaluate the other temperature options:\n    *   **600 °C:** At this higher temperature, particularly with an excess of fluorine, the reaction favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n    *   **200 °C, 78 °C, 0 °C, -78 °C:** These temperatures are too low for the reaction to proceed at an efficient rate. The activation energy for the reaction is significant, requiring substantial heat.\n7.  Therefore, 400 °C is the most widely cited and lowest temperature among the choices provided at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently via the thermal method.\n\nThe following Python code will print the explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    and identifies the coldest efficient temperature from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The chemical equation for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride is:\n    # 1Xe + 2F₂ → 1XeF₄\n    # We will print the coefficients of this equation as requested.\n    reactant_1_coeff = 1  # Coefficient for Xe\n    reactant_2_coeff = 2  # Coefficient for F₂\n    product_coeff = 1     # Coefficient for XeF₄\n    \n    print(\"Synthesizing Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)\")\n    print(\"The balanced chemical equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{reactant_1_coeff} Xe + {reactant_2_coeff} F₂ → {product_coeff} XeF₄\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Provided answer choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": \"600 C\",\n        \"B\": \"400 C\",\n        \"C\": \"200 C\",\n        \"D\": \"78 C\",\n        \"E\": \"0 C\",\n        \"F\": \"-78 C\"\n    }\n\n    # Explanation of the synthesis process\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is produced by the direct reaction of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas.\")\n    print(\"This reaction requires specific conditions to be efficient.\")\n    print(\"While the reaction can occur at various temperatures, efficiency is key.\")\n    print(\"- At temperatures above 400 C (e.g., 600 C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) is favored.\")\n    print(\"- At temperatures significantly below 400 C, the reaction rate is too slow to be considered efficient.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe standard, established method involves heating the elements at 400 C.\")\n    \n    # Identify the correct answer\n    correct_temp = \"400 C\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the coldest temperature from the choices at which XeF₄ can be produced efficiently is {correct_temp}.\")\n\n# Run the function to display the result\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
