    This function explains the solution to the problem of finding the smallest
    natural number N with the property that every anisotropic quadratic form
    in N variables over a specific field K is surjective.

    The explanation proceeds as follows:
    1.  Analyze the properties of the field K.
    2.  Break down the problem by classifying quadratic forms over K.
    3.  Determine the condition for surjectivity for each class of forms.
    4.  Establish a lower bound for N.
    5.  Prove that this bound is also sufficient.

    print("Step 1: Understanding the Field K")
    print("-----------------------------------")
    print("Let K be a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2.")
    print("Its residue field, k, is a local field of characteristic 2.")
    print("An example of such a field is K = F_q((t_1))((t_2)), where F_q is a finite field of characteristic 2.")
    print("A crucial property for quadratic forms in characteristic 2 is the subfield of squares, K^2 = {x^2 | x in K}.")
    print("For a field like K = F_q((t_1))((t_2)), the dimension of K as a vector space over K^2 is [K : K^2] = 4.")

    print("--------------------------------------")
    print("We are looking for the smallest natural number N such that for every anisotropic quadratic form Q in N variables, the value map Q: K^N -> K is surjective.")
    print("A quadratic form Q is 'anisotropic' if Q(x_1, ..., x_N) = 0 only has the trivial solution x_1 = ... = x_N = 0.")
    print("A map is 'surjective' if its image (the set of values Q can take) is the entire field K.\n")

    print("Step 3: Classifying Quadratic Forms in Characteristic 2")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("A quadratic form Q over a field of characteristic 2 can be classified into two types:")
    print("a) Purely inseparable forms: Q(X_1, ..., X_N) = a_1*X_1^2 + ... + a_N*X_N^2.")
    print("b) Forms that are not purely inseparable: These have a non-degenerate part of dimension at least 2.\n")

    print("Step 4: Analyzing Surjectivity for Each Type")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("Case a) Purely inseparable forms:")
    print("The value set of Q = a_1*X_1^2 + ... + a_N*X_N^2 is the K^2-vector space spanned by its coefficients {a_1, ..., a_N}.")
    print("For Q to be surjective, this value set must be the entire field K.")
    print("Since [K : K^2] = 4, the K^2-span of the coefficients must have dimension 4.")
    print("This implies that we need at least 4 coefficients, so N >= 4.")
    print("Furthermore, for Q to be anisotropic, the coefficients {a_1, ..., a_N} must be linearly independent over K^2.\n")

    print("Case b) Forms that are not purely inseparable:")
    print("Let Q be an anisotropic form that has a non-degenerate part Q_nd of dimension >= 2.")
    print("By a theorem of R. Baeza, the value set of an anisotropic non-degenerate form of dimension >= 2 contains a basis of K over K^2.")
    print("The value set of Q, D(Q), contains the value set of Q_nd, so D(Q) also contains a basis of K over K^2.")

    print("Therefore, any anisotropic form that is not purely inseparable is surjective.\n")

    print("Step 5: Determining the Value of N")
    print("-----------------------------------")
    print("From Step 4, the only forms that might not be surjective are the purely inseparable ones.")
    print("We need to find the smallest N that guarantees surjectivity for *all* anisotropic forms.")
    print("Let's test if N < 4 is possible. Consider N = 3.")
    print("We can construct a counterexample: let {b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4} be a basis for K over K^2.")
    print("The form Q = b_1*X_1^2 + b_2*X_2^2 + b_3*X_3^2 is anisotropic because its coefficients are linearly independent over K^2.")
    print("However, its value set is the 3-dimensional K^2-subspace spanned by {b_1, b_2, b_3}, which is not all of K.")
    print("So Q is not surjective. This proves that N must be at least 4.\n")

    print("Step 6: Verifying N = 4 is Sufficient")
    print("-----------------------------------------")
    print("Now we check if N=4 works. Let Q be any anisotropic quadratic form of dimension 4.")
    print("- If Q is purely inseparable, Q = a_1*X_1^2 + a_2*X_2^2 + a_3*X_3^2 + a_4*X_4^2.")
    print("  Anisotropy implies its coefficients {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4} are linearly independent over K^2.")
    print("  Since [K : K^2] = 4, they must form a basis. Their K^2-span is K.")
    print("  The value set is K, so Q is surjective.")
    print("- If Q is not purely inseparable, its non-degenerate part has dimension >= 2 (since the total dimension is 4).")
    print("  By the argument in Step 4, Q is surjective.")
