# The problem asks for the minimum number of prototypes required to guarantee
# the correct classification of C class centroids.
# Based on the reasoning provided above, this number is equal to C.

# Let M_min be the minimum number of prototypes.
# Let C be the number of classes.
# The final relationship is: M_min = C.

# The value of C is not specified in the problem, so the answer is the
# symbolic variable 'C' itself.
final_answer = 'C'

# The prompt requires printing the final answer using the print function.
# It also mentions outputting numbers from a final equation. Since our equation
# M_min = C is symbolic, we will print the symbol representing the solution.
