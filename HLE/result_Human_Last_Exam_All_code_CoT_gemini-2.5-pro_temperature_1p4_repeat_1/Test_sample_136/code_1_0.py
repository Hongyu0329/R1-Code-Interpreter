# The problem asks for the limit of a conditional probability of a random walk on a large 2D torus.
# This limit can be determined using results from the theory of random walks on the infinite grid Z^2.

# The limit is the square of the probability that a simple random walk on Z^2 starting
# "from infinity" hits the origin (0) before it hits the other specified point (x_0).
# Let this probability be p.

# By the symmetry of the simple random walk on Z^2, for any two distinct points, the probability
# of hitting one before the other for a walk starting far away is 1/2.
p_numerator = 1
p_denominator = 2
p = p_numerator / p_denominator

# The required limit is the square of this probability, p.
exponent = 2
limit = p ** exponent

# The final equation demonstrates the calculation. We print it out as requested.
print(f"The final limiting probability is given by the equation: ({p_numerator}/{p_denominator})^{exponent}")
print(f"The result is: {limit}")
