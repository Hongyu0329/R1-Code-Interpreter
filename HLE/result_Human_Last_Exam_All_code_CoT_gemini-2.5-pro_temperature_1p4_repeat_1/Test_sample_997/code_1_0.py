# The game is solved using backward induction.
# Let P_i be the probability chosen by agent i, which corresponds to p(w_i).
# A higher P_i is better, and the agent with the highest P_i wins.

# Agent C's choice determines the game's outcome.
# Let's define C's winning probability based on C's choice, p_C.

# Case 1: Agent C chooses p_C < 1.
# - Agent B observes p_C < 1. To maximize B's winning chance, B chooses p_B = 1.
# - With p_B = 1, B secures the highest possible probability, guaranteeing B wins.
# - In this case, Agent C's probability of winning is 0.
prob_win_C_if_pC_less_than_1 = 0

# Case 2: Agent C chooses p_C = 1.
# - Agent B must choose a unique probability, so p_B < 1.
# - Agent A observes p_C = 1 and p_B < 1. A cannot choose a probability higher than 1, so A cannot win.
# - The winner is the one with the highest probability, which is Agent C.
# - In this case, Agent C's probability of winning is 1.
prob_win_C_if_pC_equals_1 = 1

# Agent C, being rational, chooses the action that maximizes the win probability.
# Comparing a win probability of 0 with a win probability of 1, C will choose the action corresponding to the latter.
# Therefore, the optimal choice for Agent C is p_C = 1.
p_C = 1

# The problem asks for the value of floor(100 * p_C).
# Let's formulate the final equation and calculate the result.
factor = 100
final_value = int(factor * p_C)

# Output the explanation and the final equation.
