    # Step 1: Define the terms from the Kirkby Lonsdale (Cumbric) dialect.
    # The person "used to have had tyaan'eboon". This is the original number we need to translate.
    # 'Tyaan' is a form of 'Tyan' (2) and 'boon' is a form of 'Bumfit' (15).
    # So, 'tyaan'eboon' means 2 + 15.
    kirkby_lonsdale_term = "tyaan'eboon"
    original_quantity = 17

    # 'daoves' is a form of 'dovera' (9), the current quantity, which is not needed for the final answer.
    # current_quantity = 9

    # Step 2: Define the equivalent term in the Derbyshire dialect.
    # In Derbyshire, 17 is 'Tain-a-bumfit', where 'Tain' is 2 and 'Bumfit' is 15.
    derbyshire_term = "Tain-a-bumfit"

    # Step 3: Print the final equation as requested.
    # The question asks what the person "had had", so we use the original quantity.
