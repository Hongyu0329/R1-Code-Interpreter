    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the components involved: the \"sum of graphs\" operation and the \"chromatic number\" of a cycle.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Graph Sum:** The sum of graphs \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\), denoted \\(G_1 + G_2\\), is formed by taking the union of the vertices and edges of \\(G_1\\) and \\(G_2\\) and adding new edges connecting every vertex of \\(G_1\\) to every vertex of \\(G_2\\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Sum:** A key property is that the chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers. For \\(G = G_1 + G_2 + \\dots + G_k\\), the chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) + \\dots + \\chi(G_k) \\).\n    In our case, \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), so \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The number of colors needed for a cycle \\( C_n \\) (where \\( n \\ge 3 \\)) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n4.  **Find the Maximal Chromatic Number:** To find the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must choose the value of \\( n \\) that maximizes \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is odd.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** By choosing \\( n \\) to be any odd number for all three cycles, we maximize the total chromatic number. The maximal chromatic number is therefore \\( 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \\).\n\nThe following Python code calculates and displays this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the *maximal* chromatic number.\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle Cn is 2 if n is even, and 3 if n is odd (for n>=3).\n    # To maximize the total chromatic number, we choose n to be odd for each cycle.\n    max_chromatic_number_of_cycle = 3\n\n    # The graph G is the sum of three cycles.\n    num_cycles = 3\n\n    # The chromatic number of a sum of graphs is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\n    # So, X(G) = X(C_n) + X(C_n) + X(C_n).\n    # To maximize this, we take the maximum X(C_n) for each term.\n    total_max_chromatic_number = max_chromatic_number_of_cycle * num_cycles\n\n    # We print the final equation showing each part of the sum.\n    # Since G is the sum of three cycles, and the maximal chromatic number for each is 3,\n    # the equation is 3 + 3 + 3.\n    c1 = max_chromatic_number_of_cycle\n    c2 = max_chromatic_number_of_cycle\n    c3 = max_chromatic_number_of_cycle\n    \n    print(\"The maximal chromatic number is achieved when each cycle's length 'n' is odd.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of an odd cycle is 3.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of the sum of the three cycles is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {c1} + {c2} + {c3} = {total_max_chromatic_number}\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_number()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
