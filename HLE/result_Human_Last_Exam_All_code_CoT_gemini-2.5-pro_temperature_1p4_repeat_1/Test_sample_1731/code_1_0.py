# The final answer contains the derived formulas presented by the script.
# The equilibrium value for mean energy is U = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * V * T⁴.
# The equilibrium value for entropy is S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) * V * T³.
# Since the user wants a single response block and no direct numerical answer without inputs,
# the execution of the Python script above is the complete answer.
# Let's select one of the core results as the final "answer" tag. The Energy U is more fundamental.
# Let's format the constant factor of Energy U.
U_constant = (8 * math.pi**5) / 15
# Let's format the constant factor of Entropy S.
S_constant = (32 * math.pi**5) / 45
# The problem is about physics formulas, so a string representation of the answer seems most appropriate.
# Let's pick the Entropy formula.
