    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the task.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Acknowledge the Theoretical Framework**: The Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems form the mathematical foundation of large deviation theory. In statistical mechanics, these principles justify the method of maximum entropy. The equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate with the highest probability, which corresponds to the state with the largest number of associated microstates (i.e., maximum entropy). Therefore, we will find the equilibrium values by maximizing the entropy of the photon gas.\n2.  **Formulate the System**: We are dealing with light quanta (photons), which are bosons. The entropy `S` is given by the Boltzmann formula `S = k * ln(W)`, where `W` is the number of microstates for a given macrostate.\n3.  **Identify Constraints**: For a photon gas in equilibrium with the walls of a container at temperature `T`, the total energy `U` is constant. However, unlike a gas of massive particles, photons can be created and absorbed by the walls. This means the total number of photons `N` is **not conserved**. In the language of statistical mechanics, this sets the chemical potential `μ` to zero.\n4.  **Find the Equilibrium Distribution**: We will maximize the entropy `S` subject to the single constraint of constant energy `U`. This procedure yields the famous Planck distribution for the average number of photons `<n>` in an energy state `ε`.\n5.  **Calculate Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**: We will then find the total mean energy `U` by integrating the energy of each state (`ε` multiplied by its occupation number `<n(ε)>`) over the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a three-dimensional volume. This calculation leads to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n6.  **Calculate Equilibrium Entropy (S)**: Once `U` is known, the equilibrium entropy `S` can be found using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a photon gas, which connects `S`, `U`, and `T`.\n7.  **Present in Code**: The final Python script will clearly present these steps and output the final analytical formulas for the mean energy `U` and entropy `S`, carefully annotating all the numbers in the final equations as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_equilibrium_values():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script uses the principles of statistical mechanics, justified by large deviation\n    theorems, to find the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a photon gas.\n    The method involves maximizing the entropy for bosons with zero chemical potential.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Derivation of Equilibrium Values for a Photon Gas (Bose Case) ###\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the starting point - the distribution\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The Equilibrium Distribution\")\n    print(\"Maximizing the entropy S for a gas of bosons (photons) where particle number is not conserved (chemical potential μ=0) yields the Planck distribution for the average occupation number <n(ε)> of a state with energy ε:\")\n    print(\"\\n  <n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k*T)) - 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(\"  k = Boltzmann constant\")\n    print(\"  T = Temperature\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate and display the mean energy U\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)\")\n    print(\"The total mean energy U is found by integrating the energy per state over the density of states for photons in a volume V.
