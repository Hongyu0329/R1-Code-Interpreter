    "Answering this question requires applying key concepts from the theory of finite reflection groups, specifically for the group of type H3.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The goal is to find the number of elements `w` in the reflection group H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n    a. `w` has a *regular eigenvector*.\n    b. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector has an order of 10 (which is the Coxeter number, `h`, for H3).\n\n2.  **Apply Group Theory Principles:**\n    *   A fundamental theorem by T. Springer states that an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if the element itself is *regular*.\n    *   An element is defined as regular if and only if the number 1 is not one of its eigenvalues.\n    *   The H3 group acts on a 3-dimensional space, so its elements (as matrices) have three eigenvalues.\n    *   Since the group's representation is over real numbers, any complex eigenvalues must appear in conjugate pairs.\n\n3.  **Determine the Eigenvalues:**\n    *   Let `w` be an element satisfying the conditions. One of its eigenvalues, `λ₁`, must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi/10)`).\n    *   Its complex conjugate, `λ₂`, must also be an eigenvalue.\n    *   The third eigenvalue, `λ₃`, must be real. The only real roots of unity are `+1` and `-1`.\n    *   The \"regularity\" condition (that 1 is not an eigenvalue) forces `λ₃` to be `-1`.\n    *   Therefore, the eigenvalues of any such element must be `{ζ₁₀ᵏ, ζ₁₀⁻ᵏ, -1}`, where `ζ₁₀ = exp(2πi/10)` and `gcd(k, 10) = 1`.\n\n4.  **Identify and Count the Elements:**\n    *   The different valid values for `k` (1, 3, 7, 9) define different sets of eigenvalues, which correspond to distinct conjugacy classes within H3.\n    *   **Case k=1, 9:** The eigenvalues are `{ζ₁₀, ζ₁₀⁹, -1}`. This is the set of eigenvalues for the *Coxeter elements* of H3. The number of elements in this conjugacy class is calculated as `|H3| / h`, where `|H3| = 120` is the order of the group and `h = 10` is the Coxeter number. This gives `120 / 10 = 12` elements.\n    *   **Case k=3, 7:** The eigenvalues are `{ζ₁₀³, ζ₁₀⁷, -1}`. This corresponds to another conjugacy class of regular elements. For instance, if `c` is a Coxeter element, the element `c³` belongs to this class. This class has the same size as the Coxeter class, which is also 12.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   The total number of elements is the sum of the elements from these two classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have\n    a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the H3 reflection group.\n    # The order of the H3 group is the product of its invariant degrees (2, 6, 10).\n    group_order_h3 = 2 * 6 * 10\n    # The Coxeter number for H3 is 10.\n    coxeter_number_h = 10\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the conditions\")\n    print(\"An element has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a 'regular element'.\")\n    print(\"A regular element is one for which 1 is not an eigenvalue.\")\n    print(\"The element must also have an eigenvalue of order 10 (a primitive 10th root of unity).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determining the eigenvalues\")\n    print(\"Let w be such an element in H3 (a 3x3 matrix).\")\n    print(\"1.
