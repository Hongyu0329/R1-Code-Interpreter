    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory:** The problem asks for the scaling exponent `α` using the epsilon (`ϵ`) expansion from renormalization group theory.\n2.  **Define Key Parameters:**\n    *   The epsilon expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For a system with an O(n) symmetry (like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models), `d_c = 4`.\n    *   The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d` is the spatial dimension of our system, given as `d = 3`.\n    *   The specific model is not specified. I will assume the standard Ising model, where the order parameter is a scalar, meaning it has `n = 1` component.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` for the O(n) model is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script that defines these parameters, calculates `ϵ`, substitutes the values into the formula for `α`, and prints the step-by-step calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the calculation.\n    # d_c is the upper critical dimension for O(n) models.\n    d_c = 4\n    # d is the spatial dimension given in the problem.\n    d = 3\n    # n is the number of components of the order parameter.\n    # We assume the Ising model, where n=1.\n    n = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the expansion parameter, epsilon.\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the first-order epsilon expansion formula for alpha.\n    # The formula is: alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n    numerator_term = 4 - n\n    denominator_term = 2 * (n + 8)\n    \n    alpha_value = (numerator_term / denominator_term) * epsilon\n    \n    # For a more precise representation, calculate using fractions\n    alpha_fraction = Fraction(numerator_term, denominator_term) * epsilon\n\n    # Step 4: Print the process and the result.\n    print(\"Calculation of the Specific Heat Scaling Exponent α\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"This calculation uses the first-order epsilon (ϵ) expansion for the Ising model (n=1).\")\n    print(f\"Upper Critical Dimension (d_c): {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"System Spatial Dimension (d): {d}\")\n    print(f\"Order Parameter Components (n): {n}\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we calculate ϵ:\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nNext, we use the formula for α:\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n    # The final equation with each number printed out\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator_term} / {denominator_term} * {epsilon}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe result as a fraction is: {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\")\n    print(f\"The numerical value for α is: {alpha_value}\")\n    \n    # Return the final numerical answer in the required format\n    # Redirecting to stdout to be captured\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{alpha_value}>>>\")\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```"
