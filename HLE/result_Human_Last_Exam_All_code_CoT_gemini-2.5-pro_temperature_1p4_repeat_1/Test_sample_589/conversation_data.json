    "My plan is to analyze the key elements from your description: a major Hollywood film, a teenager, a distinct pink bike, and the specific action of riding toward an oncoming car. I will search my knowledge base for films that match these specific, memorable details. The combination of these elements points to a specific scene in a popular 1980s horror franchise. I will then provide the name of this film.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a film based on a specific scene description.\n    - Film Type: Major Hollywood production\n    - Character: Teenager\n    - Prop: Pink bicycle\n    - Action: Riding toward an oncoming car\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    scene_description = (\n        \"In this 1985 film, the teenage protagonist, Jesse Walsh, \"\n        \"rides his sister's pink bike down the middle of a street \"\n        \"in a tense scene with traffic.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
