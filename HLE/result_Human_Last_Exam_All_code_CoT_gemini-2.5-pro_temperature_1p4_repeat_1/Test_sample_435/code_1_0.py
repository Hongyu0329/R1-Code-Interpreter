Based on the body of evidence, one would predict that manufacturing CAR T cells with Interleukin-15 (IL-15) would lead to **enhanced effector cytokine release** upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.

The reasoning for this prediction is as follows:

1.  **Promotion of a Memory Phenotype:** IL-15 is a cytokine that strongly supports the development and survival of memory T cells, particularly the less-differentiated and highly persistent central memory (Tcm) and stem cell memory (Tscm) phenotypes. T cells with these characteristics have a greater capacity for self-renewal and long-term persistence in the patient.

2.  **Improved Cell Fitness and Potency:** T cells cultured with IL-15 are generally more metabolically fit and less prone to exhaustion than those cultured with other cytokines like IL-2, which tends to drive terminal differentiation.

3.  **Robust Effector Function:** When these IL-15-conditioned memory CAR T cells encounter their target antigen, they are primed to mount a powerful and sustained effector response. This response includes the robust release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are critical for anti-tumor activity.

In summary, by fostering a more persistent and potent memory-like CAR T cell population, IL-15 would be expected to increase the magnitude and sustainability of cytokine production when the cells are activated, leading to a more effective anti-tumor response.
