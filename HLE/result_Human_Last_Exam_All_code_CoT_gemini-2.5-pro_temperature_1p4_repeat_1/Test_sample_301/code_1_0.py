# This script will determine the relationship between 3-Hydroxypropionate ([B]) and PEP ([F]).

# 1. Define the start and end points of the pathway analysis.
initial_reactant_name = "3-Hydroxypropionate"
initial_reactant_symbol = "[B]"
final_product_name = "PEP"
final_product_symbol = "[F]"

# 2. Identify the direct enzymatic steps and their rate constants connecting [B] to [F].
# Path: [B] -> Malonyl-CoA -> Acetyl-CoA -> Pyruvate -> [F]
path_constants = ["k2", "k3", "k4", "k5"]

# 3. Build the proportionality expression as a string.
# The concentration of the final product is proportional to the initial reactant
# multiplied by all the rate constants along the direct path.
expression_parts = [initial_reactant_symbol] + path_constants
final_expression_str = " * ".join(expression_parts)

# 4. Print the reasoning and the final derived equation.
print(f"To find the relationship between {final_product_symbol} and {initial_reactant_symbol}, we trace the direct path:")
print("3-Hydroxypropionate -k2-> Malonyl-CoA -k3-> Acetyl-CoA -k4-> Pyruvate -k5-> PEP")
print("\nThe concentration of the final product is proportional to the concentration of the initial reactant")
print("multiplied by the rate constants of the intermediate steps.")
print("\nFinal derived relationship:")
# Ensure each k value's number is printed as requested
print(f"{final_product_symbol} ‚àù {initial_reactant_symbol} * k2 * k3 * k4 * k5")

# 5. The resulting expression matches one of the answer choices.
final_answer = "G"
print(f"\nThis corresponds to answer choice {final_answer}.")
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
