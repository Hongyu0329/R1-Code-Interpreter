    "To determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Mountains:** First, we identify all the significant historical mountains mentioned in the text of the *Iliad*. These include Mount Olympus, Mount Ida (in Turkey, near Troy), Mount Samothrace (where Poseidon watched the battle), and Mount Athos.\n2.  **Find Elevations:** Next, we find the official elevation for each of these real-world mountains.\n3.  **Exclude Olympus:** As per the request, we remove Mount Olympus from our list of candidates.\n4.  **Compare and Identify:** Finally, we compare the elevations of the remaining mountains to find the tallest one.\n\nThe Python script below automates this process. It defines a dictionary containing the mountains and their elevations, removes Mount Olympus, and then sorts the remaining mountains to find the highest peak. It will print the comparison and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ida (Turkey)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Mountains mentioned in the Iliad (with elevations):\")\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height}m\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Exclude Mount Olympus from the comparison.\n    contenders = {name: height for name, height in mountains.items() if name != \"Mount Olympus\"}\n\n    # Step 4: Find the tallest among the remaining mountains.\n    if not contenders:\n        print(\"No other mountains to compare.\")\n        return\n\n    # Sort contenders by height in descending order to create the \"equation\"\n    sorted_contenders = sorted(contenders.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    tallest_mountain_name = sorted_contenders[0][0]\n    tallest_mountain_height = sorted_contenders[0][1]\n\n    print(\"After excluding Mount Olympus, the comparison is:\")\n    \n    # Building the final equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = []\n    for name, height in sorted_contenders:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{name} ({height}m)\")\n    \n    final_equation = \" > \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(f\"The tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
