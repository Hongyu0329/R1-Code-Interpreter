# The three correctly associated triplets are:
# 2) Automimicry, with Arcas cypria (false head) and Apis melifera (drones mimicking workers) as valid examples.
# 5) MÃ¼llerian mimicry, a classic mimicry ring between Heliconiini butterflies and certain unpalatable moths.
# 8) Aposematism, with Danaus plexippus (visual warning) and Cycnia tenera (acoustic warning) as valid examples.
# The following code calculates the sum of the numbers of these correct triplets.

correct_triplet_1 = 2
correct_triplet_2 = 5
correct_triplet_3 = 8

total_sum = correct_triplet_1 + correct_triplet_2 + correct_triplet_3

# The final equation prints each number from the correct triplets and their sum.
print(f"{correct_triplet_1} + {correct_triplet_2} + {correct_triplet_3} = {total_sum}")
