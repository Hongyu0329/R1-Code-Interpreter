    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams**: First, we need to determine the relevant Feynman diagrams. The problem specifies \"second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in φ⁴ scalar field theory\".\n    *   \"Second-order\" in the coupling constant λ means we use the interaction vertex, which comes from the $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ term in the Lagrangian, exactly twice.\n    *   \"Vacuum bubble\" means the diagrams have no external lines; all propagator lines begin and end on a vertex.\n    *   When considering all possible ways to connect the 8 field legs from the two 4-point vertices, we find there are only two distinct connected topologies. These are commonly known as the \"Figure-8\" diagram and the \"Sunset\" diagram. Any other combination of contractions results in disconnected diagrams, which are not included in this calculation.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram**: The symmetry factor, S, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group. It represents the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be permuted without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n3.  **Sum the Symmetry Factors**: Finally, we will add the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams together to get the total sum.\n\nNow, let's calculate the symmetry factor for each diagram.\n\n*   **Diagram 1: The \"Figure-8\" Diagram**\n    This diagram consists of two vertices. Each vertex has one propagator loop attached to it, and the two vertices are connected to each other by two separate propagators.\n    The symmetries are:\n    1.  The two vertices are identical and can be swapped: factor of 2.\n    2.  The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical and can be swapped: factor of 2.\n    3.  For each of the two self-loops, the two ends of the propagator are connected to the same vertex. These ends can be interchanged: factor of 2 for each loop, so $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors.\n\n*   **Diagram 2: The \"Sunset\" Diagram**\n    This diagram consists of two vertices connected directly by four identical propagators.\n    The symmetries are:\n    1.  The two vertices are identical and can be swapped: factor of 2.\n    2.  The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical and can be permuted in any way: factor of $4!$ (4-factorial).\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these factors.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the results.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the symmetry factors for the second-order vacuum bubble\n# diagrams in phi^4 theory and sums them.\n\n# --- Diagram 1: Figure-8 Diagram ---\n\n# Description: Two vertices, each with a self-loop, connected by two propagators.\n# Symmetries:\n# 1.
