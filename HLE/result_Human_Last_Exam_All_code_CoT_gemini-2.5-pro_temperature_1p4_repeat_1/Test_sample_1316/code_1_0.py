    print("\nStep 1: Understand the Key Individuals")
    print("-----------------------------------------")
    print("Observation: An unexpected male fly with red eyes and a chromosomal makeup of X0.")
    print("In Drosophila genetics:")
    print("  - Sex is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes.")
    print("  - X0 is a male (sterile).")
    print("  - The allele for red eyes (+) is dominant and X-linked.")
    print("This means the male's genotype is: X+O.")

    print("\nStep 2: Trace the Gametes from the Parents")
    print("-----------------------------------------")
    print("An organism receives one set of chromosomes from each parent's gamete (egg and sperm).")
    print(f"To produce an X+O offspring:")
    print("  - One gamete must have been [X+]")
    print("  - The other gamete must have been [O] (lacking a sex chromosome).")
    print("Conclusion: Since the father provides the red-eye allele (X+), he must have produced a normal [X+] sperm. The mother must have produced the abnormal [O] egg.")

    print("\nStep 3: Identify the Cause of the Abnormal Egg")
    print("----------------------------------------------")
    print("The production of a gamete missing a chromosome is caused by 'non-disjunction' - the failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis.")
    print("Since the abnormal gamete is the egg, the non-disjunction event occurred in the female.")

    print("\nStep 4: Pinpoint the Specific Meiotic Event")
    print("---------------------------------------------")
    print("There are two stages where this can happen in the female:")
    print("  A. Meiosis I Non-disjunction: The two homologous X chromosomes fail to separate. This single event produces abnormal eggs that are either XX or O.")
    print("  B. Meiosis II Non-disjunction: The sister chromatids of one X chromosome fail to separate after a normal Meiosis I. This also produces XX and O eggs.")

    print("\nFinal Analysis:")
    print("-------------")
    print("The formation of the 'O' egg that leads to an X+O son is a direct result of non-disjunction of the X chromosomes in the mother.")
    print("The non-disjunction of the homologous X chromosomes during Meiosis I is the specific event that most fundamentally explains the production of the two types of exceptional gametes (XX and O) that Bridges observed.")

    # The final answer corresponds to choice A.
    final_answer = "A"
    print(f"\nTherefore, the specific event indicated is: Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I.")
