    # Case summary: A 43-year-old man with a new itchy rash on the periphery of his axillae.
    # The onset correlates with wearing new workout clothes.
    # The physical exam findings strongly suggest textile contact dermatitis.
    # The question is to identify the best diagnostic step.

    # Analysis of options:
    # A. Skin biopsy: Too invasive for a first step in this clear-cut case.
    # B. KOH preparation: Tests for fungus; less likely given the rash distribution.
    # C. Topical steroid: This is a treatment, not a diagnostic test.
    # D. Patch test: The gold-standard test to confirm allergic contact dermatitis and identify the specific allergen.

    # The most logical next step to confirm the suspected diagnosis is the Patch test.
    answer_choice = "D"
    explanation = "The patient's history and the rash distribution are highly suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis from clothing. The Patch test is the definitive diagnostic procedure to confirm this diagnosis and identify the specific causative allergen."
