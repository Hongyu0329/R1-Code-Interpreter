    "To find the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3, we first need to understand the definitions.\n\n1.  **Group `G`**: A set of elements with an associative operation (like multiplication or addition), an identity element, and an inverse for every element.\n2.  **Product-free set `S`**: A subset of `G` where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is never an element of `S`. Mathematically, `S ∩ S*S = ∅`, where `S*S = {ab | a ∈ S, b ∈ S}`.\n3.  **Maximal by inclusion**: A product-free set `S` is maximal if it cannot be made any larger. If you add any other element from the group `G` to `S`, the new set is no longer product-free.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct finite groups that have at least one such set of size 3. This is a known classification problem in group theory. While the full proof involves abstract algebra beyond a simple script, we can write a Python program to search for these sets in any given finite group.\n\nThe following Python code implements a search to find all maximal product-free sets of size 3 for a given group. I will demonstrate its use on two small groups: the cyclic group `Z_6` (integers modulo 6 with addition) and the symmetric group `S_3` (permutations of 3 elements). The code will verify that both of these groups contain such sets.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_maximal_product_free_sets_of_size_3(group_name, elements, op):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints all maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 in a given group.\n\n    Args:\n        group_name (str): The name of the group for printing.\n        elements (list): A list of the group's elements.\n        op (function): A function that takes two elements and returns their product.\n    \"\"\"\n    found_sets = []\n    \n    # Generate all subsets of size 3\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(elements, 3):\n        s = set(s_tuple)\n        \n        # 1.
