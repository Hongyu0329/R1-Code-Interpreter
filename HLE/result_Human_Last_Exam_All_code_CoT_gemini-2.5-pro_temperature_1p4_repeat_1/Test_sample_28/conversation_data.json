    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the VC dimension of the given hypothesis class:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Hypothesis Class**: I'll start by understanding the structure of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$. This class consists of all binary classifiers on a domain $X$ of size $T$ that assign the label '1' to exactly $z$ points.\n\n2.  **Handle Edge Cases**: A key constraint is that the number of points labeled '1' must be $z$. If $z > T$, it's impossible to find $z$ points to label '1' in a domain of size $T$. In this case, the hypothesis class is empty. The VC dimension of an empty class is 0.\n\n3.  **Apply the Definition of VC Dimension**: For the main case where $1 \\le z \\le T$, I'll use the definition of the VC dimension, which is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the hypothesis class.\n\n4.  **Derive the Condition for Shattering**: A set of points $S$ of size $d$ is shattered if for any of the $2^d$ possible binary labelings of $S$, there exists a hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ that can produce that labeling. I will analyze what conditions on $d$, $z$, and $T$ must be met for this to be possible.\n    *   Let's consider an arbitrary labeling for a set $S$ of size $d$. Suppose this labeling assigns '1' to $k$ points in $S$ (where $0 \\le k \\le d$).\n    *   For a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ to match this labeling, it must assign '1' to these $k$ points. To satisfy the constraint $| \\{x: h(x)=1\\}| = z$, the hypothesis must assign '1' to an additional $z-k$ points in the complement set $X \\setminus S$.\n    *   The number of points available in $X \\setminus S$ is $T-d$. So, for this to be possible, the number of required ones, $z-k$, must be between 0 and the number of available slots, $T-d$. That is, $0 \\le z-k \\le T-d$.\n    *   This condition must hold for *every* possible labeling of $S$, i.e., for all possible values of $k$ from $0$ to $d$.\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum Size of a Shattered Set**: By analyzing the inequalities from the previous step for the entire range of $k$, I will derive the maximum possible value for $d$.\n    *   The condition $k \\le z$ must hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$. This implies it must hold for the largest $k$, so $d \\le z$.\n    *   The condition $z-k \\le T-d$ (or $d-k \\le T-z$) must also hold for all $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d\\}$. This is most restrictive when $k$ is smallest, i.e., $k=0$. This gives $d \\le T-z$.\n    *   Combining these, any shattered set of size $d$ must satisfy $d \\le \\min(z, T-z)$. This means the VC dimension is at most $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n\n6.  **Prove the Bound is Tight**: I will show that a set of size $d = \\min(z, T-z)$ can indeed be shattered, proving that the VC dimension is exactly this value.\n\n7.  **Construct Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that implements the derived formula. The script will use example values for $z$ and $T$ and print the step-by-step calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_vc_dimension(z, T):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the VC dimension for the hypothesis class H_{z-ones}.\n\n    Args:\n        z (int): The number of points that must be classified as 1.
