# Step 1: Assign the historical Cyrillic numeral values to the letters.
k = 20  # К (Kako)
o_cyrillic = 70 # О (On)
m = 40  # М (Myslete)
a = 1   # А (Az)

# Step 2: Apply the puzzle's visual pun. The letter 'О' is treated as the number 0.
o_puzzle = 0

print(f"   So, for the puzzle's calculation, we use О = {o_puzzle}.")

print("\n3. The final location code is found by applying an alternating sum to the numbers in the order they appear in 'Кома': K - O + M - A.")

# Step 3: Perform the calculation.
