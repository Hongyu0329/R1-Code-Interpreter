    "My plan is to find the smallest positive integer `n` such that a set with `n` elements can be structured as a non-group. While the empty set (`n=0`) is trivially not a group because it lacks an identity element, the standard definition of a group requires a non-empty set, so I will search for `n ≥ 1`.\n\nThe Python script below will solve this by:\n1.  Iterating through `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n2.  For each `n`, generating all possible binary operations for a set of `n` elements. A binary operation can be represented by a Cayley table.\n3.  Checking each operation against the group axioms (associativity, identity, and inverses).\n4.  The first `n` for which a non-group structure is found will be the smallest such positive integer. The script will then print this value and terminate.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_smallest_n_for_non_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest positive integer n for which a set of n elements can have a\n    binary operation defined on it that does NOT form a group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_group(elements, table):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given set and Cayley table form a group.\n        Closure is guaranteed by the table generation method.\n        \"\"\"\n        n = len(elements)\n        # Use a dictionary for faster lookups of element indices\n        element_map = {elem: i for i, elem in enumerate(elements)}\n\n        def operate(a, b):\n            \"\"\"Performs the binary operation using the table.\"\"\"\n            idx_a = element_map[a]\n            idx_b = element_map[b]\n            result_val = table[idx_a][idx_b]\n            return elements[result_val]\n\n        # 1.
