    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the approximate analytical expression for the solution of the given ODE.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE for large y**: The initial conditions, $y(0)=0.00, y'(0)=3.00, y''(0)=2.00$, suggest that the solution $y(x)$ will start growing from $x=0$. I will analyze the ODE under the assumption that $y(x)$ and its derivatives become very large. In this regime, certain terms in the ODE will become dominant. The equation is:\n    $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n    As $y$ becomes large, the terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ will likely dominate the other terms. I will find which of these two is the largest.\n\n2.  **Determine the Asymptotic Form**: By balancing the most dominant terms, I will derive the functional form of the solution $y(x)$ in the large-$x$ regime. This kind of analysis often leads to a solution that has a singularity at a finite point, $x_0$, of the form $y(x) \\approx A(x-x_0)^p$. I will determine the constants $A$ and $p$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Unknown Parameter $x_0$**: The constant $x_0$, which is the location of the singularity, is determined by the specific solution trajectory starting from the initial conditions. This value is generally not obtainable from the asymptotic analysis alone. I will write a Python script to solve the initial value problem numerically. The script will find the value of $x_0$ by detecting when the solution $y(x)$ blows up to infinity.\n\n4.  **Construct the Final Expression**: After finding $x_0$ numerically, I will substitute it back into the analytical form. The constants will be rounded to two decimal places as requested. The Python code will print out the constants of the final equation.\n\n### Asymptotic Analysis\nFor a growing solution, we expect $y^4$ to dominate $y'^4$. The dominant balance in the ODE is therefore $y''' \\approx y^4$.\nAssuming a solution of the form $y(x) = C(x-x_0)^{-1}$ (which corresponds to $p=-1$ and a coefficient change for convenience), we have:\n$y' = -C(x-x_0)^{-2}$\n$y'' = 2C(x-x_0)^{-3}$\n$y''' = -6C(x-x_0)^{-4}$\n\nSubstituting these into the balance equation $y''' \\approx y^4$:\n$-6C(x-x_0)^{-4} \\approx (C(x-x_0)^{-1})^4 = C^4(x-x_0)^{-4}$\n$-6C \\approx C^4$\nSince $C \\neq 0$, we can divide by $C$ to get $C^3 = -6$. This is incorrect, let me re-verify.\n\nLet's assume the form $y(x)=A(x_0-x)^p$:\n$y''' = -p(p-1)(p-2)A(x_0-x)^{p-3}$\n$y^4 = A^4(x_0-x)^{4p}$\nEquating powers: $p-3=4p \\implies p=-1$.\nEquating coefficients: $-(-1)(-2)(-3)A = A^4 \\implies -6A=A^4 \\implies A^3=-6$.\nSo, $y(x) = A(x_0-x)^{-1} = \\frac{A}{x_0-x} = \\frac{-A}{x-x_0}$.\nLet $C = -A = -(-6)^{1/3} = 6^{1/3}$.\nThe form is $y(x) = \\frac{6^{1/3}}{x-x_0}$.\n$C = \\sqrt[3]{6} \\approx 1.817$. Rounded to two decimal places, $C \\approx 1.82$.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python script to find the value of $x_0$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\nimport warnings\n\n# We can ignore warnings about overflow as they are expected when the solution blows up.\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\ndef find_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the approximate analytical expression for the given ODE\n    by numerically calculating the point of singularity, x0.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the system of first-order ODEs\n    # z = [y, y', y'']\n    def ode_system(x, z):\n        y, yp, ypp = z\n        \n        # This term has poles, but the solution is expected to blow up before the first pole.\n        tan_term = 1.0 / (np.tan(x) + 1.0)\n        \n        yppp = y**4 + yp**4 - ypp / (3*x**2 + 2) + tan_term\n        return [yp, ypp, yppp]\n\n    # Initial conditions\n    z0 = [0.00, 3.00, 2.00]\n\n    # Time span for integration.
