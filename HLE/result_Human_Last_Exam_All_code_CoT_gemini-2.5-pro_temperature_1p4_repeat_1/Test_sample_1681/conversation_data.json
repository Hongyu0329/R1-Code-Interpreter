    "In the quantum version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the players' strategies are expanded from simple 'Cooperate' or 'Defect' to a range of unitary operations on an entangled quantum state. We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard model for quantum games.\n\n**1. Initial State:** The game starts with a maximally entangled state created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|00>`. We assume an optimal setup using maximal entanglement.\n\n**2. Player Strategies:** Players A and B choose unitary operators `U_A` and `U_B` to apply to their respective qubits. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are subsets of this new strategy space.\n\n**3. New Equilibrium:** For the given payoff matrix `[[(5,5), (0,7)], [(7,0), (1,1)]]`, the condition for escaping the classical dilemma in the EWL framework is met. This allows for the emergence of a new Nash Equilibrium that resolves the dilemma. This equilibrium occurs when both players choose the quantum strategy, `Q`, often called the \"miracle move\".\n\n**4. Payoff Calculation:** The final state is measured after applying the players' strategies and a disentangling operator `J†`. The expected payoff is calculated based on the probabilities of the four classical outcomes: (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D).\n\nThe following Python code calculates the outcome and payoff for the `(Q, Q)` strategy profile, demonstrating that it leads to the optimal `(Cooperate, Cooperate)` result, thus establishing a new equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
