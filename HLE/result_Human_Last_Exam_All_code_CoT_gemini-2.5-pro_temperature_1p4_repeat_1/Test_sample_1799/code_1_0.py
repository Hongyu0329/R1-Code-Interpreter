    Explains the relationship between the two postulates of special relativity.

This is a very insightful question. The relationship between the two postulates is subtle. While they are deeply connected, the second postulate is not considered superfluous and cannot be derived purely from the first postulate alone. Here’s why:

Argument for "Derivation":

1.  The first postulate states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames.
2.  In the 19th century, James Clerk Maxwell formulated his equations for electricity and magnetism. These were considered fundamental laws of physics.
3.  A key prediction arising directly from Maxwell's equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves that travel at a specific, constant speed in a vacuum, c (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s). The value of c is determined by fundamental constants of the universe (the permittivity and permeability of free space).
4.  If you take the first postulate seriously and apply it to Maxwell's equations, then these equations must look the same for every inertial observer. Consequently, the speed 'c' that the equations predict must also be the same for every inertial observer.
5.  This conclusion is exactly what the second postulate states.

So, it seems that the second postulate is just a logical consequence of applying the first postulate to the laws of electromagnetism.

Why the Second Postulate is NOT Superfluous:

The key issue is that the "derivation" above requires a crucial hidden assumption: that the Principle of Relativity (Postulate 1) applies to electromagnetism and that Maxwell's equations are universally correct as they are. Before Einstein, this was not the accepted view.

Physicists in the late 19th century were faced with a conflict:
-   Classical (Galilean) Relativity: Velocities add up. If you are on a train moving at speed 'v' and throw a ball forward at speed 'u', an observer on the ground sees the ball moving at 'u + v'.
-   Maxwell's Equations: Predict a single, constant speed of light, 'c'.

This conflict led to the theory of the "luminiferous aether" – a hypothetical medium that filled all of space, through which light propagated at speed 'c'. In this view:
-   Maxwell's equations were only perfectly correct in the reference frame of the aether.
-   The Principle of Relativity did NOT apply to electromagnetism.
-   The speed of light would be different for observers moving relative to the aether.

Einstein's revolutionary step was to resolve the conflict differently. Instead of discarding the universality of Maxwell's equations, he discarded the long-held beliefs of Galilean relativity and absolute time. He made a choice:

1.  He TRUSTED the Principle of Relativity and insisted it applied to ALL laws of physics, including electromagnetism.
2.  He therefore had to accept the consequence: the speed of light must be the same for everyone.

By stating the constancy of the speed of light as a second, separate postulate, Einstein made his foundational assumption explicit. It highlights the central, non-intuitive idea that breaks from classical physics. It elevates a result from electromagnetism to a general principle of spacetime itself, making the theory of relativity more fundamental and independent of the ultimate correctness of Maxwell's equations.

Conclusion:
The second postulate is not logically derivable from the first in a vacuum. It requires the additional physical assumption that Maxwell's equations are correct and subject to the first postulate. Einstein stated it separately to emphasize the radical departure from classical intuition and to establish a firm, independent foundation for his new theory of spacetime. Therefore, the statement that it is superfluous is considered false.
