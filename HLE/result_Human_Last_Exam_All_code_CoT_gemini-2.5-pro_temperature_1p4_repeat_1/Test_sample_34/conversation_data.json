    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The request is to find the \"worst\" suited Jack (a hand like JXs) to open-raise from the button in a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game.\n2.  **Consult GTO Strategy:** This question is about poker strategy, so the answer must be based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop charts. These charts are generated by powerful solvers and represent a theoretically sound approach to the game.\n3.  **Key Factors:**\n    *   **Position:** The button is the latest and most powerful pre-flop position, which means we can profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n    *   **Rake-Free:** The absence of rake increases the value of stealing the blinds, making it correct to open-raise with an even wider range of hands than in a standard, raked game.\n    *   **Hand Type (Suited Jacks):** Suited hands have enhanced playability, as they can make flushes. Suited connectors and gappers can also make straights.\n4.  **Determine the Range:** Based on modern GTO solvers for this specific scenario (100BB, Button open, Rake-Free), the opening range is extremely wide. It includes all suited aces, suited kings, suited queens, and all suited jacks. The hands are ranked by their expected value (EV), and the \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest EV that is still a profitable raise.\n5.  **Identify the Worst Hand:** Within the suited Jack category, the hand strength decreases as the kicker (the second card) gets lower. Therefore, the list of playable suited Jacks, from best to worst, is JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. The worst among these is J2s.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this logic. The script will define the GTO-approved list of suited jacks to open from the button and then programmatically identify and print the worst one from that list.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on GTO poker principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In a 100BB rake-free cash game, GTO strategy advises opening an extremely\n    # wide range from the button to capitalize on position and steal the blinds.\n    # This range includes all suited Jack combinations due to their post-flop playability.\n    # The hands are ranked by the value of their kicker.\n    \n    # Suited Jack hands considered standard opens from the button, ordered from strongest to weakest kicker.\n    # Note: AJs, KJs, QJs are much stronger and are omitted as the question implies J-high hands.\n    gto_approved_jacks_suited = [\"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    # The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest EV, which is the last in this ordered list.\n    worst_hand_to_open = gto_approved_jacks_suited[-1]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the suited Jack opening range from the button in a 100BB rake-free game:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The set of standard JX-suited opens includes: {', '.join(gto_approved_jacks_suited)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe worst hand in this range (the one with the lowest kicker that is still a profitable open) is:\")\n    \n    # To satisfy the 'output each number in the final equation' requirement, we print the components.\n    hand_components = list(worst_hand_to_open)\n    print(f\"Hand: {hand_components[0]}{hand_components[1]}{hand_components[2]}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
