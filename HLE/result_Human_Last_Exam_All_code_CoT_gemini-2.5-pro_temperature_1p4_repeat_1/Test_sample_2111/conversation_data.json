    "This is a knowledge-based question related to the historian Fernand Braudel. My plan is to identify the specific quote and the conceptual entity mentioned. I will then create a Python script that programmatically stores the context of the quote and prints the final answer.\n\nThe quote is from Fernand Braudel's work, where he cites the author Paul Morand. The assertion is that to be properly understood, a particular concept must be viewed in a global context, symbolized by a sphere. The entity in question is \"every great policy\". The script will define the context and print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_braudel_quote_entity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the conceptual entity from a quote by Paul Morand,\n    cited by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Context of the quote\n    historian = \"Fernand Braudel\"\n    quoted_author = \"Paul Morand\"\n    metaphorical_shape = \"a sphere\"\n    example_given = \"the symbol of a nation\"\n    \n    # Paul Morand's original term was \"politique,\" which in this context\n    # refers to a grand strategy or course of action.\n    # The English translation of the quote states that this entity\n    # should be inscribed within the metaphorical sphere.\n    conceptual_entity = \"every great policy\"\n\n    print(f\"Historian Fernand Braudel quoted Paul Morand's assertion that a specific conceptual entity should be inscribed within {metaphorical_shape}.\")\n    print(f\"This entity, exemplified by things like the policies of a nation, is: '{conceptual_entity}'.\")\n\nfind_braudel_quote_entity()\n```\n<<<Every great policy>>>"
