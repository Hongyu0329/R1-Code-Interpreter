    "To identify the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Fetch Data**: I will programmatically download the complete adult hermaphrodite connectome data from the Witvliet et al. (2021) dataset, available at `wormwiring.org`. This dataset provides a comprehensive list of all synaptic connections.\n2.  **Filter Synapses**: I will filter the data to isolate only the chemical synapses originating from the presynaptic ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n3.  **Group Targets**: Since many neurons exist as left/right pairs (e.g., AIAL/AIAR), it is most informative to group them by their class (e.g., AIA). I will normalize the names of the postsynaptic target cells by removing the 'L' or 'R' suffix.\n4.  **Calculate and Identify**: I will sum the synapse counts for each target neuron class to find which class receives the most synaptic input from ASJ.\n5.  **Display Results**: The script will print the name of the main target neuron class and provide a detailed breakdown of the synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR that contribute to the total.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef get_neuron_class(name):\n    \"\"\"Removes a terminal 'L' or 'R' from a neuron name to get its class.\"\"\"\n    if isinstance(name, str):\n        if name.endswith('L') or name.endswith('R'):\n            # Check if the character before L/R is a letter to avoid changing names like 'CANL' to 'CAN' if 'CAN' is a different cell.\n            # In C. elegans nomenclature, this is generally safe.\n            return name[:-1]\n    return name\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main projection target of ASJ axons by synapse number\n    in the C. elegans connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    # URL for the connectome data from Witvliet et al., 2021\n    url = \"https://wormwiring.org/db/latest/all_connections.csv\"\n    print(\"Fetching C. elegans connectome data...\")\n\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n\n        # Load the data into a pandas DataFrame\n        col_names = ['pre', 'post', 'type', 'N', 'neurotransmitter']\n        df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text), header=0, names=col_names)\n\n        # Filter for chemical synapses (type 'S') from ASJ neurons ('ASJL', 'ASJR')\n        asj_neurons = ['ASJL', 'ASJR']\n        asj_outputs = df[(df['pre'].isin(asj_neurons)) & (df['type'] == 'S')].copy()\n\n        if asj_outputs.empty:\n            print(\"No synaptic outputs found for ASJ neurons.\")\n            return\n\n        # Create a new column for the postsynaptic neuron class\n        asj_outputs['post_class'] = asj_outputs['post'].apply(get_neuron_class)\n\n        # Group by the postsynaptic neuron class and sum the number of synapses\n        class_synapse_counts = asj_outputs.groupby('post_class')['N'].sum()\n\n        # Find the class with the maximum number of synapses\n        main_target_class = class_synapse_counts.idxmax()\n        total_synapses = class_synapse_counts.max()\n\n        # Get the detailed connections to the main target class\n        main_target_details = asj_outputs[asj_outputs['post_class'] == main_target_class]\n        \n        # Get synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR to their respective partners in the target class\n        synapses_from_asjl = main_target_details[main_target_details['pre'] == 'ASJL']['N'].sum()\n        synapses_from_asjr = main_target_details[main_target_details['pre'] == 'ASJR']['N'].sum()\n        \n        # Print the final result and the equation\n        print(\"\\n--- Analysis Complete ---\")\n        print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the {main_target_class} neuron class.\")\n        print(\"The total number of synapses is calculated as follows:\")\n        print(f\"Synapses from ASJL to {main_target_class}L: {synapses_from_asjl}\")\n        print(f\"Synapses from ASJR to {main_target_class}R: {synapses_from_asjr}\")\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"{synapses_from_asjl} + {synapses_from_asjr} = {total_synapses}\")\n\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to retrieve data from {url}.
