    Solves the set theory problem about semidistributivity.

    The problem asks for the largest cardinal `μ` such that any forcing `P`
    with density `d(P) = κ` is necessarily `(μ, κ⁺)`-semidistributive.

        kappa_str: A string representing the cardinal κ, e.g., 'aleph_0'.

    # The reasoning is as follows:
    # 1. We are given a forcing notion P with density d(P) = κ.
    # 2. We are looking for the largest μ such that P is necessarily (μ, κ⁺)-semidistributive.
    # 3. A theorem by Apter & Sargsyan states that if λ is a regular cardinal and d(P) < λ,
    #    then P is (δ, λ)-semidistributive for every cardinal δ < λ.
    # 4. In our case, λ = κ⁺ is a regular cardinal, and d(P) = κ < κ⁺.
    # 5. Thus, the theorem applies. P is necessarily (δ, κ⁺)-semidistributive for all δ < κ⁺.
    # 6. This means we can choose δ = κ, so μ = κ is a valid solution.
    # 7. To show it's the largest, we must demonstrate that μ cannot be κ⁺. There exist
    #    forcing notions P with d(P) = κ that are NOT (κ⁺, κ⁺)-semidistributive.
    #    For instance, Shelah constructed a c.c.c. forcing (d(P)=ℵ₀) that adds a set
    #    X of size ℵ₁ such that any ground model subset of X is countable.
    #    This serves as a counterexample for μ > κ.
    # 8. Therefore, the largest such μ is κ itself.
