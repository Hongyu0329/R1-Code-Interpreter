# Step 1: Define the constants
sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
lambda2 = (1 - sqrt5) / 2
t = 10 * math.log(10) # This is ln(10^10)

# Step 2: Calculate the components of the final expression
# Based on our analysis, the expression simplifies to (2/sqrt(5)) * exp(lambda2 * t)
term1 = 2 / sqrt5
term2 = math.exp(lambda2 * t)
final_value = term1 * term2

# Step 3: Print the numbers in the final equation and the result
