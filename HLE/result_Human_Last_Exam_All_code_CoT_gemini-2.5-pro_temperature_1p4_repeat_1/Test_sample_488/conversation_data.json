    "The user wants me to identify the type of conceptual metaphor expressed by the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the phrase**: \"my love for humanity\". This phrase talks about \"love,\" which is an abstract concept (an emotion), as if it were a concrete object or substance. You can possess it (\"my love\") and direct it (\"for humanity\").\n\n2.  **Review the types of metaphors from Lakoff and Johnson**:\n    *   **Structural Metaphor**: Understanding one concept in terms of another. For example, ARGUMENT IS WAR. This involves mapping the structure of war (attacking, defending, winning) onto the concept of argument.\n    *   **Orientational Metaphor**: Organizing concepts spatially (up/down, in/out). For example, HAPPY IS UP; SAD IS DOWN.\n    *   **Ontological Metaphor**: Understanding experiences, emotions, and ideas as entities, substances, or containers. For example, treating INFLATION as an entity we can fight.\n\n3.  **Apply the categories to the phrase**:\n    *   The phrase treats \"love\" as a substance or a possession. This is a form of ontological metaphor because it gives a non-physical concept (love) the characteristics of a physical object (ontology = the study of being/existence).\n    *   However, by treating love as a possession (\"my love\"), we are also imposing the *structure* of ownership onto the concept of love. We are using the well-understood concept of POSSESSION to structure our understanding of the abstract concept of LOVE. This allows us to talk about \"having\" love, \"giving\" love, etc. This is the definition of a **structural metaphor**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the options**:\n    *   A. Conceptual metaphor: Too general; it's the overarching category.\n    *   B. Physical metaphor: Not a standard term in Lakoff and Johnson's framework.\n    *   C. Orientational metaphor: The phrase does not relate to spatial orientation like up/down or in/out.\n    *   D. Structural metaphor: This fits well. The concept of LOVE is being structured in terms of the concept of a POSSESSABLE SUBSTANCE.\n    *   E. Intentional metaphor: Not a standard term in this context.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: The phrase \"my love for humanity\" structures the abstract concept of love in terms of a possessable substance. This is a classic example of a structural metaphor.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_metaphor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conceptual metaphor in the phrase \"my love for humanity\".\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the conceptual metaphor in the phrase: \\\"{phrase}\\\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Explanation based on Lakoff and Johnson's theory of conceptual metaphors.\n    print(\"Step 1: The phrase treats 'love', an abstract emotion, as a tangible thing.\")\n    print(\"This is evident from the possessive 'my', which implies love is a possession or a substance one can have.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: We must identify which category of metaphor this falls into.\")\n    print(\"An Orientational Metaphor relates to spatial orientation (e.g., up/down), which doesn't apply here.\")\n    print(\"An Ontological Metaphor treats an abstraction as a physical entity.
