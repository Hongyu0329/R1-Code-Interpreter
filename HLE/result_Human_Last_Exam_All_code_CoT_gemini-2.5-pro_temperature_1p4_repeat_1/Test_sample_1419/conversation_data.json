    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the Context**: We will work with the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter. The behavior of the theory at different energy scales is described by the Renormalization Group (RG).\n2.  **State the Beta Function**: The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, $\\beta(u)$, which describes how the dimensionless coupling constant $u$ changes with the energy scale. For $\\phi^4$ theory, the one-loop beta function is given by:\n    $\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3 u^2}{16 \\pi^2}$\n3.  **Apply the Fixed Point Condition**: A fixed point, denoted by $u^*$, is a value of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant, meaning the beta function is zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n4.  **Solve for the Fixed Point**: We will solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ to find the expression for the non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n5.  **Generate the Code**: A Python script will be provided to print out the derivation and the final expression for $u^*$ in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and derives the leading order expression for the\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling u*\")\n    print(\"=\" * 55)\n    \n    # Step 1: State the Beta Function\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling u in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions is:\")\n    print(\"  beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 * u^2) / (16 * pi^2)\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply the Fixed Point Condition\n    print(\"Step 2: A fixed point u* is a value where the coupling does not change with scale, i.e., beta(u*) = 0.\")\n    print(\"  -epsilon * u* + (3 * (u*)^2) / (16 * pi^2) = 0\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Solve for the fixed point\n    print(\"Step 3: We factor out u* to find the solutions.\")\n    print(\"  u* * [-epsilon + (3 * u*) / (16 * pi^2)] = 0\\n\")\n    print(\"This gives two possible solutions:\")\n    print(\"  1.
