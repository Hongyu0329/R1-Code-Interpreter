    print("Step 1: Understand the core ecological driver.")
    print("The 'information arms-race' between plants and their parasites (herbivores, pathogens) is a key driver of chemical diversity.")
    print("This arms-race is known to be more intense in the tropics (low latitudes) than in temperate zones (high latitudes) due to a more stable climate and higher species diversity, leading to stronger, more specialized interactions.\n")

    print("Step 2: Predict the effect of latitude on α-diversity (within-plant VOC diversity).")
    print("In the tropics (low latitude), high parasite pressure selects for individual plants with a more complex and diverse chemical arsenal to defend against a wider array of specialized enemies. A higher diversity of compounds makes a plant more difficult to consume.")
    print("In temperate regions (high latitude), lower parasite pressure means less selection for such high chemical complexity within a single plant.")
    print("Therefore, as latitude increases (from 0 to 60 degrees), α-diversity is expected to decrease. This represents a NEGATIVE effect.\n")

    print("Step 3: Predict the effect of latitude on β-diversity (between-plant VOC diversity at a site).")
    print("In the tropics, where specialized herbivores are abundant, there is a strong advantage for a plant to be chemically different from its neighbors. This is a form of 'chemical camouflage' against specialist enemies adapted to the most common plant chemistry.")
    print("This selective pressure promotes high chemical variation among individuals in the community, leading to high β-diversity.")
    print("In temperate regions, with weaker specialist pressure, this advantage is reduced, likely resulting in more chemically uniform plant communities (lower β-diversity).")
    print("Therefore, as latitude increases, β-diversity is also expected to decrease. This also represents a NEGATIVE effect.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print("Both within-plant (α) and between-plant (β) VOC diversity are expected to be highest in the tropics and decrease towards the poles.")
    print("This means there is a negative relationship between latitude and both diversity metrics.")
    print("The direction of effect for α-diversity is negative, and the direction of effect for β-diversity is negative.")
