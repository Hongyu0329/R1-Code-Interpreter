    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will analyze the training methodologies of each ballet school listed, specifically focusing on their approach to pointe work during barre exercises.\n2.  The Vaganova (Russia), Royal Ballet (English), and La Scala (Italian) methods traditionally emphasize building foundational strength in soft shoes at the barre before progressing to extensive pointe work.\n3.  The School of American Ballet, which teaches the Balanchine method, is distinct in this regard. The Balanchine technique requires exceptional speed, agility, and footwork, for which George Balanchine advocated for training at the barre on pointe to build the necessary strength and articulation directly.\n4.  Based on this analysis, I will write a Python script that will print out the reasoning and identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes training methods of different ballet schools to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala',\n            'method': 'Primarily the Italian Cecchetti method.
