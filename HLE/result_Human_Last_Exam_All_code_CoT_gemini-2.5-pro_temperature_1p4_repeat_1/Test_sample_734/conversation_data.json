    "The Christian theologian who first developed a sophisticated framework with specialized terminology to account for such events is **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD).\n\nIn his work, particularly in *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad Litteram*), Augustine introduced the concept of **_rationes seminales_** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\").\n\nHis plan was as follows:\n1.  **Initial Creation:** Augustine argued that in the initial six days of creation, God did not create everything in its final, mature form. Instead, He embedded these \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentials into the fabric of the created world.\n2.  **Ordinary Providence:** These seminal reasons would then unfold over time according to the natural laws and processes God ordained. This is how the world normally operates. For example, an acorn grows into an oak tree because the seminal reason for the oak is within the acorn.\n3.  **Miracles and Novel Events:** Miracles, such as the virgin birth, were not violations of the natural order God created. Instead, they were the actualization of potentials (*rationes seminales*) that God had placed in creation from the beginning but which lay outside the *ordinary* course of nature. Thus, the virgin birth was not contrary to nature itself, but contrary to the *known course* of nature. God was simply activating a potential He had always intended.\n4.  **The Fall:** Likewise, the changes to the natural world after the Fall (e.g., death, toil, thorns and thistles) could be explained as the activation of negative potentials that were also embedded in creation, triggered by human sin. This altered the way the natural order unfolded from its originally intended paradisical state.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to affirm both an orderly, law-governed universe and God's ability to perform miracles and enact historical changes without being arbitrary or \"breaking\" His own laws.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
