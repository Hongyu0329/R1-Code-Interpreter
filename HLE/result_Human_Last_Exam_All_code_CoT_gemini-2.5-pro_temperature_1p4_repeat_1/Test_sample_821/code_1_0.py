    This script explains the reasoning to find the largest possible value of d.

    Let the interval be [0, d].
    For any n, the points {0, a_1, ..., a_n, d} partition the interval.
    Let the sorted points be y_0, y_1, ..., y_k, where y_0=0 and y_k=d.
    The number of segments, k, is at most n+1.
    The length of each segment, l_i = y_i - y_{i-1}, must be at most 1/n.

    The total length d is the sum of the lengths of the segments:
    d = sum(l_i for i=1 to k)

    Using the condition l_i <= 1/n, we can establish an upper bound for d:
    d <= sum(1/n for i=1 to k) = k/n

    Since the number of segments k is at most n+1, we have:
    d <= (n+1)/n = 1 + 1/n

    This inequality must hold for all n >= 1.
    Let's check this bound for a few values of n.
