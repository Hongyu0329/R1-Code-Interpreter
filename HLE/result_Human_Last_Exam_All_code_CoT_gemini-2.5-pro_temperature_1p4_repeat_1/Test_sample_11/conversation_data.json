    "This is a legal history question rather than a coding task. I will find the name of the statute and then use a Python script to print the answer as you've requested.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Research the legal history of the State of Israel to identify the first statute that formally and explicitly introduced the principle of \"good faith\" (תום לב) as a general duty.\n2.  The most prominent and widely cited statute for this is the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, specifically sections 12 and 39. This law is considered a cornerstone of modern Israeli civil law for establishing this overarching principle.\n3.  I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this law, omitting \"the\" and the year as instructed.\n\n```python\ndef get_israeli_statute():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the first statute in the modern State of Israel\n    to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a general principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The statute is the Contracts (General Part) Law from 1973.\n    # The user requested the name without \"the\" or the year.\n    statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n    print(statute_name)\n\nget_israeli_statute()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
