    Identifies and returns the line numbers with errors in the triangle.py file.
    Based on the analysis, the errors are:
    1. Line 11: The `^` operator is used for Python integers, which performs a bitwise XOR instead of the intended exponentiation. `**` should be used.
    2. Lines 22 & 23: The `/` operator is used for division between Python integers, which results in floating-point division. This violates the requirement for precise, non-floating point arithmetic.
    3. Lines 29, 30, & 31: The `^` operator is used on a SageMath object within a standard Python module. This is not a defined operation and will raise a TypeError, crashing the method. `**` should be used.
