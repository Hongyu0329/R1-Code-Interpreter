    # correspondence between the eigenstates of H0 and H1.
    # This means m0(E) = m1(E) for E != -alpha, where m(E) is the
    # multiplicity of the eigenvalue E.

    # The only energy where the spectra can differ is E = -alpha.
    # This occurs if there is a state psi such that L(psi) = 0 or L_plus(psi) = 0.
    
    # Let's consider the number of states for H0 at E = -alpha.

    # that satisfy the boundary conditions.

    # Let's consider the number of states for H1 at E = -alpha.

    # The spectra can differ only at this single energy level.
    # The number of differing levels is the number of energy values E
