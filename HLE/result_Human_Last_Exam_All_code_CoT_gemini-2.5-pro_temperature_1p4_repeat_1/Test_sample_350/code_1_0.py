    # The question asks for the two key historic figures Pannenberg draws on for his
    # argument for a model of cosmic history built upon a contingent concept of time.

    # Step 1: Analyze the first part of the argument: "Cosmic History"
    # Pannenberg's concept of history as the locus of God's self-revelation is
    # a critical dialogue with the German Idealist philosopher Georg Hegel.
    influence_1 = "Georg Hegel"
    reasoning_1 = f"1. {influence_1}: Pannenberg adopts and modifies Hegel's foundational idea that history is the sphere of divine self-revelation. He expands this from human history to 'cosmic history'."

    # Step 2: Analyze the second part of the argument: "Contingent Concept of Time"
    # To avoid the determinism found in Hegel's system, Pannenberg incorporated ideas
    # of contingency and freedom from another German Idealist, Friedrich Schelling.
    influence_2 = "Friedrich Schelling"
    reasoning_2 = f"2. {influence_2}: Pannenberg draws on Schelling's philosophy of freedom and contingency to argue for an open future. This allows him to develop his concept of time where the future (the eschaton) retroactively determines the meaning of the past and present."
