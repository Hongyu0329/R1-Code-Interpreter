    print("  - Evaluation: CA moves from a high-raffinose host (watermelon) to a low-raffinose host (cotton). Less substrate (raffinose) logically leads to lower activity of its enzyme (galactosidase). This is likely TRUE.")

    print("\nStatement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Evaluation: This gives a different reason for the outcome in C. The problem's context is about sucrose vs. raffinose metabolism. The most direct cause for a change in galactosidase activity is the amount of its substrate (raffinose), not glucose. This reasoning is not supported by the text. This is likely NOT TRUE.")
