    This function solves the user's question about a tower of subsets of omega_2.

    The problem asks for the second smallest possible cardinal `delta` that can be the length of a special type of "tower".
    A tower is a sequence of omega_2-sized subsets of omega_2, <x_alpha : alpha in delta>, such that for alpha < beta,
    the size of the set difference |x_beta \ x_alpha| is less than omega_2.
    Furthermore, the tower is "unbounded", meaning there is no single omega_2-sized set `y` that is "above" all sets in the tower
    in the sense that |y \ x_alpha| is less than omega_2 for all alpha.

    Here is the step-by-step solution:

    1.  The smallest possible length of such a tower.
        Let's call the minimal length delta_0. We can prove from the axioms of set theory (ZFC) that delta_0 must be at least omega_2.
        The proof relies on the fact that omega_2 is a regular cardinal. For any tower with length delta < omega_2, one can construct
        an upper bound by taking the union of all sets in the tower. This shows that any such short tower cannot be unbounded.
        So, in any model of set theory, the length of such a tower must be at least omega_2.
        It is also known to be consistent with ZFC that towers of length omega_2 exist. Therefore, the smallest possible value for delta is omega_2.

    2.  Finding the second smallest possible length.
        The word "possible" means we consider all values the cardinal delta can take in any valid model of set theory.
        We have established that the smallest possible value is omega_2.
        Now, let's determine the next possible value.

        In any given model of set theory, if the minimum tower length is delta_0 (which we know is at least omega_2), then the set of all possible tower lengths `delta` is given by the condition that the cofinality of `delta`, cf(delta), is at least delta_0.

        Let's consider a model where the minimum length is its smallest possible value, i.e., delta_0 = omega_2.
        In this model, the possible lengths are all cardinals `delta` such that cf(delta) >= omega_2.

        - The smallest cardinal `delta` satisfying this is omega_2 itself (since omega_2 is regular, cf(omega_2) = omega_2).
        - The second smallest cardinal `delta` must be greater than omega_2. The smallest cardinal number greater than omega_2 is its successor cardinal, omega_3.
        - The cardinal omega_3 is regular, so cf(omega_3) = omega_3, which is greater than omega_2.
        - Therefore, omega_3 is a possible length for a tower in this model.

    Since there are no cardinal numbers between omega_2 and omega_3, the second smallest possible length for such a tower is omega_3.

    The final answer is the cardinal omega_3. We represent the cardinals omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, ... by their indices 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
