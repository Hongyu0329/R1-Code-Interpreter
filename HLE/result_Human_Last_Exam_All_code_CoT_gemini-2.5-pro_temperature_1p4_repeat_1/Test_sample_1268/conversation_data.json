    "This problem can be solved by applying a fundamental result from the geometry of numbers, namely Minkowski's theorem, to the lattices derived from quadratic number fields.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Context:** The mention of \"squarefree natural numbers (N)\" and \"covolume (V)\" points towards the study of ideal lattices in number theory. Specifically, for a squarefree integer $N$, we consider the real quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. The ring of integers of this field, $\\mathcal{O}_K$, forms a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the Minkowski embedding.\n2.  **Clarify Terminology:** The term \"maximum norm\" ($k_{k,\\infty}$) is ambiguous, as lattice vectors can have arbitrarily large norms. A standard and logical interpretation in this context is that it refers to an upper bound on the infinity norm of the *shortest non-zero vector* in the lattice, denoted $\\lambda_{1, \\infty}$.\n3.  **Apply Minkowski's Theorem:** Minkowski's first theorem provides a relationship between the covolume (volume of the fundamental parallelepiped) of a lattice and the length of its shortest non-zero vector. For a lattice $\\Lambda$ of dimension $n$ and covolume $V$, the theorem guarantees the existence of a non-zero vector $v \\in \\Lambda$ such that its infinity norm $\\|v\\|_{\\infty}$ is bounded by:\n    $\\|v\\|_{\\infty} \\le V^{1/n}$\n4.  **Determine the Parameters:** The lattice formed by the ring of integers of $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ is a 2-dimensional lattice, so $n=2$.\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:** By substituting $n=2$ into Minkowski's inequality, we get the upper bound for the shortest vector's infinity norm in terms of the covolume $V$:\n    $k_{k,\\infty} \\le V^{1/2}$\n\nThe Python code below will formally print this derived relationship, showing each number in the equation.\n\n```python\ndef print_norm_covolume_relation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the upper bound on the maximum norm (k_k,inf)\n    in relation to the covolume (V) for lattices from squarefree integers.\n\n    This relationship is derived from Minkowski's theorem applied to\n    2-dimensional lattices from real quadratic number fields.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the formula\n    norm_variable = \"k_{k,inf}\"\n    covolume_variable = \"V\"\n    exponent_numerator = 1\n    exponent_denominator = 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the formula\n    print(\"Based on Minkowski's theorem for a 2-dimensional lattice, the upper bound is derived.\")\n    print(\"The formula relating the maximum norm and the covolume is:\")\n    \n    # Output the final equation with each number explicitly shown\n    print(f\"{norm_variable} <= {covolume_variable}^({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator})\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nprint_norm_covolume_relation()\n```\n<<<V^(1/2)>>>"
