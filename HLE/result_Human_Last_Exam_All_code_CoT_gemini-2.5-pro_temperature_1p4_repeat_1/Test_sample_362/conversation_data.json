    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a breakdown of the chemical reaction and the Python code to detail the results.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The problem specifies a \"Wittig reaction,\" which is a well-known method in organic chemistry for synthesizing alkenes (compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds).\n\n2.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Carbonyl Compound:** Pivalaldehyde (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal). Its structure contains a tert-butyl group `(CH₃)₃C-` attached to an aldehyde group `-CHO`. The key reactive site is the carbon-oxygen double bond (C=O).\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. Its structure is `(C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. The key reactive site is the phosphorus-carbon double bond (P=C).\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism:** In a Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group of the ylide are eliminated and swap places. The carbonyl carbon atom from the aldehyde forms a new double bond with the ylidic carbon atom from the Wittig reagent.\n\n    *   `R₂C=O` (from aldehyde) + `Ph₃P=CR'₂` (from ylide) → `R₂C=CR'₂` (new alkene) + `Ph₃P=O` (triphenylphosphine oxide byproduct)\n\n4.  **Construct the Products:**\n    *   The `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of pivalaldehyde combines with the `=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)` part of the ylide.\n    *   **Main Product (Alkene):** This results in the structure `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)`. The systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n    *   **Byproduct:** The remaining parts, `Ph₃P` and `O`, combine to form **triphenylphosphine oxide**, `(C₆H₅)₃P=O`.\n\n5.  **Determine Chemical Formulas and Write the Equation:** To fulfill the request to output numbers from the equation, I will first determine the chemical formula for each compound.\n    *   Pivalaldehyde: C₅H₁₀O\n    *   Wittig Reagent: C₂₆H₂₂ClP\n    *   Alkene Product: C₁₃H₁₇Cl\n    *   Triphenylphosphine Oxide: C₁₈H₁₅PO\n\n    The balanced chemical equation is:\n    C₅H₁₀O + C₂₆H₂₂ClP → C₁₃H₁₇Cl + C₁₈H₁₅PO\n\n6.  **Plan the Python Code:** The code will store this balanced equation as a string. It will then print the names of the products and the full equation. Finally, it will use regular expressions to find and print all the numerical values present in the formula string as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef wittig_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the products of the specified Wittig reaction,\n    prints the reaction equation, and extracts all numbers from the chemical formulas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reactant names and formulas\n    aldehyde_name = \"Pivalaldehyde\"\n    aldehyde_formula = \"C5H10O\"\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    ylide_formula = \"C26H22ClP\"\n\n    # Product names and formulas\n    alkene_product_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    alkene_product_formula = \"C13H17Cl\"\n    byproduct_name = \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n    byproduct_formula = \"C18H15PO\"\n\n    # Print the product names\n    print(f\"The Wittig reaction produces two compounds:\")\n    print(f\"1.
