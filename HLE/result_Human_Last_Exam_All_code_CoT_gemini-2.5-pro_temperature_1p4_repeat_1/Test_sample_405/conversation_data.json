    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the main, distinct allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  List the characteristic color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  Count the number of unique colors found.\n4.  Write a Python script to present this information and print the count as a simple addition equation, as requested. The script will store the allotropes and their colors, count them, and then format the output.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of the main allotropes of phosphorus\n    and calculates the total number of distinct colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the main allotropes and their distinct colors.\n    # While white phosphorus turns yellow on exposure to light, it represents one color type.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White (or Yellow) Phosphorus\": 1,\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": 1,\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": 1,\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The main allotropes of phosphorus exhibit the following colors:\")\n    for color in allotropes.keys():\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of unique colors.\n    num_colors = len(allotropes)\n    \n    # Step 4: Create and print the equation as requested.\n    # We create a list of '1's, one for each color.\n    summands = ['1'] * num_colors\n    \n    # We join the '1's with a '+' sign to form the left side of the equation.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(summands)\n\n    print(\"\\nCounting each distinct color, the total is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
