    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`). The residues at the hydrophobic core positions, `a` and `d`, are the primary determinants of oligomerization due to \"knobs-into-holes\" packing efficiency. Different oligomeric states (dimers, trimers, tetramers) have different packing requirements for the size of the amino acid side chains at these positions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat Register:** We'll test all seven possible alignments (phases) of the heptad repeat on the sequence. For each phase, we will calculate a \"hydrophobic score\" by summing the hydrophobicity (using the Kyte-Doolittle scale) of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions. The phase with the highest score is the most likely correct register.\n2.  **Analyze the Core Residue Pattern:** Once we identify the most likely phase(s), we will examine the specific amino acids found at the `a` and `d` positions.\n    *   **Trimers (3-mer):** These typically have a small residue (like Alanine) at the `a` position and a larger bulky hydrophobic residue (like Leucine or Isoleucine) at the `d` position. This `a=small, d=large` pattern allows for very efficient and tight core packing.\n    *   **Dimers (2-mer):** These are more accommodating and often feature large hydrophobic residues at both the `a` and `d` positions (e.g., Leucine or Isoleucine).\n3.  **Conclude the Oligomeric State:** Based on the identified pattern of core residues, we will determine the most probable oligomeric state that satisfies the principles of packing efficiency.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence by analyzing its heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    kyte_doolittle = {\n        'A': 1.8, 'C': 2.5, 'D': -3.5, 'E': -3.5, 'F': 2.8, 'G': -0.4, 'H': -3.2,\n        'I': 4.5, 'K': -3.9, 'L': 3.8, 'M': 1.9, 'N': -3.5, 'P': -1.6, 'Q': -3.5,\n        'R': -4.5, 'S': -0.8, 'T': -0.7, 'V': 4.2, 'W': -0.9, 'Y': -1.3\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    best_phases = []\n    max_score = -float('inf')\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat Register\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Identifying Heptad Repeat Register by Hydrophobicity Score ---\")\n    phase_scores = {}\n    for phase_start in range(7):\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        a_indices = []\n        d_indices = []\n        \n        # Get 'a' position residues\n        for i in range(phase_start, len(sequence), 7):\n            a_residues.append(sequence[i])\n            a_indices.append(i)\n        \n        # Get 'd' position residues (d is a+3)\n        for i in range(phase_start + 3, len(sequence), 7):\n            d_residues.append(sequence[i])\n            d_indices.append(i)\n\n        if not a_residues and not d_residues:\n            continue\n\n        a_score = sum(kyte_doolittle.get(r, 0) for r in a_residues)\n        d_score = sum(kyte_doolittle.get(r, 0) for r in d_residues)\n        total_score = a_score + d_score\n        phase_scores[phase_start] = total_score\n        \n        print(f\"Phase {phase_start} (starts with '{sequence[phase_start]}'): a={a_residues}, d={d_residues}.
