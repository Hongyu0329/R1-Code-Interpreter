def solve_curve_ratio_problem():
    """
    Solves the theoretical problem about the ratio of points on a curve.

    The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of two sets of points on a curve C:
    1. Numerator: Irreducible degree d points belonging to a specific linear series (g^r_d).
    2. Denominator: All irreducible degree d points on the curve.

    Let's denote the quantities from the problem statement:
    - C: A nice curve over a number field k.
    - d: The degree of the points/divisors.
    - G: The Galois group Gal(k(C)/k(P^1)) associated with a map defining a g^1_d.
    - |G|: The order of the Galois group G.

    A naive analysis might suggest the ratio is 0 when the Jacobian's rank is positive,
    as the numerator points are restricted to a single linear series out of infinitely many.

    However, this is a known result in arithmetic statistics. The distribution of
    these points is not uniform but is structured by the arithmetic of the curve.
    The theorem states that the fraction of such points that come from the specific
    linear series is determined by the order of the associated Galois group G.

    The ratio approaches 1/|G|.

    # We represent the order of the Galois group G symbolically.
    G_order = sympy.Symbol("|G|")

    # The final equation for the ratio
    # The variable `one` represents the numerator in the final fraction.
    one = 1
