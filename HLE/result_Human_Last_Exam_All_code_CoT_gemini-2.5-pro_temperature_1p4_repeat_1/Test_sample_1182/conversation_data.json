    "My approach to solving this problem is to use an algorithm that computes the stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve. This is a standard procedure in arithmetic geometry, often referred to as Liu's algorithm, which generalizes Tate's algorithm for elliptic curves.\n\nThe overall plan is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Curve**: The curve is given by the equation $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. We will represent the polynomial $f(x)$ by its list of integer coefficients.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Model**: The initial model, when reduced modulo 2, gives $y^2 \\equiv x^2$, which is $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0$. This represents a non-reduced line, indicating that the model is not \"stable\". We need to find a better model by applying a change of variables. The standard transformation for this purpose is $(x, y) \\to (2x, 2y)$. Applying this transformation repeatedly will simplify the equation until its reduction modulo 2 is a *reduced* curve (meaning, not a power of another polynomial).\n\n3.  **Calculate Genera**:\n    *   The genus of the original hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f) - 1) / 2\\rfloor$.\n    *   After the simplification process, we will obtain a new model whose reduction modulo 2 is a curve $y^2 = \\bar{f}_{reg}(x)$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. We will calculate the genus of this reduced curve, let's call it $g_{reg}$.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Double Points**: The number of double points ($\\delta$) in the stable reduction is the difference between the genus of the original curve and the genus of the smooth curve found in the special fiber of the regular model. This is given by the formula $\\delta = g - g_{reg}$.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps algorithmically. It will start with the initial coefficients, repeatedly apply the transformation, and check the condition on the reduction at each step. Once it finds the stable model, it will calculate the genera and compute the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_poly_str(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Creates a string representation of a polynomial from its coefficients.\"\"\"\n    poly_str = []\n    for i, c in reversed(list(enumerate(coeffs))):\n        if c == 0:\n            continue\n        if i == 0:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{c}\")\n        elif i == 1:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{c}*x\")\n        else:\n            poly_str.append(f\"{c}*x^{i}\")\n    return \" + \".join(poly_str).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n\ndef get_degree(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Gets the degree of a polynomial.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(coeffs) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if coeffs[i] != 0:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\ndef calculate_genus_hyperelliptic(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the genus of a hyperelliptic curve y^2=f(x).\"\"\"\n    deg = get_degree(coeffs)\n    if deg < 0:\n        return 0\n    return (deg - 1) // 2\n\ndef get_genus_reg_F2(coeffs_F2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the genus of the curve y^2 = f(x) over F_2.\n    \"\"\"\n    deg = get_degree(coeffs_F2)\n    if deg <= 2:\n        # y^2 = ax^2 + bx + c -> (y + sqrt(a)x)^2 = ... is genus 0\n        return 0\n    # For y^2 = f(x) over F_2, if f is not a square\n    # the genus is given by the standard formula.\n    return (deg - 1) // 2\n\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coefficients of f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x + 0\n    # from lowest degree (x^0) to highest (x^5)\n    coeffs = [0, 8, 1, 4, 4, 8]\n    \n    print(f\"Original curve: y^2 = {get_poly_str(coeffs)}\")\n\n    # Calculate genus of the original curve\n    g_orig = calculate_genus_hyperelliptic(coeffs)\n    \n    # Loop to find the regular model\n    for i in range(10): # Limit iterations to prevent infinite loops\n        # Reduce coefficients modulo 2\n        coeffs_F2 = [c % 2 for c in coeffs]\n        \n        # Check if the reduced polynomial is a square in F_2.\n        # This is true if all odd-degree coefficients are 0.\n        is_square = True\n        for j in range(1, len(coeffs_F2), 2):\n            if coeffs_F2[j] != 0:\n                is_square = False\n                break\n        \n        # If it is not a square, we have found our regular model's reduction.\n        if not is_square:\n            print(f\"\\nAfter {i} transformations, the model reduction is not a square.\")\n            break\n            \n        print(f\"\\nTransformation {i+1}:\")\n        \n        # Apply the transformation: c_i -> c_i * 2^(i-2)\n        new_coeffs = [0] * len(coeffs)\n        for j in range(len(coeffs)):\n            if j >= 2:\n                new_coeffs[j] = coeffs[j] * (2**(j - 2))\n            else:\n                # Use integer division for negative exponents\n                new_coeffs[j] = coeffs[j] // (2**(2 - j))\n        coeffs = new_coeffs\n        print(f\"New model: y^2 = {get_poly_str(coeffs)}\")\n    \n    # The final regular model\n    print(f\"\\nThe equation for the final regular model is:\\ny^2 = {get_poly_str(coeffs)}\")\n    \n    # Reduction mod 2 of the final model\n    final_coeffs_F2 = [c % 2 for c in coeffs]\n    print(f\"\\nIts reduction modulo 2 is:\\ny^2 = {get_poly_str(final_coeffs_F2)}\")\n\n    # Genus of the reduced curve\n    g_reg = get_genus_reg_F2(final_coeffs_F2)\n    \n    # The number of double points is the difference in genera\n    delta = g_orig - g_reg\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Genus of the original curve: g = {g_orig}\")\n    print(f\"Genus of the reduced curve's smooth model: g_reg = {g_reg}\")\n    print(f\"The number of double points in the stable reduction is delta = g - g_reg\")\n    print(f\"delta = {g_orig} - {g_reg} = {delta}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal answer:\")\n    print(f\"{delta}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<2>>>\n```"
