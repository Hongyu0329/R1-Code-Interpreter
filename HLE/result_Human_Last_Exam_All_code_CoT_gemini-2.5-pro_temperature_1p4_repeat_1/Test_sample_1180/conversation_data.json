    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we need to analyze the 2-adic properties of the branch points of the curve, which are the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the roots:** Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ using its Newton polygon with respect to the valuation $v$ where $v(2)=1$.\n2.  **Identify root clusters:** A double point in the stable reduction corresponds to a partition of the roots into two non-empty sets (clusters). We determine this partition by analyzing the roots after a suitable change of variables.\n3.  **Calculate the sum of valuations:** For the partition of roots $W = S_1 \\cup S_2$, we calculate the sum of the valuations of the differences between roots from the two sets, which is $V = \\sum_{r \\in S_1, s \\in S_2} v(r-s)$. This value can be found using the valuation of the derivative of $f(x)$ at one of the roots.\n4.  **Calculate the thickness:** The thickness is a numerical invariant associated with the double point. Different conventions exist for its definition. A common definition that yields a positive value is $\\tau = -\\frac{1}{2}V$. We will use this formula to find the final answer.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1.  **Valuations of roots:** The Newton polygon of $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is constructed from the points $(i, v(a_i))$ for non-zero coefficients $a_i$. The points are $(0, v(1)=0)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(5, v(2)=1)$. The lower convex hull is the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$. This segment has a single slope of $m = (1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$. The valuations of all five roots $\\alpha_i$ of $f(x)$ are given by the negative of the slope, so $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$ for all $i=1, \\dots, 5$.\n\n2.  **Root clusters:** The stable reduction has a double point, implying the five roots split into two groups. By analyzing a transformed polynomial (as detailed in the thought process), one can show that the roots partition into one set $S_1$ with a single root and another set $S_2$ with the remaining four roots.\n\n3.  **Sum of valuations ($V$):** The value $V = \\sum_{r \\in S_1, s \\in S_2} v(r-s)$ is equal to $\\sum_{j=2}^5 v(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_j)$, assuming $\\alpha_1 \\in S_1$. This sum is related to the valuation of the derivative $f'(\\alpha_1)$ by the formula: $v(f'(\\alpha_1)) = v(a_5) + \\sum_{j \\neq 1} v(\\alpha_1 - \\alpha_j)$, where $a_5=2$ is the leading coefficient.\n    *   $f'(x) = 10x^4 + 6x^2 = 2x^2(5x^2+3)$.\n    *   $v(f'(\\alpha_1)) = v(2) + v(\\alpha_1^2) + v(5\\alpha_1^2 + 3)$.\n    *   Since $v(\\alpha_1) = -1/5$, $v(\\alpha_1^2) = -2/5$.\n    *   $v(5\\alpha_1^2) = v(5)+v(\\alpha_1^2) = 0 - 2/5 = -2/5$. As $v(3)=0$, the valuation of the sum is $v(5\\alpha_1^2+3) = \\min(v(5\\alpha_1^2), v(3)) = -2/5$.\n    *   $v(f'(\\alpha_1)) = v(2) + v(\\alpha_1^2) + v(5\\alpha_1^2+3) = 1 + (-2/5) + (-2/5) = 1/5$.\n    *   Substituting into the formula: $1/5 = v(2) + V \\implies 1/5 = 1 + V \\implies V = -4/5$.\n\n4.  **Thickness:** Using the formula $\\tau = -1/2 \\cdot V$:\n    *   $\\tau = -1/2 \\cdot (-4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Define initial values from the problem analysis\n# v_a5 is the valuation of the leading coefficient of f(x), which is 2.\nv_a5 = Fraction(1, 1)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the valuation of the derivative at a root alpha.\n# From the analysis: v(f'(alpha)) = v(2) + v(alpha^2) + v(5*alpha^2 + 3)\nv_alpha = Fraction(-1, 5)\nv_alpha_sq = 2 * v_alpha\nv_5_alpha_sq_plus_3 = v_alpha_sq # As v(5*alpha_sq) = -2/5 < v(3)=0\nv_f_prime = v_a5 + v_alpha_sq + v_5_alpha_sq_plus_3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate V, the sum of valuation differences.\n# The formula is v(f'(alpha)) = v(a_n) + V\nV = v_f_prime - v_a5\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the thickness.\n# The formula is thickness = -1/2 * V\nfactor = Fraction(-1, 2)\nthickness = factor * V\n\n# Output the steps of the final calculation\nprint(\"The thickness of the double point is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(\"thickness = (-1/2) * (v(f'(alpha)) - v(a_5))\")\nprint(f\"where v(a_5) = v(2) = {v_a5}\")\nprint(f\"and v(f'(alpha)) = v(2) + v(alpha^2) + v(5*alpha^2+3) = {v_a5} + {v_alpha_sq} + {v_5_alpha_sq_plus_3} = {v_f_prime}\")\nprint(f\"So, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"thickness = {factor} * ({v_f_prime} - {v_a5}) = {thickness}\")\n\n```\n<<<2/5>>>"
