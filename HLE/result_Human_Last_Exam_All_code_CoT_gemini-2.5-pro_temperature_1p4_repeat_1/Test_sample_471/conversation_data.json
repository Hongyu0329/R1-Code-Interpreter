    "This is a classic problem in a field of mathematics called Morse theory. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Understand the object:** The function is defined on a 2-torus, $T^2$, which is the mathematical term for the surface of a donut.\n2.  **Use Morse Theory:** Morse theory connects the properties of a smooth function on a manifold (like the torus) to the manifold's topology (its fundamental shape and number of holes).\n3.  **Betti Numbers:** A key part of a manifold's topology is described by its Betti numbers. For the 2-torus, these are:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent non-bounding loops or \"holes\" - one around the tube, and one through the center hole).\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one void or cavity).\n4.  **Morse Inequalities:** For a special (but generic) type of smooth function called a \"Morse function,\" the number of critical points of a certain \"index\" is related to these Betti numbers. Let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ (where index 0 are local minima, index 1 are saddle points, and index 2 are local maxima). The weak Morse inequalities state:\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0$\n    *   $c_1 \\ge b_1$\n    *   $c_2 \\ge b_2$\n5.  **Calculate the Minimum:** The total number of critical points, $N$, is the sum $N = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum possible number of critical points for a Morse function is $N_{min} \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$. It turns out that this lower bound is the true minimum for any smooth function on the torus, not just Morse functions.\n6.  **Construct an Example:** We can confirm this minimum is achievable. The standard \"height function\" on a torus placed horizontally in 3D space (i.e., the function that gives the z-coordinate of each point) has a circle of maximum points and a circle of minimum points. By slightly tilting the torus, these degenerate circles resolve into a specific number of non-degenerate critical points: one maximum, one minimum, and two saddle points. This gives a total of $1 + 1 + 2 = 4$ critical points, matching our calculated lower bound.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number based on the sum of the Betti numbers of the 2-torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2)\n    # b_0: number of connected components\n    b0 = 1\n    # b_1: number of \"holes\" (one-dimensional cycles)\n    b1 = 2\n    # b_2: number of \"voids\" (two-dimensional cycles)\n    b2 = 1\n\n    # According to the Morse inequalities, the number of critical points c_k of\n    # index k must satisfy c_k >= b_k for a Morse function.\n    # The total number of critical points N must therefore be at least the\n    # sum of the Betti numbers. This lower bound is the actual minimum.\n    min_critical_points = b0 + b1 + b2\n\n    print(\"The Betti numbers of the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b2}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe minimal number of critical points is the sum of these Betti numbers:\")\n    print(f\"{b0} + {b1} + {b2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis corresponds to 1 minimum (index 0), 2 saddle points (index 1), and 1 maximum (index 2).\")\n\n\nsolve_critical_points_on_torus()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
