    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, over all such graphs.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** We will show that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n-1$.\n    *   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, by definition, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n    *   We can devise a valid coloring scheme using at most $n-1$ colors. We assign the same color (e.g., color 1) to both $u$ and $v$. This is valid because they are not adjacent.\n    *   For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, we can assign each of them a new, unique color from a set of $n-2$ different colors (e.g., colors 2 through $n-1$).\n    *   This coloring is proper. The total number of colors used is $1$ (for $u$ and $v$) + $(n-2)$ (for the rest) = $n-1$ colors.\n    *   This proves that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. For our specific case, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n3.  **Show the Bound is Achievable:** We need to demonstrate that a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices can actually have a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n    *   Consider a graph $G$ constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph with $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and a single, isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n    *   This graph has a total of $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components: $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{n-1}), \\chi(K_1))$.\n    *   A complete graph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ colors. An isolated vertex $K_1$ requires 1 color.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Based on the above reasoning, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$. With $n=12345$, this is $12344$. The Python code below will perform this simple calculation and print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph\n    with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # The problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with n vertices\n    # that is not a complete graph.\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound for the chromatic number.\")\n    print(f\"Let G be a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"If G is not a complete graph, there must be at least two vertices, u and v, that are not adjacent.\")\n    print(\"We can assign the same color to u and v.\")\n    print(f\"The remaining {n} - 2 vertices can each be assigned a unique new color.\")\n    print(f\"This results in a proper coloring using at most 1 + ({n} - 2) = {n-1} colors.\")\n    print(f\"Thus, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most {n-1}.\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Showing the upper bound is achievable.\")\n    print(\"Consider a graph G constructed from two disjoint components:\")\n    print(f\"1.
