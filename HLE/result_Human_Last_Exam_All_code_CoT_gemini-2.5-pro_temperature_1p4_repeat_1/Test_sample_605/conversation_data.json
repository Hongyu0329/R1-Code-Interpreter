    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Crawley-Nordström Invariant:** The invariant, denoted as $c(X)$, for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $X$ in a weighted projective space is defined by the formula:\n    $c(X) = \\frac{d}{\\text{lcm}(w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n)}$\n    where $d$ is the degree of the defining polynomial and $w_i$ are the weights of the ambient space.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** The polynomial must be weighted-homogeneous, meaning each monomial term has the same weighted degree. The degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}\\dots z_n^{a_n}$ with weights $(w_1, \\dots, w_n)$ is $\\sum a_i w_i$. For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree $d$ is equal to the sum of the weights, $d = \\sum w_i$. I will verify this condition.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM):** I will compute the LCM of the given weights $(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Invariant:** I will substitute the values of $d$ and the LCM into the formula and simplify the resulting fraction.\n\n5.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script to automate these calculations. The script will:\n    *   Verify the degree $d$.\n    *   Calculate the LCM of the weights.\n    *   Compute the invariant as a simplified fraction.\n    *   Print out each step of the calculation, including the final equation with all its components.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the problem data\n    # Weights of the weighted projective space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    \n    # The polynomial is P = z_1^8*z_3 + z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3 + z_1*z_2^7 + z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5 + z_2*z_3^4 + z_4^3*z_5 + z_5^3\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' is the sum of the weights.\n    # Let's confirm this.
