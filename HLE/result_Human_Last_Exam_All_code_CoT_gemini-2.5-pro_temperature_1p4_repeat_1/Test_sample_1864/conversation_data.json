    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider several categories of controls required for a robust, multi-color analysis. Each control type serves a distinct and critical purpose.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  **Identify the baseline control:** This is the unstained sample to measure autofluorescence.\n2.  **Account for spectral overlap:** For five colors, we need a single-stain control for each to calculate compensation.\n3.  **Ensure accurate gating:** For a sorting experiment, Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls are essential for setting precise gates. We will need one FMO for each of the five colors.\n4.  **Address special reagents:** The use of Streptavidin implies a biotin-streptavidin detection system, which requires its own control to check for non-specific binding.\n5.  **Sum the controls:** I will write a Python script to sum these controls and print a detailed breakdown of what each control is for, along with the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry\n    sorting experiment based on user-provided parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Experiment Parameters ---\n    channels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_channels = len(channels)\n    # The mention of \"Streptavidin beads\" implies a biotin-streptavidin system is\n    # used for detection, which requires a specific control.\n    uses_streptavidin = True\n\n    # --- Control Calculation ---\n    # 1.
