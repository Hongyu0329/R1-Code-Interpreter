    "Of course, I can help with that. I will calculate the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The information about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) provides context for the origin of the matrix, but the calculation itself only requires the matrix A.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    For a matrix  `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]`, the determinant is `a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n2.  I will write a Python script that substitutes the values from your matrix `A` into this formula.\n3.  The script will print out the full equation with the numbers from the matrix, showing the step-by-step calculation.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the computed determinant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The matrix A is defined as given in the problem.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract the elements of the matrix to display them in the equation.\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# The determinant formula is det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n# We print the formula with the specific numbers from matrix A.\nprint(\"Calculating the determinant using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values from matrix A:\")\n# Print the equation with each number explicitly shown.\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Calculate the intermediate terms to show the process.\nterm1 = e*i - f*h\nterm2 = d*i - f*g\nterm3 = d*h - e*g\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({term1}) - ({b}) * ({term2}) + ({c}) * ({term3})\")\n\n# Calculate the final value of each main term.\nfinal_term1 = a * term1\nfinal_term2 = -b * term2\nfinal_term3 = c * term3\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({final_term1}) + ({final_term2}) + ({final_term3})\")\n\n# Compute the final determinant of the matrix using numpy, which is efficient and accurate.\n# The result is rounded to handle potential floating point inaccuracies.\ndeterminant = round(np.linalg.det(A))\n\nprint(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\nprint(f\"The determinant of the adjacency matrix is: {determinant}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
