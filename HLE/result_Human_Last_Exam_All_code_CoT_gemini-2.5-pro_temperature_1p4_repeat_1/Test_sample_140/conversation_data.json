    "This is a 3D packing problem. A simple approach based on dividing the volumes (`(15*15*15) / (9*1*1) = 375`) is an upper bound, but it doesn't account for the physical constraints of fitting the blocks. A more effective method is a greedy algorithm where we fill the space with blocks in one orientation, and then recursively fill the remaining space with blocks in other orientations.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Start with the `15x15x15` cube.\n2.  **First Pass (X-axis alignment):** Fill the cube with `9x1x1` blocks aligned along the first dimension (let's call it the x-axis). I will calculate how many fit and determine the size of the leftover space.\n3.  **Second Pass (Y-axis alignment):** Take the leftover space from the first pass and fill it with blocks aligned along the second dimension (y-axis). Again, I'll calculate the number of blocks and the new remaining space.\n4.  **Third Pass (Z-axis alignment):** Take the remaining space from the second pass and fill it with blocks aligned along the third dimension (z-axis).\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Sum the number of blocks from all three passes to get the total. I will print out each step of the calculation and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit\n    inside a 15x15x15 cube using a greedy packing strategy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial dimensions of the cube and block\n    cube_dims = [15, 15, 15]\n    block_major_dim = 9\n    block_minor_dim = 1\n\n    total_blocks = 0\n    calculation_parts = []\n\n    # Make a mutable copy for tracking remaining space\n    space = list(cube_dims)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Pack along the first dimension ---\n    # Try to fit the 9-unit length of the block into the first dimension of the space.\n    num_fit_1 = (space[0] // block_major_dim) * (space[1] // block_minor_dim) * (space[2] // block_minor_dim)\n    print(f\"Step 1: In the initial {space[0]}x{space[1]}x{space[2]} space, we align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the first dimension.\")\n    print(f\"   We can fit ({space[0]} // {block_major_dim}) * ({space[1]} // {block_minor_dim}) * ({space[2]} // {block_minor_dim}) = {space[0] // block_major_dim} * {space[1] // block_minor_dim} * {space[2] // block_minor_dim} = {num_fit_1} blocks.\")\n    total_blocks += num_fit_1\n    calculation_parts.append(num_fit_1)\n\n    # Update the remaining space\n    space[0] -= (space[0] // block_major_dim) * block_major_dim\n\n    # --- Step 2: Pack along the second dimension ---\n    # In the remaining space, try to fit the 9-unit length of the block into the second dimension.\n    num_fit_2 = (space[0] // block_minor_dim) * (space[1] // block_major_dim) * (space[2] // block_minor_dim)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: In the remaining {space[0]}x{space[1]}x{space[2]} space, we align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the second dimension.\")\n    print(f\"   We can fit ({space[0]} // {block_minor_dim}) * ({space[1]} // {block_major_dim}) * ({space[2]} // {block_minor_dim}) = {space[0] // block_minor_dim} * {space[1] // block_major_dim} * {space[2] // block_minor_dim} = {num_fit_2} blocks.\")\n    total_blocks += num_fit_2\n    calculation_parts.append(num_fit_2)\n\n    # Update the remaining space\n    space[1] -= (space[1] // block_major_dim) * block_major_dim\n\n    # --- Step 3: Pack along the third dimension ---\n    # In the remaining space, try to fit the 9-unit length of the block into the third dimension.\n    num_fit_3 = (space[0] // block_minor_dim) * (space[1] // block_minor_dim) * (space[2] // block_major_dim)\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: In the remaining {space[0]}x{space[1]}x{space[2]} space, we align the 9-unit length of the blocks along the third dimension.\")\n    print(f\"   We can fit ({space[0]} // {block_minor_dim}) * ({space[1]} // {block_minor_dim}) * ({space[2]} // {block_major_dim}) = {space[0] // block_minor_dim} * {space[1] // block_minor_dim} * {space[2] // block_major_dim} = {num_fit_3} blocks.\")\n    total_blocks += num_fit_3\n    calculation_parts.append(num_fit_3)\n    \n    # Update the remaining space\n    space[2] -= (space[2] // block_major_dim) * block_major_dim\n    print(f\"\\nThe final unusable space is a {space[0]}x{space[1]}x{space[2]} cube.\")\n\n    # --- Final result ---\n    print(\"\\nSumming the blocks from each step gives the total:\")\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, calculation_parts))\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n<<<351>>>"
