    Calculates and prints the theoretical lower bound on the number of queries for
    learning a two-hidden-layer ReLU network in the Statistical Query (SQ) model.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of queries needed for an SQ algorithm
    to learn a poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU network over a Gaussian
    distribution N(0, Id) up to a squared loss of 1/poly(d), with the constraint
    that the query tolerance is not negligible (i.e., τ >= 1/poly(d)).

    This is a well-established result in computational learning theory. It has been
    proven that any SQ algorithm solving this problem requires a number of queries
    that is exponential in the dimension `d`. The intuition is that there exist
    families of functions that are very different from each other (in terms of L2
    distance) but are nearly indistinguishable by any low-precision statistical
    query. Therefore, an SQ algorithm cannot learn the correct function without
    making an exponential number of queries to reduce the statistical uncertainty.

    The lower bound is expressed using Big-Omega notation (Ω) to signify an
    asymptotic lower bound. The formula is exp(Ω(d)).
