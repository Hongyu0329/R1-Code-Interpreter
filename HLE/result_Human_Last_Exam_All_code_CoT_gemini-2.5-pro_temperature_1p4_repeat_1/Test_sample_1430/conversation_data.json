    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: The problem involves a genus 3 Riemann surface, C, and its 15th symmetric power, X = Sym¹⁵(C). The goal is to find the minimum and maximum possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X).\n\n2.  **Use the standard formula**: I will use the well-known formula that relates the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve to the Picard number of its Jacobian. The formula is ρ(Cᵈ) = 1 + ρ(J(C)), where J(C) is the Jacobian of the curve C of genus g. This formula is valid for degree d ≥ g-1.\n\n3.  **Analyze the range of ρ(J(C))**: The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of ρ(J(C)) for a genus g=3 curve.\n    *   **Minimum**: For a generic curve C, its Jacobian J(C) has a Néron-Severi group of rank 1.\n    *   **Maximum**: The rank is maximized for special curves with complex multiplication. The theoretical upper bound for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety is g². For g=3, this maximum is 9, and it is known to be achieved by the Jacobian of the Fermat curve x⁴+y⁴=z⁴.\n\n4.  **Calculate the final results**: Using the formula from step 2 and the range from step 3, I will calculate the smallest and largest possible values for ρ(X).\n\n5.  **Generate the code**: I will write a Python script that implements these steps to print out the derivation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
