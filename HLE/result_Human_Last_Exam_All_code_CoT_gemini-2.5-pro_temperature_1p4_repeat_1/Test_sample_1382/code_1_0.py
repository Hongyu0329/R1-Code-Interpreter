    This function demonstrates the likely answer to the user's question.
    
    The problem states that for a graph G, null(B^T B) = lambda_n(G) / 2.
    My analysis suggests that this implies a specific property of the graph, which is best
    described by option D: The graph has exactly lambda_n(G) / 2 connected components.
    
    To demonstrate this, I will use an example graph that satisfies the initial condition:
    the disjoint union of two 4-cycles (C_4 U C_4).
    
    For this graph:
    - n (nodes) = 8
    - m (edges) = 8
    - c (connected components) = 2
    - The cyclomatic number (which equals null(B_oriented^T B_oriented)) is m - n + c = 8 - 8 + 2 = 2.
    - The largest Laplacian eigenvalue lambda_n is 4.
    - The condition null(B^T B) = lambda_n(G) / 2 becomes 2 = 4 / 2, which is true.

    Now, I will show that for this graph, the number of connected components 'c' is
    indeed equal to lambda_n(G) / 2.
