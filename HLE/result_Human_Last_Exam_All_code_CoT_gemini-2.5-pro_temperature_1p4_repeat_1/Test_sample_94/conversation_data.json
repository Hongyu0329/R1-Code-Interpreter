    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the keywords in your question: \"physicist,\" \"microscopy,\" \"optical effect,\" \"accidental observation,\" and \"custodial worker.\"\n2.  I will use these keywords to search my knowledge base for the specific historical event and the person associated with it.\n3.  The story described strongly points to the invention of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.\n4.  The physicist credited with this invention, based on an accidental observation of this nature, is Georges Nomarski.\n5.  I will then create a simple Python script to print the name of this physicist, fulfilling your request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on the provided story.\n    The story describes the accidental observation that led to the development of\n    Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The physicist known for work in microscopy who developed an optical effect\n    # after it was accidentally observed is Georges Nomarski.\n    physicist_name = \"Georges Nomarski\"\n    print(physicist_name)\n\nfind_physicist()\n```\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
