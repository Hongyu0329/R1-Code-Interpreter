# The problem asks for the number of connected components of the intersection of all
# compact connected neighborhoods of the point a = (0, 1, 0) in a given space X.
# This intersection is a topological structure often related to the quasi-component of the point.
# The solution can be found through logical deduction based on the properties of the space.

# Step 1: Define the point 'a'.
a = (0, 1, 0)

# Step 2: Analyze the space X around the point 'a'.
# The space X is constructed from several parts, but near 'a', its structure is determined
# by the slice P_0 = {0} x P. The point 'a' corresponds to the point (1,0) in the y-z plane
# definition of P. Locally, this is just the end of a line segment.
# Any sufficiently small open ball B(a, epsilon) intersects X only along the line segment
# {(0, y, 0) | 1-delta < y <= 1}.

# Step 3: Find a set that contains the intersection K.
# We can find compact connected neighborhoods of 'a' to narrow down K.
# Let L_0 be the line segment {(0, y, 0) | y is in [0, 1]}.
# One can show that K is a subset of L_0 by intersecting two larger neighborhoods:
# 1. P_0 = {0} x P
# 2. X_bottom = The portion of X with z=0.
# The intersection of these two valid neighborhoods is precisely L_0.

# Step 4: Show that the intersection K is precisely the point {a}.
# Let p = (0, y_p, 0) be any point on L_0 other than 'a', so y_p < 1.
# We can construct a new set N_p = {(0, y, 0) | (y_p + 1)/2 <= y <= 1}.
# N_p is a compact and connected line segment.
# N_p contains 'a'.
# N_p is a neighborhood of 'a' in X because it contains a small interval {(0, y, 0) | 1-delta < y <= 1}.
# However, N_p does not contain p.
# Since we found a compact connected neighborhood of 'a' that excludes p, p cannot be in K.
# This holds for all points on L_0 except for 'a' itself.
# Thus, K = {a}.

# Step 5: Count the connected components of K.
# The set K contains a single point. A singleton set is connected.
# Therefore, K has exactly one connected component.

# Let's represent this result.
num_components = 1

# To satisfy the instruction "output each number in the final equation",
# we present the result within a simple equation format.
final_equation = f"The number of components = {num_components}"
print(final_equation)
