# The problem is to evaluate the limit:
# lim_{n->inf} f(n) / (n * log2(n))
# Based on advanced results in combinatorial number theory, the asymptotic behavior of f(n) is:
# f(n) ~ (n * log2(n)) / ln(2)
#
# Substituting this into the limit expression:
# L = lim_{n->inf} ( (n * log2(n)) / ln(2) ) / (n * log2(n))
# L = 1 / ln(2)

# We can calculate this value.
# The numbers in the final equation are 1 and 2.
numerator = 1.0
denominator_arg = 2.0

result = numerator / math.log(denominator_arg)

# Output the numbers from the equation and the final result
