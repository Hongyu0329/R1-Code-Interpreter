    # 1. The upper bound
    # A theorem states that a set with Hausdorff dimension > 1/2 must contain
    # a 3-term arithmetic progression (x, x+d, x+2d).
    # Such a set cannot be a Sidon set because x + (x+2d) = (x+d) + (x+d),
    # which violates the Sidon property for d != 0.

    # 2. The lower bound
    # Constructions of Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimension exactly 1/2 exist.
    # This means the maximum dimension is at least 1/2.
    lower_bound = 0.5

    print("A theorem in mathematics shows that any set with a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1/2 is not a Sidon set.")
    print(f"This leads to the inequality for the maximum dimension D_max:")
    # The instruction asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # Here, the 'equation' is the inequality D_max <= 0.5.
    print(f"D_max <= {upper_bound}")

    print("\nPart 2: Establishing a Lower Bound")
    print("Mathematical constructions have proven the existence of Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1/2.")
    print(f"This means the maximum possible dimension must be at least this value:")
    # Here, the 'equation' is the inequality D_max >= 0.5.
    print(f"D_max >= {lower_bound}")

    # Conclusion
    # If D_max <= 0.5 and D_max >= 0.5, then D_max must be 0.5.
    max_dimension = min(upper_bound, lower_bound) # Or max(), it's the same
