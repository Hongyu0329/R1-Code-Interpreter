def solve_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the logic puzzle to determine the identity of 'Alice'.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1.  We identify all possible configurations of hats (scenarios) that match the
        alternating "Know" / "Don't Know" sequence of statements.
    2.  Analysis shows there are four such valid scenarios.
    3.  In two scenarios, person A has the single Number hat.
    4.  In the other two scenarios, person C has the single Number hat.
    5.  The blind person H, being a perfect logician, considers all four scenarios valid.
    6.  H then determines the hat type (Color vs. Number) for each person (A-G).
    7.  A person's hat type is 'known' to H if it's the same across all four scenarios.
    8.  'Alice' is the person whose hat type is not the same across all scenarios.
    9.  The code identifies all such ambiguous persons.
