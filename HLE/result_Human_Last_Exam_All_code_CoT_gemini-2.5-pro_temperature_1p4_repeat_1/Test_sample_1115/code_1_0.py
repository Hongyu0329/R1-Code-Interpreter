# This problem describes a system of two entangled photons.
# The core principle is the conservation of angular momentum.

# 1. Define the states and spin values.
# The initial atomic state (1S0) and final atomic state (1S0) both have a total angular momentum (J) of 0.
# Therefore, the total angular momentum of the two emitted photons must also be 0.
total_spin_of_photons = 0

# Photon polarization can be represented by spin values:
# Right-handed polarization corresponds to a spin of +1.
# Left-handed polarization corresponds to a spin of -1.
polarization_map = {
    1: "Right-handed",
    -1: "Left-handed"
}

# 2. Use the information given in the problem.
# One photon is measured to be right-handed.
spin_photon1 = 1
name_photon1 = polarization_map[spin_photon1]

# 3. Solve for the spin of the companion photon.
# From the conservation equation: spin_photon2 = total_spin_of_photons - spin_photon1
spin_photon2 = total_spin_of_photons - spin_photon1

# Get the name of the polarization for the second photon.
name_photon2 = polarization_map[spin_photon2]
