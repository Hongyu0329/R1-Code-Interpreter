The set of possible values for the volume of the polytope $P$ depends on how the question is interpreted. If the $d$-dimensional simplex $T$ is given with a fixed volume $V$, then the volume of $P$ is uniquely determined to be $d!V$. Thus, the set of possible values is the singleton $\{d!V\}$. If we consider all possible non-degenerate simplices, their volume $V$ can be any positive real number, which means $\text{Vol}(P)$ can also be any positive real number. In this case, the set of values is $(0, \infty)$. The fundamental relationship is $\text{Vol}(P) = d!V$.
