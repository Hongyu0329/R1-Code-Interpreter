# Based on the analysis of the properties of tame, non-hereditary representation
# categories, the projective dimension 'n' is determined. The problem implies a
# universal constant for 'n' under these conditions.
# The class of tame, non-hereditary categories, such as those of tame concealed
# algebras, typically have a global dimension of 2.
# The conditions on the functor F ensure that it is n-resolvable for a finite n,
# and n must be a value characteristic of this algebraic structure.
# Therefore, n represents this global dimension.

# The final equation is n = 2.
n = 2

# As requested, printing the number in the final equation.
