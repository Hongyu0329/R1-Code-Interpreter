            "HELPS (or is intended to). This is a form of regularization. By simplifying the functions for speciation and extinction rates (constraining them to be piecewise constant), the model's flexibility is reduced. This can help stabilize inference and is a common approach for ill-posed problems, even if it doesn't solve the underlying mathematical congruence issue.",
        
        "B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework":
            "HELPS. Priors add external information to the model. By using informative priors on speciation or extinction rates, we can constrain the parameter space, helping the model distinguish between solutions that would otherwise be equally likely based solely on the phylogenetic data.",

        "C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5":
            "DOES NOT HELP. This strategy dramatically increases the model's complexity and number of parameters. For a model that is already fundamentally unidentifiable, increasing its flexibility makes the problem worse. It creates an even larger space of functions that can fit the data equally well, leading to severe overfitting and unreliable estimates.",

        "D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny (probability of lineage removal after sampling = 0)":
            "HELPS. Fossils provide direct evidence of past life and extinct lineages. This information breaks the ambiguity because extinctions are now observed events rather than inferred ones, allowing for the separate estimation of speciation and extinction rates.",

        "E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate":
            "HELPS. This is a direct mathematical solution. It has been shown that while λ(t) and μ(t) are not identifiable, certain combinations of them, like the 'pulled diversification rate', are. By changing the model to estimate this identifiable parameter, you are asking a question that the data can actually answer.",

        "F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny (probability of lineage removal after sampling = 1)":
            "HELPS. Similar to strategy D, adding fossil tips provides direct data on extinction events. This additional information is crucial for disentangling the speciation and extinction processes.",
            
        "G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate":
            "HELPS. Similar to strategy E, this involves re-parametrizing the model to estimate a different quantity that is identifiable from an extant-only phylogeny. This reframes the problem to be solvable."
