    # Sentence A
    print("A. 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("   - Analysis: The pronoun 'She' is the subject and the R-expression 'Mary' is in the object position.")
    print("   - The subscript '_i' means they refer to the same person.")
    print("   - The subject c-commands the object. Therefore, the R-expression 'Mary' is bound by 'She'.")
    print("   - VIOLATION: This violates Principle C, which states an R-expression must be free.")
    print("   - Result: Ungrammatical due to a binding principle.\n")

    # Sentence B
    print("B. 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - Analysis: This sentence is ungrammatical, but not due to binding.")
    print("   - The error is a syntactic movement violation (Left Branch Condition). The entire phrase 'Whose glasses' should be moved, not just 'Whose'.")
    print("   - Result: Ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle.\n")

    # Sentence C
    print("C. 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("   - Analysis: This sentence is also ungrammatical, but not due to binding.")
    print("   - The error is a syntactic movement violation (Coordinate Structure Constraint). An element cannot be moved out of a coordinate structure ('Mary and ...').")
