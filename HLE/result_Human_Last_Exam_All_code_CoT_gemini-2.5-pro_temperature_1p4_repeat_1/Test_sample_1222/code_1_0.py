        "This action 'g' is explicitly defined to be a reflection on the vertices: g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}. "
        "Therefore, the very existence of a map 'sigma' satisfying these properties is contingent "
        "on 'g' acting as this reflection. The condition that sigma(a) is non-zero does not "

        "To ensure sigma(a) can be non-zero for all arrows 'a', we must avoid situations where "
        "the defining relations force sigma(a) to be zero. A problematic case arises when an arrow "
        "'a' is a fixed point of the group action, i.e., g . a = a.\n"
        
        "An arrow a: i -> j is a fixed point under 'g' only if it is a loop (i=j) at a vertex 'i' "
        "that is itself a fixed point of the vertex action.\n"
        
        "A vertex 'i' is a fixed point if g . e_i = e_i. From the definition g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}, this means "
        "the vertex index 'i' must satisfy the equation:\n"
        "i = n - d - i\n"
        
        "Rearranging this gives the final equation for a fixed vertex:\n"
        "2 * i = n - d\n"
        
        "For this equation to have an integer solution for 'i', the right-hand side, (n - d), must be an even number. "
        "If (n - d) is even, a fixed vertex can exist, which in turn allows for a fixed arrow 'a' (a loop at that vertex). "
        "For such a fixed arrow, the relation sigma(g . a) = lambda^(-1) * g . sigma(a) becomes "
        "sigma(a) = lambda^(-1) * g . sigma(a). This constraint can force sigma(a) = 0, for instance, "
        "if lambda = -1 and g acts trivially on sigma(a).\n"
        
        "To prevent this and ensure sigma(a) is not forced to be zero, we must prevent the existence of fixed vertices. "
        "This is achieved by ensuring the equation 2 * i = n - d has no integer solution. "
