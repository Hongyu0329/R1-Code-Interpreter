    print("\n--- The Proof ---")

    print("\nStep 1: Introduce the Fourier Transform.")

    print("its Fourier transform F(ξ) is also a Schwartz function.")

    print("\nStep 2: Relate moments of f(x) to derivatives of its Fourier transform F(ξ).")
    print("Let's compute the k-th derivative of F(ξ) at ξ = 0.")
    print("First, the k-th derivative of F(ξ) is:")

    print("A general infinitely-differentiable function (like e^(-1/x^2)) can have all derivatives be zero at a point without being the zero function.")

    print("  'If a Schwartz function φ(x) has all its derivatives at a single point equal to zero,")
    print("   then the function must be identically zero everywhere.'")
    print("Applying this theorem to F(ξ), we conclude that F(ξ) must be the zero function.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclude using the Inverse Fourier Transform.")
    print("The Fourier transform is invertible on the Schwartz space. We can recover f(x) from F(ξ):")
    print("  f(x) = ∫ F(ξ) * e^(2πi * x * ξ) dξ")
