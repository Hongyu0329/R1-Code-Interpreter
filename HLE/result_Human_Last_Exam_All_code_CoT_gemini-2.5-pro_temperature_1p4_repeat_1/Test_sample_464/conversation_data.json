    "The question asks whether a Schwartz function $f$ must be identically zero if all its moments, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$, are zero for all non-negative integers $k$.\n\nThe answer is yes. This is a classic result in Fourier analysis that highlights a key property of Schwartz functions. The argument proceeds in four main steps:\n1.  Relate the moments of the function $f(x)$ to its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$.\n2.  Show that the given condition implies that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ and all its derivatives are zero at the origin ($\\xi=0$).\n3.  Argue that for a Schwartz function, having all derivatives vanish at a single point is enough to prove the function is identically zero everywhere.\n4.  Conclude that since the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is zero, the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero, due to the invertibility of the Fourier transform.\n\nHere is a Python script that explains the logical steps of the proof in detail.\n\n```python\ndef prove_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the proof that a Schwartz function with all zero moments is the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- The Schwartz Function Moment Problem ---\")\n    print(\"\\nProblem Statement:\")\n    print(\"Suppose f(x) is a Schwartz class function, and its moments are all zero:\")\n    print(\"  ∫ x^k * f(x) dx = 0  (for k = 0, 1, 2, ...)\")\n    print(\"Does it follow that f(x) = 0 for all x?\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- The Proof ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Introduce the Fourier Transform.\")\n    print(\"Let F(ξ) be the Fourier transform of f(x), defined as:\")\n    print(\"  F(ξ) = ∫ f(x) * e^(-2πi * x * ξ) dx\")\n    print(\"A fundamental property of the Schwartz space is that if f(x) is a Schwartz function,\")\n    print(\"its Fourier transform F(ξ) is also a Schwartz function.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Relate moments of f(x) to derivatives of its Fourier transform F(ξ).\")\n    print(\"Let's compute the k-th derivative of F(ξ) at ξ = 0.\")\n    print(\"First, the k-th derivative of F(ξ) is:\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(ξ) = d^k/dξ^k [F(ξ)] = ∫ f(x) * (-2πi * x)^k * e^(-2πi * x * ξ) dx\")\n    print(\"Evaluating at ξ = 0, the exponential term becomes 1:\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(0) = ∫ f(x) * (-2πi * x)^k dx\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(0) = (-2πi)^k * ∫ x^k * f(x) dx\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the given condition.\")\n    print(\"We are given that all moments are zero: ∫ x^k * f(x) dx = 0.\")\n    print(\"Substituting this into our equation for the derivatives of F(ξ):\")\n    print(\"  F^(k)(0) = (-2πi)^k * 0\")\n    equation_number_1 = 0\n    print(f\"  F^(k)(0) = {equation_number_1}  (for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...)\")\n    print(\"This means the Fourier transform F(ξ) and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Use a key property of Schwartz functions.\")\n    print(\"F(ξ) is a Schwartz function, and we've shown that F^(k)(0) = 0 for all k.\")\n    print(\"A general infinitely-differentiable function (like e^(-1/x^2)) can have all derivatives be zero at a point without being the zero function.\")\n    print(\"However, Schwartz functions are more 'rigid'.
