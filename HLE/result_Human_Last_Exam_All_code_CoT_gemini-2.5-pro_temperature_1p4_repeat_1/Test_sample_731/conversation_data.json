    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Identify the group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is a group of order $2^n$. We first need to determine the value of $n$.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups of this form exist for the given group.\n3.  **Apply Group Theory Results:** For semidihedral groups of the form $SD_{2^n}$, there's a known theorem that describes all its power subgroups. The set of power subgroups consists of the group itself, $SD_{2^n}$, plus $n-1$ cyclic subgroups.\n4.  **Calculate and Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates $n$ for the group of size 512. Then, based on the theorem, it will list the power subgroups and calculate the total count, displaying the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the number of power subgroups:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_of_semidihedral(group_order):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in a semidihedral group.\n\n    Args:\n        group_order: The order of the semidihedral group, which must be a power of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    if group_order <= 0 or (group_order & (group_order - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: The group order must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n = log2(group_order).\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (where n >= 3), the number of\n    # power subgroups is exactly n.\n    # These subgroups are:\n    # 1. The group SD_{2^n} itself.\n    # 2. The n-1 cyclic subgroups <a^{2^i}> for i = 1, 2, ..., n-1,\n    #    where 'a' is a generator of the maximal cyclic subgroup of order 2^{n-1}.\n\n    num_cyclic_subgroups = n - 1\n    total_power_subgroups = 1 + num_cyclic_subgroups\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order} is denoted as SD_{{{group_order}}}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the form SD_{{2^n}} with n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to group theory, the power subgroups are:\")\n    print(f\"1. The group SD_{{{group_order}}} itself.\")\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        exponent = 2**i\n        print(f\"{i + 1}. A cyclic subgroup of order {2**(n-1-i)} generated by an element like a^{{{exponent}}}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the total number of power subgroups is:\")\n    print(f\"1 (the group itself) + {num_cyclic_subgroups} (cyclic subgroups) = {total_power_subgroups}\")\n\n# Size of the semidihedral group\nsemidihedral_group_size = 512\ncount_power_subgroups_of_semidihedral(semidihedral_group_size)\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
