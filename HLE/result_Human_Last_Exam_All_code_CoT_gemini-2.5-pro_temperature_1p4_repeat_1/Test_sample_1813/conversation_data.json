    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we need to follow a multi-step process based on the theory of continued fractions and Markov numbers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Find the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number:** First, we determine the standard continued fraction representation of the given rational number, \\( 4/7 \\).\n2.  **Identify the Associated Continued Fraction:** In the context of generalized Markov numbers, the continued fraction of a rational \\( p/q \\) (where \\( 0 < p/q < 1 \\), like \\( 4/7 \\)) is used to define a purely periodic continued fraction. If \\( p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k] \\), the associated continued fraction is \\( \\alpha = [0; \\overline{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_k}] \\).\n3.  **Determine the Minimal Polynomial:** Any number represented by a periodic continued fraction is a quadratic irrational, meaning it's the root of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients, \\( Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0 \\). We will derive this equation.\n4.  **Derive the Equation Programmatically:**\n    *   Let the periodic part be \\( [a_1, \\dots, a_k] \\). The value of the purely periodic part is \\( y = [\\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_k}] \\).\n    *   This implies \\( y = [a_1, \\dots, a_k, y] \\). We can express this as a rational function of \\(y\\) using the convergents of \\( [a_1, \\dots, a_k] \\).\n    *   The relation is \\( y = \\frac{P_k \\cdot y + P_{k-1}}{Q_k \\cdot y + Q_{k-1}} \\), where \\( P_i/Q_i \\) are the convergents of \\( [a_1, \\dots, a_k] \\).\n    *   The value we seek is \\( x = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_k}] = 1/y \\).\n    *   By substituting \\( y=1/x \\) into the equation for \\(y\\), we can find the quadratic equation for \\(x\\).\n5.  **Solve for the Value:** Finally, we solve the quadratic equation to find the numerical value of the continued fraction. Since the continued fraction is positive, we will choose the positive root. The final Python code will print the equation and its positive root.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_continued_fraction(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the continued fraction coefficients of p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef compute_convergents_matrix(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the matrix M = M_1 * M_2 * ... * M_k\n    where M_i = [[coeffs[i-1], 1], [1, 0]].\n    The resulting matrix is [[P_k, P_{k-1}], [Q_k, Q_{k-1}]].\n    \"\"\"\n    if not coeffs:\n        # Identity matrix for an empty list of coefficients\n        return np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])\n\n    # Initialize with the first matrix\n    m_first = np.array([[coeffs[0], 1], [1, 0]], dtype=object)\n    m_total = m_first\n\n    # Multiply by subsequent matrices\n    for i in range(1, len(coeffs)):\n        m_i = np.array([[coeffs[i], 1], [1, 0]], dtype=object)\n        m_total = np.dot(m_total, m_i)\n\n    return m_total\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to compute the continued fraction associated with m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n\n    # 1.
