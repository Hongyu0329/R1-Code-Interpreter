    "To determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with a 6-31G** basis set, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$):** I will sum the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule ($\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{Si}, \\mathrm{F}$).\n    *   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n    *   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n    *   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n    *   Total for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F) is $6 + (3 \\times 1) + 14 + 9 = 32$ electrons.\n\n2.  **Determine the total number of basis functions/orbitals ($N_{orb}$):** I will find the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set and sum them up.\n    *   For a heavy atom (like C, F, Si), 6-31G* (or the `*` in `**`) adds a set of 6 d-type polarization functions.\n    *   For Hydrogen, 6-31G** (the second `*`) adds a set of 3 p-type polarization functions.\n    *   **C**: 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from `*`) = 15 basis functions.\n    *   **H**: 2 (from 6-31G) + 3 (from `**`) = 5 basis functions.\n    *   **Si**: 13 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from `*`) = 19 basis functions.\n    *   **F**: 9 (from 6-31G) + 6 (from `*`) = 15 basis functions.\n    *   Total for $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ (1 C, 3 H, 1 Si, 1 F) is $15 + (3 \\times 5) + 19 + 15 = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64$ basis functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of CSFs:** The molecule has an even number of electrons (32), so its ground state is a singlet state (total spin $S=0$). The number of singlet CSFs is given by the formula:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2}^2 - \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2 - 1} \\times \\binom{N_{orb}}{N_{elec}/2 + 1}$\n    where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** I will substitute $N_{elec} = 32$ and $N_{orb} = 64$ into the formula and compute the result using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_csf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a\n    full CI calculation of CH2SiHF with a 6-31G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define atomic compositions and calculate total electrons (N_elec).\n    # Molecule: CH2SiHF -> 1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogen, 1 Silicon, 1 Fluorine\n    composition = {'C': 1, 'H': 3, 'Si': 1, 'F': 1}\n    electron_counts = {'C': 6, 'H': 1, 'Si': 14, 'F': 9}\n\n    n_elec = sum(count * electron_counts[atom] for atom, count in composition.items())\n\n    # Step 2: Define basis function counts and calculate total orbitals (N_orb).\n    # Basis set: 6-31G**\n    # H: 2 (6-31G) + 3 (p funcs from **) = 5\n    # C: 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d funcs from *) = 15\n    # Si: 13 (6-31G) + 6 (d funcs from *) = 19\n    # F: 9 (6-31G) + 6 (d funcs from *) = 15\n    basis_function_counts = {'C': 15, 'H': 5, 'Si': 19, 'F': 15}\n\n    n_orb = sum(count * basis_function_counts[atom] for atom, count in composition.items())\n    \n    # The ground state of this even-electron molecule is a singlet (S=0).\n    # Number of alpha electrons = Number of beta electrons = N_elec / 2\n    n_alpha = n_elec // 2\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation for the number of CSFs:\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.
