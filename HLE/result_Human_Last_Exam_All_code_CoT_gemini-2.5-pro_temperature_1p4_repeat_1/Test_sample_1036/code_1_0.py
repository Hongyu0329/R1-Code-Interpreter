# The problem is a theoretical one, but we can verify the properties of the proposed solutions.
# Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100).
# The problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= L such that
# n mod k are all distinct for k in {2, 3, ..., 100}.

# Let's test the proposed solutions n = L-1 and n = L-2.
# For calculation purposes, we don't need the value of L.
# If n = L-a, then n_mod_k = (L-a) mod k.
# Since k divides L (for k in 2..100), L mod k = 0.
# So, n_mod_k = (-a) mod k = k-a (if k>a).

    This function analyzes the problem and prints the number of solutions.
    The detailed reasoning is provided in the text above.
    Based on the analysis, there are only two numbers that satisfy the condition.
    Here we verify this for a smaller range, e.g., up to 10, for intuition.

    Let's check n = L-1 for k in {2,...,10}.
    Remainders are (k-1) for k in {2,...,10}: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. All distinct.

    Let's check n = L-2 for k in {2,...,10}.
    Remainders are (k-2) for k in {2,...,10}: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. All distinct.

    Let's check n = L-3 for k in {2,...,10}.
    Remainders are (k-3) mod k.
    k=2: -3 mod 2 = 1
    k=3: -3 mod 3 = 0
    k=4: -3 mod 4 = 1. Remainders for k=2 and k=4 are the same. Not a solution.

    Let's check n = L-4 for k in {2,...,10}.
    Remainders are (k-4) mod k.
    k=2: -4 mod 2 = 0
    k=3: -4 mod 3 = 2
    k=4: -4 mod 4 = 0. Remainders for k=2 and k=4 are the same. Not a solution.

    The argument in the text shows that only two solutions exist. The logical deduction
    leads to the conclusion without needing to check all numbers up to L.
    The number of such positive integers is 2.
