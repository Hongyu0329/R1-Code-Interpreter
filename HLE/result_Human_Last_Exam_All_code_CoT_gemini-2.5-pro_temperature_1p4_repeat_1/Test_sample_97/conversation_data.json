    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify all relevant chemical equilibria for the dissolution of Al(OH)3 in pure water. This includes the simple dissolution into ions, governed by the solubility product constant `K_sp`, and the formation of the `Al(OH)4^-` complex ion, which is related to the formation constant `K_f`.\n2.  The total molar solubility, `S`, is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species: `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n3.  To solve for these concentrations, I will establish a charge balance equation for the system, which states that the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges: `[H+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`.\n4.  I will then use the equilibrium constant expressions (`K_sp`, `K_f`, and `K_w` for water autoionization) to substitute each species concentration in the charge balance equation, resulting in an equation with a single unknown variable, `[OH^-]`.\n5.  This equation is a polynomial that I will solve for `[OH^-]`.\n6.  Once `[OH^-]` is known, I will calculate the concentrations of `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]`.\n7.  Finally, I will sum these concentrations to find the total solubility `S`, presenting the final calculation clearly. The Python code below will perform all these calculations and print the reasoning, the final equation, and the answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_solubility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molar solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water,\n    considering both dissolution and complex ion formation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given constants\n    K_sp = 5.3e-27\n    K_f = 1.1e31\n    K_w = 1.0e-14\n\n    # --- Step 1: Explain the chemistry and define derived constants ---\n    print(\"The solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is determined by two main equilibria:\")\n    print(\"1.
