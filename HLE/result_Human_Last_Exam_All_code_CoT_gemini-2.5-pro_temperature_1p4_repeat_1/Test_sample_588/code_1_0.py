    Finds the lexicographically least tuple (a1, b1, ..., al, bl),
    with l minimal, such that no M(ai, bi) is full, yet the
    connect-sum of those l many manifolds is full.

    Our model for this is:
    1. l=2 is the minimal number of manifolds.
    2. M(a, b) is "full" iff a=1 and b=1.
    3. The condition for the connect-sum to be full is that the sum
       of component "invariants" is zero. We model this as:
       a1 + a2 = 2
       b1 + b2 = 2
    4. The tuple is lexicographically sorted: (a1, b1) <= (a2, b2).
    5. We search for the lexicographically smallest tuple (a1, b1, a2, b2).
