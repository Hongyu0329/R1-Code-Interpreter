    # Step 1: Define the properties of the computational model.
    # The model is a transformer with a constant number of layers.
    # It uses "float activations," which implies finite-precision arithmetic on a digital computer.
    # It uses "saturated activations" (e.g., sigmoid), which behave like threshold functions.
    # "Average-hard-attention" involves arithmetic and comparisons.

    # Step 2: Relate these properties to known circuit complexity classes.
    # The circuit complexity class TC^0 is defined for constant-depth,
    # polynomial-size circuits that can use Majority or Threshold gates.

    # Step 3: Justify why the transformer model fits within TC^0.
    # - The arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) on finite-precision numbers
    #   can be implemented by TC^0 circuits. Integer multiplication is a canonical
    #   problem in TC^0.
    # - Saturated activation functions are directly equivalent to the threshold gates
    #   that define the TC^0 class.
    # - A transformer has a constant number of layers. Since TC^0 is closed under
    #   composition (i.e., stacking a constant number of TC^0 circuits results
    #   in another TC^0 circuit), the entire fixed-depth transformer falls
    #   within this class.

    # Step 4: Print the final answer and its components as requested.
