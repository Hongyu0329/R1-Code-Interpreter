    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Knowns:** We are given the uncertainty in the electron's position (Δx = 10 pm) and that the electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n\n2.  **Find Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):** We use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. We'll use the minimum uncertainty:\n    Δp ⋅ Δx ≥ ħ / 2\n    Δp = ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n3.  **Find Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):** According to Bohr's model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron is quantized: L = nħ. For the first orbit, n=1, so L = ħ. The classical definition of angular momentum is L = r ⋅ p, where r is the orbit's radius and p is the linear momentum. For the first Bohr orbit, the radius is the Bohr radius, a₀.\n    p ⋅ a₀ = ħ\n    p = ħ / a₀\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p):** Now we can find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum itself.\n    Ratio = Δp / p = [ħ / (2 ⋅ Δx)] / [ħ / a₀]\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:** The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, leaving a simpler formula:\n    Ratio = a₀ / (2 ⋅ Δx)\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will substitute the values for the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) and the given uncertainty in position (Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m) into the simplified formula to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants.\n# Uncertainty in position (Δx) in meters. 10 pm = 10 * 10^-12 m.\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Bohr radius (a₀) in meters.\na0 = 5.29177e-11\n\n# Step 2: The problem asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (Δp)\n# to the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n# The ratio can be calculated using the simplified formula derived from\n# the Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio.\nratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with the numbers substituted in.\nprint(\"To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\\n\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0} m / (2 * {delta_x} m)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0} / {2 * delta_x}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
