    "Here is a thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Model the Flag as a Matrix\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the flag of Tonga and represent it as a matrix.\n1.  **The Flag's design:** The flag is composed of a red field (background). In the top-left corner (the canton), there's a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is a standard '+' shape that does not touch the edges of the white rectangle it's on.\n2.  **Matrix representation:** Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel gets a value `b`. This creates a large matrix, `M`.\n3.  **Structure of `M`:** We can think of `M` as a block matrix.\n    *   The top-left block corresponds to the canton, `C`. This block contains values `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background of the canton).\n    *   The rest of the matrix (top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right blocks) corresponds to the red field. All entries in these blocks are `a`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Distinct Row Vectors\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's identify the unique types of rows in the matrix `M`. A row can either pass through the canton or be entirely below it.\n\n1.  **Rows below the canton:** These rows are entirely in the red field. Every pixel is red, so every entry in these rows is `a`. All these rows are identical: `(a, a, a, ..., a)`. Let's call this vector `v_R`.\n2.  **Rows passing through the canton:** These rows have two parts: the canton part and the field part. The field part always consists of `a`'s. The canton part depends on what the row intersects.\n    a.  **A row hitting the horizontal bar of the cross:** The canton part of this row is all red (`a`). So, the entire row is `(a, a, ..., a)`, which is identical to `v_R`.\n    b.  **A row hitting the vertical bar of the cross (but not the horizontal one):** The canton part of this row has `b`'s (for the white background) and some `a`'s where it crosses the vertical bar. The rest of the row (the field part) is all `a`'s. All such rows are identical to each other. Let's call this vector `v_CV` (Canton-Vertical). It looks something like `(b, b, a, b, b, ..., a, a, a)`.\n    c.  **A row hitting only the white background of the canton (e.g., above or below the cross but still within the canton):** The \"couped\" nature of the cross means it's surrounded by white pixels. So, there are rows whose canton part is all white (`b`). The rest of the row is all `a`'s. All such rows are identical. Let's call this vector `v_CW` (Canton-White). It looks like `(b, b, b, b, b, ..., a, a, a)`.\n\nSo, the entire matrix `M` is composed of at most three distinct row vectors: `v_R`, `v_CV`, and `v_CW`.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Linear Independence of the Row Vectors\nThe maximal rank of `M` will be the number of these distinct vectors, provided we can choose `a` and `b` to make them linearly independent. The row space of `M` is spanned by `{v_R, v_CV, v_CW}`. The rank is the dimension of this space. Let's check for linear independence.\n\n*   `v_R   = (a, a, ..., a, ..., a, a, ..., a)`\n*   `v_CW  = (b, b, ..., b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`\n*   `v_CV  = (b, b, ..., a, ..., b, a, ..., a)` (The `a` in the first part is from the vertical cross bar).\n\nLet's assume `a` and `b` can be any real numbers. To maximize the rank, we should choose them so that these vectors are linearly independent.\nLet's try to express one as a linear combination of the others.\nFor example, `v_R = k1 * v_CW + k2 * v_CV`. This is very unlikely to hold for all components, as the vectors have different structures of `a`s and `b`s in their first part, but the same `a`'s in the second part.\n\nLet's form a linear combination and set it to zero: `x_1 * v_R + x_2 * v_CW + x_3 * v_CV = 0`.\n*   Looking at a column in the field part (far right), the equation is `x_1*a + x_2*a + x_3*a = 0`. If we choose `a ≠ 0`, this implies `x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0`.\n*   Looking at a column in the canton that is always white (e.g., the very edge of the canton), the equation is `x_1*a + x_2*b + x_3*b = 0`.\n*   Looking at a column that hits the vertical bar of the cross, the equation is `x_1*a + x_2*b + x_3*a = 0`.\n\nWe have a system of linear equations for `x_1, x_2, x_3`:\n1) `x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0`\n2) `a*x_1 + b*(x_2 + x_3) = 0`\n3) `a*(x_1 + x_3) + b*x_2 = 0`\n\nFrom (1), `x_2 + x_3 = -x_1`. Substitute into (2): `a*x_1 + b*(-x_1) = 0` => `(a-b)x_1 = 0`.\nTo maximize rank, we should choose `a ≠ b`. This forces `x_1 = 0`.\nIf `x_1 = 0`, our system becomes:\n1) `x_2 + x_3 = 0` => `x_3 = -x_2`\n2) `b*(x_2 + x_3) = 0` => `b*0 = 0` (this is uninformative)\n3) `a*x_3 + b*x_2 = 0`\n\nSubstitute `x_3 = -x_2` into the new (3): `a*(-x_2) + b*x_2 = 0` => `(b-a)x_2 = 0`.\nSince we chose `a ≠ b`, this forces `x_2 = 0`.\nIf `x_2 = 0`, then `x_3 = 0`.\n\nThe only solution is `x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0`. This means the three vectors are linearly independent, provided we choose `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`. For example, `a=1, b=0`.\n\nSince we found 3 linearly independent rows, the rank of the matrix is at least 3. Since all rows in the matrix are of one of these three types, the rank cannot be greater than 3.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix is 3. This rank is achieved when `a` and `b` are chosen such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the Tongan flag.\n\n    The flag's matrix has at most 3 distinct types of rows, assuming a standard\n    representation of the couped cross. We demonstrate this by constructing a\n    sample matrix and finding its rank.\n\n    1. Row Type 1 (v_R): All red pixels. Value 'a'. This corresponds to the\n       red field and the horizontal bar of the cross.\n    2. Row Type 2 (v_CW): White pixels in the canton that don't intersect the cross.\n       Values are 'b' in the canton, 'a' in the field.\n    3. Row Type 3 (v_CV): White pixels in the canton that intersect the vertical\n       bar of the cross. Values are 'b's and an 'a' in the canton part,\n       and 'a's in the field part.\n\n    If we choose `a` and `b` to be distinct and non-zero (e.g., a=2, b=1), these\n    three row types are linearly independent. The rank is the number of\n    linearly independent rows, which is 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # To find the *maximal possible* rank, we can choose a and b to make the\n    # distinct rows/columns as independent as possible.
