    Calculates the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the Tongan flag.

    The flag's matrix has at most 3 distinct types of rows, assuming a standard
    representation of the couped cross. We demonstrate this by constructing a
    sample matrix and finding its rank.

    1. Row Type 1 (v_R): All red pixels. Value 'a'. This corresponds to the
       red field and the horizontal bar of the cross.
    2. Row Type 2 (v_CW): White pixels in the canton that don't intersect the cross.
       Values are 'b' in the canton, 'a' in the field.
    3. Row Type 3 (v_CV): White pixels in the canton that intersect the vertical
       bar of the cross. Values are 'b's and an 'a' in the canton part,
       and 'a's in the field part.

    If we choose `a` and `b` to be distinct and non-zero (e.g., a=2, b=1), these
    three row types are linearly independent. The rank is the number of
    linearly independent rows, which is 3.
    """
    # To find the *maximal possible* rank, we can choose a and b to make the
    # distinct rows/columns as independent as possible. Let's set a=1 and b=0.
    # The matrix then becomes a 0-1 matrix representing white (0) and red (1) pixels.
    # The rank of this matrix will be the maximal rank.
    
    a = 2  # Value for red pixels
    b = 1  # Value for white pixels

    # Dimensions are arbitrary but must capture the structure.
    # Total size: 10x12 pixels
    # Canton size: 5x6 pixels
